"Twenty years ago, climate change was believed by many in Beijing to be a conspiracy cooked up by the western world to contain China’s development. Since then, China has performed an about-turn, not only recognising climate change as a major global challenge but also, ahead of Davos this week, vowing to lead the world’s effort in combating it.  The election of Donald Trump, who, labelling climate change a “hoax” created by China, has reversed the conspiracy, casts a dark shadow on the prospect of future international climate cooperation. But for China, now could be a moment of opportunity. Since the catastrophic Copenhagen failure in 2009, China has anchored climate actions at the core of its political agenda. There are three main reasons for this, and over the next four years, they will be the drivers that will propel China’s climate action forward regardless of the political situation in the US. First, the calculus of cost and benefit has shifted. For a long time, environmental protection was positioned on the opposite side of economic prosperity – the pursuit of one could only sacrifice the other. In China, this binary has fallen apart, as the enormous health impacts of air pollution have galvanised both political and public opinion against polluting industry, and as the booming clean energy industry shows the possibility to make both environmentally and economically sound investments. Second, China feels an increased – and increasing – sense of global responsibility, as displayed in phrase after phrase of Xi Jinping’s speeches in Davos and Geneva this week. Beijing was quick to learn from its mistakes in Copenhagen. In the run up to the Paris conference, it managed to forge consensus on the most difficult political questions with other key players ahead of time.  Many of these political breakthroughs, such as on common but differentiated responsibilities (CBDR) and the issue of transparency, will require China to move beyond its previous positions and take more ambitious action. In addition, China has started to implement its own south-south cooperation scheme, aimed at helping other developing countries to pursue climate action. China is slowly but surely re-defining its international responsibilities and shifting to a more active and cooperation oriented climate diplomacy. Third, China’s leaders have started to take ownership of combating climate change.  This new dynamic could bear promising prospects over the next few years. US-China cooperation on climate in the Obama era helped to elevate climate change to the very top of the Chinese leadership’s agenda. This has ensured the unprecedented direct engagement of the Chinese leaders for multiple years, and not only familiarised them with the technicality and politics of climate change, but also allowed them to see the strategic value it can generate.  With Xi soon entering his second five-year tenure, he might well take a leaf out of the outgoing US president’s book and try to secure climate action as one of his political legacies. This could mean further investment in and greater leadership on climate action.  These three reasons, coupled with the fundamental trend of China’s economic transition and the associated coal consumption decline, present a real opportunity for China to project further international leadership on climate change. What China urgently needs now is a comprehensive strategy that sets climate change as a diplomatic priority. For the past years, China’s policy circle primarily considered climate change through the lens of managing US-China relations and as an issue subordinate to the most important bilateral relationship in the world. As the political winds shift in Washington, climate change now deserves an independent strategy that takes into account but is not dependent on the US-China relationship. Chinese leaders should be confident in such an approach and not underestimate the country’s potential for global leadership. The establishment of the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank and the One Belt, One Road initiative both demonstrate that, when the issue is given political priority, China is not only able to participate in international diplomacy, but can also actively lead. None of these is to say China should step in for the US. Climate change is a crisis larger than any single country. And it is neither feasible nor fair to expect other countries to fill the hole left by the US. But for China, if what it takes to move from a climate villain to a reluctant leader is the short five years of the first half of this decade, it is not completely unreasonable to expect the country to become a true leader by the end of this decade.  As Trump drops Obama’s legacy, Xi might well establish one of his own. Li Shuo is Greenpeace’s east Asia senior climate policy adviser based in Beijing."
"The first film on the screening schedule for the 2017 edition of the Sundance film festival is Al Gore’s An Inconvenient Sequel: Truth to Power, a follow-up to his 2006 Oscar winning documentary An Inconvenient Truth. Truth to Power is Gore’s second blast of righteous rhetoric in the cause of climate activism, but the screening has taken on a new urgency as the festival, which starts on 19 January in Park City, Utah will be preoccupied by events 3,000 miles away. The presidential inauguration of Donald Trump takes place in Washington DC on Friday, the festival’s second day, and is likely to cast its shadow over the entire event. Though the festival itself is not officially involved, the immediate response from festivalgoers – unarguably a bastion of liberal, activist film-making – is the Women’s March on Main, one of the many nationwide sister event to the massive Women’s March on Washington that is due to take place on Saturday, the day after the inauguration. Park City’s version will be led by talk-show host Chelsea Handler, and is due to start at 9am in a pub car park on Main Street. Writing in the Hollywood Reporter, Handler said: “Let’s teach our Predator-in-Chief a lesson that he can’t do anything he wants, and that he can’t trample all over the rights of America’s 162 million women and girls.” Plenty of Sundance attendees will be involved, including film-makers, agents and studio executives, as well as the festival’s director John Cooper.  The politically inflected mood is reflected in the festival lineup, which is noticeably more strident than in recent years. Chief among the offerings is the hot-off-the-press documentary Trumped: Inside the Greatest Political Upset of All Time, a feature film culled from footage shot by the team behind the Showtime TV series The Circus, which covered the entire election cycle throughout 2016, culminating in Trump’s election victory in November. However, Gore’s film – directed by Bonni Cohen and Jon Shenk – is the centrepiece of wider-ranging effort at Sundance: a sidebar called The New Climate, conceived as a direct riposte to the climate-change scepticism of the incoming president and the new head of the Environmental Protection Agency, Scott Pruitt. Sundance has a strong track record of such stances – a legacy of the environmental activism of its founder, Robert Redford – but this year sees a new sense of urgency. As a result, the festival has programmed a series of documentaries, covering a huge range of subjects. Chasing Coral grapples with the disastrous decline of coral reefs in oceans across the world, while Plastic China is a study of a recycling facility in Shandong and those who own it and work there. Water and Power: A California Heist aims to unpick the profiteering in California’s water-supply system that is the backdrop to the years of drought in the state. Trophy examines the big-game hunting industry in Africa that is the flipside of animal conservation. Festivalgoers can even experience what it’s like to be a rainforest tree in what is described as a “virtual experience” put together by artists Milica Zec and Winslow Porter. Aside from all the politics, however, Sundance is first and foremost dedicated to allowing independent film-makers to showcase their wares, and is often the point of first exposure for a potential crossover hit. In 2016, the big gamble was slavery drama The Birth of a Nation, for which Fox paid $17.5m; that proved to be a loser after the film’s theatrical release and awards run misfired after the resurfacing of historic rape allegations – of which he was acquitted – against its director-star Nate Parker. Although the heady atmosphere of the festival has often triggered bidding wars, few are expecting such large sums to change hands in 2017. However, a number of films are already attracting interest from distributors: most notably Long Strange Trip, a documentary about underground rockers the Grateful Dead, which has just been snapped up by Amazon. Other likely looking titles include Jack Black comedy The Polka King, about real life polka fraudster Jan Lewan; Newness, directed by Sundance favourite Drake Doremus, about romance in the age of Tinder; and Wind River, a crime thriller directed by Hell and High Water writer Taylor Sheridan. The Sundance film festival runs from 19-29 January at Park City, Utah."
"In 2016 koalas were sighted for the first time in decades at Mount Kembla, Wollongong and in Kosciuszko national park in New South Wales. Although these sightings are a source of hope, it’s important we don’t get lulled into a false sense of security about the extent to which nature, including koalas, is threatened in Australia. We have serious work to do to protect our unique plants and animals. Most environment news these days focuses on climate change. In many ways this isn’t surprising. Climate change threatens to alter our entire environment as rainfall patterns change, temperatures rise and extremes become more common. Many species are already finding their habitats shrinking – just look at polar bears and the rapidly vanishing Arctic sea ice.  Yet amid this climate emergency “mere” species extinctions have largely been pushed out of mind. Of course the issues are intertwined as climate change can cause extinctions: in July the Bramble Cay melomys (a rodent) was reported as the first animal to have been made extinct primarily due to climate change. In its case, its single-island habitat had been repeatedly inundated by rising sea levels destroying the native vegetation and ultimately the species itself. And of course climate change threatens to exacerbate and amplify other threats to species like bushfires and heatwaves. But human destruction of habitat is, at least in the short term, a much greater threat to species than climate change. In mid-December, scientists from the University of Queensland were part of a team that found, of all developed countries on Earth, Australia was performing worst in protecting its ecoregions (areas containing broadly similar habitat). The researchers identified “crisis ecoregions” where habitat loss is greatest. A crisis ecoregion in Australia? Temperate forests. Enter the koala. Undoubtedly the most famous inhabitant of Australian temperate forest ecosystems, and arguably the world’s favourite species. But as you may expect from a species inhabiting a crisis ecoregion, it’s not faring so well. Historical accounts describe large numbers of koalas being seen regularly in the late 1800s in NSW. In 1921, 200,000 koala pelts passed through Sydney and in 1924 two million pelts were exported from eastern Australia.  Yet now all koala populations, bar a few in eastern Australia, are in decline. Some sharply so. So whether or not you find, as we do, the most recent estimate of 329,000 in Australia (36,000 koalas in NSW) to be optimistic one thing is clear: koala numbers are a fraction of what they once were and the species is slipping away. In NSW, koalas are in the centre of a perfect storm largely of the government’s own making: changes to land clearing laws have already devastated bushland in Queensland and history threatens to repeat itself in NSW with the Baird government recently passing its land-clearing legislation.  Much remaining high-quality koala habitat is either on private land, thus at risk of clearing, or in state forests and thus subject to ever more intense state-sanctioned logging. Urban development is eating into koala habitat up and down the coast. And following this habitat destruction, koalas are vulnerable to dog attacks and vehicle strike as they spend more time on the ground. If this were happening to a snail, or even a frog, it would probably be ignored. But koalas are one of the few animals whose plight the government finds it hard to ignore. That’s why the NSW government is currently beginning the development of a whole of government koala strategy and asking for community feedback on planning issues and its Saving Our Species conservation strategy. At a federal level, the National Koala Conservation and Management Strategy expired in 2014. Word is that a new strategy is in the pipeline but at the moment we’re flying blind. The best way to protect koalas is a tried and tested one. The scientists that identified the crisis ecoregion problem also identified the solution: large, well-connected protected areas. Only by protecting and connecting remaining koala habitat can the government enact meaningful conservation. Everything else is tinkering round the edges.  And only by demonstrating that it can effectively protect koalas can we have any confidence that the government can protect the rest of Australia’s extraordinary wildlife that doesn’t share the koala’s high profile."
"When speaking about climate change, President-elect Trump has flip-flopped between acceptance and denial, which suggests that he hasn’t put much thought into one of humanity’s greatest threats. However, what his administration does is far more important than what he thinks. Unfortunately, Trump has nominated individuals to several critical climate leadership positions who reject inconvenient scientific and economic evidence. Climate denial often pinballs between five different stages, but the cleverer denialist arguments tend to land on Stage 3: denial that climate change is a problem. It’s ironic that Secretary of State nominee Rex Tillerson – CEO of ExxonMobil – has the most sophisticated position on climate change among Trump’s key nominees. Tillerson accepts that humans are causing global warming, but he denies that it’s a problem. His key argument focuses on sowing doubt about the accuracy of climate models. This happens to be the core topic in my book Climatology versus Pseudoscience, whose analysis I updated for a presentation at the American Geophysical Union conference two weeks ago. Climate scientists have been making global temperature predictions for over 40 years, and they’ve turned out to be amazingly accurate, as this video of the key slides from my presentation shows: Tillerson has long cast doubt on the accuracy of climate models, for example saying at a 2013 ExxonMobil annual shareholder meeting: our ability to project with any degree of certainty the future is continuing to be very limited … our examination about the models are that they’re not competent. This line of argument led to the question Tillerson posed at the company’s 2015 annual meeting: What if everything we do, it turns out our models are lousy, and we don’t get the effects we predict? The answer to that question is that we get the co-benefits associated with reduced burning of fossil fuels: cleaner air, cleaner water, healthier people, green jobs and economic growth, energy independence, and so on. But the point is that Tillerson tries to cast doubt on scientists’ ability to project what will happen in the future, because the projections show that we need to leave most fossil fuel reserves in the ground. For Exxon, that’s bad for business. Trump’s appointees will sometimes get stuck in Stage 1 denial – that global warming is even happening – but most frequently they land in Stage 2 denial – that humans are responsible.  This is a question that’s about as settled as science gets. The best estimate in the 2014 IPCC report, representing the consensus of the world’s top climate scientists summarizing the body of climate research, was that humans have caused all the global warming over the past 65 years. The report concluded with 95% confidence that humans have caused most of the global warming since 1950. Climate scientists are as confident in human-caused global warming as medical scientists are that smoking causes cancer. There’s a 97% expert consensus on the subject. Trump’s nominee to head the EPA, Scott Pruitt is in Stage 2 denial. So is his choice to lead the Department of Energy, Rick Perry. His choice to lead the Department of Interior, Ryan Zinke is an interesting case, who strongly supported climate action in 2010, but now denies that humans are responsible. Even Trump himself has said “nobody knows” what’s causing it. Somebody does: the world’s scientific experts. Trump’s nominees will sometimes advance to Stage 4 denial, and argue that solutions to the climate problem are too costly. For example, while environmental regulations actually have a positive net effect on employment, Pruitt and Trump argue that these sorts of regulations kill jobs. Tillerson argues that third world countries need fossil fuels to end ‘energy poverty.’ In reality, while access to electricity certainly helps the poor, distributed renewable energy like solar panels and wind turbines are a better fit for most developing nations, especially since poorer countries are the most vulnerable to climate change impacts. Trump’s transition team also believes the cost of carbon pollution is lower than the estimates used by the Obama Administration. However, the most recent research on the subject indicates the actual cost is in fact much higher than government estimates, and a majority of economists agree that the federal estimate is too low. Tillerson has claimed to support a revenue-neutral carbon tax – a bipartisan solution that in addition to helping curb climate change and its damages, would have a modestly beneficial direct impact on the economy. However, under Tillerson’s leadership, ExxonMobil hasn’t supported policymakers who have proposed this exact legislation, and has instead continued to fund climate denial organizations that work to obstruct it. And in 2013, Tillerson walked back his carbon tax support: I would not support putting a carbon tax in place today because I think we still have a lot of gains to be made through technology and other less intrusive policies on the economy which are showing results. Tillerson has argued that climate change is “an engineering problem and it has engineering solutions.” In other words, that we can keep burning fossil fuels, and solve the problem through adaptation efforts. However, research is quite clear that while we’ll need a combination of mitigation and adaptation, relying primarily on adaptation would be exceptionally costly. It’s not surprising that the CEO of ExxonMobil advocates for a path that would lead to the burning of lots more fossil fuels. However, the Secretary of State has tremendous influence over America’s role in international climate negotiations. ExxonMobil’s priorities are in sharp conflict with America’s and the world’s on this issue. The prevalence and effectiveness of misinformation in this year’s elections suggests that we’re entering a post-truth world in which many people disregard whatever facts they don’t want to believe. A study by Robert Brulle and colleagues found that cues from political leaders are the main driver of public opinion on climate change. That strong response to elite cues is exemplified in the sudden spike in Vladimir Putin’s favorability among Republicans. Unfortunately, Republican Party leaders are sending cues of doubt and denial to their constituents. But denying facts doesn’t change reality. As leading climate scientist Ben Santer wrote to Trump: Your choice on Day 1 is clear. Leadership or denial. If it’s the former, you’ll have plenty of Americans willing to help you. If it’s the latter, you’ll have millions of powerful voices allied against you. Please choose wisely."
"The time when you don’t need hope is when your hopes have been fulfilled. Hope is for when you don’t have what you need and for when things are not OK. It is the belief that liberation might be possible that motivates you to make it more possible, and pursuing hope even when it doesn’t lead to the ultimate goal can generate changes that matter along the way, including in yourself. A dozen years ago I talked about hope to a roomful of working-class community college students in Washington, citing the German philosopher Ernst Bloch to the effect that without hope there is no action but without action there is no hope. A woman said in a clear voice that she agreed, because if she had not hoped she would not have struggled and if she had not struggled she would not have survived Pol Pot and the Cambodian genocide.  That floored me. Sometimes hope is just that you will survive, or that you will escape. Then you can hope for more. I wish I knew her story, but that she was in North America, alive and well and confident enough to speak out, told me something of it. Even despotic regimes end, though it’s important to remember that not everyone and everything survives; you can be devastated for what won’t and hopeful for what will at the same time. In the United States we are probably headed for a very grim phase of uncertain duration. We will see much that we love under attack – but it’s worth remembering that a lot of this is nothing new. From oil pipelines to human rights, there have been massive incursions over the past 16 years against nature, against equality, against governmental transparency. We are not exiting a utopia, and human rights organisations that are currently rising to a greater challenge have not been idle for lack of work in the Obama era. The Bush years are not far behind us, and though more predictable, it was plenty brutal. May Boeve, executive director of 350.org, told me that after the recent US presidential election, her colleagues in Turkey sent their sympathy and said they got good work done on climate change, even under authoritarianism. We will have much work to do and we will still have the capacity to do it. It will matter more than ever that we do. We would do well to study the countries that have sunk into tyranny or despotism and survived. To discover how Argentina and Chile and Brazil went through an era of dictators and death squads and emerged, in part because people like the Argentinian women in las Madres de la Plaza de Mayo stood up to their fears and their regime. El Salvador is now governed by the FMLN, which fought against the death squads in the 1980s, and Chile’s current president is Michelle Bachelet, who was kidnapped and tortured under the Pinochet regime. Most of the countries in our hemisphere besides Canada have gone into horror and emerged, many more than once. The difference is one of scale. A Filipino climate activist friend of mine begged Americans to stop Donald Trump on the grounds that the tinpot despot in charge of his country has a largely local impact but the president of the US has a global impact on everything from human rights to climate policy around the world. We have a responsibility not just to our country but to the world to contain and weaken and try to defeat Trump and Trumpism to the best of our abilities. Those of us who are not in immediate peril have a grave responsibility to those who are. But in the wake of this terrible election, much of my hope has rested not on what could or should happen, and not what the historical record tells us has happened, but what is happening now. There is another America rising and taking action, and it is beautiful. I’m thinking of the many stories of people standing up for the vulnerable, directly when they intervene in confrontations with haters. Or indirectly, as with the young woman I know who co-organised the creation of Neveragain.tech, a public oath people working in tech can take to refuse to create Muslim registries, turn over people’s private data, or otherwise cooperate with state persecution. Of the California state senate, which immediately after the election issued a manifesto of defiance: “California will defend its people and our progress. We are not going to allow one election to reverse generations of progress at the height of our historic diversity, scientific advancement, economic output, and sense of global responsibility. We will lead the resistance to any effort that would shred our social fabric or our constitution.” I’m thinking of the many action groups and coalitions that came together in the wake of the election determined to stop Trump, defend civil liberties and address the illegitimacy of the election, and of the candidate. The Harvard lawyers laying the case for impeachment on the grounds of the “emoluments” or profits from overseas that would fatally compromise a Trump regime. Many people are still trying to figure out what to do; others are doing it. They give me hope, in some portion of humanity, the portion that will resist Trump and defend our ideals. It will be hard. It will be ugly. Our job will be to be embody and protect all of those things most antithetical to authoritarianism, racism, misogyny, kleptocracy, an atmosphere of lies and indifference to science, fact and truth. In easy times, we grow slack; this will require us each to find our capacity for heroism. Some will, and my hope lies with them. Or us."
"A controversial $900m expansion of Queensland’s Acland open-cut coalmine has received federal government approval. The environment minister, Josh Frydenberg, made the announcement on Friday, but the New Hope project is still waiting on state permits and the outcome of a legal challenge in the land court.  “A total of 28 strict conditions are attached to the approval, which include requirements for water management and monitoring, and environmental offsets,” Frydenberg said. The expansion is expected to create 260 construction jobs and guarantee the ongoing employment of hundreds of workers and contractors. The New Hope managing director, Shane Stephan, said timing of the required state approvals was critical to the future of Acland employees given the current lease was running out of coal. “Now we have the federal approval our people’s futures are squarely in the hands of the Queensland state government,” Stephan said. The Oakey Coal Action Alliance has been fighting stage three of the mine in the land court, claiming the expansion would put water, air quality and farming at risk. New Hope needs the land court to rule in its favour before the state can grant mining lease and environmental authority approvals, while an associated water licence is also required. The federal approval includes 28 conditions, including requirements for water management and environmental offsets. “I know this project has both its supporters and opponents within the local community but I am advised with the strict conditions attached we will see mining and agriculture co-exist,” Frydenberg said."
"Ten years ago, New York City mayor Michael Bloomberg released a plan to create what he called “the first environmentally sustainable 21st-century city”. The blueprint, known as PlaNYC and released on Earth Day, outlined more than 100 projects and policies to create that sustainable city by 2030. It set a precedent for local action on climate change; cities around the world began drafting their own sustainability plans. But then in October 2012, it got a harsh reality check.  “We would talk about sea-level rise and how it was this thing that would happen in the future,” says Amy Chester, part of the team that created PlaNYC. “Never once in that office did we imagine a storm like Hurricane Sandy could hit New York.” Hurricane Sandy made landfall north of Atlantic City, New Jersey, on 29 October 2012. Within hours, it was inundating New York harbour with a storm surge of waves that reached a record height of nearly 14 feet. The storm ravaged coastal communities: an estimated 80% of the city of Hoboken was under water. The power went out in most of Lower Manhattan as its basements, tunnels and subways flooded, bringing the biggest city in the country to a near-standstill. Across the region, Sandy caused an estimated $65bn in damages and economic loss, destroyed or damaged more than 650,000 homes, and killed more than 100 people. It was a visceral reminder that, despite the wealth and power of the world’s biggest cities, many are inadequately prepared for the effects of extreme weather. As the disaster recovery funds began flowing, the US federal government realised that even the best sustainability plans, such as PlaNYC, weren’t thinking comprehensively enough about the vulnerabilities cities and regions face. They didn’t recognise the inherent uncertainty of changing climate, nor how to respond.  On a trip to Europe in the weeks after Hurricane Sandy, then-secretary of the Department of Housing and Urban Development (Hud), Shaun Donovan, visited the Netherlands to learn how a country, around a third of which is below sea level, protects itself. His guide was Henk Ovink, the country’s acting director general of spatial planning and water affairs. The Dutchman promptly offered to help the US rethink its approach to water.  “Mankind lost track in the last century,” Ovink says, referring to his proposal that cities such as New York should be redesigned with a better understanding of the natural processes that have guarded settlements against flooding for generations.  “It’s not new to the United States, and it’s not new to a lot of places in the world. But we lost track of that knowledge. And now with challenges like climate change, we are forced to un-forget that; to remember better and to start building new approaches based on that memory. And of course we will do better than we did before.” Based on hundreds of years of Dutch flood prevention experience, Ovink’s approach called for a systematic rethinking of American traditional disaster response: to simply rebuild whatever was destroyed. “Instead we needed to ask not just how can we build back, how can we repair, but how can we look at the future?” Ovink explains. “This was not only about rethinking how our governments work, but how we think about future uncertainties like climate change.” In June 2013, the US housing department launched a $1bn multidisciplinary design competition informed by this new approach. Dubbed Rebuild by Design and funded by the Rockefeller Foundation (which also supports Guardian Cities) and other organisations, nearly 150 interdisciplinary design teams applied to participate. Ten finalist teams were chosen in August 2013, after which Ovink led them through a year-long process of research and collaboration with community stakeholders to understand and design around local conditions and needs. The design teams – world-class architects, landscape architects, engineers and urban planners – were forbidden from offering any design solutions at the start. Instead, they engaged in three months of research, travelling the region to meet stakeholders and learn about local concerns directly from the people affected by Sandy. Only after that intensive research period could the designers actually begin designing. Even then, they had to submit not one solution but five – a requirement intended to encourage holistic thinking. It was a new approach to design for almost everyone involved. “Everything was a challenge,” says Chester, who became the competition’s project manager. She was in charge of orchestrating the large number of design teams and even larger number of community groups and local participants to develop projects that could be built and replicated, all on a tight deadline to qualify for federal funding. “We were literally building the plane as we were flying it.” The winning designs were announced in June 2014. Seven of the projects were eventually awarded a total of $930m in federal grants. They’re now being implemented – using ecological and landscape design techniques to address issues such as coastal storm surges and inland flooding of low-lying areas. In the US, the Rebuild By Design competition represents a dramatic shift in disaster planning, adopting a more comprehensive and collaborative research and design approach to address complex problems and improve resiliency – in the New York region and beyond. “The whole idea was to start something that would have a larger impact,” says Ovink. The competition was widely hailed as a success, but there was room for improvement before its approach could be replicated. A 2014 Urban Institute review praised its ambition but called its original vision “more aspirational than operational”. To have a larger impact beyond the New York region, the process would have to be systemised. With that goal in mind, Rebuild By Design spun off to become its own organisation, focused on using its research and interdisciplinary design approach to help cities and regions prepare for climate-related disasters before they strike. It is currently working with five cities and regions in North America, helping them to understand and respond to existing and potential vulnerabilities – from water insecurity to sea-level rise, to ageing infrastructure. They use the same research and collaborative design approach from the competition, linking local stakeholders and public agencies with experts and international design talent. “What we try and do with cities is have them acknowledge that they may not know what the problem is. They may know what one aspect of the problem is, but not really the root cause,” says Chester. “Only after that’s understood can we start to think about what the solutions are. The challenge is, there are so many interdependencies in what cities face.” That means bringing together multiple parties – local infrastructure agencies, elected officials, transit authorities, community members and others – to see how the vulnerability to a threat like sea-level rise is experienced across the spectrum. “It’s about understanding the opportunity that you could do things differently,” says Ovink, who is now a special envoy for international water affairs for the Netherlands. “If you would take the responsibility to engage with others across government, across business, across communities, then we could invest and build better communities that are far better prepared for an uncertain future.” Rebuild By Design’s first large-scale test of this approach will be Resilient By Design, a competition Rebuild is helping to organise in the San Francisco Bay Area to develop projects to address flooding. This competition is different from the post-Hurricane Sandy effort in that the disaster hasn’t yet struck – but the Bay Area can literally see it coming. In mid-December, San Francisco experienced its annual “king tides” – the highest tides of the year, which have grown in recent years to overwhelm the concrete edge of some of the city’s piers. The result is little more than a shallow puddle, but it’s a preview of what will happen with greater intensity in the future. And that future may not be far off. A recent report from public policy advocacy organisation the Bay Area Council found that flooding from an overdue major storm could cause upwards of $10bn in damages to the region, about the same amount caused by the devastating 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake. With nine counties and 41 cities touching the bayshore, flooding is a regional risk that will require widespread cooperation. “Climate change writ large is very much a regional issue,” says Larry Goldzband, a member of the design competition’s executive board. He’s also executive director of San Francisco Bay Conservation and Development Commission, a state planning agency, so he’s seen the region’s individual cities and counties begin to take action on rising tides. “They recognise that solutions have to be holistic, they have to be large scale, and they can’t simply deal with only one aspect of the rising sea level problem.” The competition seeks to unite these efforts into a set of 10 implementable projects. Organisers are currently raising money from foundations and corporate sponsors to run the competition and award prize money to the winning design teams. The competition will launch later this year and is expected to cost about $5.8m – not including the cost of building the winning projects. But with commitments from counties, cities and various infrastructure and planning agencies, the organisers are confident the winning projects will get built. “We don’t have the big sum of funds that Hud put up for the Sandy competition, so we really needed to structure the Bay Area competition differently and get all the infrastructure agencies on board,” says Chester. “Cities are going to spend millions and billions of dollars in the future shoring up for climate change.” There’s an incentive to commit funds to the competition’s winners, she says, because eventually “they’ll have to spend that money anyway”. None of the cities Rebuild By Design is now working with are in disaster recovery mode. Instead, they’re recognising vulnerabilities to future disasters and planning ahead for how they’ll respond. It’s a more proactive form of disaster planning, which is why Rebuild By Design joined forces with 100 Resilient Cities (also supported by the Rockefeller Foundation), a growing network of global cities that understand the importance of planning for future disasters and uncertainties before they happen.  Mexico City is one of the 100 resilient cities participants now using Rebuild By Design’s research and design approach to address one of its disasters-in-waiting, the environmentally sensitive Unesco World Heritage Site, Xochimilco. About 17 miles south of the city centre, it’s a pre-Hispanic settlement of canals and artificial islands that’s one of few remaining examples of traditional lagoon land use and development – and a popular tourist site. On weekends, garishly painted boats logjam through the canals in a slow caravan, carrying beer drinking revellers and floating mariachi bands. But years of dropping water tables, contamination and encroaching urbanisation have put the area’s ecological stability at risk. The city hopes to use the Rebuild By Design process in conjunction with its resilience plan to counter the contamination, while still sustaining its local economies. “This is a very traditional place where we have a lot of marginal communities, but still it’s a world heritage site and an area of one of the key elements of Mexican identity,” says Arnoldo Matus Kramer, Mexico City’s chief resilience officer. “So we don’t want to have just ideas from the outside; we want to also integrate ideas from the communities and to have this dialogue.” He’s now convening local stakeholders and outside experts to begin the process of researching and understanding how these different systems interact. “It’s a very complex situation that will not be solved by just one solution. There should be multiple different solutions – some of which will succeed, and some will not. But we need to build a process and a system that can learn around that and provide a long-term vision.” Ovink says the process that developed out of the original Rebuild By Design competition is an effective way to find those solutions – whether in Mexico City, San Francisco or New York. And he wants it to take off in other cities that are facing future uncertainties: “If I would lean back a little and dream, I would say it would explode into a movement around the world.” But he also recognises that there’s a limit to the power of plans. “I really hope we can show in the New York region that those ambitions are for real, and that whatever administration is going to continue to build on that,” he says. “That’s a scary thing to say at this time. We better build these projects to showcase that this is the new reality, the new world.” Follow Guardian Cities on Twitter and Facebook to join the discussion, and explore our archive here"
"Scottish fishermen have uncovered an intriguing way to supplement their income: they have added squid to the menu of marine creatures they regularly pull from the sea. A species normally associated with the warmth of the Mediterranean, rather than the freezing north, may seem an odd addition to their usual catches of cod and haddock. Nevertheless, squid has become a nice little earner for fishing boats from Aberdeen and the Moray Firth in recent years.  Thirty years ago, squid was a rarity in the North Sea. Today, boats bring back thousands of tonnes a year – though cod and haddock still dominate catches. Nor is this warm-water addition to northern fish menus a unique feature. Red mullet, sardines and sea bass have also appeared with increasing frequency in North Sea fishermen’s nets in recent years. All of them are associated with warmer waters and their appearance is seen by many scientists as a sign that climate change is beginning to have a serious impact on our planet’s oceans. For Scottish lovers of fresh squid, this is good news. However, in many other parts of the world, rising sea temperatures – triggered by climate change – are providing fishing industries and governments with major headaches. Fish are moving hundreds of miles from their old grounds, sometimes out of zones that had been set up to protect them. In other cases, fish are simply disappearing from nets. Part of the problem has its roots in past overfishing. But now climate change is exacerbating the issue. Last week, scientists revealed that a vast chunk of ice was set to break away from the Antarctic Larsen C ice shelf, while Arctic sea ice extent is now at its lowest level for this time of year since records began. And if sea temperatures continue to rise, even greater disruption will be caused to fishing stocks. Fishermen will lose their livelihoods and communities will be deprived of their only source of food. “There is an unambiguous trend,” said marine biologist Andrew Bakun of Miami University. “If you look at the world’s fish catches as a whole, you find they are made up, more and more, of warm-water species as opposed to catches in previous years which had more species that were from cooler waters.” Seafood is the critical source of protein for more than 2.5 billion people today. However, over-exploitation in the past has resulted in a crash in fish stocks, with the result that the world’s annual catch is now decreasing by more than 1 million tonnes every year – despite the availability of the latest fishing technology: nets big enough to engulf cathedrals, echo locators, satellite navigation, and powerful engines to drive boats. Now climate change is making the management of this threatened supply even more difficult. “All the world’s oceans are facing intense problems but the problem is going to be particularly serious for tropical countries, which are often underdeveloped and are far less able to maintain sustainable management regimes for their fisheries,” said marine biologist Callum Roberts, of York University. An example is provided by Bangladesh. Fish gives the nation 60% of its animal protein and is vital to the 16 million Bangladeshis living near the coast, a number that has doubled since the 1980s. However, a study – led by Jose Fernandes, of the Plymouth Marine Laboratory – of two key fish species, Hilsa shad (Tenualosa ilisha) and Bombay duck (Harpadon nehereus), showed that stocks of both could be devastated by climate change that would affect nutrient flows in coastal waters, ocean temperatures and sea levels. The introduction of sustainable management measures would offset some of these impacts but stocks still face being cut significantly, the group added. “Both the sea and land environment are changing,” said Fernandes. “The problem is that we know much less about the sea than the land, so it is harder to observe and to intervene.” Think of the problem as a double whammy, said marine ecologist Malin Pinsky, of Rutgers University, New Jersey. “Fish have already been reduced to low numbers by intense overfishing and that makes them far less able to deal with increasing temperatures or other effects of climate change.” Pinsky points to the example of the Atlantic cod in the Gulf of Maine. “It has been badly hit by intense overfishing. Now it appears that warmer waters have been reducing survival even further. The trouble is that the fisheries management in the area did not realise this and allowed fishing to continue there at a too high level.” Managing fish stocks in a warming world is proving to be a particularly thorny problem, he added. “Fish management maps have lines drawn on them but it turns out fish don’t see those lines.” As waters warm, fish seek cooler waters and head to higher latitudes, a problem that has also been highlighted in the North Sea. There, closure areas have been set up to protect spawning and nursery grounds of plaice, herring and sandeel from intense fishing. “But if species shift their distribution in response to climate change it is possible such measures will become less effective in the future,” says a study by a group of scientists led by John Pinnegar, of the government-funded Centre for Environment, Fisheries and Aquaculture Science (Cefas). Another example of the problem was highlighted last week by the New York Times, which noted that the centre of the US black sea bass population is now found in waters off New Jersey. In the 1990s, it was hundreds of miles further south. Under fishing rules that were laid down then, North Carolina fishermen are still entitled to the largest share of black sea bass catches – which requires them to steam north for 10 hours to reach the black sea bass’s current fishing grounds. By contrast, local New England fishermen are allowed to catch a small fraction of the black sea bass now found in their own neighbourhood and must throw all excess overboard. The issue has already reached the status of causing international discord, as is revealed through the example of the humble mackerel. “Until recently, mackerel in the Atlantic were fished mainly by Britain, Ireland and Norway and stocks were protected by an EU quota system,” said Roberts. “Then stocks began to head north, most probably because sea temperatures were rising. Eventually, mackerel reached Iceland – at which point Iceland asked to be included in fishing quotas. This request was rejected – so Iceland went ahead and started catching mackerel in any case.” The result was a drop in mackerel stocks and an international dispute that lasted several years and which has only recently been resolved – though this respite may only be temporary. “Unless we find ways to adapt quota agreements speedily and efficiently, we are going to see a lot more disputes like this one in future,” Roberts said. This point is highlighted in the study led by Pinnegar, which revealed that anchovy stocks are now spreading along the south coast of England. Talks are taking place to determine whether French or Spanish boats can fish for these – on the grounds that these stocks are extensions of existing populations from the south. Others argue that the new anchovy stocks are a separate population that is only now rebounding in numbers thanks to greatly improved climatic conditions, and that French and Spanish boats should be allowed only restricted access to them. The “anchovy wars” are looming, it would seem. In addition to overfishing and warming sea temperatures, marine creatures face a further danger: ocean acidification. Increased amounts of carbon dioxide, pumped into the atmosphere from cars and factories, are being absorbed by the oceans, making their waters more acidic. The impact on coral reefs, which provide homes to thousands of different species of fish, is already being felt. Last year, it was reported that a rare underwater heatwave, combined with an increase in ocean acidity, had destroyed swaths of Australia’s Great Barrier Reef. This has led marine biologists to warn that all coral reefs risk being destroyed by the end of the century even if carbon dioxide emissions are kept to relatively low levels in future decades. Apart from the impact on one of the world’s greatest natural wonders, the effect on fish stocks, and in particular shellfish, could be grim. Shells of marine creatures are made from calcium carbonate and their formation is disrupted by acidic water. An example is provided by oyster farms on the Oregon coast. These farms regularly suffer from upwellings of acidic water from deep regions of the Pacific. When this happens, larval oysters die at the point when they have to form their first shells. “From the time eggs are fertilised, Pacific oyster larvae precipitate roughly 90% of their bodyweight as calcium carbonate shell within 48 hours,” George Waldbusser at Oregon State University told the Climate News Network. “They must build their first shell quickly on a limited amount of energy – and, along with the shell, comes the organ to capture external food. It becomes a death race of sorts. Can the oyster build its shell quickly enough to allow its feeding mechanism to develop before it runs out of energy from the egg?” Increasingly, the answer to this question appears to be no. This point is summed up by Roberts. “Prawns, lobsters, clams and scallops – which now dominate our intensively fished seas – all lay down carbonate shells. The fishing industry is therefore badly exposed to risk from more acidic seas. Not only that, acidification threatens the important role that filter-feeding shellfish play in cleansing ocean water. Quite frankly, increased acidity is the last thing marine life needs given all of the other ways in which we are making oceans a tougher place to live.” And then there is question of just how much seafood is actually eaten today. This turns out to be an issue of considerable controversy, one that was stoked last year in a study – by Daniel Pauly and Dirk Zeller of the University of British Columbia – that was published in the Nature Communications online journal. It indicates that the UN’s Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO) has seriously underestimated the world’s appetite for fish and miscalculated global annual catches. The FAO – using figures provided by individual governments – had suggested that annual catches began rising significantly over the 20th century, peaked at 96m tonnes in 1996 and have been declining slowly since then – largely due to the fact that fish stocks had been so seriously overfished. Pauly and Zeller put the annual “peak fish” figure for 1996 at 130m tonnes while adding that levels have fallen off far more dramatically and worryingly as stocks have become depleted at a rate that is far sharper than realised previously. In other words, far more fish – millions of tonnes – is being taken from the seas than has been recorded by official statistics. This extra annual catch is made up by small-scale and subsistence fisheries and fish thrown back in the sea as discards, according to Pauly and Zeller. What is particularly worrying about this discovery is the sharp rate of decline of fish catches in recent years. Despite sending out more boats, fitted with advanced fish detection technologies, fishermen are unable to catch as much as they used to. Nor do Pauly and Ziller anticipate that it will stop. “I expect a continued decline because I don’t expect countries to realise the need to rebuild stocks,” Pauly told the Guardian. “I don’t see African countries, for example, rebuilding their stocks, or being allowed to by the foreign fleets that are working there, because the pressure to continue to fish is very strong. We know how to fix this problem but whether we do it or not depends on conditions that are difficult.” It is against this grim background that the world’s oceans are warming significantly, with temperature rises of several degrees being forecast by the end of the century. Inexorably, fish stocks will be pushed further towards high latitudes, confusing attempts to manage and to protect them, while the make-up of local fisheries will undergo drastic changes. The stress on one of the world’s most important resources is going to be intense. The great fish migration has begun."
"Ninety per cent of people living in rural and regional Australia believe they are already experiencing the impacts of climate change and 46% believe coal-fired power stations should be phased out, according to a new study. A poll of 2,000 people conducted by the Climate Institute found that 82% of respondents in rural and regional Australia and 81% of those in capital cities were concerned about increased droughts, flooding and destruction of the Great Barrier Reef due to climate change, and 78% of all respondents were concerned there would be more bushfires. About three quarters of all respondents – 76% in capital cities and 74% in rural or regional areas – said ignoring climate change would make the situation worse and about two-thirds said they believed the federal government should take a leading role. However, only a third of respondents said the federal government should be contributing to action on climate change. Instead, two-thirds, (67% in capital cities and 71% in regional areas) said individuals should be contributing to action on climate change and about half said state and local governments and businesses should be contributing to action on climate change. The majority of people – 59% in capital cities and 53% in regional areas – said solar was their preferred energy source, followed by wind and hydro. Only 3% of respondents in the city and 4% in regional areas said coal was their preferred energy source. Nicky Ison, the director of the Community Power Agency, which represents 80 grassroots groups, said the results showed that concern about climate change was not limited to inner-city suburbs. “I think there’s a misconception that concern is mainly held in the city and I think there are some strong voices, particularly in rural and regional Australia, that have exaggerated or stoked that misconception,” Ison said. “A vocal minority gets a lot of traction, probably because they have a greater access to megaphones.” Matthew Charles-Jones is a co-president of Totally Renewable Yackandandah, a community-run initiative that aims to make the small town, 300km north-east of Melbourne, entirely run on renewable power by 2022. Charles-Jones said the group was motivated by energy security and rising electricity costs but members were also concerned about the effects of climate change. “We have been threatened by bushfire roughly every three years for the last decade,” he said. The last bushfire was in December 2015. “It’s very real for us in Yackandandah,” Charles-Jones said."
"Make America Wait Again. That is what Donald Trump’s energy policy amounts to. Stop all the clocks, put the technological revolution on hold, ensure that the transition from fossil fuels to clean power is delayed for as long as possible. Trump is the president that corporate luddites have dreamed of: the man who will let them squeeze every last cent from their oil and coal reserves before they become worthless. They need him because science, technology and people’s demands for a safe and stable world have left them stranded. There is no fair fight that they can win, so their last hope lies with a government that will rig the competition.  To this end, Trump has appointed to his cabinet some of those responsible for a universal crime: inflicted not on particular nations or groups, but on everyone. Recent research suggests that – if drastic action of the kind envisaged by the Paris agreement on climate change is not taken – ice loss in Antarctica alone could raise sea levels by a metre this century, and by 15 metres in subsequent centuries. Combine this with the melting in Greenland and the thermal expansion of sea water, and you discover that many of the world’s great cities are at existential risk. The climatic disruption of crucial agricultural zones – in North and Central America, the Middle East, Africa and much of Asia – presents a security threat that could dwarf all others. The civil war in Syria, unless resolute policies are adopted, looks like a glimpse of a possible global future. These are not, if the risks materialise, shifts to which we can adapt. These crises will be bigger than our capacity to respond to them. They could lead to the rapid and radical simplification of society, which means, to put it brutally, the end of civilisations and many of the people they support. If this happens, it will amount to the greatest crime ever committed. And members of Trump’s proposed cabinet are among the leading perpetrators. In their careers so far, they have championed the fossil fuel industry while contesting the measures intended to prevent climate breakdown. They appear to have considered the need of a few exceedingly rich people to protect their foolish investments for a few more years, weighed it against the benign climatic conditions that have allowed humanity to flourish, and decided that the foolish investments are more important. By appointing Rex Tillerson, chief executive of the oil company ExxonMobil, as secretary of state, Trump not only assures the fossil economy that it sits next to his heart, he also provides comfort to another supporter: Vladimir Putin. It was Tillerson who brokered the $500bn (£407bn) deal between Exxon and the state-owned Russian company Rosneft to exploit oil reserves in the Arctic. As a result he was presented with the Russian Order of Friendship by Putin. The deal was stopped under the sanctions the US imposed after Russia invaded Ukraine. The probability of these sanctions in their current form surviving a Trump government is, to the nearest decimal place, a snowball’s chance in hell. If Russia did interfere in the US election, it will be handsomely rewarded when the deal goes ahead. Trump’s nominations for energy secretary and interior secretary are both climate change deniers, who – quite coincidentally – have a long history of sponsorship by the fossil fuel industry. His proposed attorney general, Senator Jeff Sessions, allegedly failed to disclose in his declaration of interests that he leases land to an oil company. The man nominated to run the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), Scott Pruitt, has spent much of his working life campaigning against … the Environmental Protection Agency. As the attorney general in Oklahoma, he launched 14 lawsuits against the EPA, seeking, among other aims, to strike down its Clean Power Plan, its limits on the mercury and other heavy metals released by coal plants and its protection of drinking water supplies and wildlife. Thirteen of these suits were said to include as co-parties companies that had contributed to his campaign funds or to political campaign committees affiliated to him. Trump’s appointments reflect what I call the Pollution Paradox. The more polluting a company is, the more money it must spend on politics to ensure it is not regulated out of existence. Campaign finance therefore comes to be dominated by dirty companies, ensuring that they wield the greatest influence, crowding out their cleaner rivals. Trump’s cabinet is stuffed with people who owe their political careers to filth. It was once possible to argue, rightly or wrongly, that the human benefits of developing fossil fuel reserves might outweigh the harm. But a combination of more refined climate science, which now presents the risks in stark terms, and the plummeting costs of clean technologies renders this argument as obsolete as a coal-fired power station. As the US burrows into the past, China is investing massively in renewable energy, electric cars and new battery technologies. The Chinese government claims that this new industrial revolution will generate 13m jobs. This, by contrast to Trump’s promise to create millions of jobs through reanimating coal, at least has a chance of materialising. It is not just that returning to an old technology when better ones are available is difficult; it is also that coal mining has been automated to the extent that it now supports few jobs. Trump’s attempt to revive the fossil era will serve no one but the coal barons. Understandably, commentators have been seeking glimpses of light in Trump’s position. But there are none. He could not have made it clearer, through his public statements, the Republican platform and his appointments, that he intends to the greatest extent possible to shut down funding for both climate science and clean energy, rip up the Paris agreement, sustain fossil fuel subsidies and annul the laws that protect people and the rest of the world from the impacts of dirty energy. His candidacy was represented as an insurgency, challenging established power. But his position on climate change reveals what should have been obvious from the beginning: he and his team represent the incumbents, fighting off insurgent technologies and political challenges to moribund business models. They will hold back the tide of change for as long as they can. And then the barrier will burst. Twitter: @GeorgeMonbiot. A fully linked version of this column will be published at monbiot.com"
"Imperial College London has partnered with the climate change charity 10:10 to investigate the use of track-side solar panels to power trains, the two organisations announced yesterday. The renewable traction power project will see university researchers look at connecting solar panels directly to the lines that provide power to trains, a move that would bypass the electricity grid in order to more efficiently manage power demand from trains. According to the university, the research team will be the first in the world to test the “completely unique” idea, which it said would have a “wide impact with commercial applications on electrified rail networks all over the world”. “It would also open up thousands of new sites to small- and medium-scale renewable developments by removing the need to connect to the grid,” Imperial College London said in a statement. Network Rail is currently investing billions in electrifying the UK’s railways in a bid to reduce the number of trains running on diesel fuel, curbing costs, air pollution, and greenhouse gas emissions in the process. Combining this effort with increased renewable energy generation in the UK could significantly decarbonise train lines by 2050, according to 10:10, but in many rural areas the electricity grid has reached its limit for both integrating distributed energy generation and supplying power to train firms. “What is particularly galling is that peak generation from solar and peak demand from the trains more or less match but we can’t connect the two,” explained 10:10’s Leo Murray, who is leading the project. “I actually believe this represents a real opportunity for some innovative thinking.” Initially the project will look at the feasibility of converting “third rail systems” which supply electricity through a power line running close to the ground and are used on roughly one third of the UK’s tracks. “Many railway lines run through areas with great potential for solar power but where existing electricity networks are hard to access,” explained Prof Tim Green, director of Energy Futures Lab at Imperial College London. The university will collaborate on the technical aspects of the project with Turbo Power Systems – a firm that works on distribution and management of power in the railway sector – while 10:10 is leading on research looking at the size of the long-term power purchase agreement (PPA) market for directly connecting renewables to transport systems. “I don’t think you get a better fit for PPA than a train line,” added Murray. “A rural train line even more so, the project would open up many investment opportunities across the country and further afield.” The news comes as it emerged that every one of the Dutch state-owned railway company NS’s passenger trains are now being powered entirely by wind energy. As of 1 January 2017 all trips taken by the estimated 600,000 people who ride NS trains everyday are being powered by wind energy.  Having teamed up with the energy firm Eneco in 2015 with the aim of reducing its emissions, NS has now reached its target of switching the sources of power for its trains to 100% renewables one year ahead of schedule, with the firm originally setting a target date of 2018 for the milestone.

"Until recently, like a sociopath might have little feelings when witnessing violence, I’ve managed to have relatively mild emotional responses to climate change. For five years I’ve been covering climate change – the science that underpins it, the things that are driving it, the devastation it is wreaking, and the desperate measures we need to urgently put in place to mitigate it. (Not to mention the reporting I’ve done on the pathetic politics surrounding it.)  But for most of that time I’ve been able to maintain a wall between the objective facts I report, and my emotional response to those facts. Intellectually I’ve understood the things I’ve been reporting and the inevitable disaster that is looming for much of the world’s population. But somehow, I didn’t feel the deep sense of panic or dread that is obviously appropriate when facing such a serious crisis. But in 2016, something changed. I’m not sure if it was a shift in my focus in reporting as I moved from reporting mostly just the hard science of climate change for New Scientist, to reporting the depressing politics as well at the Guardian. Or perhaps it was the sheer scale of the climate-related disasters I reported on in 2016 that shook me. Or maybe it was the very personal experience of impending fatherhood, with my partner and I preparing to bring a little girl into the world early this year. Suddenly the period of time that seems directly relevant to me is extended several decades into the future. The experience of becoming completely responsible for a person who will see first-hand the major changes wrought by climate change towards the end of the 21st century made consideration of what would happen in those decades impossible to ignore. Actually, my emotional awakening was probably caused partly by each of them. But there was one moment this month that made me feel this stronger than ever. I experienced a type of panic, but one that brought me another kind of relief. I was half way through James Bradley’s brilliant novel Clade, which is part of a growing movement of fiction that is conscious of the vast ecological changes – climate and otherwise – being caused by humans. It is set in the later decades of the 21st century, and follows a few generations of people as they navigate a world in which climate change is an ongoing all-encompassing crisis. Early in the book, one of the main characters – a climate scientist – struggles with the decision he and his partner had made to have a baby. After describing the hastening melting of permafrost, the loss of Arctic ice and the destabilisation of Antarctica, Bradley writes: One day in his office, he reviewed a new study about the release of methane from the ocean floor and saw, more starkly than ever before, the conundrum the world faced. It wasn’t simply that they needed to consume less, to bring humanity’s impact on the biosphere under control, it was that there were just too many people, and even allowing for technological change and economic restructuring, the planet was on a collision course with disaster. In the United States and India floods covered millions of square kilometres, in Africa and Europe the heat was growing ever more intense and in Indonesia and Brazil and Malaysia the forests were burning, yet he and Ellie were trying to have a baby. What sort of world would that child inherit? Were they really doing the right thing by bringing another life into it? As I read the way that child dealt with the world it inherited, the Bureau of Meteorology released its annual climate statement, describing what happened in 2016. It was so clearly an early warning signal for the impacts that Clade was exploring. In my news report I wrote: Australia’s weather was extreme in 2016, driven by humankind’s burning of fossil fuels as well as a strong El Niño, according to the Bureau of Meteorology’s annual climate statement. That extreme weather led to devastated ecosystems both on land and in the sea, with unprecedented bushfires in regions that don’t usually burn, the worst coral bleaching on record, and has been attributed as the cause of damage to vast tracts of crucial kelp forests, oyster farms and salmon stocks across southern Australia. The similarity between what I was reporting of what happened in 2016, and the futurism in Bradley’s work left me with something close to a panic. But the new emotional reaction I’ve developed to climate change, while obviously unpleasant, also comes as a kind of relief. Feeling numb to something that deserves an emotional response is disconcerting. I used to nod along as people expressed their pain at watching the world drown itself in CO2. But I harboured a guilt at the lack of appropriate emotional response I had to something I knew was objectively a disaster. Indeed, that ability for humans to not react emotionally to climate change is undoubtedly one of the things that is making this collective form of species-level suicide possible. While I can’t say with confidence that bringing a child into the world we are creating is the right thing to do, I maintain a hope that those children will find a way to undo what we have imposed on them. And if nothing else, it has given me a renewed passion for to do my part in fighting for a just world for future generations."
"Conservatives cannot properly be climate deniers. At the heart of their political stance is a desire to hand on something better to the future than they have received from the past. Now that climate science is so clear, a recognition of the duty to act to protect the next generation follows naturally. Of course, Conservatives have been somewhat cautious. Constitutionally, they don’t chase after novelty and it’s in their character to question fashionable theories. So we shouldn’t be surprised at the genesis of Margaret Thatcher’s commitment to fighting climate change. As a Conservative she wasn’t a pushover, but as a scientist, she rigorously tested the science and was convinced. Once convinced she saw the imperative to act, and that made her the first leader of a major economy to commit to the Rio Earth Summit. In turn, it was her influence that brought George Bush to the table.  In today’s world, she would have scorned the populist attack on science that we are seeing from much of the American right. She wouldn’t have recognised it as Conservative but, instead, as a rearguard defence of the status quo and the vested interests that sustain it. At the heart of her criticism would be the flight from logic and science. But she’d have been just as trenchant about the confusion between the distorted market and the free market. She would reject the distorted market beloved of Trump. That’s the market that defends vested interest by allowing coal owners to make profits while the community pays the cost of the consequent pollution, ill-health and climate change; the market that enables American cotton farmers to damage land and air while driving poor African producers out of business on the back of US subsidies worth more than the value of their crops; the market that lets oil and gas producers compete effectively with renewables only because they don’t pay for the damage they do to ecology, the water supply, and the air we breathe. Thatcher believed that only the power of the market is strong enough to make the necessary changes to the way we live. She understood that the market must not be operated to advantage established owners and entrenched interests. Instead, it must be free to drive innovation and embrace change. Today’s consumers must be charged for the real costs of the products they buy. Creating slag heaps, poisoning the air, contributing to flooding – this is not the market working. It’s the opposite. It’s the product of market failure, a system fixed to advantage incumbents by leaving to the community or future generations, costs that should have been born by today’s businesses and consumers. It’s a system that enables Exxon and Peabody Energy to make profits by not charging the real cost of what they sell. Putting this right is essential if a free society is to flourish. It’s not just to combat climate change that we need reform, it’s to enable the market to be even more effective as the engine of opportunity and invention. Yet those in the new US administration who look to reinforce today’s market distortions label any attempt to free it of its perversities as “socialist” intervention. Recognising the fact of global warming didn’t make Thatcher a socialist! Of all people, she embraced the concept of the free market because it worked, and she dismissed collectivism as an ineffective road to serfdom. Solving the problems of climate change needs the most efficient of markets where real costs are charged to customers and companies make real profits because they don’t pass those costs on to today’s or tomorrow’s communities. Bolstering old industries that in a free market would fail is not part of Conservative economics. Retaining fossil fuel subsidies so you have to subsidise renewables is a daft way of driving change. We need to get the American right to recognise that free markets are uncomfortable for incumbents but essential to drive necessary change. One of the most necessary changes is to move to a low carbon economy, and the Conservative desire to make things better for the next generation should make them the most determined to use the free market to achieve it. And what an opportunity that gives us, the shift to new technologies, the new jobs, and the wealth creation are all within our grasp if we don’t let vested interests get in the way."
"In the lead-up to Donald Trump’s inauguration as the 45th president of the United States on Friday, the Guardian is running 24 hours of live uninterrupted digital coverage focused on climate change, and what you can do to help the planet. Trump, who is openly skeptical that climate change is caused by humans and has appointed many climate change deniers and sceptics to cabinet positions, comes into office as 2016 was declared the hottest year on record. The Guardian spoke with more than a dozen leading global voices on climate change, who urged the incoming president to make America great again by embracing the trillion-dollar green tech industry. We’ve partnered with Univision who are running a parallel blog in Spanish.   Global warning: the saviour tech that can help turn the tide on climate change Some residents of the upstate New York town of Saranac Lake will be hosting their own inauguration party on Friday – celebrating the defeat of Donald Trump. Liberal-minded people will be gathering to celebrate Hillary Clinton’s win of the popular vote by a margin of 2.9m votes. The residents share the sentiment of national leaders Bernie Sanders and the Rev Al Sharpton that liberal ideas did in fact win in this election. “Mr Trump has got to understand that he does not have a mandate. He lost by almost 3 million votes,” Bernie Sanders told the Guardian. Several leaders are organizing marches to protest about the legitimacy of Trump’s presidency. As far as the official inauguration is concerned, Nicole Puglise has outlined exactly how the day will unfold.

In his final press conference as president, Barack Obama said that Chelsea Manning had served a tough sentence and her time spent in prison would still deter potential future leakers of classified information. Obama was defending his decision to commute the remainder of Manning’s 35-year sentence and allow her to walk free on 17 May. “Let’s be clear: Chelsea Manning has served a tough prison sentence,” Obama said. “I feel very comfortable that justice has been served.” Manning, a former intelligence analyst in Iraq, was responsible for one of the biggest government breaches of classified information in US history and was found guilty in a military court in 2013. Barack Obama: ‘justice served’ by Chelsea Manning commutation Staff within the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) are nervous about attempts to pivot away from renewables and sideline science, the agency’s outgoing head, Gina McCarthy, told the Guardian. Trump’s nominee to run the agency, the Oklahoma attorney general, Scott Pruitt, has sued the EPA 14 times, and has questioned the science surrounding climate change. “I would not be telling the truth if I said there was no sense of nervousness,” McCarthy said. She added that she hopes the world realizes that most people at the EPA recognize the “seriousness of the issue”. Trump has vowed to gut the EPA and dump many of its regulations. McCarthy said she has reached out to talk to Pruitt but has not yet received a response. “Climate change is real, it’s happening, it’s a challenge and I want to talk to him about that,” she said. Outgoing EPA chief reveals fears Trump administration will halt climate action China has called on the current administration and the Trump transition team to not allow Taiwan to attend the inauguration on Friday as it could, “disturb Sino-US relations”. It is the latest in a saga of spats between Beijing and Trump since the president-elect broke with a decades-old diplomatic convention and spoke with the president of Taiwan. Hua Chunying, a foreign ministry spokeswoman, urged “relevant parties” to ensure that no delegation from Taiwan was allowed to attend Friday’s ceremony. China’s US ambassador, Cui Tiankai, will attend the event. A delegation from Taiwan led by Yu Shyi-kun, a former premier and party chairman, will be attending the ceremony. It is customary for Taiwan to send a delegation to inaugurations, but Trump’s recent comments towards China has strained relations.  Trump inauguration: Taiwan delegation could ‘disturb Sino-US relations’ Up to 30 people are missing after an avalanche that was triggered by an earthquake buried a ski resort in the Abruzzo region of central Italy. Rescuers braved the blizzard conditions to reach the Rigopiano hotel in the town of Farindola, in the lower Gran Sasso mountain range, where it is believed 20-30 people were staying when the avalanche hit on Wednesday night. A video showed a cascade of snow falling down a stairway into the hotel’s foyer and another showed rescuers digging a man out of the snow. The central Italy region was struck by four earthquakes on Wednesday, measuring between 5.1 and 5.7 magnitude.

"There’s a brief reference to what could be nuclear attack or a comet strike – “a sudden shear of light and then a series of low concussions” – but the slow process of climate change isn’t mentioned in this terrifying 2006 novel about a man and his young son struggling to survive after the fall of civilisation. Make no mistake, though, this is a book about environmental apocalypse: what would happen to humans, and our humanity, if the natural world was no longer a self-replenishing, bountiful support system for the higher apes who scratch at its surface but just another dead rock in space.  In the first years after the catastrophe, the roads were crowded with refugees, foraging remaining food stocks. Survivors descended into “bloodcults”, savagery and cannibalism. Nine years on, if the man and boy meet other humans, they will almost certainly be raped and eaten. The father keeps a pistol by him, to kill his son and then himself when the time comes; the mother committed suicide years before. This is a hard book to read but also, as Andrew O’Hagan put it, “the first great masterpiece of the globally warmed generation”. McCarthy writes in an unrelenting, declamatory prose somewhere between the Bible and late Beckett, stripped for the most part of the adornment of apostrophes and speech marks and the breathing space provided by commas. He grapples not only with human suffering and savagery on a baroque, almost unimaginable scale; with faith, love and the blunt urge to survive; but with the existential horror of the possible end of the human race. The fragility of human endeavour and the terrifying consequences of our choices are the message to take from this devastating book. Justine Jordan The Year of the Flood is the middle book in Atwood’s dystopian MaddAddam trilogy, published between 2003 and 2013. As with The Handmaid’s Tale and the rise of the misogynist right in the US, the passing of time has made her work seem ever more eerily prophetic. But then, as Atwood has always said, everything she writes about is possible and much of it has already happened. The environmental ravages caused by oil and the terrifying consequences of it running out; corporate empire-building, scarcening resources and increasing inequality; genetic experimentation and the badlands of the internet: all are followed to their (un)natural conclusions. The flood in this novel is not a watery one, but a global pandemic triggered as part of the same hubristic rapaciousness that is causing sea levels to rise. Comparing it with its predecessor Oryx and Crake, Ursula Le Guin found “less of Hogarth and more of Goya” in a post-apocalyptic scenario that combines horrors with glimmers of hope. Her treatment of her main two characters, survivors Toby and Ren, and of God’s Gardeners, a sect dedicated to preserving the besieged natural world, is Atwood at her best: cool-headed, warm-hearted, funny, smart and undeceived. Backed up by wide research, Atwood’s speculative fictions are complex and layered enough to consider the global nexus of science, capitalism and politics, along with individual stories of brutality and resilience. The questions she poses are urgent and essential. “What if we continue down the road we’re already on? How slippery is the slope? What are our saving graces? Who’s got the will to stop us?” JJ In all of his novels – including Ghostwritten, Cloud Atlas and Number9Dream – David Mitchell has been preoccupied with the differences between personal and planetary ethics: why does every human’s self-interest conflict with the wider need for collective survival?  The Bone Clocks is told in six parts, each focusing in on a different period in the life of Holly Sykes. The last part, set in 2043 when Holly is in her 70s, sees her huddled away on the Irish coast, seeing out the end as the world falls into “the Endarkenment”: climate change has so depleted resources that people must live off the land and government rationing. Ireland is moderately stable thanks to a deal with China – until the Chinese suddenly pull their resources, leaving Ireland in a state of confusion and violence.  Mitchell’s depiction of the subsequent desperation and rapid descent into anarchy is bleak, if undeniably believable. Sian Cain In his acknowledgments, Bacigalupi stresses that his novel “should not be construed as representative of present-day Thailand or the Thai people”. His vision of Thailand’s future is less beaches and good curry, and more oil-starved, corruption-riddled nightmare.  At its heart, The Wind Up Girl is a biopunk thriller following a undercover corporate agent and a genetically modified woman – but its detailed, bleak depiction of the effects of climate change sets it apart. Set during “the contraction” – when the world runs out of fossil fuels – Bacigalupi’s Bangkok is one of only a few south-east Asian cities left, now below sea level and desperately holding off the rising waters with a series of spring-powered pumps. Thailand’s environment ministry works like a guerrilla force to ensure the country’s survival, burning entire villages to the ground at the first sight of crop plagues. Ships transport goods, computers run on treadle-power and all the while, everyone resolutely acts as if nothing is wrong – so there is a little realism in this science fiction. SC As climate catastrophes roll across the globe, and Britain is laid waste by the Great Storm, the UK government decides it is time to take the drastic step of imposing a 60% carbon tax. Day one of her diary sees 16-year-old wannabe bass player Laura holed up with her family as the countdown to rationing begins: “We’ve got to choose – hairdryer, toaster, microwave, smartphone, de-ioniser (Mum), kettle, lights, PTA, e-pod, fridge or freezer and on and on … ” At first the new limits seem impossible: dad loses his job as a travel and tourism lecturer and mum has to forsake her beloved car for a life of getting lost on buses. Her sister, Kim, meanwhile, throws such a strop after being forced to abandon her gap-year plans for a working holiday in the US that she absconds to Spain, leaves the television running and lands herself in Carbon Offenders counselling. But gradually the family starts to adapt to the new reality. It’s a shame that the novel is dated by its title (a followup, The Carbon Diaries 2017, is out of print), because Saci Lloyd’s portrayal of an angsty teenager squaring her infatuation with the boy next door and ambitions to be a new punk angel with a state clampdown on everything that powers her lifestyle is smart, funny and all too believable. As a teen reviewer on the Guardian children’s site wrote: “It gave me an insight [into] how we may have to live our lives in a few years, and made me wonder how I would deal with the situation, were I in Laura’s shoes.” Claire Armitstead • The section on The Road was amended on 23 Jan 2017 to reflect the fact that there are various interpretations of the cause of global apocalypse in the novel."
"A publicly funded scheme to reduce carbon emissions collapsed, after running up costs of £100m, following a disagreement between government departments, Whitehall’s spending watchdog has concluded. Ministers launched a competition for developing technology to capture carbon emissions before Treasury officials cancelled the project, a report by the National Audit Office has found.   The carbon capture and storage (CCS) competition was the second attempt by the government to build technology that could absorb and dispose of carbon dioxide from power stations or heavy industry.  Auditors concluded that a failure by the Treasury to agree the long-term costs of the competition with the Department for Energy and Climate Change (DECC) contributed to its cancellation in 2015, when ministers had already spent £100m on the scheme.  The findings have concerned senior politicians. Meg Hillier, the chair of the public accounts committee, said the scheme was “hugely ambitious and expensive” but was in sight of a breakthrough when it was stopped.  “The then DECC failed to convince HM Treasury but ultimately the taxpayer lost out both financially and in the ending of this programme to reduce carbon emissions. “Taxpayers will be alarmed that disagreement between departments means the taxpayers have little to show for the £100m the government spent on the competition,” she said. It would cost the UK £30bn to meet targets to cut greenhouse gases by 2050 without CCS, auditors believe, and it is “currently inconceivable” that such technology would be developed without government support. Globally, there are 16 examples of large-scale CCS schemes operating with 22 more being developed.  The then-DECC, now part of the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy (BEIS), began the programme in 2012 without agreeing with the Treasury on the amount of financial support available over the lifetime of the projects. At the time it was cancelled, the competition had two preferred bidders - the White Rose consortium in North Yorkshire, which planned to build a new coal plant, and Shell’s scheme in Peterhead, Aberdeenshire, to fit new CCS technology to an existing gas plant.  Auditors found that the failure to agree on the amount of support contributed to the Treasury pulling its pledged £1bn in capital funding in late 2015, resulting in the competition’s cancellation.  In 2012, officials estimated it would cost consumers – who would subsidise electricity from the schemes – between £2bn and £6bn over 15 years. By 2015, this figure had risen to risen to as much as £8.9bn.  A BEIS spokesman said: “We haven’t closed the door to carbon capture and storage technology in the UK, but decisions had to be taken to control government spending and protect consumer bills.  “This is why the government ended the funding for the CCS competition, and ensured taxpayers were protected from significant costs when the competition closed.”"
"A row of mangrove trees sticking out of the sand, exposed by low tide off Kutubdia island in the Bay of Bengal, is all that remains of a coastal village that for generations was home to 250 families. The villagers were forced to flee as their land, which had been slowly eroding for decades, was finally engulfed by the ever-rising tide five years ago. For the embattled people of Ali Akbar Dial, a collection of disappearing villages on the southern tip of the island in Bangladesh, the distant trees serve as a bittersweet reminder of what they have lost and a warning of what is come. The low-lying island of Kutubdia has one of the fastest-ever sea level rises recorded in the world, placing it bang on the front line of climate change, and the islanders are fighting a battle they fear is already lost.  “I was born there, so were my parents and grandparents,” said Onu Das, 25, standing on a sandy coastal path atop a concrete embankment, pointing to a forest of mangroves. “There were mango, betel nut and coconut trees. Now we are landless and it is very difficult. We do not get food regularly. We fish. Somehow we are trying to survive.” The
first legally binding global climate deal, agreed in Paris in 2015, is meant to limit global warming to 2C, with an aspiration to keep it to
1.5C, to mitigate the effects of climate change. Records show global temperatures have already risen by 1.1C, with 2016 breaking the record for hottest year for the third year running. While the Earth’s temperature does fluctuate, the effects of current rapid warming are already being felt: Arctic ice is melting, the Great Barrier Reef is dying off and according to the UN, 60 million people now face food insecurity.  “The ocean is torturing us,” said Pushpo Rani Das, 28, a mother of three who has had to move her home four times to escape storm surges. “We can’t stop it. Water enters my house in every high tide, especially in the rainy season.” Rani fears that soon her family will have to leave the island altogether. A 100 yards from where she lives, a half-built brick mosque lies abandoned, its cement foundations washed away. UN scientists predict some of the worst impacts of climate change will occur in south-east Asia, and that more than 25 million people in Bangladesh will be at risk from sea level rise by 2050. It is well known that many of the countries most vulnerable to climate change are among those who contribute to it the least, and here that’s certainly true. The carbon footprint of Kutubdia’s 100,000 islanders is small – most do not even have access to a regular electricity supply. But they fear that for them, time is already running out. Tides that once stopped short of the three-metre-high concrete embankment, built by the government to protect the island, now flood over it and the embankment is damaged in many places. While no scientific monitoring is done here, sea level rise of 8mm a year over 20 years has been recorded at Cox’s Bazar, 50 miles away on the mainland. This is nearly three times the level for Bangladesh as a whole and up to five times the world average. So far, members of the fishing community of Ali Akbar Dail, perched precariously on a strip of coast next to the embankment, have learned to adapt to the many natural disasters thrown at them. When the cyclones hit, they hoist their children on to their shoulders and head for the network of cyclone shelters, which, along with the country’s early warning system, have dramatically reduced fatalities.  However, after a year that they say has brought more – and more powerful – storms than before, the fishermen are engaged in a battle for survival against their only asset: the ocean. They say the climate is changing too fast for them to adapt. “For me, it is the increase in signals [storm warnings], that they are coming in winter,” said Jogot Hari Jala Das, 70, a village elder, squinting against the hot sun. “It is hot now and it is supposed to be winter.” The fishermen no longer fish in the shallow waters around the island because of a decrease in catches, which they believe is linked to the water warming, Hari said. Now, they travel 10 to 15 hours to the deep sea. But this year, they have seen an increase in signals, forcing them back to land and cutting their earnings further. “Around 15 to 20 years back, signals were not as frequent as they are now,” Hari said. “When the signal comes you can’t go to the deep sea because it could change at any time.” Asked what they would do if they could not fish, Hari laughed. “We can’t do anything. When we catch fish, we eat. Our only asset is the ocean.” It is a dangerous life. Last month, 89 fishermen who left for the deep sea did not return.  In Cox’s Bazar, meteorologists confirmed the fishermen’s observations. Last year, there were four cyclones – Roanu, Kyant, Nada and Vardah – in the Bay of Bengal. Usually there is only one. Nazmul Huque, an assistant meteorologist, said: “This year, the quantity of signals was more than any other year in the Bay of Bengal. Two or three depressions occur normally, but this year there were seven or eight, and four cyclones.” Huque also confirmed a change in the pattern of the seasons. The monsoon, which runs from June to October, began later last year, he said, and the year before. “We see the pattern changing,” said Huque. “But I’m not a researcher and this is a subject that needs research. Whether it is climate change, I’m not sure.” Scientists say the sinking of islands in the Bay in Bengal is due to natural and possibly manmade climate change. Erosion linked to storm surges, for instance, predate global warming. But sea surface temperatures, linked to sea level rise, have risen in the Bay of Bengal. In a report published last month, scientists said they believed the higher surface temperatures in the Indian Ocean were causing cyclones to increase their frequency and intensity.  Moqbul Ahmed, project coordinator of Coast, an organisation working with climate-affected communities and migrants on Kutubdia and elsewhere, believes the villagers are victims of climate change.  “High tides never used to enter the villages before,” said Ahmed. “One portion of the island has already been washed away. I’m quite convinced it is happening because of climate change. “There are too many challenges. People are losing their ancestral land, and they are having to migrate to other places. There, they have to adapt to a new environment. There are families from Kutubdia who were once rich, with land and cows and boats, and now are living in slums and are beggars. There is no money for the migrated people and no government policy to help them.” Tens of thousands of islanders from Kutubdia have already fled to the mainland, many of them resettled by the government after 20 villages were swamped when a massive cyclone hit the island in 1991. Most live in makeshift corrugated iron and bamboo huts in a shanty town called Kutubdia para (meaning “neighbourhood”), behind the airport in Cox’s Bazar, the longest stretch of sandy beach in the world and a popular resort for middle-class Bangladeshi tourists. But they, too, are anxious and uncertain about the future. The local government wants them to move elsewhere so it can build a bigger airport to service the growing tourist industry. Outside the shanty town’s primary school, where children are learning English, Didarul Islam Rubel 29, spoke of his father’s heartbreak on leaving the island with nothing.  “My father had four fishing boats but he lost most of [them] and a lot of land during the 1991 cyclone,” said Islam. “He had to go back to being a day labourer and fish with nets. It was a huge shift. My father’s generation lost their way of life. If the government drive us out, another generation will lose theirs.” The question of whether the weather extremes in Bangladesh are down to climate change is difficult to answer: more difficult still is whether those who have lost land like those in Kutubdia can be deemed climate change or environment migrants. Saleemul Huq, the director of the International Centre for Climate Change and Development and a senior fellow of the International Institute for Environment and Development, said: “You can’t ignore the fact that what climate change will do is exacerbate what is happening. Erosion because of storm surges precedes climate change. But if people are talking about king tides and queen tides getting bigger, and observing that it is getting worse, then you shouldn’t discount it. Our former environment minister, who is from Chittagong, has talked about it.” Huq said the term “climate change refugee or migrant” was disputed, because it is very difficult to disentangle the reasons why someone might migrate. “But you can make a very strong prediction: that tens of millions of people living in coastal areas of Bangladesh will definitely have to move because they will be unable to pursue the livelihoods that their forefathers have done. “Climate change migration is an issue of the future that we will have to think about and plan for.”"
"While Australia bakes through another hot, angry summer, its precious wildlife is increasingly under threat, not just from the extreme weather of fires and floods but by the growing reality of a changing climate. It is getting hotter. Day by day, month by month, year by year – 2016 is confirmed as the hottest year on record globally, closely following the leads of 2015 and 2014 – and with summer in full swing in Australia we turn our minds and our national concerns to bushfires, ever more intense, and to extreme weather events, flash flooding, cyclonic winds, unexpected parching and flooding of our wide brown land.  And it is not just the Australian people who are feeling these stresses first hand, but some of the most unique wildlife to be found anywhere in the world. For those who have had the privilege of watching a platypus swim, of holding a koala, of watching kangaroos bound across seemingly endless plateaus – you should be well aware that these special creatures face a very uncertain future. Climate change from unprecedented carbon emissions not only threaten the habitats of our unique animals and birds, but also challenges the very ability of them to survive.  This should be of concern to each and every one of us. Species lost, iconic animals threatened, wiped out, perhaps in a generation. This should provoke nothing short of shame in the hearts of people the world over. So what we can be sure about? Climate change is making Australia hotter. Hot days are happening more often while heatwaves are becoming hotter, longer and more frequent. While it has been clear for many years that climate change is a major factor in intensifying heat, recent scientific advances now allow us to understand the extent of the impact on individual extreme events. Climate change has significantly worsened recent extreme heat events in Australia. And the outlook just looks bleaker. The work of some great scientists from this side of the planet emphasises the very real threat to our unique wildlife. In addition, the most recent report by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) stated that native species are set to “suffer from range contractions, and some may face local or even global extinction … Koalas, gliders, quokkas, platypus and several species of birds and fish will all suffer from shrinking habitats as temperatures increase, even under the most optimistic scenarios.” And it is not just our well known natural icons, it is the lesser known also. The golden-shouldered parrot, currently listed as endangered in Queensland, is only found in the southern and central Cape York Peninsula, and is now restricted to just two populations there – covering an area less than 2,000 sq km.  This rare and beautiful bird will be one of many species that will likely be affected by increased temperatures, fires and droughts across Northern Australia. Then there is the little known Lumholtz’s tree kangaroo, a remarkable animal. According to the Australian Wildlife Conservancy, global warming poses a very real threat to this species. They thrive in a high-altitude, cool rainforest as these areas provide the kangaroo with a cool environment, keeping their body temperatures down with access to moisture from dew and mist formed under the rainforest canopy. There can be little doubt that increased atmospheric temperatures will significantly impact these habitats. Everywhere we turn we can see that our changing climate, and the extreme weather it delivers with a vengeance, is already having a profound and deeply disturbing impact on the flora and fauna that have made the Great Southern Land such a remarkable place - for travellers, for explorers, for discovery. It is a sad fact that the very country that risks losing these special places, these special and unique forms of life, is also playing such a key role in warming the planet. Our export coal industry is being pushed to expand and expand, despite all the economics and science one can throw at our leaders. So while other countries are winding down their coal use, Australia is attempting to ramp up our production and export of the product, all the while as we watch first-hand the immediate and long term damage coal and fossil fuels are wreaking on our planet, on people and on nature."
"On climate change, like so many other things, the world is going one way and Donald Trump is going the other. On Twitter the president-elect has claimed manmade global warming was a hoax invented by China to increase its trade surplus with the US. However, for most Americans, like most other people on the globe, daily life is increasingly impacted by extreme weather. In 2016, for the third year running, the world exceeded the previous record temperature. A remarkable 16 of the 17 hottest years on record have been this century, which scientists attribute to human activities. President Obama did much to roll back the pre-enlightenment approach to climate science that had polluted political discourse in America – giving global warming top billing during his second term, and even calling it an immediate threat to national security. His parting shot was to send $500m to prop up the Paris international accord to limit greenhouse gas emissions. Mr Trump vowed to renege on the Paris agreement and said he would cancel further payments. Political leadership has an important role to play, especially when leaders must act now to avert a crisis that will pose the gravest risks long after they have left office. The biggest obstacle to action on climate remains, as it has been for more than 20 years, the US political system which has embedded climate scepticism into public debate. President-elect Trump’s cabinet nominations give rise to big fears and small hopes. His nomination of Scott Pruitt, Oklahoma’s attorney-general, as head of the Environmental Protection Agency – tasked with reining in fossil fuel pollution – puts a man in charge of an institution he spent years fighting. Mr Pruitt sings a climate-denying tune, claiming scientists continue to disagree about global warming’s “connection to the actions of mankind”. However, Rex Tillerson, a former oilman nominated as Mr Trump’s secretary of state, favoured remaining in the Paris climate change agreement. He accepted that the risks of climate change exist but downplayed the size of them. This feels closer to Mr Trump’s position. The president-elect’s style lends itself to whimsical dissembling, and the weight of scientific evidence is such that even the Tweeter-in-chief has admitted there is “some connectivity” between human activity and climate change. There’s no doubt the world will lose out if America decides to relinquish global leadership on battling climate change. But Mr Trump’s fossil fuel plans are likely to flounder without higher hydrocarbon prices. No one will frack for gas unless profits can be made. Coal mines won’t reopen while shale gas is cheap. Instead, self-interest will undergird the fight against global warming. China will decarbonise to ensure its citizens don’t choke to death in its cities. The costs of clean energy are tumbling too, keeping nations on the path towards decarbonisation. The price of electric vehicles is dropping; offshore wind power has become dramatically cheaper. For the first time, the costs of wind and solar power have dropped to match those of fossil fuels. Last year was the first in which renewable energy surpassed coal as the world’s biggest source of power-generating capacity. Countries such as India have ambitious plans for renewable energy. As we report, experts say that the best way for Mr Trump to make America great is to create the well-paid, fulfilling jobs that the “technologies of the future” promise. If he does not, then there’s a threat made in a language that Mr Trump understands: protectionism. Politicians in nations such as France and Mexico threaten punitive carbon tariffs on American exports if the United States, the world’s second biggest polluter, attempts to free-ride on the efforts of others when it comes to global warming. This would not be a good idea, but the lack of leadership from Mr Trump’s team has engendered worldwide exasperation. With or without the US, the fight against climate change will go on. It’s just that victory will be harder to deliver."
"Migrating birds are responding to the effects of climate change by arriving at their breeding grounds earlier as global temperatures rise, research has found.  The University of Edinburgh study, which looked at hundreds of species across five continents, found that birds are reaching their summer breeding grounds on average about one day earlier per degree of increasing global temperature.  The main reason birds take flight is changing seasonal temperatures and food availability. The time they reach their summer breeding grounds is significant, because arriving at the wrong time, even by a few days, may cause them to miss out on vital resources such as food and nesting places. This in turn affects the timing of offspring hatching and their chances of survival. The research included species that travel huge distances, such as the swallow and pied flycatcher, as well as those with shorter migrations, such as the lapwing and pied wagtail. British swallows fly through western France, across the Pyrenees, down eastern Spain into Morocco, and across the Sahara, to spend their winter in South Africa from around September or October.  Migrating swallows can cover 200 miles a day at speeds of 17-22 miles per hour, with a maximum flight speed of 35mph.  The pied flycatcher, a bird slightly smaller than a house sparrow, is a summer visitor to the UK and breeds mainly in western areas of the country, before spending the winter in west Africa.  The northern lapwing, which is about 30cm long from beak to tail, can be seen across the British Isles throughout the year, favouring farmland, wetland and meadows during the breeding season and pasture and ploughed fields during the winter months. The University of Edinburgh researchers examined records of migrating bird species dating back almost 300 years. They drew upon records from amateur enthusiasts and scientists, including notes from 19th-century American naturalist Henry David Thoreau. They hope their study, published in the Journal of Animal Ecology and supported by the Natural Environment Research Council, will help scientists better predict how different species will respond to environmental changes. Long-distance migrants, which are shown to be less responsive to rising temperatures, may suffer most as other birds gain advantage by arriving at breeding grounds ahead of them.  Takuji Usui, of the university’s school of biological sciences, said: “Many plant and animal species are altering the timing of activities associated with the start of spring, such as flowering and breeding. “Now we have detailed insights into how the timing of migration is changing and how this change varies across species. These insights may help us predict how well migratory birds keep up with changing conditions on their breeding grounds.”"
"A breakthrough in the race to make useful products out of planet-heating CO2 emissions has been made in southern India. A plant at the industrial port of Tuticorin is capturing CO2 from its own coal-powered boiler and using it to make baking soda.  Crucially, the technology is running without subsidy, which is a major advance for carbon capture technology as for decades it has languished under high costs and lukewarm government support. The firm behind the Tuticorin process says its chemicals will lock up 60,000 tonnes of CO2 a year and the technology is attracting interest from around the world. Debate over carbon capture has mostly focused until now on carbon capture and storage (CCS), in which emissions are forced into underground rocks at great cost and no economic benefit. The Tuticorin plant is said to be the first unsubsidised industrial scale example of carbon capture and utilisation (CCU). There is already a global market for CO2 as a chemical raw material. It comes mainly from industries such as brewing where it is cheap and easy to capture. Until now it has been too expensive without subsidy to strip out CO2 from the relatively low concentrations in which it appears in flue gas. The Indian plant has overcome the problem by using a new CO2-stripping chemical. It is just slightly more efficient than the current CCS chemical amine, but its inventors, Carbonclean, say it also needs less energy, is less corrosive, and requires much smaller equipment meaning the build cost is much lower than for conventional carbon capture. The new kit has been installed at Tuticorin Alkali Chemicals. The firm is now using the CO2 from its own boiler to make baking soda – a base chemical with a wide range of uses including glass manufacture, sweeteners, detergents and paper products. The firm’s managing director, Ramachandran Gopalan, told BBC Radio 4: “I am a businessman. I never thought about saving the planet. I needed a reliable stream of CO2, and this was the best way of getting it.” He says the plant now has virtually zero emissions to air or water. Carbonclean believes capturing usable CO2 can deal with perhaps 5-10% of the world’s emissions from coal. It’s no panacea, but it would be a valuable contribution because industrial steam-making boilers are hard to run on renewable energy. The inventors of the new process are two young chemists at the Indian Institute of Technology in Kharagpur. They failed to find Indian finance and were welcomed instead by the UK government, which offered grants and the special entrepreneur status that whisks them through the British border. The firm’s headquarters are now based in London’s Paddington district. Its CEO, Aniruddha Sharma, said: “So far the ideas for carbon capture have mostly looked at big projects, and the risk is so high they are very expensive to finance. We want to set up small-scale plants that de-risk the technology by making it a completely normal commercial option.” By producing a subsidy-free carbon utilisation project, Carbonclean appears to have something of a global lead. But it is by no means alone. Carbon8 near Bristol is buying in CO2 to make aggregates, and other researchers are working on making plastics and fuels from waste CO2. At last, it seems, the race to turn CO2 into profit is really on. • Roger Harrabin presents Climate Change: The Trump Card on BBC Radio 4 at 8pm on 3 January. Follow Roger on Twitter @rharrabin."
"Small island species, confined to limited terrain, are always vulnerable, particularly to invasive species, burgeoning human populations, and new diseases. On Hawaii, climate change intersects with these three factors to imperil its unique birds, including six species of honeycreeper.  The small, often brightly coloured honeycreepers tend to survive at higher altitudes where their forest habitat is less likely to be destroyed by humans. Higher elevations are also cooler, and less attractive to mosquitoes, which were first carried to Hawaii in the 19th century, long after the birds had evolved there. Outbreaks of mosquito-borne diseases such as avian malaria and avian pox began soon afterwards. As the world warms, so mosquitoes move into higher elevations – and there is nowhere for the honeycreepers to escape to. The birds are particularly susceptible to avian malaria. Last year, a scientific study noted that the prevalence of avian malaria has more than doubled since the 1990s in the upper regions of the Hawaiian island of Kauai. Naturalists working in the Kauai mountains never encountered mosquitoes despite searching for them until the last six years or so, during which time they have become commonplace. As well as mosquitos, climate change is also assisting non-native competitors and invasive weeds, which may hasten the native birds’ demise. Eben Paxton, of the US Geological Survey’s Pacific Island Ecosystems research centre, fears that two honeycreepers, the ‘akikiki and the ‘akeke’e, will fall extinct in the next decade “without major intervention”. This means action unfamiliar to many conservationists: removing standing water to reduce mosquito populations, and even releasing genetically modified mosquitoes to reduce populations over time, as undertaken in Brazil to combat the Zika virus. The Baird’s sandpiper (Calidris bairdii) is not likely to become extinct any time soon. It is still listed as a species of “least concern” on the International Union for Conservation of Nature’s (IUCN) Red List. But the challenge posed by climate change for this elegant little wading bird is one experienced by many other species: it’s a problem of phenology and synchronicity. Phenology, the study of the timing of natural events in relation to weather and climate, is increasingly complex and important in an era of rapid climate change. Changes in phenology may be a positive sign, demonstrating that species are adapting to climatic conditions and migrating earlier, or flowering sooner, or having offspring earlier in the spring to coincide with food supplies that are changing with the season. But many species are struggling to adapt quickly enough. Increasing temperates in the high Arctic are encouraging shore birds such as the Baird’s sandpiper to breed earlier in the season. This means that more chicks are emerging before the peak abundance of the insects that they feed own. Studies show that chicks raised outside the period of peak abundance grow much more slowly, which means they are less likely to survive into adulthood. A similar mismatch between chick emergence and peak food has also been shown to occur with the European pied flycatcher in the Netherlands. Increasing temperatures are posing a challenge for all kinds of montane species. They may retreat to higher altitudes but, eventually, they will run out of mountain. Mountainous regions are also likely to experience particularly extreme temperature changes: while the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change estimates that 21st-century climate warming is likely to exceed 2C in many scenarios, the rate of temperature increase in mountainous areas is predicted to be much higher – possibly three times the increase recorded over the 20th century. The giant mountain lobelia (Lobelia rhynchopetalum) is a native of Ethiopia, a spectacular-looking tropical alpine plant that resembles a spiky tropical palm but then shoots up a huge woolly protuberance, sometimes more than 10 metres tall. Implausibly large in arid mountainous terrain, the family of lobelia plants remarkably predate the formation of tall mountains in eastern Africa, to which they’ve adapted. They are not finding it so easy to adapt to rapid anthropogenic climate change. A scientific study of the plant’s prospects last year concluded it “will suffer massive reduction in range” under warmer climes, with just 3.4% of its habitat still suitable by 2080. By then, it is predicted to be confined to just four suitable mountain-top habitats “which may be too small to sustain viable populations”. There’s a further problem. As alpine species such as the giant mountain lobelia are confined to isolated mountaintops, their genetic diversity will narrow dramatically – by 82% – further increasing the likelihood of extinction. The travails of this mountain giant are matched by mountain plant species around the world, including high-altitude species in Britain. Botanist Trevor Dines, of the charity Plantlife, says: “It’s already clear that some of our rarest Arctic-alpine plants, such as Highland saxifrage, are at risk. As the climate warms, they’re already moving to higher altitudes to find cooler, damper conditions. At some point, they’ll run out of mountain to climb and we’ll be facing the extinction of some of our most enigmatic and wonderful flora.” For many creatures, climate change is the most vicious component of a perfect storm driving them towards extinction. For some, extinction is quite literally caused by storms and rising seas. Anthropogenic climate change has almost certainly driven our first mammal species to extinction. The Bramble Cay melomys (Melomys rubicola), or mosaic-tailed rat, lived the unobtrusive life of a small rodent in the eastern Torres Strait. It was first discovered – and killed – on the tiny vegetated coral island of Bramble Cay by Europeans in 1845. Several hundred lived there as recently as 1978. But the highest point of Bramble Cay is three metres above sea level and around the Torres Strait the sea level rose at almost twice the global average rate between 1993 and 2014. Since 1998, the area of Bramble Cay above high tide has shrunk from from 4 hectares to 2.5 hectares. The melomys has lost 97% of its habitat and was last seen by a fisherman in 2009. Scientists laid traps in 2011 and twice in 2014 to catch the little rodent and start a captive breeding programme to save it from extinction. But they were too late: they couldn’t find any trace of the animal. There’s a small chance an as-yet-undiscovered population may survive in Papua New Guinea but the scientists have judged it is almost certainly extinct. The Sierra Nevada blue (Polyommatus golgus) is a small butterfly that is both brilliant blue (the male) and dark black-brown (the female) and is one of four endangered species unique to Spain. It is only found in the peaks of the Sierra Nevada and in another small mountainous area further north. It has already lost habitat to overgrazing by animals, a ski resort, and the trampling of vegetation by people on roads and footpaths. But its biggest threat is climate change, according to a species recovery plan drawn up by the researcher Miguel Munguira for Butterfly Conservation Europe. Drought, increased temperatures and reduced snow coverage are set to displace the species to higher areas where the habitat might not be suitable. “For the populations living on the highest areas of the mountains these changes would mean their extinction,” says Munguira. Of the 482 species of butterfly in Europe, 149 are restricted to such small areas that it is difficult for scientists to assess how the changing climate will affect them. Isolated in such small pockets of land makes these rare insects hugely vulnerable – wild habitat is too fragmented for even winged creatures to easily find a suitable alternative. And those that can only live in northern Europe, or on the tops of mountain ranges, will be the first to go. “The scale of threat to the species of Europe is massive,” says Nigel Bourn, conservation director of Butterfly Conservation in Britain. “I don’t really think policymakers have even begun to come to terms with that.” The disappearance of a few butterflies may not move the hardest of human hearts but these are the most closely monitored insects: the impact of climate change on hundreds of butterflies will be replicated in other less-known pollinators and insect populations – from bees to hoverflies – and the very fabric of life on earth will start to fray. Rising seas and stormy weather will affect turtle species in the most direct of ways, eroding or destroying many of the beaches where they lay their eggs. But scientists have discovered that hotter sands also cause greater numbers of sea turtles to be born female. In the short term, over the next 20 or 30 years, this will increase turtle numbers. But a study published in Nature Climate Change examining the loggerhead turtles of Cape Verde in the Atlantic, warns that significantly warmer sands in the next 150 years could cause such a preponderance of females that species become extinct. Hotter sand can also cause complete nest failure. Turtles are facing more problems than most animals: warming ocean temperatures will alter currents and shift the distribution and abundance of prey species. Species such as the hawksbill turtle are dependant on coral reefs which are bleaching and dying with climate change. The Adélie penguin is one of just two true Antarctic penguins, surviving on the ice-bound continent for 45,000 years. Now its survival is being questioned by scientists puzzling over the precise cause for sharp declines that correlate with a rapidly changing climate. Colonies of this little penguin on the West Antarctic Peninsula have declined by at least 80% since the 1970s, and this is an area with more years of warmer-than-average sea surface temperatures than other regions. Changes in sea temperature and sea ice affects the availability of food, and where fish populations have fallen the penguins eat more krill, which is less nutritious. Nest sites may not be ideal if warming is creating premature melt and puddles on the ground as eggs cannot survive if they are lying in a pool of water. Most importantly, the Adéie penguin cannot survive without sea ice. In a paper published last year, researchers predicted that 60% of the present habitat would be unsuitable for the penguins by 2099. But Adélie populations in the southern most parts of Antarctica, where there has been fewer climatic and environmental changes, are much more stable. The Adélie has refugia but for how long? The polar bear may be the poster-creature of climate change victims but this equally attractive – and rather more timid – white furry mammal is much closer to the edge of extinction. This arboreal marsupial lives on the wooded slopes of Mount Lewis in the Daintree rainforest in Queensland, Australia, where scientists have judged it already “ecologically extinct”. The white lemuroid ringtail possum (Hemibelideus lemuroides) lives off leaf moisture and are only found in the high-altitude cloud forest and cannot survive temperatures above 30C for more than a few hours. At less than 3,000 metres high, the climate of Mount Lewis is rapidly changing. A severe heatwave in 2005 killed off most of these cool-loving creatures. In July 2014, scientists observed four or five adults during 10 surveys. Even if the population bounces back, soon it will have nowhere left to go. Genetic studies have never been carried out to determine whether the white possums are a separate species or simply colour variations of the brown-furred lemuroid ringtail possums, which appear to be able to survive higher temperatures. But Prof Bill Laurance of James Cook University has argued that the white form is “a unique evolutionary unit and therefore worthy of conservation”. It is also just one furry symbol of the “ecological catastrophe” that scientists warn will soon befall thousands of species who will find that Australia’s tropical rainforests offer them no shelter in an era of warming. The most commonly pictured victim of climate change is the polar bear clinging to a rapidly diminishing iceberg. But there is another vulnerable Arctic mammal that is just as photogenic and even more dependant upon Arctic sea ice for its survival. Climate change is driving polar bears from the safety of sea ice and on to hazardous dry land, and into more conflict with humans. But the ringed seal, the smallest Arctic seal species, cannot adapt to dry land so easily. Ringed seals rest on sea ice, conceive beneath it, and give birth upon it, excavating snow dens on the surface of the sea ice to shelter their newborns. These dens keep the young warm, and depends upon sufficient annual snowfall. Warmer spring temperatures causes snow dens to collapse and the ice to break up early, separating young – just 60cm long when born – from their mothers, and exposing them to the cold, predators and pathogens. Ring seal reproductive rates are already showing declines associated with climate change. Hundreds of pups are usually born each year on the fjords along the west coast of Svalbard but pups were “virtually non-existent” in 2006 and 2007, when many fjords did not freeze for the first time in recorded history. If ringed seal populations slump, there will be another victim, too: they are the prime food source of the polar bear. Coral is not merely a living species; it’s a miraculous ecosystem engineer, building elaborate and beautiful subterranean structures that provide food and shelter for so many other forms of life on Earth. Coral reefs are hailed as the “rainforest of the sea” but such analogies underplay their significance: they house a greater diversity of animal and plant life than rainforests. Coral is being killed by climate change and its extinction is coming sooner than many other creatures imperilled by climate change. Staghorn coral (Acropora cervicornis) is experiencing disastrous declines in its range in the southern Gulf of Mexico, Florida and the Bahamas, declining by up to 98% in parts of the Caribbean since the 1980s. It is listed as “critically endangered” on the IUCN red list. Since 2005, the Caribbean region has lost 50% of its corals, largely because of rising sea temperatures and mass bleaching incidents which have killed coral around the world. Species such as the orange-spotted filefish are completely dependent on coral reefs, and highly sensitive to warmer water. Across the world, coral reefs are bleaching and dying: Japan’s government this year reported that almost three-quarters of its biggest coral reef has died, blaming rising sea temperatures caused by global warming. Australia’s Great Barrier Reef experienced the worst bleaching ever recorded by scientists in 2016. Researchers at the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration have predicted that by 2050 more than 98% of coral reefs around the world will be afflicted by “bleaching-level thermal stress” each year. They conclude that reefs, including the Great Barrier Reef, are unlikely to survive such events. Homo sapiens is not dependant on the coral reefs but their loss would be a devastating and demoralising indictment of our era, and the destructiveness of our species. “We’ll lose more species of plants and animals between 2000 and 2065 than we’ve lost in the last 65 million years,” environmentalist Paul Watson, the founder of Sea Shepherd, has pointed out. “If we don’t find answers to these problems, we’re gonna be victims of this extinction event that we’re at fault for.”       "
"“We know that it was us that scorched the sky.”  And with that curt footnote, The Matrix sidesteps any further elaboration on the climate conditions that reign in the future outside the virtual world. Which seems to be Hollywood’s approach to climate change all over. It’s great for a bit of post-apocalyptic window-dressing, but any serious consideration of the topic is almost taboo. Perhaps the eco-scepticism of middle America – still Hollywood’s main market – is one reason; the lack of room for real-world settings and concerns amid the superhero-heavy cinematic universes that now dominate the franchise landscape is another. Not everyone has shied away from inconvenient truths, though: here are our top five climate-change feature films.  Perhaps the best climate change-related feature is far less well known than it should be – probably not because of its politics, but rather because its offbeat stylisation meant that the Weinstein Company deemed it unsuitable for a wide US release, or any exposure at all in the UK. A shame, because Bong Joon-ho’s adaptation of the cult graphic novel makes no bones about what might lie ahead: botched climate engineering has plunged the Earth into a new ice age, and the only survivors all inhabit a huge train that perpetually circumnavigates the globe. Amenities include rolling views of permafrosted devastation outside, a never-ending supply of gelatinous insect bars, and, most importantly, the abiding sense that, despite the apocalypse, plus ça change. Organised hierarchically from front to rear, the Snowpiercer is a microcosm of 21st-century society: multicultural, but with the 1% in charge of the engine. The rear carriages are the ones stoking revolution, but their betters (marshalled by Tilda Swinton with the fruitiest Yorkshire brogue since Geoffrey Boycott) seem content to carry on going round in circles. Which will be familiar to any observer of global environmental forums over the last 20 years.  Blockbusterdom’s schlockiest director, Roland Emmerich, can at least be commended for making not one but two ecologically conscious tentpoles. Disaster movie 2012, in which the Chinese save John Cusack and an ark full of middleweight stars from the aftermath of Earth crust displacement, was his most recent. But 2004’s The Day After Tomorrow was his most clarion environmental statement; it somehow smuggles the eco-consciousness of the director’s native Germany into the heart of Hollywood.  It starts off thinking big, visualising the atmospheric consequences of the North Atlantic current slowing down and causing superstorms that are drawn to major world monuments. But the film’s thinking gets comically reductive, Jake Gyllenhaal’s breakneck Manhattan escape from a flash freeze boiling down to – stand back! – closing a door and fanning the fire. Fans of unsubtle political statements could also thrill to the sight of southern American climate refugees streaming across the border to Mexico (luckily for the film-makers, Trump wasn’t tweeting back then). In the obligatory narcissistic-trashing-of-LA sequence, the twister that scrubs out the Hollywood sign is perhaps Emmerich’s rebuke to his peers’ lack of faith on the climate question. The film industry loves the obvious, so why is it that the dramatic possibilities of heat have remained largely unexplored? The Mad Max franchise takes place at the upper end of the thermometer’s scale, and Fury Road, with its water-hoarding warlords and seed-nurturing granny-bikers, took it down an ever more ecological track. But it’s unclear if the scorching conditions are manmade or just the Australian norm.  Which leaves the 2011 German horror Hell (produced by that man Roland Emmerich again) as almost the only other sustained look at a hothouse Earth. A 10C temperature rise has made daytime excursions dangerous, and society’s remnants wander around goggled and swaddled like vampires on holiday. The film’s central band of survivors trail distant birds in search of water. Apart from the bleached colour palette, Hell mostly follows the post-apocalyptic playbook, according to which some portion of humanity inevitably lets the side down and resorts to the forbidden flesh. But the film’s economic plotting – wringing maximum tension out of the simplest actions, from climbing a radio mast to prying open boarded-up windows – is a lesson in itself for a more resource-scarce world. In 1995, Kevin Costner was a massive draw and could persuade Universal to blow $170m on a big-budget eco-pic featuring a lead character with gills. But Waterworld has long since been on the box-office catastrophe list. Perhaps it’s safer, and more anchoring, to do these kind of fantasy sprees on the cheap – like 2012’s $1.8m Beasts of the Southern Wild, a different kind of rising-seas picture.  Not classic dystopian sci-fi at all, it still has a visionary gleam in its eye, with present-day ecological concerns pressing on and constantly threatening to break through the levees of the imagination. Six-year-old Hush Puppy (the Oscar-nominated Quvenzhané Wallis), living in a Louisiana bayou community called “the Bathtub”, has a head full of premonitions of prehistoric aurochs that her teacher tells her will be released by melting ice caps. Their snouts and hooves represent a fear of ancient, resurgent nature, but this southern magical-realist fable, inspired by the Hurricane Katrina disaster, bets on human resilience being more than a match. Waterworld-style bombast usually seems glib when applied to the real blockbuster event of our times, climate change; Beasts knows we’re all little in the face of that. Silent Running (1972), with its flora-filled geodesic domes, was one early example of the “escape” film. All Earth’s plant life has died out, but we never get to see it. Interstellar, on the other hand, gives us the full tour before blasting off into space. And it’s admirably specific about the cause and effect: giant dust storms are causing crop blight that is destroying the global food supply. Most seriously, the end is nigh for decent vegetable curry: it’s the last okra harvest ever, we’re told. Everyone is in the last-chance saloon, scrabbling for basic resources: Matthew McConaughey’s Coop and his kids hunt down an Indian drone in order to salvage its power cells.  There’s nothing particularly optimistic about Christopher Nolan’s suggestion that we may end up abandoning the planet, but McConaughey’s trip into the great beyond then curves tellingly back to an exact point in space and time. All the classic midwest cornfield imagery isn’t just Nolan’s wake-up call to the most climate-change sceptic country, but a reminder to us all that any solution begins in the most familiar place: home.                        "
"Bob Hawke has blamed “the increasing intrusiveness of the media into private lives of politicians” for what he sees as a decline in quality of MPs and leaders in Australia and abroad. In a wide-ranging address at the Woodford Folk festival in Queensland, where the 87-year-old has spoken for eight years in a row, the former prime minister said “poor quality of representatives … is not a purely Australian phenomenon – it’s a worldwide phenomenon”.  Hawke said the world was living through a unique period where it was the first time since the end of the second world war that there hadn’t been “an outstanding political leader … anywhere in the democratic world”. “Some people talk about Merkel and I do not run her down in any sense at all; I simply make the point that if you compared Angela Merkel with the chancellors of Germany in the postwar period, she’d rate about sixth. “So is there some reason why the quality of people going into the parliament is not as high? I don’t know the complete answer but I think, in fact I’m sure, that part of it is the increasing intrusiveness of the media, the general media and social media, into the private lives of politicians and their families. “I think this is more of a problem for the conservative side of politics than mine because on our side we tend to have some ideology-driven move which brings up good people.” Four minutes into his 20-minute address to a crowd of more than 1,000 festivalgoers, the former prime minister had broached one of his pet topics, calling for an overhaul of the Westminister system and the abolition of the states.  “What we have today basically represents the meanderings of British explorers across the Australian continent more than 200 years ago,” Hawke said. “Lines were drawn on a map and jurisdictions and governments followed. And so you have 13 governments dealing with much the same issues and I believe that the simple fact is that the states should be abolished.” Hawke also warned that if climate change was not immediately addressed it would result in the imminent and “total destruction of mankind on this planet”.  Drawing considerable ire from the progressive audience, Hawke advocated nuclear power as one integral part of the solution to climate change, returning to an issue he has been passionately pushing since the late stages of his prime ministership: that Australia, as the most geologically stable nation on Earth, has a responsibility to store the world’s nuclear waste. “Nimby – not in my backyard – ignores the fact that the world’s leading geologists have said that we have geologically the world’s safest backyard and we cannot ignore that fact if we are to be serious to ourselves, our children and our grandchildren. I think more work should be done on this by our government, leading to an affirmative decision. “It would be a win for the global environment and it would be a win for Australia,” he said, arguing nuclear powered nations “would pay well for the storage of nuclear waste”. He also added that during a recent visit to Japan he met with the prime minister, Shinzo Abe, who he said “nearly had an orgasm” when he raised the mere idea of Australia accepting nuclear waste. Hawke said Indigenous Australians would be a “further winner” if Australia became the world’s dumping ground for radioactive waste.  “The greatest stain upon this great Australian nation’s character, without any question, is the great gaps that exist between our Aboriginal brothers and sisters in terms of their health, their education, their living conditions, their incarceration rates and life expectancy. It’s a great stain. I would argue strongly that a non-negotiable condition of taking this big decision to take the world’s nuclear waste … would be that a significant potion of the income that we got in this way should be directed to closing these gaps that exist amongst the most underprivileged in our nation, Aboriginal people.” In his only dig at Donald Trump, which drew laughs, Hawke said: “There are few people of any substance – inside or outside the world scientific community – who now question the fact of global warming. I think there’s an incoming president of the United States, a guy called Trump, who says it doesn’t exist. To me that’s prima facie evidence of the fact it does.” Speaking later in a one-on-one interview with Guardian Australia, Hawke said it was “almost impossible to overstate how dangerous” it was to have the leader of the US expressing scepticism about climate change. He said if he was in Malcolm Turnbull’s position today and forced to play the diplomatic game with Trump, “I would hold out my hand to him. I would try to do all I could to be positive with him; to gently explain where I thought he was mistaken and where his pursuit of his campaign statements could create problems for the world.” Hawke also expressed alarm at Trump’s pivot towards Russia and protectionist leanings, saying: “If he starts to try and smash international trade, that will be disastrous. “One of the things that worries me most about him is his closeness to Putin. The man he has appointed as secretary of state has a business relationship with him. I think Putin is an extraordinarily dangerous man. I think he’s trying to recreate the Soviet empire and it’s that connection which I think should be very worrying to a lot of people.” Hawke said he did not advocate centre-left politicians emulating Trump’s populist style but stressed that every political party needed to be sensitive to the changing view of the electorate. “One fundamental issue which Trump did take advantage of was the increasing disparities of income in the United States. So many people saw the rich getting richer and it not being spread around. It’s affecting European politics too now.” Hawke also defended the prime ministership of his former treasurer and political rival, Paul Keating, conceding “I certainly would not argue that I would’ve done a better job than Paul” in guiding the Australian economy through the 1990s recession.  “Paul was a very competent treasurer and he must be commended from where he came from. He had no formal training in economics and indeed, in the early days of government he said to me: ‘God I hope they don’t ask me any detailed questions in parliament,’” Hawke laughed.  “But he grew in the job and become one of Australia’s great treasurers.” Hawke has become a major drawcard to the annual six-day Woodford Folk festival, which is now in its 31st year and pulls crowds of more than 120,000.  On Tuesday night the former prime minister stole the show at the festival’s “welcoming ceremony”, leading a crowd of about 15,000 people in a rousing, operatic rendition of Waltzing Matilda complete with intermittent fist-pumping.

"Barack Obama’s original cabinet was chockablock with historic firsts. The first African American attorney general. The first Nobel laureate upon appointment. The first female homeland security secretary, and the first African American to head the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). Donald Trump’s cabinet, if confirmed, also would advance multiple historic firsts. It would be the first cabinet of multiple billionaires. It would be the first cabinet to give pride of place to climate deniers. It would be the first cabinet whose members want to eliminate their own agencies. And it would raise the bar – a lot – for conspiracy theorists. Before Trump’s team faces closer scrutiny from Congress in January, here’s your guide to understanding how these four categories define many of Trump’s major nominees and advisers.  These nominees would lead the four most important agencies in combatting climate change. Scott Pruitt, EPAOklahoma state attorney general Pruitt wrote in a May 2016 editorial in the National Review that there was a climate change “debate” that was “far from settled. Scientists continue to disagree about the degree and extent of global warming and its connection to the actions of mankind. That debate should be encouraged …” He was part of a “secretive alliance” with fossil fuel companies to fight Obama administration environmental regulations, according to 2014 New York Times reporting. Ryan Zinke, Department of the InteriorCongressman from Montana  In a 2014 interview, Zinke blamed the buildup of greenhouse gases on volcanoes. “I’m a conservationist, but when there’s a volcano in the Philippines that erupts and produces more CO2 than humans have produced in 200 years – is CO2 really the problem?” Rick Perry, Department of Energy  Former Texas governor Perry wrote in a 2010 book that “we have been experiencing a cooling trend”. “I don’t believe that we have the settled science,” he said in a 2014 interview, continuing: “Calling CO2 a pollutant is doing a disservice the country, and I believe a disservice to the world ... I’m not a scientist.” Mike Pompeo, CIACongressman from Kansas Pompeo has used congressional hearings to grandstand against “what you all call climate change today”. He told CSPAN in 2013: “There are scientists who think lots of different things about climate change. There’s some who think we’re warming, there’s some who think we’re cooling, there’s some who think that the last 16 years have shown a pretty stable climate environment.” Rex Tillerson, secretary of stateCEO of ExxonMobil Tillerson pays lip service to “risks of climate change” but runs the world’s biggest non-state oil and gas extraction company. Likewise, he has said ExxonMobil favors a climate tax and supports the Paris climate accords but has not backed those statements with action. Trump’s billionaire cabinet could be the wealthiest administration ever. At least six appointees have net worths estimated in the nine figures. Collectively, they have more money than a third of American households combined, according to a Quartz calculation. Wilbur Ross, Department of Commerce Industrialist Net worth: $2.5bn, according to Forbes. He made it the old-fashioned way: by buying, merging and selling large industrial concerns in steel, textiles and coal. He owns 40 Magrittes. Linda McMahon, Small Business AdministrationEntertainment executive Forbes pegs the net worth of her husband, Vince McMahon, at $1.14bn; the couple has been married 50 years. Together they created the entertainment juggernaut now known as World Wrestling Entertainment. Betsy DeVos, Department of EducationPhilanthropist Daughter-in-law of Richard DeVos, who co-founded the multi-level-marketing giant Amway, which specializes in beauty, home care and health products such as the dietary supplement Nutrilite.  Forbes pegs Richard DeVos’s family’s net worth at $5.1bn. Steve Mnuchin, treasury secretaryFinancier Net worth: about $655m, according to Bloomberg. Former Goldman Sachs partner, hedge funder and Hollywood producer (Sully, American Sniper, The Legend of Tarzan).  Rex Tillerson Net worth: around $365m, according to Bloomberg. Outgoing chairman of ExxonMobil after 41 years with the energy giant. Elaine Chao, Department of Transportation Public servant Her net worth has faced scrutiny because her husband is Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell, who is subject to financial disclosure rules. Chao is a daughter of James SC Chao, a shipping magnate whose net worth PolitiFact had difficulty nailing down in 2014, except to note that the family foundation recently gave $40m to Harvard.  A noticeable Trump innovation in picking a cabinet: appointing leaders who have said they would like to destroy the agencies they’re supposed to lead. A variation is appointing leaders whose careers have undercut the agencies they’re supposed to lead.  Scott Pruitt Pruitt has been involved in multiple lawsuits against the EPA. He is currently part of a legal action waged by 28 states against the EPA to halt the Clean Power Plan, an effort by Obama’s administration to curb greenhouse gas emissions from coal-fired power plants. Pruitt has said the American people “are tired of seeing billions of dollars drained from our economy due to unnecessary EPA regulations”, and he boasted on his LinkedIn page that he was “a leading advocate against the EPA’s activist agenda”. Rick Perry Perry famously suffered a memory lapse during a presidential debate in trying to name the Department of Energy as one of three federal agencies he would eliminate if elected. “Oops,” he said. Perry’s background in nuclear issues, which is the energy department’s main charge, appears to be limited to an effort to privatize the disposal of radioactive waste in Texas. Perry’s two immediate predecessors in the job were both nuclear physicists. Andrew Puzder, Department of LaborFast food executive Puzder is a vehement critic of government regulation and staunch opponent of minimum wage laws and the Fight for $15 movement. He blames Obamacare for increased labor costs and has diagnosed a “government-mandated restaurant recession”.  Rex Tillerson  As ExxonMobil’s main dealmaker around the world, Tillerson had interests that sometimes ran up against US interests. He continued (legally) to do business with Russia after the country became the target of continuing sanctions. During the Obama years, Tillerson defied the state department to cut an oil deal with the Iraqi Kurds, the New Yorker pointed out. Betsy DeVos  DeVos has been an advocate for school vouchers, which critics say undercut public schools.  Trump traffics in conspiracy theories and fake news – Barack Obama was born outside the US and sympathizes with terrorists, the election was rigged, Hillary Clinton is a criminal – so it’s only proper that his cabinet should too. Here are the three Trump nominees in competition for the tinfoil hat trophy. Ben Carson, Department of Housing and Urban Development Retired neurosurgeon Carson believes pyramids were built by the biblical Joseph to store grain, that Vladimir Putin, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei and Mahmoud Abbas attended school together in Moscow in 1968, that Jews with firearms might have been able to stop the Holocaust, that he personally could stop a mass shooting and that Osama bin Laden enjoyed Saudi protection after 9/11. Stephen Bannon, chief strategist Former CEO of Breitbart and Sirius XM radio host Breitbart ran stories linking Hillary Clinton’s aide Huma Abedin to the Muslim Brotherhood in addition to stories stoking antisemitism, white supremacy and misogyny. As a Sirius host, Bannon made the “case that House speaker Paul Ryan is a liberal globalist trying to sell out the American worker to foreign Islamist shills”, the Daily Beast reported.  Michael Flynn, national security adviserRetired general Flynn tweeted that Hillary Clinton had ties to “money laundering, sex crimes with children, etc”. He told his Twitter followers to buy the book of a far-right troll who said Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta was part of a sex cult and the Orlando nightclub shooter did not act alone.  He once said there were signs in Arabic along the Mexican border, which he had seen pictures of, to guide “radicalized Muslims” into the United States. “On three occasions, Flynn tagged in his tweets Jared Wyland, an ‘alt-right’, antisemitic commentator who has tweeted about the ‘Liberal Jewish media’,” CNN reported."
"Australia’s January news has been full of official reports of record-breaking extreme weather devastating our ecosystems on land and in the sea and government ministers suggesting we build new coal-fired power stations, provide billion-dollar subsidised loans to rail lines for new coal mega-mines, increase coal exports to reduce temperature rises and reduce our ambitions for renewable power. The disconnect is glaring but perhaps dimmed in the eyes of some readers because Australian politicians have been dissembling on climate change for decades, pretending it will be possible to do what we must without any impact on our position as the world’s largest coal exporter or our domestic reliance on brown coal-fired power, or without incurring any costs.   The Coalition government – which boasts as one of its proudest achievements the repeal of the former government’s emissions trading scheme – has a particular need for doublespeak. Having run two election campaigns on the pledge of “axing the tax” with hyperbolic assertions that it would strangle the economy and impoverish households, it found it convenient to claim the discovery of the climate policy equivalent of a free lunch. The Coalition has never resolved the bitter internal divisions with conservative climate doubters that saw Malcolm Turnbull overthrown as leader in 2009 owing to his support for carbon pricing, to be replaced by Tony Abbott, who had declared the settled science of climate change to be “crap” and believed coal was “good for humanity”.  In September 2015 Turnbull overthrew Abbott but, since then, climate change has barely rated a mention and the new prime minister has surprised many by apparently falling into line with the mineral industry’s argument that our coal exports are really doing the world a big favour. Trump’s victory has emboldened the doubters – the resources minister, Matt Canavan, for example, enthused that “Donald Trump is good for fossil fuels, good for steel and good for Australia”. But it has also coincided with more conflicting responses from the government.  Less than a day after the US election, the Turnbull government ratified the Paris agreement – the same agreement the new US president has vowed to “tear up” and that calls for zero net emissions by the second half of the century – describing it was a “watershed … that has galvanised global action”.  But then it promptly abandoned a domestic policy idea that represented its last credible chance of meeting its promised targets or galvanising any real action here. With the world recording its third year in a row of record temperatures and the Great Barrier Reef bleaching, any objective assessment would suggest the time for prevarication and obfuscation is long since past. We’ll soon see. On 1 February, in his first major speech for the year, Turnbull will stand before the National Press Club to explain his policy on energy and the greenhouse gases it produces. Experts from business, industry and the environment movement are wondering what he can possibly say.  For years the former environment minister had privately reassured stakeholders that a 2017 review would quietly morph the Direct Action policy into a so-called emissions intensity trading scheme and business and environment groups alike were clinging to those promises as the last hope for a credible climate policy and an end to the investment drought caused by years of mindless “climate wars” and policy uncertainty. But late last year, despite advice that such a scheme would lead to lower household power prices, despite having bipartisan support and just hours after the current environment minister said the review would look at it, the government ruled it out. Turnbull will announce new vehicle emissions standards and a new energy efficiency scheme. He and his office are looking at “technological solutions” – bright new ideas in solar thermal, or battery or carbon storage technology that might fill the policy void. But all those technologies need government policies to provide investors with incentives and certainty, and without actually confronting the climate doubters no one can imagine what that policy might be. Turnbull will also reassure voters, who repeatedly tell pollsters they are worried about global warming, that Australia will “meet and beat” its international targets, as it has in the past. But again complexity hides the underwhelming truth.  Australia got not one but two special deals in the original Kyoto protocol – an allowance to increase its emissions in absolute terms – unlike almost all other developed countries, on account of our reliance on fossil fuels – and another special deal so particular to our circumstances it was called “the Australia clause”. It allowed the inclusion of land-use changes in emission calculations in a way that meant restrictions that had already been imposed on large-scale land clearing – especially in Queensland – allowed Australia to rest assured it had achieved its new target before it even signed up to it. The deal was so good we did “meet and beat” the target and, unlike almost all other developed countries, we are using that overshoot to help us also meet our very low 2020 target. But now state governments are overturning land-clearing restrictions and the federal government is arguing that states should abandon their regional renewable energy targets, which were only ever necessary because the federal scheme is effectively winding down.  In short, we have done very little and we have no effective federal policies to shift to a low emissions economy, and everyone knows it. Trump gives the Australian sceptics the chance to run the same old arguments – if the US does nothing, then why should we? His victory has increased the prospect that some of them could split to form a new conservative party.  The energy market remains so complex that all kinds of wild claims can be made to justify a do-nothing end. And international climate negotiations remain so byzantine that countries can claim hero status while doing very little. But the reality of global warming cannot be disguised by political obfuscation and the Turnbull government has run out of excuses. It has to have an honest internal reckoning – is it serious about climate policy or does it run with the sceptics? Trump’s election makes it more urgent that we finally have an honest debate."
"President-elect Donald Trump’s nominee for Secretary of State – and until recently the CEO of ExxonMobil – Rex Tillerson was given a confirmation hearing by the Senate Foreign Relations Committee last week. In his testimony, Tillerson accepted the reality of human-caused global warming and that “The risk of climate change does exist and the consequences of it could be serious enough that action should be taken.” While he accepted the problem exists, Tillerson nevertheless proceeded to downplay its risks, saying:   The increase in the greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere are having an effect, our ability to predict that effect is very limited. Many climate scientists took issue with that statement, and for good reason. Climate models have been very accurate in their projections about many consequences of human carbon pollution. It’s true that there’s uncertainty in just how quickly some of those consequences will be triggered. The bad news is that recent studies have shown that many of those consequences are happening more quickly than climate scientists anticipated. Greater climate uncertainty translates into more urgency to tackle the problem, not less. The Gulf Stream – which keeps the UK and surrounding area significantly warmer than it would otherwise be – is part of the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC). Research has shown it could shut down as a result of global warming: In 1997, the oceanographer Wallace Broecker, of Columbia University in New York, suggested that if the Gulf stream turned off, winter temperatures in the British Isles could fall by an average of 11°C - plunging Blackpool or Berwick to the same temperatures as Spitsbergen, inside the Arctic circle. Any dramatic drop in temperature could have devastating implications for agriculture - and for Europe’s ability to feed itself. Just how quickly such a shutdown could happen has been a subject of debate and research among climate scientists. A study published in Science Advances in early January corrected for a bias recently identified in climate models that acted to keep the AMOC and Gulf Stream more stable than it appears to be in reality: Freshwater continually flows into the northern Atlantic through precipitation, rivers and ice-melting. But supply of salty waters from the south, through the Gulf Stream System, balances this. If however the current slows, there is less salt supply, and the surface ocean gets less salty. This fresher water is lighter than saltier water and therefore cannot sink into the depths so easily. Since this sinking – the so-called deep water formation – drives the Gulf Stream System, the current continues to weaken. There is a critical point when this becomes an unstoppable vicious circle. This is one of the classic tipping points in the climate system. In most climate models, the AMOC imports fresh water, which would make the circulation more stable. According to recent observational data, the AMOC is actually exporting fresh water. The authors of the study corrected for this bias, and ran the models in a scenario of an abrupt doubling of atmospheric carbon dioxide levels from about 350 to 700 ppm.  This is a more extreme scenario than a more gradual ramping up of carbon levels, but importantly, the study did not account for meltwater flowing into the Atlantic from the melting Greenland ice sheet. Recent research has shown that Greenland meltwater may significantly weaken the AMOC in the coming decades. Under the study’s scenario, the AMOC lost a third of its strength after 100 years, and broke down within about 300 years. As a result, average winter temperatures over parts of northern and western Europe would become 7°C colder than today. Global sea ice has also been tracking at record-shattering low levels.  Climate scientists have known for about a decade that Arctic sea ice is declining faster than climate models anticipated. In 2016, Antarctic sea ice also hit an extreme record low, but until recently, had been stable and even expanding slightly. Counter-intuitively, global warming is one of the causes of that Antarctic sea ice expansion, as climate scientists Andreas Schmittner and Peter Clark explained: When the ocean temperatures warm, it causes more direct melting of the ice sheet below the surface, and it increases the number of icebergs that calve off the ice sheet … The cold, fresh water freezes more easily, creating additional sea ice despite warmer temperatures that are down hundreds of meters below the surface. In December, they published a study in Nature finding that not only would the collapse of the Antarctic ice sheet cause large-scale sea level rise, but that it would also increase global climate variability, which translates into greater risks.  Another study published in Science Advances in December found that Totten glacier in East Antarctica is melting from below due to warming ocean waters. During the Pliocene epoch 3 million years ago, global temperatures were about 2 to 3°C hotter than today, but sea levels were a whopping 25 meters (80 feet) higher. The melting of East Antarctic ice may help explain that tremendous sea level rise. Meanwhile, a massive iceberg the size of Delaware is poised to break off the Larsen C ice shelf on the Antarctic Peninsula, much as the Larsen B ice shelf did starting in 2002:  Scientists have also concluded that the collapse of the West Antarctic ice sheet is already underway and is likely unstoppable. The loss of the entire ice sheet would eventually cause up to a 4-meter (13-foot) sea level rise over several centuries. These are some of the consequences that led the Department of Defense – unlike Tillerson – to consider climate change an imminent threat. Tillerson: ""I don’t see [climate change] as an imminent national security threat but perhaps others do""The others: https://t.co/CjMX4MDRkY Senator Jeff Merkley’s (D-OR) questioning in the hearing revealed that Tillerson is not very concerned about climate change and doesn’t think America should be a leader on the issue. He wouldn’t pull the US out of international climate negotiations, but he might very well undermine them. That should normally be enough to disqualify Tillerson from being Secretary of State and in charge of America’s role in those negotiations. The problem is that if the Senate rejects Tillerson, Trump might very well nominate an outright science denier to the position. However, Tillerson would likely support lifting sanctions against Russia, which would allow ExxonMobil to extract tremendous reserves of oil from the country.  In neither case would the US take the needed action to curb the climate risks that Trump and his picks deny. While Tillerson does accept the reality of climate change and that it poses some risks, he denies that those risks are serious. Functionally he might not be very different than a Secretary of State who outright denies climate change. Such are the choices we face under a President Trump."
"Almost three-quarters of Japan’s biggest coral reef has died, according to a report that blames its demise on rising sea temperatures caused by global warming. The Japanese environment ministry said that 70% of the Sekisei lagoon in Okinawa had been killed by a phenomenon known as bleaching.  Bleaching occurs when unusually warm water causes coral to expel the algae living in their tissues, causing the coral to turn completely white. Unless water temperatures quickly return to normal, the coral eventually dies from lack of nutrition. The plight of the reef, located in Japan’s southernmost reaches, has become “extremely serious” in recent years, according to the ministry, whose survey of 35 locations in the lagoon last November and December found that 70.1% percent of the coral had died. The dead coral has now turned dark brown and is now covered with algae, the Yomiuri Shimbun said. The newspaper said the average sea surface temperature between last June and August in the southern part of the Okinawa island chain was 30.1 degrees centigrade – or one to two degrees warmer than usual – and the highest average temperature since records began in 1982, according to the Japan meteorological agency. The ministry report follows warnings by the Coral Reef Watch programme at the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration that global coral bleaching could become the “new normal” due to warming oceans. Experts said that bleaching had spread to about 90% of the Sekisei reef, a popular diving spot that covers 400sq km. A similar survey conducted in September and October last year found that just over 56% of the reef had died, indicating that bleaching has spread rapidly in recent months."
"It’s the time of year for students to promise themselves a new start – traditionally they’re taking a hard look at their personal habits right now, promising themselves no more food binges, fewer late nights and more punctual essays.  But how about the state the rest of the world is is in? You could consider putting something good into a community.  For my generation, rising global temperatures are the norm and a clear threat to our future. It doesn’t help that the US now has a president-elect who claims that climate change is a “Chinese hoax”. So it is important that we explore alternative, sustainable ways to live. That’s why I’m spending my gap year learning how to farm in the desert and recycle poo.  Yeah, I know, gap yahs have been roundly mocked as the cliched preserve of those privileged youths who just want to “discover themselves”. But studies have shown they can be good for personal development and teach skills that are beneficial at university and beyond.  So, along with 12 other teenagers, I’m spending a month on Kibbutz Lotan in the middle of the desert in southern Israel. We are a living social experiment: a self-sustaining, ecological “village” . My home is a dome made of mud, clay, straw and a waterproofing layer of turpentine and recycled cooking oil, which I share with three others. It’s a modern hut with a fan, plugs and even air-con. The village has compost toilets, solar showers, a sustainable kitchen with biogas and a bike-cum-washing machine that provides a work-out. It’s a massive change from the lives that most of us lead back in London. We’ve replaced Starbucks and shellac nails with shovels; it’s taken some time to get over the culture shock. Our days start with an 8 am wake-up: horribly early for me, but late for the real kibbutz workers who rise as early as 1 am to milk the cows. We start the chores before breakfast: cleaning the kitchen, loos and showers, and “feeding” the biogas with yesterday’s food scraps. After breakfast in the communal dining hall, we have permaculture and ecology lessons about the ethics of genetically modified crops, maintaining compost heaps, caring for the animals and keeping morale up throughout the long, hot days. We shovel goat and cow manure and build mud walls for the kibbutz kindergarten.  Working with animal dung is weirdly liberating for us townies. “Being on kibbutz has made us feel less materialistic,” says participant Max Klass. He’s never worked with animals before but says getting up close to the cows and goats is bringing out his “rough and ready side”. A simpler, more sustainable, ecologically ethical lifestyle is an achievable feat if you start on a small scale, adds participant Dan Apter. “People don’t know that shovelling shit is such fun.” I’ve found there’s more to the kibbutz experience than just an ecological education. We’re learning to live a truly communal life. It can be tough, but living in an “intentional community” feels like valuable training for university and a life of work. Yet even in this utopia, the books have to balance. Like many kibbutzim nowadays, this one has been privatised to ensure its economic survival. But it is still a place where members debate issues such as whether it’s ethical to maintain a refet (dairy), the extent of communal responsibility, and how to fairly distribute resources.   This time next year, I’ll be at Leeds University. I may not need to pick dates, farm or manage a compost loo there, but I’ll take the broader lessons that I’m learning on the kibbutz with me. I know it will affect the decisions I make about all sorts of things, from which products to buy to how to use transport. And it’s given me all kinds of ideas for the future.  My new home is the Giuseppe Conlon House, a former Roman Catholic church in north London. It is a well-preserved Edwardian building with a crypt, a confessional and an austere church hall. Nowadays it is the host of an intentional community run by London Catholic Worker, and a house of hospitality for refugees. Practically speaking, this involves a handful of volunteers living shoulder-to-shoulder with 20 asylum seekers, who are treated as guests. They live here as they pursue their asylum claims, which can take a long time. The old confessional is now used to store donated tins and vegetables. The crypt, which I like to imagine once housed the bones of saints, now contains two rooms where people sleep. The church hall is a multi-purpose living space where everyone sits for candlelit suppers. I’m about a month into my gap year now, having committed to a minimum of three months here. Perhaps the difference between this and more typical volunteering schemes is the authentic sense of community. We do everything as a group, regularly gathering for morning and night prayer in the hall among the bin bags filled with donated Manchester United jerseys and Queens Park Rangers boxer shorts. Lots of organisations run projects like this: you can contact Diggers and Dreamers, Eurotopia or WWOOF if you’re interested. I live here for free: meals and lodging are provided as long as you pull your weight with the chores. I’m given weekly volunteering expenses of £30, which allow me to meet up with friends for the odd drink. You meet a few characters at a place like this: climate change activists, Passionist priests and Servite nuns frequently pop in to chat and sometimes stay for a night or two. This creates a warmth that contrasts with the anonymity of the affluent neighbourhood outside. Life in the community is unlike anything I’ve experienced before. There’s little privacy. My room contains a second bed that is usually occupied by another guest. The sheer number of people coming and going is difficult to adapt to. You’re confronted with your personal flaws when you’ve got company at all times – in my case, a tendency to be petty about minor things.  Several times, I’ve needed to invent an excuse to go to a private place in some unused part of the house. One of these is the reading room, a cold, dank space which no one uses in the winter, where I freeze in solitude for a bit, just to get away from the commotion. But it does make every day exciting. Even at breakfast each morning, I’m bound to meet someone new. Many of my friends elsewhere – graduates who now work in London or other cities – say their busy lives don’t allow them time to stop and make friends, or get to know the area they live in. I feel lucky not to have these problems right now. I think my time here is preparing me for my studies at UCL next year. I am learning interpersonal skills, such as managing conflict and counselling, as well as solid practical skills: I cook for lots of people and I can deseed a donated pomegranate in no time. In many ways, the chaotic life here is like that of a student house – with just a few more rowdy housemates.

"I’ve always had a passion for the ice. I’d been to Iceland seven or eight times, to Arctic Norway and to Greenland. Greenland’s contribution to global sea-level rise is about three times that of Antarctica. I saw how fast the landscape was changing and wanted to put it into a body of work.  I teamed up with the Scott Polar Research Institute in Cambridge. They told me these deep blue lakes were appearing every summer in increasing numbers, higher and higher up on the ice cap. They provided me with satellite images highlighting where they tend to be. But frankly, the second I got up there I could have thrown all the maps away: there are so many lakes, it’s scary. A landscape you’d expect to be pristine white is just littered with blue. I was on the ice cap for about a week last summer, and I flew whenever the weather permitted. You get massive storms, fog cover – and then suddenly it’s clear again. But at that time of year the sun never really sets, so you can go flying at three or four in the morning and the light is perfect. Imagine sitting in a helicopter without any doors, strapped into a harness and leaning out over the Arctic ice cap. It’s not particularly comfortable. The helicopter also costs around £2,000 an hour to fly, so I ended up shooting mostly from a twin-engine plane, which only had a tiny hole in the window. That meant the pilot needed to tilt the plane at an almost 60-degree angle for me to be able to shoot vertically down. He was swearing at me a lot. The images are deliberately abstract. I didn’t want them to be documentary photographs. You have to get close to find the small, hidden details that help you to understand what you’re seeing. They’re beautiful, but what you’re looking at is climate change at its worst. My favourite is the one that looks like an eye. It’s a half-circle of concentric blues at the top of the image – it’s almost as if global warming is looking right back at you.  The beauty belies the terrifying implications. The ice cap fragments into tiny pieces. A river runs through the Greenland ice cap. More and more lakes are forming.

"Tomorrow the world shudders as Donald Trump becomes US president. Hopes that wise advisers would mitigate the erratic, half-crazed stream of contradictions pouring from his lips have been dashed as he picks fake news purveyors and climate change-deniers for his close consiglieri.  For these 24 hours the Guardian is marking the event with reporting from all seven continents on the effects of climate change happening right now, following the sun as day breaks around the world. Reports from every continent tell of rising seas, melting ice, warming tundra, scorching heat and a Gulf stream that may shift to freeze us here, as manmade global warming risks reaching the point of no return. The idea is to make us all stop and think. For example, we commentators on politics and society need to ask ourselves what’s wrong with us? Why is it that we mostly ignore this fast-approaching cataclysm, as we write about daily political dramas instead – Theresa May’s Brexit speech in Davos today, Jeremy Corbyn’s failed joke at PMQs yesterday, Boris Johnson comparing the potential behaviour of the French president to that of a Nazi prison camp guard. The trouble with climate change as a political issue is that it’s too big to grasp, too ever-present. An occasional fixed point of global decision – the dramatic last-minute signing of the Paris climate change deal – briefly flashes up on the political grid, but once over, it falls back as if done and dusted. The planet is heating up fast – but not fast enough for the hungry 24-hour news cycle. One problem: it’s hard for politicians, commentators and the public to worry about several things at once. The high-octane anxiety over Trump and Brexit absorbs all political energy: fear-fatigue can’t accommodate too much at once. Climate change is background noise, the slow roll of distant thunder. Like anyone not a denier, I am always aware of it and sometimes add “and climate change” to the list of monster crises ahead. Getting it right to the forefront of the brain, ahead of everything else, forcing politicians and public to put planet survival first, second and third in their priorities, that’s the great task. But it’s not easy. Serve up too much doom, and people despair, shrug and just hope nothing too terrible happens in their own lifetimes. Or they hope clever scientists and engineers will save us all just in time. The waterworld of Bangladesh drowning its people or the vanishing under the waves of Tuvalu are far away. Some will cling to the comfort of climate-change denial. Rex Tillerson, Trump’s chosen secretary of state, and a lifelong ExxonMobil man, uses the most dangerous subtler variety: he’s not an outright denier, but he tells Senate hearings its effects are uncertain, it exists but it’s just not that serious – though 97% of scientists are as certain as they are that smoking kills. The deranged and deluded species of denier include former chancellor Nigel Lawson, his columnist son Dominic, most of the Tory press and Owen Paterson, David Cameron’s climate change-denying former environment secretary who cut his climate adaptation budget by 40%. He told the BBC’s Any Questions four years ago that “the temperature has not changed in the last 17 years ”, though the temperature has been rising for decades, and 2016 was the hottest year on record, setting a new high for the third year in a row. Outright climate misinformation from people in authority is hugely effective: surely no minister would be so bold-faced? Besides, who doesn’t yearn for the discovery that it was all a mistake, what Trump calls a “hoax” and we are not about to boil, drown and freeze after all? A very little denial lie goes a long way, right round the world. Some, like ExxonMobil are venal, others are mad ideologists of the right who see green politics as a socialist plot or tree-hugging virtue-signalling. If they were serious, the precautionary principle would say, even if warming turns out less bad than feared, the cost of avoiding it is peanuts weighed against the high risk of human annihilation. To Westminster, climate politics smack of voter-unfriendly puritanism and self-denial, like dry January for ever – a hard sell for politicians, who instinctively veer away. Concern about the environment only rises up the agenda when the economy is thriving – in the late 80s, late 90s, 2006 – as a luxury for good times. But when most people’s incomes are still below crash levels, it’s harder to worry about the environment. Better jobs, higher growth, more of everything for everyone is the universal politicians’ message – not less of anything. European Green parties have sometimes sounded like people who relish less for its own sake. Besides, politicians urging individuals to change their driving, flying and meat-eating habits go down exceptionally badly in a society as unequal as ours. Who do they think they are, on their incomes? Let’s see the fat cats give up their private planes and Rolls-Royces first. Inequality kills in many ways – but losing the moral authority to urge restraint may fry the planet. Optimism is what successful politicians sell in manifestos of hope, change and better lives for all. The modern environmental movement has been good at balancing threats of doom with reasons why green energy and green living can foster clean growth, not kill it. What an opportunity was lost post-crash for a great green Keynesian investment surge in home insulation and new boilers, alongside a massive renewables push for wind, solar, tidal and nuclear power, with better public transport. Instead, no sooner did onshore wind become economic than its subsidies were taken away by Cameron; and just as solar was on the verge of success, George Osborne’s drastic cut in solar subsidy last year wrecked an industry, causing thousands of jobs to be lost. Read not only the warnings of impending disaster in our reports today, but the messages of hope. It can be done with political will. Greening the economy can be a motor for success not a drag on growth – and it’s for all of us, the voters, to hold the politicians’ feet to the global warming fire and fight off the reckless evil of the deniers."
"A magazine article claiming “marine life has nothing whatsoever to fear from ocean acidification” has been deemed neither misleading nor inaccurate by the UK’s press regulator. The feature, written by journalist and climate-change sceptic James Delingpole, appeared in the Spectator under the headline “Ocean acidification: yet another wobbly pillar of climate alarmism”.   Seawater is becoming more acidic as the oceans absorb carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, where rising concentrations are the cause of global warming. Many scientists are concerned about the impact of acidification on marine life. Phillip Williamson, whose research programme was derided in the article, complained to the Independent Press Standards Organisation (Ipso), arguing the piece contained many inaccuracies. But Ipso rejected the complaint, telling Williamson: “The article was clearly a comment piece.” Williamson said he was frustrated by the ruling: “Ipso’s overall message that ocean acidification is just a matter of opinion, not hard-won, testable knowledge is pernicious, with serious policy consequences.” Another researcher, whose study was cited by Delingpole as “heavy-fire support” for scepticism about acidification, criticised the Ipso decision.  Prof Howard Browman, at the Institute of Marine Research, Norway, said: “During these times of fake news in a post-fact world, it is essential that organisations such as Ipso are able to differentiate between a scholarly exposition that is based upon the best available information [Williamson’s complaint to Ipso] and an opinion piece.” Carol Turley, a marine expert at the Plymouth marine laboratory in the UK was also critical, calling Ipso’s decision “deplorable”. Fraser Nelson, editor of the Spectator, said: “It’s odd that, in a nation which cherishes free speech, so many of those who disagree with articles feel the need to report an author to a regulator rather than write in and argue their own case. The Spectator is proud to abide by [Ipso’s] editors’ code: every fact has to be correct. But there is no such thing as a ‘correct’ opinion. Proper science invites challenge and argument, and there have been plenty of both in the pages of The Spectator since 1828.” Williamson said he did contact the Spectator in August to propose a response but got no reply.  Delingpole, who writes for controversial rightwing news site Breitbart, was censured by the Australian Press Council in 2012 after he quoted an anonymous source who compared the windfarm industry to a paedophile ring. He has dubbed greens “eco-nazis” and in another article he ended a long list of people and groups supporting action on climate change by writing: “Truly there just aren’t enough bullets!” Delingpole’s article, published in April 2016, said: “Ocean acidification – the evidence increasingly suggests – is a trivial, misleadingly named, and not remotely worrying phenomenon which has been hyped up beyond all measure for political, ideological and financial reasons.”  It also said: “Why, between 2009 and 2014, did Defra spend a whopping £12.5m on an ocean acidification research programme when the issue could have been resolved, for next to nothing, after a few hours’ basic research?”  Williamson was the scientific coordinator of that research programme and told Ipso that the idea that “marine life has nothing whatsoever to fear from ocean acidification”, as Delingpole claimed, was “contrary to the totality of the peer-reviewed scientific literature on the topic”. But in its ruling, Ipso said the article “made clear that many were concerned by the possible consequences of ocean acidification, and it was not misleading for it to describe the alternative point of view”. Ipso did find the article contained some inaccuracies, such as the details of a chart it referred to, but that these were not significant. “As an individual, Delingpole is entitled to hold such views, even if incorrect,” said Williamson. “But it is irresponsible journalism for such claims to be published without credible supporting evidence.” Prof Paul Pearson, at Cardiff University in the UK, said: “The reality of ocean acidification and its likely long-term effects have been thoroughly documented and extensively published in the world’s most respected scientific journals for many years.” Pearson added: “That is not to say that the body of research is either fully complete or above all criticism – no science is – but the public deserves to know that the work they have funded has by now firmly established that the problem of ocean acidification is undoubtedly real and the consequences for marine life are likely to be very serious unless action is taken fast to cut emissions.” Attacking climate change scepticism, Prof Sam Dupont, at the University of Gothenburg, Sweden, said: “I am a sucker for conspiracy theories but you have to ask yourself what is the most plausible: hundreds of scientists from more than 50 countries working secretly together to promote a false idea, or merchants of doubt with financial and political interests at stake working very hard to undermine the scientific evidence.”"
"China’s chief climate negotiator has attempted to calm fears that Donald Trump’s arrival in the White House will spell disaster for the fight against climate change. Trump, who has dismissed climate change as “bullshit” and a Chinese hoax, will become the first climate sceptic to occupy the highest office in the US when he is sworn in on Friday.   Climate scientists and campaigners have expressed alarm at the impact the presence of so many climate deniers and environmental enemies in Trump’s cabinet could have on efforts to prevent catastrophic and irreversible global warming.  But speaking to the government-run China Daily newspaper, China’s special representative for climate change, Xie Zhenhua, played down such concerns.  Xie reaffirmed Beijing’s “firm attitude” towards fighting global warming and noted that the incoming US president had “softened his tone on whether climate change is real” following his election in November.  In an interview with the New York Times after his shock victory Trump said he had an “open mind” about how he would approach the issue and conceded there was “some connectivity” between global warming and human activity.  Xie, a Communist party veteran who spent more than a decade at the helm of China’s environmental agency, told the China Daily the global momentum behind the push towards a low carbon future was now such that no one person was capable of halting progress.  “Industrial upgrades aiming for more sustainable growth is a global trend … It is not something that can be reversed by a single political leader,” he was quoted as saying. The newspaper said Xie believed “the international community and US citizens will pressure the Trump administration to continue clean energy policies”.  Weeks of tension between Trump’s team and Beijing have sparked fears that collaboration on climate change – one of the few bright spots of US-China relations under Barack Obama – may be at risk. In September 2016 Obama and the Chinese president, Xi Jinping, earned global plaudits when they jointly announced their decision to ratify the Paris climate accord.  Two years earlier, in November 2014, Obama and Xi unveiled a historic secretly negotiated deal to tackle climate change, including China’s first commitment to cap its greenhouse gas emissions.  “This is a major milestone in US-China relations and shows what is possible when we work together on an urgent global challenge,” Obama said at the time.  Xie played down the suggestion that frictions between Trump and Xi might thwart joint efforts by the world’s top two emitters to fight global warming. “Collaboration on climate change has never ceased amid the political tensions,” he said.  Xie was speaking on the eve of a major speech that Xi Jinping is due to deliver at the World Economic Forum (WEF) in Davos on Tuesday.  Environmentalists and some foreign policy experts hope Xi, the first Chinese president to attend the forum, will use part of his opening address to restate Beijing’s determination to fighting climate change amid fears over the future role of the US.  “I think it is absolutely brilliant that he is going to Davos. I think that is a very smart move on his part. I’m in favour of a China that becomes a global leader doing good things and behaving responsibly,” said Susan Shirk, the chair of the 21st Century China Centre at the University of California San Diego, who expects Xi’s speech to touch on China’s climate leadership.  “Frankly if the US is going to abdicate leadership then it is good to have somebody step forwards and defend positions which I can identify with,” Shirk added.  “But let’s remember, China can’t do this stuff alone … [Taking greater leadership on climate] will enhance China’s reputation as a responsible global leader … but it’s not going save the planet. “If the US is pulling in the opposite direction, we are not going to be able to make the progress on climate change the way we should, or could, if we were working together.”"
"The world must not allow the Paris climate deal to be “derailed” or continue to inflict irreparable damage on the environment, Chinese president Xi Jinping has said, amid fears the rise of Donald Trump could strike a body blow to the fight against global warming. Trump, who will be sworn in as the 45th president of the United States on Friday, has threatened to pull out of the historic Paris agreement and dismissed climate change as a Chinese “hoax” and “expensive… bullshit”.  But in an address to the United Nations in Geneva on Wednesday, which observers saw as a high-profile bid to bolster China’s image as a reliable and dedicated climate leader, Xi issued a direct challenge to those views, warning “there is only one Earth in the universe and we mankind have only one homeland”.  “The Paris agreement is a milestone in the history of climate governance. We must ensure this endeavor is not derailed,” the Communist party leader said.  “All parties should work together to implement the Paris agreement. China will continue to take steps to tackle climate change and fully honor its obligations,” Xi added, according to a transcript published by Xinhua, China’s official news agency. Just a few months ago, climate campaigners hailed a major breakthrough in efforts to tackle global warming when Barack Obama and Xi jointly announced that their countries, the world’s top two emitters of greenhouse gases, would ratify the Paris accord.  “We have a saying in America that you need to put your money where your mouth is,” Obama said at the time. “And when it comes to combating climate change that is what we are doing … we are leading by example.” Signatories of the deal, which came into force in November last year, agreed to keep global warming to no more than 2C above pre-industrial levels.  However, Trump’s shock election – and the presence of so many climate sceptics in his administration – has thrown the US’ commitment to such goals into doubt.  The Guardian has interviewed more than a dozen leading global voices on climate change in the run-up to 24 hours of live, uninterrupted digital coverage running from Thursday through to Trump’s inauguration on Friday. Reporters have investigated countless examples of climate change utterly transforming lives and livelihoods, from Bangladesh to Egypt, west Africa to the south Pacific, even Europe and the United States itself, despite Trump’s repeated claims that it is a hoax.  In his Geneva speech Xi reaffirmed Beijing’s pledges to slash its emissions and sought to position China, which remains the world’s top polluter, as a global pacesetter on climate change and sustainable development.  “We should make our world clean and beautiful by pursuing green and low-carbon development,” he told his audience.  “Man coexists with nature, which means that any harm to nature will eventually come back to haunt man. We hardly notice natural resources such as air, water, soil and blue sky when we have them. But we won’t be able to survive without them.”  “Industrialisation has created material wealth never seen before, but it has also inflicted irreparable damage to the environment,” Xi went on. “We must not exhaust all the resources passed on to us by previous generations and leave nothing to our children or pursue development in a destructive way. Clear waters and green mountains are as good as mountains of gold and silver. We must maintain harmony between man and nature and pursue sustainable development.” Li Shuo, Greenpeace’s China climate policy adviser, described Xi’s speech as “a very important political signal … especially in the context of the incoming US administration”. The activist said he believed Xi’s call to arms on the climate was designed to pressure Trump’s White House into sticking to his predecessor’s commitments while simultaneously highlighting China’s role as a responsible climate leader.  “It is a calculated move… it is their first move on the chess board and I expect further moves if they are needed at a later stage,” said Li.  “China has a very important and a very special role in keeping the US on course and we would very much like to see them use their leverage on that,” he added.  Zhang Haibin, an expert in environmental diplomacy from Peking University’s school of international studies, said Xi’s speech was a response to the global “uncertainties and concerns” that Trump’s election had thrown up, including over climate change.  The president’s words “sent a strong signal to the world” about China’s determination to tackle global warming.  Zhang said Beijing would stick to its climate commitments since it understood the importance of cutting deadly air pollution but argued China would not want to serve as the world’s “sole leader” on climate change.  “We regard ourselves as a developing country and, in addition to that, we’ve got pollution issues and are facing an economic slowdown at home,” he said.

"Scotland is seeking to dramatically cut its reliance on fossil fuels for cars, energy and homes after setting a radical target to cut total climate emissions by 66% within 15 years. In one of the world’s most ambitious climate strategies, ministers in Edinburgh have unveiled far tougher targets to increase the use of ultra-low-carbon cars, green electricity and green home heating by 2032.   The Scottish government has set the far higher target after its original goal of cutting Scotland’s emissions by 42% by 2020 was met six years early – partly because climate change has seen winters which are warmer than normal, cutting emissions for home heating. The new strategy, which is expected to cost up to £3bn a year to implement and is closely linked to a new renewable energy programme due to be published this month, will call for: • 40% of all new cars and vans sold in Scotland to be ultra-low-emission by 2032, with 50% of Scotland’s buses to be low-carbon. • A totally carbon-free electricity sector based entirely on renewable energy sources by 2032, when Scotland’s last nuclear power station will close. • Four out of five of Scotland’s 2m homes to be heated using low-carbon technologies. • The repairing of 250,000 hectares of degraded peatlands, which store a total of 1.7 gigatonnes of CO2 in Scotland. • At least 30% of Scotland’s vital publicly owned ferry fleet to be low-carbon, powered by hybrid engines. Enriched by a vast £727bn sovereign wealth fund built up from its North Sea oil and gas industries, Norway has set Europe’s most ambitious emissions reduction target so far, committing itself to become carbon neutral by 2030 – two decades earlier than planned.  But that target, a cut equal to 53m tonnes of carbon equivalent, will rely very heavily on carbon trading: paying other countries to cut their emissions more deeply or buying carbon credits from industries which are cutting emissions. Scotland’s 66% target, on the other hand, will be based on real-terms cuts in domestic emissions, although ministers admit there are serious policy and financial challenges raised by the UK’s decision to quit the EU. Nor does the strategy include Scotland’s substantial offshore oil and gas industry, or its oil exports, only covering onshore emissions.  The Scottish environment secretary, Roseanna Cunningham, told MSPs at Holyrood on Thursday that the proposals “represent a new level of ambition which will help maintain Scotland’s reputation as a climate leader within the international community”. But Cunningham said that Scottish businesses, homeowners and commuters – whom ministers privately see as too reluctant to change their behaviour – now had to take a far greater share of the burden.  Until now, a large proportion of Scotland’s decline in CO2 emissions has been driven by the sharp shift to renewable energy from windfarms, an EU-wide move away from coal-powered energy, EU emissions trading and worldwide technical advances, particularly on car engine efficiency. Scottish drivers will now be asked to quickly start taking up electrically powered or hybrid cars; homeowners will be encouraged to strip out gas-fired boilers at home and improve insulation; farmers will be asked to cut the methane and nitrogen climate gases, and Network Rail will be paid to electrify 35% of Scotland’s rail network. Richard Dixon, chief executive of Friends of the Earth Scotland, said he applauded the government’s ambition, but it still overlooked substantial issues, particularly an economic strategy wedded to roads and aviation. The Scottish government wants to abolish air passenger duty to increase flying in a bid to stimulate growth. “It paints a very good vision of what a low-carbon Scotland could look like in 2032,” he said. “But there are clearly areas where there has been resistance and policies either aren’t going far enough or aren’t credible.” Ministers should put far greater stress on forcing motorists out of their cars and on to far more energy-efficient public transport or bicycles, Dixon said. Farmers should be forced to accept compulsory testing for overuse of climate-damaging fertilisers. There had to be far tougher standards on home energy efficiency.  The 2032 target will include legally binding annual targets first agreed by the Scottish parliament in 2009. Officials estimate that hitting that goal will cost annually about 2% of Scotland’s GDP, which is worth about £147bn a year.  More offshore windfarms and marine energy plants will be needed, as will hundreds of thousands of electrical car charging points, alongside the cost of more than 1m new home heating systems.  But ministers believe that improving air quality, cutting fuel poverty, increasing home insulation, and reducing road accidents through less use of cars will save public money by cutting NHS spending and early deaths, as well as boosting economic output. They worry about the impact the UK’s departure from the EU will have on continuing pan-European funding and investment in the low-carbon economy, and the EU emissions trading regime, which plays a large part in reducing emissions. The current EU emissions targets are a 40% cut by 2030, while the UK government’s goal is to cut emissions by 50% by 2025, with an 80% target set for 2050.  Officials have previously acknowledged that policies and industries under the Scottish government’s control cover about 30% of Scotland’s overall emissions; the remainder is influenced or controlled at UK and EU level, and international industries.

"Barack Obama called the adoption of clean energy in the US “irreversible” on Monday, putting pressure on his successor, Donald Trump, not to back away from a core strategy to fight climate change. Obama, penning an opinion article in the journal Science, sought to frame the argument in a way that might appeal to the president-elect: in economic terms. He said the fact that the cost and polluting power of energy had dropped at the same time proved that fighting climate change and spurring economic growth were not mutually exclusive.  “Despite the policy uncertainty that we face, I remain convinced that no country is better suited to confront the climate challenge and reap the economic benefits of a low-carbon future than the United States,” Obama wrote. He peppered his article with subtle references to Trump, noting that the debate about future climate policy was “very much on display during the current presidential transition”. As he prepares to transfer power to Trump, Obama has turned to an unusual format to make his case to Trump to preserve his policies: academic journals. In the last week, Obama also published articles under his name in the Harvard Law Review about his efforts on criminal justice reform and in the New England Journal of Medicine defending his healthcare law, which Republicans are poised to repeal. The articles reflect an effort by Obama to pre-empt the arguments Trump or Republicans are likely to employ as they work to roll back Obama’s key accomplishments in the coming years. Yet it is unclear whether Trump or the GOP could be swayed by scholarly arguments in relatively obscure publications. In Science, Obama argued that as the cost of clean energy sources like solar and wind drop, businesses are independently coming to the conclusion that it makes financial sense to wean themselves off coal and other dirtier fuels. He also said that if Trump pulls out of the global emissions-cutting deal struck in Paris that Obama helped broker, the US would “lose its seat at the table” on global climate policy. Obama said a key advantage of the US political system is that each president determines his or her own policies. “President-elect Donald Trump will have the opportunity to do so,” Obama wrote. “The latest science and economics provide a helpful guide for what the future may bring.” Meanwhile, the outgoing secretary of state, John Kerry, told students at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology that work to combat problems caused by climate change “should not be a partisan issue” on Monday, in one of his final speeches as the top US diplomat.  Kerry noted that military officials, intelligence leaders and mayors of coastal US cities agree that the problem of rising sea levels and erratic rainfall requires action, and urged Trump’s incoming administration to tackle such concerns head on.  Trump has described climate change as a hoax and promised to pull the US out of the deal negotiated in Paris in 2015 to cut global greenhouse gas emissions. In an interview with the New York Times in November, though, he said he was keeping an open mind on whether to pull out of the accord.  “I’m not going to speculate about the policies that our president-elect and his secretary of state will choose to pursue,” Kerry said. Trump’s nominated successor to Kerry is Rex Tillerson, chief executive of the multinational oil giant ExxonMobil. “But I will tell you this … some issues look a lot different when you’re actually in office compared to when you’re on the campaign trail.  “The truth is that climate change shouldn’t be a partisan issue. It’s an issue that all of us should care about, regardless of political affiliation.”  The Senate is due this week to begin the process of confirming Trump’s appointments, including proposed Environmental Protection Agency chief Scott Pruitt, the attorney general of Oklahoma who has repeatedly challenged the agency’s authority in the courts.  Many Republicans in Congress argue environmental regulations slow business growth and job creation, top priorities for the Trump administration.  Kerry referenced a US intelligence report published on Monday that listed climate change among the factors that could raise the risk of conflict between nations. Kerry called on researchers and students at MIT to keep up their work on improving energy efficiency and inventing new energy sources, regardless of government policies.  “It’s going to be innovators, researchers, entrepreneurs, and business leaders … who will continue to create the technological advances that forever revolutionize the way we power our world,” he said.  “Every person in this room – indeed, every person on the planet – has an interest in making sure that transition happens as quickly as possible.” The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration announced on Monday that 2016 was the second hottest year in the US."
"Scientists have discovered the world’s largest tropical peatland in the remote Congo swamps, estimated to store the equivalent of three year’s worth of the world’s total fossil fuel emissions. Researchers mapped the Cuvette Centrale peatlands in the central Congo basin and found they cover 145,500 sq km – an area larger than England. The swamps could lock in 30bn tonnes of carbon that was previously not known to exist, making the region one of the most carbon-rich ecosystems on Earth.   The UK-Congolese research team, co-led by Prof Simon Lewis and Dr Greta Dargie, from the University of Leeds and University College London, first discovered the swamps five years ago. Their research, published in Nature on Wednesday, combined three year’s worth of peat analysis with satellite data to estimate that the Congo basin peatlands store the equivalent of nearly 30% of the world’s tropical peatland carbon. Lewis said: “Our research shows that the peat in the central Congo basin covers a colossal amount of land. It is 16 times larger than the previous estimate and is the single largest peatland complex found anywhere in the tropics.  “We have also found 30bn tonnes of carbon that nobody knew existed. The peat covers only 4% of the whole Congo basin, but stores the same amount of carbon below ground as that stored above ground in the trees covering the other 96%. “These peatlands hold nearly 30% of the world’s tropical peatland carbon, that’s about 20 years’ of the fossil fuel emissions of the United States of America.” Peat is an organic wetland soil made from part-decomposed plant debris, more commonly found in cool environments, such as northern Russia, Europe and Canada. Healthy peatlands act as carbon sinks, removing carbon from the atmosphere through plant growth. Further decomposition of the peat is prevented by its waterlogged environment, locking up carbon. Year-round waterlogging is needed for peat to form in the tropics. If peatlands dry out, either through changes in land use such as drainage for agriculture or reduced rainfall, further decomposition resumes, releasing carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. Lewis said: “Peatlands are only a resource in the fight against climate change when are left intact, and so maintaining large stores of carbon in undisturbed peatlands should be a priority. Our new results show that carbon has been building up in the Congo basin’s peat for nearly 11,000 years. “If the Congo basin peatland complex was to be destroyed, this would release billions of tonnes of carbon dioxide into our atmosphere.” Because of their remote location, the peatlands in the Congo basin are relatively undisturbed, but because they are so newly discovered, they are not protected by conservation plans. They could face threats from drainage for agricultural plantations, particularly for palm oil, as is happening in Indonesia. The study places the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) and the Republic of Congo (RoC) as the second and third most important countries in the world for tropical peat carbon stocks. In first place is Indonesia, that contains tropical peatlands across the islands of Borneo, Sumatra and New Guinea. However, the islands have suffered damage or loss to about 94,000 km2 of peatland over recent decades, primarily due to forest fires or drainage for agricultural use. The peat may also be vulnerable to the effects of climate change – increased evaporation due to rising temperatures or reduced rainfall could cause it to dry out and begin to release its carbon to the atmosphere. The study’s co-author Dr Ifo Suspense, from the Université Marien Ngouabi in the RoC capital Brazzaville, said: “The discovery of the Cuvette Centrale peatlands could have a large impact on the climate and conservation policies of the Congo. The maintenance and protection of this peatland complex, alongside protecting our forests, could be central Africa’s great contribution to the global climate change problem. “It is of the utmost importance that governments, conservation and scientific communities work with the people of the Cuvette Centrale to improve local livelihoods without compromising the integrity of this globally significant region of Earth.” In addition to their status as a globally important region for carbon storage, the Congo basin swamps are refuges for endangered species including lowland gorillas and forest elephants. Dr Emma Stokes, director of the central Africa program of the Wildlife Conservation Society said: “This research highlights the immense significance of these swamp forests for the stability of our climate. However, these forests, in the geographical heart of Africa, are also a vital refuge for many thousands of great apes, elephants and other large forest mammals that are threatened by developments in the surrounding landscape.  “The RoC government is considering the expansion of Lac Télé community reserve, a move that could safeguard an additional 50,000 sq km of swamp forest – much of it overlying peat – from future disturbance. We strongly support this move and commend the RoC government for this initiative. We urge both countries to continue efforts to protect these habitats from industrial transformation.” Dargie said: “With so many of the world’s tropical peatlands under threat from land development and the need to reduce carbon emissions to zero over the coming decades, it is essential that the Congo basin peatlands remain intact.”  She added: “The sheer expanse of these peatlands makes central Africa home to the world’s most extensive peatland complex. It is astonishing that in 2016 discoveries like this can still be made.” • This article was amended on 12 January 2017. The headline on an earlier version referred to the peatland discovered in Congo as the world’s largest."
"A British research station on an ice shelf in Antarctica is being shut down over the southern hemisphere winter because of fears it could float off on an iceberg. The British Antarctic Survey (BAS) said in a statement on Monday that it had decided not to winter at the Halley VI research station on the Brunt ice shelf due to concerns for its staff’s safety amid changes to the ice.  Preparations to relocate the station further inland due to the threat posed by a growing crack in the ice were under way last month, but it was to remain operational. The station will now be shut down between March and November 2017 and the 16 people who were due to stay there over the winter will move out. The BAS said changes to the ice – and particularly the growth of a new crack – presented a “complex glaciological picture” that meant scientists were unable to predict with certainty what would happen to the ice shelf in the forthcoming winter and beyond. Parts of the ice shelf periodically cleave off from the floating ice sheet, creating icebergs. Glaciologists have run computer models and created bathymetric maps to try to determine the likelihood and impact of this happening, but there was “sufficient uncertainty” for concern. The BAS said there was no immediate risk to the people currently at the station or to the station itself, and that staff were being relocated only “as a precautionary measure”. There are 88 people on the station, most of whom are only there for the summer and are due to leave. Staff could be evacuated quickly if the ice were to fracture in the summer months, but not during winter with its 24-hour darkness, extremely low temperatures and frozen sea. Capt Tim Stockings, the director of operations, said in a statement the mission aimed to leave the station ready for reoccupation as soon as possible after the Antarctic winter. “We want to do the right thing for our people. Bringing them home for winter is a prudent precaution given the changes that our glaciologists have seen in the ice shelf in recent months,” he said. The Halley VI station, made up of eight modules built on stilts with giant skis, has been situated on the Brunt ice shelf since 2012 and was designed with a potential move in mind. The relocation is in its final stages, with seven of the eight modules dragged 14 miles (23km) inland and off the shelf away from two cracks in the ice. One had lain dormant for at least 35 years before showing signs of growth in 2012, while the other appeared as recently as October 2016. Glaciologists monitoring their growth have found that the recent changes to the Brunt ice shelf have not been seen before. Stockings said the move had been “going very well” and should be completed on schedule by early March.  Ozone measurements at Halley led to discovery of the Antarctic ozone hole in 1985 and the station is important for monitoring climate change. The BAS said every effort was being made to continue scientific experiments under way there and that options to temporarily redeploy research and technical support teams to other parts of the organisation were being explored."
"Eastern Australia is sweltering in the second heatwave of 2017, setting the stage for what could be the hottest January on record. A cool change that brought sudden relief to coastal Sydney on Wednesday after record morning heat failed to flow through to the city’s western fringe, where midday temperatures topped 43C.  Northern New South Wales and southern Queensland are predicted to bear the brunt of unusually high ongoing temperatures in a repeat of last week’s severe to extreme heatwave conditions. Phil King from the Bureau of Meteorology said the heatwaves were likely driven by warmer sea temperatures combining with the unusual spread of a “reservoir of hot air” that had been building in central Australia over the past several weeks. A cool front blowing in from the coast south of Sydney saw the mercury drop to below 25C before midday after a near-record overnight low of 28C and record readings of 31C at 6am and 36.9C at 9am. But west of Sydney, some 60km from the coast, went on to record some of the highest temperatures in the country, with Camden reaching 43.6C, Penrith 43.5C and Richmond 42.8C. “You can get some incredible differences in temperature, I’ve seen 20C difference from the west to the east [of Sydney],” King said. Sydney commuters mid-morning took to Twitter to complain about a lack of air-conditioning on trains, one posting a picture of a sweat-soaked seat. Asked if the conditions were ripe for the hottest start to a year in recorded history, King said: “I suspect that’s pretty likely but January is only halfway through [and] I’m not confident to say. “But this is the second heatwave [of the summer], it’s likely that parts of Queensland won’t see cooler temperatures and we’re halfway through January with significantly above average maximum and minimum temperatures.”  Hotspots included Grafton on the northern NSW coast, which reached 40C at 2pm. A staffer at the Grafton Olympic pool said while it was “pretty darn hot at the moment” the numbers of patrons through the gates looking to cool off appeared “regulation, for now”.  It was one of only two publicly owned pools in the town, the other being “on the southside – but it’s heated”, she said. Moree in NSW was forecast by Weatherzone to remain above 40C until early evening, while Mungindi on the NSW-Queensland border was on track to hit a maximum of 42C, hitting 40C at 1pm. Cathy North, co-owner of Mungindi’s Two Mile Hotel, said the air-conditioned pub was unlikely to offer any respite to most locals until after 5pm when they finished work. “It’s mainly cotton and grain out this way so there’s a lot of outdoor work,” she said. “[But] they say [42C] is not unusual for out this way.” Maximum temperatures in most of south-east Queensland were below 40C but the region is predicted to have no break from unusually warm nights and stifling, humid, hot days into the weekend.  Gatton, 90km west of Brisbane, reached 39C on Wednesday. Some on Twitter poked fun at a “urine chart” advocated by emergency services and health authorities that gives guidance on dehydration levels according to urine colour. But a death last week underlined warnings by the BoM and health authorities that even fit, healthy adults are at risk of heat-related illness in a heatwave. A Brisbane man, Matthew Hall, 30, died of heatstroke last Friday while dirt bike riding in the Beerburrum state forest on the Sunshine Coast. His body temperature reportedly climbed to 42C, which caused organ failure. Amid the soaring heat and dry, gusty conditions, bushfire warnings were current in NSW and the Australian Capital Territory after a large blaze destroyed a home and scorched more than 2,500 hectares of bushland near Canberra on Tuesday.  Also on Tuesday, a fire burned across 51ha in northern South Australia, coming close to a windfarm near Waterloo. The BoM warned of extreme fire danger across the southern ranges of NSW and severe fire danger in greater Sydney, Illawarra/Shoalhaven, the central ranges and the southern slopes.  King said one driver of the heatwave conditions was the accumulation of heat in Australia’s interior from sinking air caused by persistent high pressure systems. North-westerly winds were pushing this reservoir of heat into eastern coastal areas.  “Every time the wind goes round to the north we drag down that hot air into other areas,” King said. “The other driver of the heat, which is why the climate outlook is suggesting that this will continue, is the warm water surrounding Australia.” King said the southern states, despite one-off spikes such as 44C in Victoria’s Swan Hill on Tuesday, were being spared the heatwave conditions because of the path high-pressure fronts in the Tasman Sea were taking. Adelaide reached 26C on Wednesday after a high of 41.1C the day before. Meanwhile, Western Australia and the Northern Territory were seeing prolonged below-average temperatures and above-average rainfall because of active monsoon conditions, King said. Those lower temperatures from rainfall in Australia’s north-west would push into NSW from Friday “but not inland Queensland and northern South Australia, so that reservoir of heat will stay there”, he said. Overnight minimum temperatures were a critical factor on the impact of heatwaves. “If the overnight minimum is high, it’s much harder to recover, cool down, it’s harder to sleep,” he said. “If you get one hot day and you don’t recover overnight and you get another hot day, I’ve seen [academic] papers that say the impact over the second and third day is compounding.” The BoM’s measure of a heatwave compares a three-day forecast with average temperatures over the previous 30 days. Severe to extreme heatwaves feature maximum temperatures of 6C to 10C above the average and minimums of 8C to 12C above the average. Severe heatwaves can impact the health of elderly people, young children, pregnant women and the ill, while extreme heatwaves have effects on infrastructure, such as railway lines buckling or high demand on electricity networks."
"Barack Obama has heeded calls to help secure the future of the historic Paris agreement by transferring a second $500m instalment to the Green Climate Fund, just three days before he leaves office. The fund was a key aspect of the Paris agreement signed in 2015, which aims to keep global warming “well below” 2C and aspires to keep warming to 1.5C.  Established in 2010, it is financed by wealthy countries and used to assist developing countries with adaptation and mitigation. It was widely seen as a key measure to bring both rich and poor countries to the negotiating table. The US committed to transferring $3bn to the fund. The new instalment leaves $2bn owing, with the incoming president, Donald Trump, expected to cease any further payments. The move followed a large campaign, with more than 100 organisations and nearly 100,000 people calling for Obama to transfer the full $2.5bn owed to the fund. “The Obama administration is refusing to let president-elect Trump’s posse of oil barons and climate deniers dictate how the world responds to the climate crisis,” said Tamar Lawrence-Samuel, of Corporate Accountability International, which led the campaign. “Tens of thousands of people around the world called on President Obama to step up before Trump takes the keys of our government and tries to reverse decades of climate progress,” she said. “This victory is the climate justice movement’s opening salvo to the Trump presidency. And we’re not going away.” The money is being drawn from the state department, the same way that the first transfer was, allowing it to be done using executive powers without congressional support."
"Sea surface temperatures today are strikingly similar to those during the last interglacial period, when sea levels were six to nine metres above their present height, according to research. The findings provide compelling evidence that Greenland and Antarctica’s continental ice sheets are highly sensitive to slight increases in ocean temperatures, and raise the prospect of sea levels continuing to rise for many centuries.  Previous research had shown that sea levels rose by several metres during the last interglacial (LIG), between 129,000 to 116,000 years ago, but until now the picture of how sea temperatures had varied over the same period had remained patchy. The latest research, based on marine sediment core records from 83 sites, concludes that sea temperatures towards the end of the LIG were comparable to those seen today. Rob DeConto, a climate scientist at the University of Massachusetts, Amherst, who was not involved in the research said: “This tells us that the big ice sheets are really sensitive to just a little bit of warming. That’s a really powerful message.” During the LIG, the Earth’s climate warmed due to a shift in the tilt of the planet, which led to average temperatures around 2C warmer than today. The hippopotamus was found as far north as the river Thames and forests reached well into the Arctic Circle. Scientists view the period as an important reference for how the Earth’s oceans and atmosphere might respond to the current warming trend in the future.  The study, published in the journal Science, compared records from 83 marine sediment core sites to data from 1870-1889 (pre-industrial times) and 1995-2014. Records of both the local surface temperatures and global sea levels are locked into the layers of sediment. Surface-feeding plankton act as natural thermometers as the ratio of magnesium to calcium accumulated in their shells depends on the water temperature. Another plankton species acts as a gauge for the extent of continental ice shelves. The ratio of two different forms of oxygen (O16 and O18) is different in continental ice sheets and seawater, so by tracking these ratios in the plankton, scientists can work out how much ice there was at a given point in time.  The analysis found that, at the onset of the LIG 129,000 years ago, the global ocean sea surface temperatures were similar to the 1870-1889 average. By 125,000 years ago, these had increased by 0.5C, reaching a temperature indistinguishable from the 1995-2014 average. Sea levels respond directly to global temperatures, both through the melting of ice shelves and through the expansion of water as it warms. However, the process happens slowly, so the full extent of sea level rises may only become apparent hundreds or thousands of years into the future. Professor Andrew Watson, a climate scientist at the University of Exeter, said: “The good news is that with luck it will continue to rise slowly, so that we have time to adapt, but the bad news is that eventually all our present coastal city locations will be inundated.” A crucial unknown is the rate at which the ice sheets will melt in the future, and the latest findings do not have a direct bearing on this question, according to Jeremy Hoffman, a climate scientist at the Science Museum of Virginia and the paper’s lead author. During the LIG, warming occurred over more than 10,000 years, meaning that changes to the global ice sheets could happen in parallel. The current warming trend has occurred over decades, and it is not clear how far behind the melting of ice will lag. The UN estimates that global sea levels will rise between 13cm and 68cm by 2050 and a high profile paper by DeConto’s group last year predicted a two metre rise by the end of the century. Louise Sime, head of palaeoclimate research at the British Antarctic Survey, said: “The rates of ice sheet loss are really difficult to predict. Estimates are anything from 200 to 7,000 years.” The Science paper also highlights apparent deficits in most climate models, which fail to replicate the warming of the oceans seen in the sediment cores when they are applied to this period. “This refined picture really clearly identifies that the modelling experiments do not create enough warming during the last interglacial,” said Hoffman.  One explanation is that the models are underestimating feedback mechanisms in the Earth’s system, such as the reduction of sunlight that is reflected back as ice melts, leading to an underestimation of how quickly ocean temperatures ramp up. “We think there might be some process missing that we’re just not capturing,” said Hoffman. “If we’re missing something from this period of the Earth’s history, what might we be missing from future projections?”"
"Scientists have proven time and time again that global warming continues unabated. Most recently, a study published last week showed that over the past two decades, the oceans have warmed faster than prior estimates. This study affirmed the findings of a 2015 NOAA paper – not surprisingly attacked by deniers – that removed a cool bias in the data, finding there never was a global warming “pause.” This particular myth has been a favorite of deniers over the past decade for one simple reason – if people can be convinced that global warming stopped, they won’t consider it a threat that we need to urgently address by cutting fossil fuel consumption. It’s thus become one of the most common myths peddled by carbon polluters and their allies.  One of those allies is the anti-climate policy advocacy group Global Warming Policy Foundation (GWPF), which tries to make the case that aggressive climate policy isn’t needed. This weekend, its “science” editor David Whitehouse wrote for the conservative UK Spectator periodical – which often promotes climate denial – denying that the “pause” is dead: their case rests on the El Nino temperature increase and will be destroyed when the El Nino subsides, as it is currently doing. A temporary victory over the ‘pause’.  The ‘pause’ can be accommodated into global warming – but not for very much longer. The world’s temperature has to increase outside the El Nino effect. If Whitehouse is correct and temperatures are not increasing outside the El Niño effect, then 2015 and 2016 should be no hotter than previous El Niño years. It’s a relatively simple test to run. In the video below, I’ve broken out the temperature data into years with an El Niño warming influence, years with a La Niña cooling influence, and neutral years. Whitehouse’s argument immediately crumbles. Among just El Niño years over the past five decades, there’s a 0.18°C per decade warming trend. Among La Niña years it’s also 0.18°C per decade, and among neutral years it’s 0.16°C per decade. And recent years aren’t falling below the long-term trend lines. In fact, 2016 is well above the El Niño trend line, as was 1998, because both saw particularly strong El Niño events. However, 2016 was 0.35°C hotter than 1998. How is it that the “pause” supposedly started in 1998, any subsequent warming is supposedly due to El Niño, and yet 2016 was 0.35°C hotter than 1998? The answer is that global warming has continued unabated over the past 18 years. There are of course natural temperature influences superimposed on top of that human-caused warming trend. It just so happens that 2008, 2009, 2011, and 2012 were all influenced by La Niña cooling, which along with some other factors, acted to temporarily dampen the warming.  But those La Niña years were about 0.2°C warmer than the La Niña years around the turn of the century. That’s because human-caused global warming has continued to push temperatures higher, despite cherry picked arguments to the contrary. Whitehouse’s argument also falls apart because scientists debunked the faux pause myth before the El Niño of 2015–2016. For example, in the summer of 2015, Grant Foster and John Abraham published a paper showing that there was no statistical evidence of a pause: A barrage of statistical tests was applied to global surface temperature time series to search for evidence of any significant departure from a linear increase at constant rate since 1970. In every case, the analysis not only failed to establish a trend change with statistical significance, it failed by a wide margin. A few months later, a study by Stephen Lewandowsky, James Risbey, and Naomi Oreskes showed that not only did the myth lack statistical support, but in a blind test, economists found “pause” claims “misleading and ill-informed.” In fact, by late 2015, at least six papers had been published debunking this myth. The record-shattering hot temperatures of 2015 and 2016 were simply more nails in its coffin. It’s a coffin with so many nails it’s hard to find room for more. It’s difficult to fathom why deniers don’t just move on to peddling other less transparent climate myths, but the sad reality is that these myths are like zombies. They never die. Just last week I suggested that deniers will soon reset the myth to “no warming since 2016,” but apparently I gave them too much credit. They won’t even admit the fact that human-caused global warming raised the Earth’s surface temperature 0.35°C since 1998. But as I keep repeating, facts matter, and people who continue to deny reality in the face of evidence and facts should no longer be considered credible. If the GWPF and Spectator keep peddling such obvious falsehoods, they should simply be ignored."
"Global warming obviously refers to temperature increases across the entire globe. We know the Earth is warming, we know it is human-caused, we have a pretty good idea about how much the warming will be in the future and what some of the consequences are. In fact, when it comes to the Earth’s average climate, scientists have a pretty good understanding. On the other hand, no one lives in the average climate. We live spread out north, west, east, and south. On islands, large continents, inland or in coastal regions. Many of us want to know what’s going to happen to the climate where we live. How will my life be affected in the future?   This type of question is answered in a very recent study published by scientists from the University of Massachusetts at Amherst. The team, which includes Dr. Raymond Bradley and researcher Dr. Ambarish Karmalkar looked specifically at the Northeastern United States. They found that this area will warm much more rapidly than the globe as a whole. In fact, it will warm faster than any other United States region. The authors expect the Northeast US will warm 50% faster than the planet as a whole. They also find that the United States will reach a 2 degree Celsius warming 10–20 years before the globe as a whole. So why does this matter? Well first, it matters because some of the effects people will experience are directly tied to the temperature increase in their region. For instance, we know that warmer air leads to more intense precipitation. In fact, we are already observing increases in very heavy rainfall across the United States (especially in the Northeast). Based on this new research, that trend will only get worse. It means that winters in this region will get warmer and wetter – more winter precipitation will likely occur as rain rather than snow. This affects the availability of water into the spring months. It also means that summers will have more intense heat waves which will lead to more severe droughts. However, there is another impact to this study. We often hear that it is important to avoid increasing the Earth’s temperature by 2°C if we want to prevent the worst risks of climate change. This 2-degree target is somewhat based on science and somewhat based on messaging and politics. There’s nothing magic about this number. It isn’t like everything will be fine so long as we stay below 2 degrees; similarly the world won’t end if we exceed 2 degrees.  It turns out that staying below a 2°C warming means we think we have a reasonable chance of avoiding some of the worst climate impacts and some of the potentially disastrous tipping points. But this is really just an educated guess. Some people have argued convincingly that our target should be lower, perhaps 1.5°C. Others argue that even 2°C is not achievable.  Regardless of the so-called temperature target, what this study shows is that even if we do keep the globe as a whole to a 2°C temperature increase, some regions, like the Northeast United States will far exceed this threshold. So, what is “safe” for the world is unsafe for certain regions.  Not to muddy the waters, but the whole issue of “safe” versus “unsafe” also depends on what climate effects we are concerned about and where we live. As an example, if you are concerned about heavy precipitation and flooding in your area, then local climate change (in your area) is pretty important to you. Conversely, if you are concerned about sea level rise (which is a global phenomenon), then the global temperature change is of most interest.  So really, what this latest paper does is provide sound evidence that we need to keep in mind BOTH the global and the regional climate effects. We need to think about which effects we care about most and how the global and regional temperature changes will cause those effects. Furthermore, we cannot simply be lulled into a sense of safety even if we reduce emissions dramatically and keep global temperature changes small. There still could be large effects in our neighborhood."

"Donald Trump’s nominee for secretary of interior, Ryan Zinke, distanced himself from the president-elect on Tuesday, saying “the climate is changing. The debate is what is that influence and what can we do”. Zinke, a two-term congressman for Montana, had been asked by Bernie Sanders about Trump’s infamous 2012 tweet where the real estate developer described climate change as “created by and for the Chinese in order to make US manufacturing non-competitive”.  Zinke, a former navy Seal, responded by stating matter of factly, “I don’t believe it’s a hoax.”  The statement came in a hearing on his nomination held by the Senate energy and natural resources committee on Tuesday. However, the Trump cabinet nominee insisted he wasn’t “a climate science expert” and stated his belief in “being prudent” towards what he characterized as “a lot of debate on both sides of the aisle”. Zinke also differed from many in his own party by insisting: “I’m absolutely against transfer or sale of public lands.” Many Republicans have long pushed for the federal government to transfer ownership of public lands to the states, and this was included as a plank in the party’s platform. However, the Montana Republican still made clear his support for fossil fuel drilling on federal lands, saying “We have to have an economy.” Zinke is expected to sail through the Senate with bipartisan support. He was introduced by both of his state’s senators, Democrat Jon Tester and Republican Steve Daines, before the hearing on Tuesday. Zinke had long been considered the strongest general election opponent to Tester in 2018 but his appointment likely prevents him from seeking a Senate bid and boosts Democratic chances of holding onto Tester’s seat in the midterms."
"This was the year when voters around the world declined, en masse, to be polite. Britons Brexited, in the United States Donald Trump sailed like a battleship into the White House while the world quivered and, in Australia, Malcolm Turnbull almost lost the federal election that was supposed to deliver him personal vindication and an emphatic mandate to govern. It was the year of disruption and disaffection, and Australia’s major parties struggled to define and articulate the new normal, as truthiness reigned and populist and protectionist insurgencies loomed like rising and relentless tides, lapping the fortified parliamentary precinct in Canberra.  The prelude to Australia’s interminable winter election was a jumble of prime ministerial miscalculations. A GST debate was invoked, then dumped. Turnbull wondered out loud in a park in Penrith whether the states might raise income taxes – whimsy with the potential to radically reshape the federation – before crashing his own thought bubble. The Senate voting rules were overhauled to clear out the non-cooperative upper house and a double dissolution promptly called, which only encouraged the public to vote 1 “feral”. Pauline Hanson returned triumphantly to the federal scene after a long absence, with a small One Nation Senate posse of permanently irritated outsiders. South Australia delivered its own upset, sending Nick Xenophon back to Canberra with two extra senators and a lower-house MP – in the process, writing a new chapter in the state’s history of hosting political schisms within Australian centre-right politics. Voters were mulish. Just after the election, they told researchers at the Australian National University they no longer trusted governments to act in the interests of people. Only 26% said they had trust in government – the lowest figure recorded in the Australian Election Study since 1969. Two in five professed dissatisfaction with democracy in Australia, the lowest ebb since the period in the 1970s after the dismissal of Gough Whitlam. And the campaign itself – eight weeks of sloganeering and slog – gave voters little incentive to resist their creeping inclination to send Canberra a message. The government was whacked and Turnbull’s profound shock at his near-death experience rang out on election night when he hectored and lectured the voters – they just needed to mind their manners, take their lumps and understand the government’s roadmap for the future was the first, best and last offer. “The circumstances of Australia cannot be changed by a lying campaign from the Labor party,” Turnbull thundered to supporters, who had waited until after midnight for the prime minister to appear. “The challenges, the fact that we live in times of rapid economic change, of enormous opportunity, enormous challenges, a time when we need to be innovative, when we need to be competitive, when we need to be able to seize those opportunities – those times are there.” Turnbull’s display of unchecked defiance on election night was something of a last hurrah for a prime minister who has been forced by events and the sum of his political circumstances to bargain for survival: his own, and that of the government. The prime minister can claim an election win as an achievement in a political year littered with spectacular upsets. In politics, a win is a win. But all Turnbull’s victories in contemporary times seem to come at considerable cost. He bowed his head to wrest the leadership from Tony Abbott in late 2015, resolving to lead in a way that would try to placate the government’s roiling conservatives and bind the disparate groupings of the government together. The crash-through-or-crash Malcolm of old – the one voters warmed to – was consigned to history. The instinct was Howardesque – John Howard always extolled the virtues of managing the Liberal party’s “broad church” by calibrating the interests of moderates and conservatives, a bit like tuning a temperamental instrument – but Howard had the internal clout to insist on collegiality, predicated on the notion that, at the cabinet table, it was the boss in the prime ministerial suite who was first among equals. The check on Turnbull’s authority was obvious from the outset, but the election was supposed to reset the balance. Turnbull’s failure to win the emphatic majority he sought has forced the prime minister to continue the cycle of internal appeasement, which keeps the government on task and inching forward but has damaged his connection with the voting public. The public, and his popularity, was always Turnbull’s faction in conservative politics. He’s a man without a base in a party that has become tribal and hostile to outsiders. But, over the course of 2016, the public deserted the people’s prime minister. Turnbull’s standing as measured in Newspoll’s better prime minister rating plunged 18 points over the course of 2016. An Essential poll published at the close of 2016 showed his approval rating at its lowest level since assuming the prime ministership. In that poll, published in mid-December, 46% of voters disapproved of Turnbull, compared with 34% of people who approved of his performance. Abbott remains defiantly in the parliament and continues to spoil. He has largely annoyed colleagues with his theatrics rather than fashioning any convincing case for his return, but the pattern of disruption damages the government. It underscores the fact that everything is permeable and contestable, when voters have had a gutful of permeable and contestable. Adding to the atmosphere of permanent contest, the Liberal senator Cory Bernardi continues to contemplate jumping off the government bus to make Australia great again. The rolling contention has distracted from the modest progress of the newly elected Turnbull’s government’s first six months. Much of the progress doesn’t matter to anyone outside the conservative base and the Master Builders Association but the government did emerge from the parliament at the end of the year with a couple of heavily amended legacies from the Abbott era – the restoration of the Australian Building and Construction Commission and a bill regulating registered organisations. Apart from the legacy caseload, there are some achievements Turnbull and the government can call their own. They managed to steer a package of superannuation reforms through parliament – less ambitious than the changes the government had floated at budget time but ones that will make the system fairer. The prime minister also managed to thread a couple of other complicated needles. He ratified the Paris climate agreement, which is an achievement, given that the Coalition remains studded with climate sceptics spoiling for confrontations. He also managed to secure US agreement to take some of the wretched souls indefinitely detained in offshore immigration detention, which is a step change from the moronic and amoral political drumbeat of “stop the boats” – never mind the cost to human rights. But, as seems usual with the government, it is one step forward and one step back. In December Turnbull ruled out policies that would allow Australia to comply with the Paris agreement at least cost to taxpayers and it is not yet clear whether Trump will honour the Obama administration’s undertaking on the refugees. Turnbull will enter 2017 under acute internal and external pressure – pressure to draw a line under a less than compelling 12 months of electioneering and governing, and pressure to articulate what he and his government stand for, which remains, frankly, mysterious. Labor and Bill Shorten have spent the past year trying to maximise the discomfort of the prime minister, while setting out some bold economic policies, such as reducing negative gearing and capital gains tax concessions, and campaigning on the party’s traditional areas of social policy strength – health and education. Shorten got through the midyear election loss without having to face a challenge to his leadership but, behind the scenes in Labor, there has been turbulence. The national left – of which Anthony Albanese is the key figure – came after one of Shorten’s key institutional backers in Victoria’s Kim Carr, and Stephen Conroy, an influential rightwing powerbroker and Shorten supporter, quit politics abruptly, catching colleagues on the hop and creating instability in Shorten’s home state. Internal controversy deepened when Shorten chose to replace Conroy with Kimberley Kitching, a long-time rightwing factional ally but a controversial figure in Labor ranks. The trade union royal commission in 2014 made adverse findings against Kitching and referred her for possible prosecution, and already Labor’s new senator is a target of government attacks in parliament. How these internal tensions play out will be a story to watch in 2017. The Greens are recalibrating after a less than stellar election in which the party lost a senator. Factional tensions were also on display over the course of 2016. The party’s former leader Bob Brown proposed a clean-out of the NSW Greens after the disappointing federal election performance. The Australian economy struggled in 2016. In seasonally adjusted terms, it shrank 0.5% in the September quarter, which was the second-biggest drop in 25 years. Measured on an annual basis, Australia has chalked up the weakest growth we’ve seen since the global financial crisis. Falls in public expenditure, net exports, private investment in new buildings, new engineering and new and used dwellings all detracted significantly from growth in the September quarter. Mining investment fell for the 12th consecutive quarter (down 10.6%), while non-mining investment rose by 4.8% – a metric underscoring the difficult transition the economy is making since the mining boom. Interest rates hit historic lows. Budget reform remained as difficult as budget reform always is. With deficits blowing out, the ratings agencies hovered, eyeing Australia’s AAA rating. In national affairs more broadly defined, abuses in juvenile detention in the Northern Territory prompted a fresh royal commission after the ABC broadcast confronting footage of a teenager Dylan Voller’s treatmentin the Don Dale detention centre; and the Catholic church faced the full glare of a separate royal commission – an inquiry that put George Pell in the hot seat. Guardian Australia published a cache of documents documenting the scale of abuse in immigration detention on Nauru and inquests into the deaths of asylum seekers fuelled further anxiety about the treatment of boat arrivals. The terrible cases of Ms Dhu in South Hedland and Ejijah Doughty in Kalgoorlie kicked along the debate about Indigenous people and law enforcement that has simmered, unresolved, for decades.  The annual Closing the Gap report for 2016 found the infant mortality rate for Indigenous children had dropped drastically but Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders were still more likely to be unemployed and die younger than the rest of the population. Australia debated whether a treaty with Indigenous people or constitutional recognition was the most appropriate way forward to promote reconciliation and justice for the first Australians. The Indigenous leader and activist dubbed the father of reconciliation, Pat Dodson, left Indigenous politics for the federal political arena. Racial issues were threaded throughout 2016. A poll from Essential found that 49% of Australians supported One Nation’s call for a ban on Muslim immigration. The poll found 41% of the sample believed Muslims did not integrate into Australian society. Some people were also worried about the threat of terrorism (27%) and agreed with the proposition “they do not share our values” (22%). A number of Liberal senators and the Australian newspaper launched a concerted campaign to overhaul the Racial Discrimination Act, and the president of the human rights commission, Gillian Triggs, found herself again in the centre of a political storm as a controversial 18C case involving students from QUT became a cause celebre. The lady herself was not for turning. “I believe I could not live with myself if I didn’t use this opportunity to speak up nationally and internationally,” Triggs told a welfare conference in late November. “When my term is up and I’m digging in my garden, hopefully smelling a rose or two, I couldn’t live with any failure on my part to raise the critical human rights of the day – whether it’s the use of steel restraint chairs in juvenile detention centres, the indefinite detention in dangerous conditions of children, indefinite detention of those with cognitive disabilities, the world’s worst levels of detention of Indigenous people and the failure to respond adequately to the deaths of women, children and some men in domestic violence, and of course the growing problem of homelessness.” While Triggs battled political headwinds, another prominent lawyer, Susan Kiefel, was appointed chief justice of the high court – becoming the first woman to lead it. Kiefel, who began her career in the law as a secretary after leaving school at 15, will replace Robert French, who retires from the bench in January. Marriage equality loomed. The government tried and failed to legislate for a plebiscite to determine whether or not the Marriage Act should be amended to allow same-sex marriage, so the debate will now enter a new round in 2017. Advocates will push for a parliamentary vote. As the planet continued to warm, scientific experts and citizens continued to worry about whether climate change would destroy Australian icons such as the Great Barrier Reef. Naomi Klein donned a wetsuit and made the case for climate action. BP dropped plans to drill for oil in the commonwealth marine reserve in the Great Australian Bight but the Adani Group continued to make the case for a giant new coal project in Queensland, helped by two governments – a Labor government in the sunshine state and a federal government in Canberra – who both want to hold off a One Nation insurgency up north. Australians worried about sharks and battled bushfires, and South Australia was plunged into a statewide blackout in September. That event prompted a round of largely unedifying finger pointing among the political class about windfarms and intermittency problems associated with some low-emissions energy technologies – an argument that will continue into 2017. In New South Wales, Mike Baird, a politician voters initially warmed to, found himself in a game of snakes and ladders, under political siege over greyhound racing and Sydney’s lockout laws. The Australian media had an interesting year. Journalists battled to define their role in a post-truth world. Nine Network employees found themselves in seriously hot water in Beirut. The ABC got a new managing director. The jury is still out on Michelle Guthrie, but her opening phase in the Australian media’s toughest job has been bumpy. Smashed avocados became a thing, a totem in the great cultural debate of 2016 – “millennials versus the oldies intent on stealing their future”. Demographer Bernard Salt thought if millennials just stopped going to “hipster cafes”, and eating avo on toast, they too could buy a house – an observation that opened a floodgate of feelings. In sport, Australia, as always, dreamed of a record gold haul in Rio, but the performance, as is often the case, was not so great at the Olympics. Cricket was a bit meh, according to a bunch of people who speak fluent cricket. In the AFL and the NFL, mighty underdogs ruled, as did Tim Cahill on the football pitch. Rounding out 2016 with culture, Crowded House rolled back the years at the Opera House and, in what seemed a tiny pre-Christmas miracle, created the conditions where people used social media to be nice to one another and share happy thought, for a number of hours in succession. Political tragics in Canberra got their own noir fix with the Foxtel series Secret City – and presumably I wasn’t the only person scratching my head on my couch trying to fathom The Kettering Incident – or declaring Sabine was robbed in the latest season of Australia’s Next Top Model. In the world of books, Stan Grant went big, Charlotte Wood’s The Natural Way of Things got the nod from the prize givers, and Helen Garner found $200,000 in her junk mail. It seems appropriate to give the final word on 2016 to Garner, who told the Sydney Morning Herald that when she read an email from someone at Yale University who had “good news” and wanted her phone number, she thought it was a hoax. Only after checking with her publisher and contacting the university was she able to confirm she had, indeed, won the Windham-Campbell prize for writers. “I nearly keeled over,” Garner said. “I’m staggered. I feel thrilled and validated.”"
"It’s been a rollercoaster of a year. In the world of sustainability alone, we saw the landmark Paris climate change agreement come into force; learned how rising temperatures in the Arctic are negatively impacting local residents; and watched as the world’s top conservationists mourned the declining state of Australia’s Great Barrier Reef. And then, a bombshell: a certain “short-fingered vulgarian” won the US presidential race and called into question everything from America’s basic environmental protection to Nasa’s ongoing climate change research. Corporate America took evasive action, signing a letter telling Donald Trump it is serious about sustainability, while others began unpacking Trump’s emphasis on “clean coal” and what it really means for the future of energy in the US.  But it hasn’t all been doom and gloom. While the rest of the world struggled to come to terms with the aforementioned craziness, innovators, scientists and tech heads worked quietly from the sidelines to come up with solutions. And some succeeded: from a trashcan that sucks up ocean garbage to a drone that delivers vaccines to endangered ferrets, here are our top picks for this year’s best sustainable tech. It’s no secret that our oceans are turning into swirling garbage dumps. There are some 5.25tn pieces of floating plastic debris in the oceans right now, and it’s estimated that some 8m metric tons of plastic waste enter global waters every year.  Earlier this year, Peter Ceglinski and Andrew Turton, two surfers from Australia, came up with a device they’re calling the Seabin – a kind of submersible garbage can that captures floating trash. Picture a cylinder, with the upper opening just below the surface of the water. An electric pump draws water through the bottom of the cylinder, creating a vortex around the upper edge that pulls in water and floating trash. A bag filter, made of natural material, collects the trash and allows water to pass through. After raising more than $267,000 in an Indiegogo campaign to help build the device, Ceglinski and Turton are keen to start selling the Seabin to marinas around the world. First stop: Miami, Florida, where Miami Beach’s marinas manager wants to start using the Seabin in 2017 to counter the bags, bottles, paper plates and forks found daily in the water. Earlier this year, British-based tech firm QuantuMDx developed a new, low-cost diagnostic DNA analyzer the size of a smartphone which is being billed as a “handheld lab”. The device – called Q-Poc – can accurately diagnose everything from cancers to infectious diseases in minutes. Although it is currently in alpha testing stage, the company hopes to get the product in the hands of doctors by early 2018. Q-Poc runs on a solar-powered battery and it’s designed to read biological samples submitted via a credit card-size cartridge. It can work with a range of sample types: swabs can be used to detect sexually-transmitted infections, while saliva is used to detect tuberculosis. (Tests for other diseases will be added at a later date.) The device uses mobile technology, enabling the test results to be geo-stamped and shared in real time.  The prospect of a speedy diagnosis at a patient’s side is exciting, particularly in countries where access to medical care is a challenge. Subject to regulatory approval by the World Health Organization (WHO), QuantuMDx hopes to initially roll out the Q-Poc unit in South Africa, before expanding to other markets. It was a big year for edible everyday items, like cutlery and beer cans. First up, an Indian cutlery company, Bakeys, invented cutlery that you can eat as a way to tackle plastic waste in oceans and landfill. (Welcome to a new geological epoch of trash – scientists are calling it the manmade Anthropocene.) Plastic cutlery significantly contributes to this problem – estimates suggest the US alone uses 40bn plastic utensils a year. Hence the need for edible versions. Bakeys makes vegan-friendly cutlery from rice, wheat and an ancient grain called sorghum, which was picked because it doesn’t go soggy when immersed in liquid. The cutlery comes in three flavors: savory (salt and cumin); sweet (sugar); and plain. And, if you’re wondering – it kind of tastes like a dry cracker. Why not wash down the cutlery with an edible beer holder? Americans are consuming more beer it seems – 67bn beer cans each year, apparently. According to the Brewers Association, this number is expected to grow significantly as craft breweries get more popular. The problem is that plastic beer can holders pose a threat to fish and marine wildlife when they end up in the ocean. Saltwater Brewery, based in Florida, has come up with a solution: biodegradable, edible beer pack rings made from wheat and barley waste. The rings disintegrate within two hours of being in the ocean, which prevents fish or other sea animals getting stuck. They’re also harmless if ingested by curious fish. More than 50 craft breweries have already contacted Saltwater expressing an interest in using the edible rings. The brewery is now developing metal molds capable of making 400,000 rings per month and hopes to build a centralized production facility by 2017. One of 2016’s most heartwarming stories revolved around a cunning plan by the US Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) to bombard a ferret habitat in Montana with a vaccine administered via specially designed drones that can “shoot” pellets in three directions at the same time. All this in a bid to save the endangered black-footed ferret. The vaccine pellets are actually intended for the prairie dog population inside the habitat at the UL Bend National Wildlife Refuge. The ferrets are dependent upon prairie dogs for food and shelter, but a flea-borne disease called sylvatic plague has slowly been killing the prairie dogs off.  The FWS came up with a “glorified gumball machine” to spit out the vaccine pellets. The machine which can be attached to a drone which uses GPS to drop the pellets throughout the habitat. Oh, and if you’re wondering: the FWS said lab tests show that prairie dogs find the bait in the vaccines “delicious”. As we’ve established, humans produce a lot of trash – apparently of the more than 300m tons of plastic produced globally every year, one refuse truck’s worth ends up in our waters, landfills and streets every minute.  One of our favorite stories this year came from India, where a local entrepreneur has set up a production facility at a local rubbish dump, where waste pickers convert high-density polyethylene (HPDE) – mostly used for plastic bottles – into 3D printing filament to eventually be sold to 3D printing companies. The market for 3D printing filament – the majority of which is made from virgin plastic – is growing rapidly. A recent report predicted the 3D printing materials market will grow by nearly 266% in the next five years. And, while the market for ethical filament is still relatively small, the greatest potential 3D printing seems to be offering the developing world is employment – there are an estimated 15 million people globally who currently make their living from waste picking, for example."
"Climate change has already led to the vanishing of some bird species in parts of England, where intensively farmed land gives them no room to adapt to warming temperatures. The revelation, in a new scientific study, contradicts previous suggestions that birds are tracking global warming by shifting their ranges. The research found that birds that prefer cooler climes, such as meadow pipits, willow tits and willow warblers, have disappeared from sites in south-east England and East Anglia, where intensive crop growing is common.   “Birds are facing a double-edged sword from climate change and declines in habitat quality,” said Tom Oliver, at the University of Reading, who led the new study. “In England, birds really look like they are struggling to cope with climate change. They are already being hit with long-term reductions in habitat quality and, for the cold-associated birds, those losses are being further exacerbated by climate change.” “Climate change is with us, here and now, and its effects on wildlife are increasingly well documented,” said Mike Morecroft, principal climate change specialist at Natural England, and part of the research team.  Simon Gillings, at the British Trust for Ornithology, and another member of the research team, said: “Intensive [land] management is making it harder for cold-associated birds to find cool corners of sites, or to disperse away from warming regions.” But Oliver noted that showing the impact of climate change on wildlife is affected by the availability of good habitats means action can be taken: “We are not completely at the mercy of climate change.” Creating larger natural areas in strategic places will help species cope with a changing climate, the scientists said. The study, published in Global Change Biology, analysed both bird and butterfly data from more than 600 sites monitored between 1964 and 2009. It found butterflies were adapting much better to climate change than birds, although cold-associated butterfly species also suffered if the area around the site was poor in natural habitat. But while many of the butterfly species that enjoy warmer weather were thriving, birds associated with warmer temperatures were not, due to lost or degraded habitat. Oliver said butterflies were faring better as they require much smaller areas of natural land, which are more likely to be available. Good habitat means more suitable food plants and more microclimates in which species can thrive in good years and survive in poor ones. The ringlet butterfly, for example, suffers badly in drought years. But they can hang on if there are patches of broadleaf woodland available, as these resist droughts and keep soils more moist than treeless landscapes. Butterflies can also produce many generations in a single year when conditions are favourable, whereas birds reproduce more slowly. The small copper butterfly can have up to five generations a year, Oliver said. Like butterflies, dragonflies and damselflies are generally adapting well to climate change and warming has brought 11 new species to Britain since 1995, according to a new report from the British Dragonfly Society. Newcomers include the stunning large white-faced darter and Genevieve Dalley, at the BDS, said: “These unprecedented events currently happening in the dragonfly world are exciting but also act as a warning: the natural world is changing.” But global warming is also threatening the northern damselfly, restricted to a few small lochs in Scotland, and the black darter, which is becoming less common in the south of Britain. The scientists conducting the bird and butterfly research determined the temperature favoured by each species by looking at the average warmth of their ranges across Europe, with those preferring heat found mostly in southern Europe and vice versa. Stopping the destruction of habitat such as hedgerows and old orchards and creating new nature reserves can give opportunities for wildlife to adapt to global warming said Oliver. But biodiversity across England continues to fall, he said, despite a landmark review of wildlife sites for the government in 2010.  “That report called for a step change in nature conservation,” said Oliver. “We are still waiting for that step change and until we see it we can’t really expect the fortunes of our wildlife to change.” Richard Bradbury at the RSPB and not involved in the new research said: “Making use of the tremendously rich wildlife data collected by dedicated UK volunteer observers, this study provides further compelling evidence that climate change is already affecting the UK’s species.” A major report in 2015 found that one in six of the world’s species faces extinction due to climate change unless action is taken to cut carbon emissions rapidly."
"2016 is likely to be remembered as an annus horribilis for so many reasons that it’s tempting to think everything is doomed. But things are not always as they seem. There are silver linings. You just have to look hard to find them. Overall, 2016 looks set to have slightly fewer deaths through armed conflict than 2015, when 167,000 people died. Hardly numbers to celebrate.  But narrow the focus and pockets of progress can be found. According to the International Institute for Strategic Studies, the death toll from the war with Boko Haram in Nigeria has fallen sharply, as Nigerian government troops retake territory. “The group’s operational capacity within Nigeria was weakened,” notes Anastasia Voronkova, IISS research fellow for armed conflict. “At least 4,500 civilians held captive by the group were rescued in 2015 alone; another around 5,000 people were freed by June 2016. 2016 fatalities are expected to be noticeably lower than the 11,000 recorded in 2015.” Death tolls are also expected to be lower from internal conflicts in the Philippines, Myanmar and India, according to the IISS. Mark Rice-Oxley Carbon is flatlining, and our planet has breathing space. After more than a century and a half of nearly unbroken growth, the quantity of greenhouse gases we pour into the atmosphere each year has stalled for the third year running. Burning fossil fuels and chopping down forests released about 40 gigatonnes of carbon dioxide last year, roughly the same amount as in the previous two years. What is more, this plateau in emissions is taking place against a background of quickening economic growth, showing that increasing prosperity and lifting people out of poverty need not come at the expense of the climate. These are big reasons to be cheerful, and we need them. We are coming to the end of the hottest year ever recorded. The Arctic ice cap is 20C above its normal winter temperatures, a heating that scientists are calling “literally off the charts”, and may soon result in more rapid melting than anything yet seen. Donald Trump is hellbent on destroying the Paris agreement, boosting the coal industry and defunding Nasa’s ground-breaking climate research in favour of sending people into space. But at least our global warming emissions are abating. It has only taken 25 years to achieve. Stalling emissions should also spell better health, because coal burning in particular pollutes the air with lung-shredding particles and choking chemicals. Finished celebrating? Good. There’s work to do. Flatlining emissions are not enough. Carbon dioxide levels in the atmosphere are still at the highest levels since humans first walked the earth. That invisible stock of carbon in the air is what causes warming, so even if we stopped burning fossil fuels tomorrow the climate would continue to change because of the greenhouse gases already there. We are not going to stop burning fossil fuels tomorrow, and emissions need to come down by as much as 80% to have a chance of keeping warming under control. That will take decades. Every molecule of carbon dioxide we release stays in the air for up to 100 years, all the while trapping heat on the planet’s surface. Every tonne of carbon emitted puts the goal of halting climate change just a bit further out of reach. We are not out of the rapidly dwindling woods yet. For now, we still have a chance of saving the planet from runaway warming, if we act fast to save energy and invest in clean sources. So cheer the carbon slowdown and put up more windmills. Fiona Harvey, environment correspondent While violent crime ticked up in the UK in 2016, the overall level of offences continued its long-term decline to the lowest level since 1981. The Office for National Statistics said there were an estimated 6.5m incidents in the year to June 2016. Various reasons are given for the long-term decline: better security against car and home theft, the drop in the jobless claimant count and a broader sociological shift towards greater civility in richer countries. But police also report a rise in the number of reported rapes, while hate crime increased after the Brexit referendum in June and cybercrime poses an ever greater threat. Connectivity is taken for granted in the western world, where smartphone and internet use rise inexorably year on year.  Now there are strong signs that this take-up is at last being mirrored in poorer parts of the world, with positive outcomes for growth, health and democratic participation. Africa in particular is experiencing the sharpest growth anywhere of smartphone proliferation: by 2020 there will be more than 700m smartphone connections in Africa – more than twice the projected number in North America, according to GSMA, an association of phone operators. In Nigeria alone in 2016, an estimated 16 smartphones are sold every minute. The mobile industry will account for 8% of GDP by 2020 – double what it will be in the rest of the world. And internet penetration is rising faster than anywhere else as costs of data and devices fall. Could 2016 go down as the year that the great global population surge finally showed signs of slowing?  The number of people around the world increases by about 80 million every year, and forecasts predict that the global population will continue to mount through this century, to hit about 11 billion people by 2100. But much depends on behaviour and attitudes in parts of the world that have yet to experience the sudden drop in birthrates that swept across rich countries in the three decades after the second world war. In January, the latest figures published by the UN showed more women than ever are now using some form of contraception. Some 64% of women aged between 15 and 49 who are married or living with a partner are now using traditional or modern forms of family planning, up from 36% in 1970.  Poorer regions of the world – particularly Asia and Africa, where access to contraception has been a barrier to development – have witnessed the fastest pace of growth. The UN predicts that Africa, a continent with the largest demand for contraceptives but the worst access to services, will record the highest rates of growth over the next 15 years. In November, the Family Planning 2020 initiative reported that the number of women using contraceptives in its 69 target countries had leapt by 30 million in the past four years alone.  This is not only good news for women and their families: the increase in family planning could cut projections of population growth by as much as 1 billion over the coming years. Jagdish Upadhyay, of the UN population fund, said if by 2030 the average family size was down by the equivalent of one child, then by 2030 the world population would be approximately 8 billion rather than 9 billion. Liz Ford Murder rates have been in decline in western democracies for years, but had persisted at stubbornly high levels in parts of central America. However, 2016 could go down as a good year in El Salvador, for years one of the most murderous places in the world. The July-September period produced a year-on-year drop in homicides of almost 50%, according to data gathered for the Guardian by the IISS.  “This decline can be attributed to the government’s tightened security policies at prisons, the creation of a new paramilitary force comprising 600 members of the military and 400 police officers, as well as a negotiated truce between the leaders of the three main gangs,” said Anastasia Voronkova at the IISS.  “The timing of the announcement by the gangs seemed to match the downward homicide trend: homicides fell by 42% in April 2016 in comparison with March [from 611 to 353], and have remained stable since then.” The standout news in 2016 was that Sri Lanka had become the latest country to be declared malaria free. More than 30 countries that are collectively home to some 2 billion people are hopeful that they might follow suit in the next four years.  The task of reducing the toll of malaria in sub-Saharan Africa, which has 90% of cases and 92% of deaths, is hard and needs more resources. But 2016 brought good news from other quarters: the World Health Organisation declared that measles had been eradicated from the Americas; death rates fell in the developed world from some forms of cancer, and the number of people getting Aids treatments continued to rise, from negligible levels in 2000 towards a target of 30m by 2020. The global assault on infectious diseases has led to ever longer lifespans: life expectancy is on average 10 years longer in 2016 than it was in 1980. The number of people living in extreme poverty has yet to be estimated for 2016, but the long-term trend is a happy one, describing steep decline.  Numbers have more than halved since 1993, despite a growth in the world population of almost 1.9 billion.  Statistically, as economies grow and middle classes expand, almost 50 million people escape poverty every year in net terms — a population equivalent to Colombia or Korea. Put even more simply, every single day over the past 25 years, the number of people living in extreme poverty has declined by 137,000. According to the newest figures, the east Asia and Pacific region accounted for the greatest reduction in extreme poverty over the 23-year measuring period, based on a $1.90-per-day poverty line.  In just one year alone – 2012 to 2013 – the number of poor in east Asia and the Pacific declined by 71 million, while in south Asia the number of poor dropped by 37 million. Declining poverty in extreme terms has shown significant regional fluctuations, however. In 2013, Sub-Saharan Africa accounted for nearly 51% of the global poor (389m people), but in 1990, it was east Asia and the Pacific that accounted for half of the global poor.  While the UN aims to eradicate extreme poverty by 2030, the World Bank report warns that economic growth has to be more equally distributed – in other words, the rich can’t keep getting richer – and says that extreme poverty trends depend on the economic success of Sub-Saharan Africa."

"Leading scientists have asked the prime minister to urge president-elect Donald Trump to acknowledge the risks of climate change and declare his support for international efforts to combat global warming. One hundred researchers, including many of the most prominent climate scientists in Britain, have written to Theresa May to warn her of the potential threats posed by Donald Trump, who has made clear he does not accept the scientific consensus on warming driven by human activities.  The letter warns that Trump’s administration may severely weaken climate change research and the collection of data such as Earth temperature records, which are used by scientists and policymakers in the UK and around the world. If the world class climate science now performed in the US is wound down under Trump, the UK must be ready to respond decisively, the letter states. One response would be to rapidly expand British climate science by offering jobs to disaffected US researchers. Trump has called global warming a hoax and may scrap Nasa’s invaluable climate research program. He threatened to withdraw from the Paris agreement, which aims to avoid the most dire consequences of climate change, though recently he said he had an open mind on US involvement in the plan. He appointed Scott Pruitt, a climate sceptic, to run the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), and Rex Tillerson, the CEO of Exxon, to be secretary of state. “We don’t know how bad it will be, and it seems that Trump has slightly gone back on some of the rhetoric, but there are still worrying concerns,” said Prof Piers Forster, a signatory of the letter and director of the Priestley International Centre for Climate at Leeds University. “What concerns me is that if we don’t have good scientific data and observations coming from America, we’ll be flying blind.” The letter urges the PM to press Donald Trump directly and through international forums such as the G7 and G20 to accept the reality of climate change and restate a commitment to the Paris agreement. In rejecting the scientific evidence around climate change, Trump is disregarding the findings and advice from expert bodies around the world, including the US National Academy of Sciences and the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), the letter states. It adds that the UK science community stands ready to back US researchers in “resisting any political attempts to prevent, hamper, or interfere with vital research on climate change.” The scientists behind the letter, which was sent on Friday, want any weakening in US climate change to be met by an expansion of research in Britain. That could see the UK substantially bolster its expertise in the area by offering jobs to top US researchers whose work is shut down, or who simply become disillusioned under the Trump administration. “There are opportunities for UK universities to make some fantastic appointments. I’m the director of a brand new institute and we are interested in giving these people jobs,” Forster said. Other signatories to the letter include Prof Phil Jones, director of the Climatic Research Unit at the University of East Anglia, Prof Corinne Le Quéré, director of the Tyndall Centre for Climate Change Research, and Prof Jim Hall, director of the Environmental Change Institute at Oxford University. “We have to be prepared as a country because things could change quite rapidly,” Forster said. “If climate scientists in the US start to lose their jobs, we have to be ready to take up the slack.” The last Republican president, George W Bush, was roundly criticised by climate scientists for interfering with research and public messages around global warming research. During his administration, a report from the EPA was edited by White House officials to reduce a long section on the risks of rising temperatures to a handful of vague paragraphs. In one email exchange that came to light, White House officials sought help from the conservative lobby group, the Competitive Enterprise Institute, which received more than $1m (£820,000) in donations from Exxon, to play down a report in which the US admitted for the first time that humans contributed to global warming. Within days of President Bush’s inauguration, Randy Randol, an ExxonMobil lobbyist, sent a memo to the White House asking if Bob Watson, the former head of the World Bank’s environment department and then-chair of the IPCC, could be replaced at the request of the US. Watson, who was knighted in 2012 and had long warned about the impact of burning fossil fuels and the need to change to prevent environmental harm, was duly unseated and replaced. The foreign secretary, Boris Johnson, has told MPs that the UK will stress the importance of climate change to the Americans, but there is an acceptance among ministers that US climate policy is a matter for the US to decide. A government spokesperson said the UK’s commitment to tackling climate change was “as strong as ever and we are clear that there will be no attempts to go back on what was agreed during negotiations in Paris and Marrakesh.” Theresa May closed the government’s dedicated climate change department last year. Work in the area now falls to the new Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy. “We know the UK and US face very similar energy challenges. We’ve had great experience working together on all kinds of energy and climate change issues and look forward to this collaboration continuing,” the spokesperson added. "
"It all seemed so simple in 2008. All we had was financial collapse, a cripplingly high oil price and global crop failures due to extreme weather events. In addition, my climate scientist colleague Dr Viki Johnson and I worked out that we had about 100 months before it would no longer be “likely” that global average surface temperatures could be held below a 2C rise, compared with pre-industrial times. What’s so special about 2C? The simple answer is that it is a target that could be politically agreed on the international stage. It was first suggested in 1975 by the environmental economist William Nordhaus as an upper threshold beyond which we would arrive at a climate unrecognisable to humans. In 1990, the Stockholm Environment Institute recommended 2C as the maximum that should be tolerated, but noted: “Temperature increases beyond 1C may elicit rapid, unpredictable and non-linear responses that could lead to extensive ecosystem damage.”  To date, temperatures have risen by almost 1C since 1880. The effects of this warming are already being observed in melting ice, ocean levels rising, worse heat waves and other extreme weather events. There are negative impacts on farming, the disruption of plant and animal species on land and in the sea, extinctions, the disturbance of water supplies and food production and increased vulnerability, especially among people in poverty in low-income countries. But effects are global. So 2C was never seen as necessarily safe, just a guardrail between dangerous and very dangerous change. To get a sense of what a 2C shift can do, just look in Earth’s rear-view mirror. When the planet was 2C colder than during the industrial revolution, we were in the grip of an ice age and a mile-thick North American ice sheet reached as far south as New York. The same warming again will intensify and accelerate human-driven changes already under way and has been described by James Hansen, one of the first scientists to call global attention to climate change, as a “prescription for long-term disaster”, including an ice-free Arctic. Nevertheless, in 1996, a European Council of environment ministers, that included a young Angela Merkel, adopted 2C as a target for the EU. International negotiators agreed the same in 2010 in Cancun. It was a commitment repeated in the Paris Climate Accord of 2015 where, pushed by a new group of countries called the Climate Vulnerable Forum, ambitions went one step further, agreeing to hold temperature rises to “well below 2C above pre-industrial levels and to pursue efforts to limit the temperature increase even further to 1.5C”. Is it still likely that we will stay below even 2C? In the 100 months since August 2008, I have been writing a climate-change diary for the Guardian to raise questions and monitor progress, or the lack of it, on climate action. To see how well we have fared, I asked a number of leading climate scientists and analysts for their views. The responses were as bracing as a bath in a pool of glacial meltwater. Nasa’s Goddard Institute for Space Studies has an important place in the history of climate-change research. Hansen was its director from 1981 until 2013. Donald Trump is set to strip the institute of funding for climate research. Its current director, Dr Gavin Schmidt, is categoric that we are no longer likely to stay below 2C. “The inertia in the system (oceans, economies, technologies, people) is substantial and … so far the efforts are not commensurate with the goal,” he says. Sabine Fuss, of Germany’s Mercator Research Institute, on Global Commons and Climate Change says emissions are currently “not aligned” with the 2C target and will need to “come down more quickly”. Joanna Haigh, co-director of the Grantham Institute for Climate Change and Environment, thinks there is “no chance whatsoever at current levels of carbon emissions”, and her Grantham Institute colleague, Prof Sir Brian Hoskins, is not “confident” that temperature rises can be held below 2C. Prof Andrew Watkinson of the School of Environmental Sciences at the University of East Anglia thinks it “unlikely” and Prof John Shepherd, a physicist at the National Oceanography Centre in Southampton, calls it “not very likely at all”. Stuart Haszeldine of the School of GeoSciences at the University of Edinburgh says we have “very little chance”, and Prof Piers Forster, director of the Priestly International Centre for Climate at the University of Leeds calls it, “on the fanciful edge of plausible”. Glen Peters, senior researcher at Norway’s leading climate change centre, Cicero, is unambiguous, saying: “We have emitted too much already.” And these sentiments are echoed by Prof Alice Larkin, of the Tyndall Centre for Climate Change Research at Manchester University, and Dr Chris Vernon, a glaciologist and former scientist at the Met Office’s Hadley Centre for Climate Science. Only one influential scientist preferred their comments to remain anonymous, but they too said we were off-target, because the “international negotiating process is disconnected from national policymaking”. In short, not a single one of the scientists polled thought the 2C target likely to be met. Bill McGuire, professor emeritus of geophysical and climate hazards at University College London, is most emphatic. “My personal view,” he says, “is that there is not a cat in hell’s chance.” The most positive response came in the guarded words of Chris Jones, head of the Earth system and mitigation science team at the Met Office’s Hadley Centre, who says that current levels of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere “don’t preclude” successfully achieving the target. Prof Joachim Schellnhuber, director of the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research, would “only confirm that it is still possible to keep global warming below 2C”. The last point, however, is contentious, for precisely the reason the target exists. Namely, to prevent global warming from feeding off itself by triggering long-term, potentially irreversible environmental domino effects, such as ice loss and forest die-back, and the weakening ability of things such as our oceans to absorb carbon. “The open question for me is not whether we will breach the 2C target,” says Prof Barry McMullin of Dublin City University, “but how soon.” In addition, the temperature target is a global average, and local variations matter. In November 2016, the Arctic was already experiencing extraordinary anomalies. Temperatures were 20C above normal. A global average rise of 2C implies higher temperatures still for the Arctic, sufficient to push long-term ice loss and trigger other potentially uncontrollable climate changes. At the other end of the world, a development more bizarre than extraordinary is touching the Antarctic. Gambling with our future used to be largely a metaphor, but it is now possible to place bets on when the next giant iceberg will detach itself from the Larsen C ice shelf. At the time of writing, betting company PaddyPower is offering odds of 7/2 in February 2017 or 12/1 in August. Hoskins says: “We have no evidence that a 1.9C rise is something we can easily cope with, and 2.1 is a disaster.” But Saleemul Huq, director of the International Centre for Climate Change and Development in Bangladesh, one of the countries most vulnerable to warming, warns in stark terms of the failure to stick to a much lower target: “The consequences of failing to keep the temperature below 1.5C will be to wilfully condemn hundreds of millions of the poorest citizens of Earth to certain deaths from the severe impacts of climate change.” “I think we actively chose to forgo the carbon budgets for a likely chance of 2C many years ago,” says Kevin Anderson, currently professor of climate change at Uppsala University in Sweden. “Judging that rate at which our emissions would need to be reduced was too politically challenging to contemplate.” The one thing agreed by all the climate scientists was the need for immediate and dramatic transition to a low-carbon economy, at a scale and speed we have not yet remotely approached. And the truly striking thing is that a huge number of the actions we need to take are things that bring enormous economic, social and environmental benefits. Rationally, we would be choosing to do them anyway. Where there are challenging shifts in behaviour required, they mostly affect only a small, wealthy proportion of society. Take flying, for example: 70% of all flights by UK residents are accounted for by just 15% of the population. So, what scale of change are we looking at to stay below 2C? Being optimistic about what might be achieved in terms of saving forests from being cut down and cleaning up industry, especially the production of steel and cement, Anderson estimates globally we can afford to emit around 650bn tonnes of carbon dioxide in total from energy systems. Currently, the world pumps out about 36bn tonnes every year alone. Starting from today, and assuming that poorer and industrialising nations see a peak in the emissions from energy use by 2025 and go zero carbon by 2050, Anderson calculates that this leaves a rich country such as the UK with the challenge of cutting its emissions by around 13% per year. Chris Goodall charts the remarkable rise of renewable energy and its equally dramatic falling costs. But renewables have to substitute for fossil fuels, not merely add to overall energy supply. In the meantime, it matters as much that we reduce our total energy use. You will hear a lot of talk about technologies to capture carbon from the burning of fuel and prevent it entering the atmosphere. Most of the climate models used to project what will happen to our atmosphere rely heavily on the assumption that they will be used at large scale. While most climate scientists see these so-called “negative emissions technologies” for carbon capture and storage (CCS) as essential parts of the toolkit to tackle climate change, many are sceptical of hope being placed in them. It is easier not to burn the carbon in the first place. “There is no guarantee that CCS will work at a sufficiently global scale,” says Dr Hugh Hunt, a Cambridge specialist on climate engineering. “These technologies will take decades to reach any meaningful scale.” Tellingly, as an engineer, he argues that our top priorities are to stop burning fossil fuels and for the biggest consumers to live less extravagantly. And, it seems, moderate shifts by the most profligate could yield huge climate dividends. Currently about half of all global emissions are the responsibility of just of just one in 10 of the global population. If just this group reduced their carbon footprints to that of the average, barely impoverished European, argues Anderson, global emissions would be cut by around one-third. There are many ways to reach a 2C world, according to Prof Diana Ürge-Vorsatz, of the Central European University. “Their common characteristic is that they all require rapid and transformational action,” she says. Small, incremental changes won’t do it. Retrofitting existing buildings in rich countries can save 70-90% of the energy used to heat and cool them, she adds. And such a move also tackles fuel poverty, creates local jobs and reduces deaths from cold. Switching transport from fossil fuels to electricity power by renewables cuts emissions but also removes the air pollution that is responsible for an epidemic of lethal respiratory disease. In Europe alone, about half a million people suffer premature deaths each year due to air pollution. In November 2016, many, mostly low-income countries, from Bangladesh to Tanzania and Guatemala, committed to switching entirely to renewable energy by 2030-50 at the latest. Costa Rica, aided by favourable geography, has already managed to power itself for extended periods, relying just on renewables. Portugal has managed the same for shorter periods. But great leaps forward are happening elsewhere, too. China is installing more new wind energy capacity in a single year than the UK has in total. So, adding to the prevailing global strangeness, the edifice of international climate policy rests on a target that no one believes it is likely can be met. And some think even that insufficiently ambitious. Yet, among climate scientists, there is a consensus that swift action is vital, and with it the target remains, at least, possible. With the amount of carbon burned by humans, we have now created a climate not experienced on Earth since the Pliocene era, 2m-5m years ago. We are daily rolling the climate dice with the odds stacked against us. But we are also clever, quick and innovative when we want to be. Now that we understand the game better, the question we face is whether we will choose to change it, fast and enough, so that we can all have better lives.

"I read with great interest the various contributions in G2 (5 January) on garden cities, towns or villages of tomorrow. The plea in the first article, by Owen Hatherley, was for a new town that “doesn’t look planned by developers but for the public good”. This is what I found in the new town I have lived in for almost 60 years. When I moved to Crawley in 1957 it was to a new town designated 10 years earlier which was growing rapidly. The main characteristic of such new towns of this first postwar generation was planning on the neighbourhood principle. Each neighbourhood was built for a population of about 8,000 to 10,000, the catchment area for a local primary school, doctors and dentist surgeries, pub, church, a small row of shops, a small community centre (initially a wooden hut). This, I believe, is still viable in our digital and car-centred age. Community is built from parents meeting at the school gates (another principle was that no child under 11 needs to cross a main road to get to school) in the doctor’s surgery and at the local shops. These contacts can build a sense of community, as I witness daily from my kitchen window which looks out on a primary school.  When the new towns were designated in the 1940s we were a country that was almost bankrupt after an expensive war and the withdrawal of aid from the US. Surely it is not beyond us to do something similar to meet the crisis in housing that exists today?Gillian PittCrawley, West Sussex • Citing the great urbanist Jane Jacobs as an inspiration for new settlements is well wide of the mark. She regarded the garden city brigade as having “city-destroying ideals” and dismissed both them and the modern movement as “decentrists”. So where should we start with “the necessary acreage and a serviceable budget”? By tackling existing cities, especially those with economic problems, and making them better. You’re right, of course, that a key garden city concept was vast acres of pointless roadside landscaping, ecologically worthless and highly wasteful of scarce building land. We can make far better use of it with modest increases in density, as our Victorian forebears taught us. Squandering scarce farmland on outmoded garden suburb dreams is destructive as well as pointless. The ultra-low densities of the garden city movement left us fatally dependent on cars, with high greenhouse gas emissions an inevitable follow-on. The bullet we need to bite is not building destructive new settlements but moving economic activity to where the people are, in sustainable, compact towns and cities.Jon ReedsSmart Growth UK  • Join the debate – email guardian.letters@theguardian.com • Read more Guardian letters – click here to visit gu.com/letters"

"The world’s airline industry adds to climate change. It burns the equivalent of more than 5m barrels of oil a day, adding up to around 2.5% of all carbon dioxide pollution, in addition to nitrogen oxides, soot and water vapour, which place an even bigger burden on the world’s climate. Aircraft are gradually becoming more fuel efficient, but that’s not happening fast enough to keep up with the huge boom in flying – since the 1970s, global air traffic has doubled in size roughly every 15 years. Flying is still cheap and budget airlines make it even more attractive, partly thanks to an international agreement reached in 1944 that prohibits tax on aviation fuel for international flights.  Aviation, as well as shipping, was also exempted from the Paris international climate agreement to limit greenhouse gases. Last October, though, a new aviation accord was reached: the Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (Corsia).  This will give countries’ airlines a quota of carbon emissions, and if they exceed those limits they will have to buy additional units of carbon quotas, which will be traded openly on a carbon exchange. The money raised from these transactions will go to UN-approved environmental schemes and carbon-offset projects. It sounds like a breakthrough, and it’s a step in the right direction, but there are drawbacks. The scheme doesn’t come fully into operation for another decade, it doesn’t include every country (Russia and India have not signed up), only applies to international flights, and offsets cover only CO2 emissions.  Airlines can still carry on polluting if they wish, and the agreement does little to stifle the huge growth in aviation. "
"An embryonic industry trying to harness the UK’s waves to generate clean electricity has been dealt a significant blow by a warning that the technology is too costly. Wave power devices being tested in Cornwall and at Orkney are 10 times more expensive than other sources of low carbon power and need a radical rethink, the Energy Technologies Institute (ETI) said.  The energy research body added that even if costs were cut aggressively, wave power would be unlikely to make a significant contribution to the UK’s energy demands in coming decades. The institute, which has a mission to accelerate low carbon technologies, said the UK’s marine energy strategy should instead prioritise support for tidal stream power, such as a project being tested in the Pentland Firth, which resembles underwater wind turbines. The ETI urged the government to agree a subsidy deal for Atlantis Resource’s MeyGen scheme, which is the world’s first large-scale tidal power project. Atlantis Resources hopes to ultimately expand the tidal array’s first four turbines to 269, which would generate even more power than the Swansea bay tidal lagoon backed by an independent review last week. Such lagoon projects are further advanced than wave energy projects but some way behind tidal stream power development, and require large levels of investment, the ETI said. Experts have previously described the UK’s wave power potential as huge and said it could generate a tenth of electricity needs.   But despite being heralded six years ago by Scotland’s then first minister Alex Salmond as on the verge of commercial deployment, the fledgling sector has been dogged by delays and bankruptcies, such as the collapse of Scotland’s Pelamis Wave Power in 2014 and Aquamarine Power in 2015. The ETI, which is funded by government and companies including Rolls-Royce, EDF and BP, called for a “radical rethink” if the technology is to provide affordable renewable electricity. Developers, which include Australia’s Carnegie Clean Energy, Finland’s Fortum and the UK’s Seatricity, need to reconsider their approaches to “drastically” cut costs, the ETI said. Grid connections were another concern, it added. “On wave energy our view is that even with aggressive cost reduction and innovation activities, current attenuator wave energy technologies are highly unlikely to meet the ETI/UK Energy Research Centre marine energy roadmap targets, and are therefore unlikely to make a significant contribution to the UK energy system in the coming decades,” a spokesman said. However, people in the industry disputed the analysis, saying they would not be testing and developing the technology if they thought it was not commercially viable. Andy Bristow, managing director at Seatricitysaid it was “nonsense” to suggest wave power was 10 times as expensive as the alternatives.  “We’re confident in our technology but we’re less confident in the UK government’s commitment to renewables. We’re finding it difficult at the moment because of a malaise that seems to have infected the marine renewables sector,” Bristow said. “We think it’s a shame, because ultimately it’s a no-brainer: it’s clean, it’s green, it has potential to be very cost effective.”  Bristow added that he was surprised the ETI had not consulted the company. In a statement, Fortum said: “Wave power is still under research, development and piloting phase throughout the world compared to for example solar and wind technologies which are rapidly maturing and becoming more market-based. It is important to understand that the development of new competitive energy technologies takes time.” Tim Sawyer, CEO of Carnegie, said he believed the report was based on out of date data. RenewableUK’s deputy chief executive, Maf Smith, said: “The UK is right at the forefront of a global race to develop wave power on a commercial scale. It’s vital that we don’t lose our lead to other countries, who stand to benefit from the years of investment and progress we’ve made. The more we deploy, the cheaper the technology will become.” The ETI’s views on marine energy come after a global renewable energy body said developments in energy storage could be a “game-changer” for clean power. The Abu Dhabi-based Irena said battery storage capacity for electricity could increase from 1GW today to 250GW by 2030, helping alleviate renewable energy’s intermittent nature."
"Prince Charles, a vocal critic of climate change sceptics, has penned a Ladybird book on the subject after lamenting with experts the lack of a basic guide to the subject. The prince has joined forces with two leading environmental campaigners to produce The Ladybird Book on Climate Change, the first in a new series aimed at adults, The Ladybird Expert, is to be published later this month.  The 48-page hardback, in the style of the iconic children’s Ladybird series popular in the 1960s and 70s, is co-authored by the former executive director of Friends of the Earth, Tony Juniper, and Cambridge-based polar scientist, Emily Shuckburgh. Perhaps mindful of the prince’s passionate views on the subject – he once called sceptics “the headless chicken brigade” – publishers Penguin Books have taken the precaution of having the book “extensively peer reviewed by figures within the environmental community”. The idea is said to have come to Charles when he was invited to address the United Nations conference on climate change in Paris in 2015. Speaking with experts on the subject of global warming, he discussed with them the lack of a basic guide to the complex subject, a source said. Penguin was approached in spring last year and the publisher was enthusiastic. After the prince and his co-authors produced their first draft, Penguin turned to David Warrilow, chairman of the climate science special interest group at the Royal Meteorological Society, and a team of seven other climate specialists to go through the 5,000-word manuscript before publication.  The final version was agreed in August, at a meeting at Balmoral, where the prince was holidaying. The Ladybird books have enjoyed recent success with the publication of new spoof guides. The successful pastiche humour series – The Ladybird Books for Grown-ups, offering a take on everything from hipsters to mindfulness, and grandparents to sickies – have sold more than 3 million copies since 2015. The approach to Penguin came at the right time. “It was a coincidence, where we were thinking about a new series for adults after the huge success of the spoof books, but this time wanted some factual books by experts on science, history and arts subjects,” White said. “So the call and the idea from Clarence House was the catalyst for the new series.” The books feature illustrations in the old-fashioned style of the original Ladybird titles. The cover of Climate Change shows the East Sussex town of Uckfield, replicating a photograph of the devastating flooding there in October 2000. “His Royal Highness, Emily and I had to work very hard to make sure that each word did its job, while at the same time working with the pictures to deliver the points we needed to make. I hope we’ve managed to paint a vivid picture, and like those iconic titles from the 60s and 70s, created a title that will stand the test of time,” Juniper told the Mail on Sunday. Penguin said the series offers a bite-sized understanding of a challenging subject and that all the books in the new series have been written by leading lights in their fields, and provide informed expert opinions. More authors, including historian Suzannah Lipscomb, space scientist Maggie Aderin-Pocock and classical music critic Fiona Maddocks, have been signed up to write for the new adult series. Charles has himself been the subject of a Ladybird book, published in 1981, on the occasion of his wedding to Lady Diana Spencer."

"Climate myths are like zombies – you shoot them through the heart, walk away thinking they’re dead, and then they pop back up behind you and try once again to eat your brain.  So it is with Stage 1 climate denial and the myth that the Earth isn’t warming. It’s so persistent that it’s related to the 5th, 9th, and 49th-most popular myths in the Skeptical Science database. Climate deniers have been peddling the myth ‘no warming since [insert date]’ for over a decade.  It’s a popular myth among those who benefit from maintaining the status quo because if the problem doesn’t exist, obviously there’s no need for action to solve it. And it’s an incredibly easy argument that can be made at any time, using the telltale technique of climate denial known as cherry picking. I created a video to illustrate this point. The key is that the Earth has natural short-term temperature oscillations caused by factors like the El Niño/La Niña cycle. El Niño events temporarily warm temperatures at the Earth’s surface, while La Niña events cause temporary surface cooling. When you combine these up-and-down cycles with a long-term human-caused global warming trend and various other noisy influences, you get a bumpy temperature rise that allows for cherry picking of periods without warming: That’s what it looks like with artificial data. Using real global surface temperature data from NASA, I created a popular graphic called The Escalator, which has been featured the PBS documentary Climate of Doubt and used by Senator Sheldon Whitehouse on the Senate floor. The video below shows The Escalator with data updated through 2016: As The Escalator shows, we’re currently in a particularly hot period. 2014 was the hottest year on record, until 2015 broke that record, which we just broke again in 2016. This unprecedented heat has temporarily stopped the ‘no warming’ myth in its tracks, but like every zombie climate myth, it will inevitably rise again. Faux science journalists have already written fake news stories about temperatures falling between August and October 2016.  It’s only a matter of time before ‘no warming since 2016’ stories become common. That’s because there was a strong El Niño event that ended in 2016, very similar to the event that ended in 1998. The 1998 El Niño gave birth to the “no significant warming in 18 years” myth, which until recently was a favorite argument of deniers like Ted Cruz. In fact, earlier this week the House [anti-] Science Committee Twitter trolled “climate alarmists” by arguing that in satellite data, 2016 wasn’t that much hotter than 1998. This myth was accurately critiqued by climate scientist Carl Mears and Admiral David Titley, as documented in the video below: Coincidentally, there was about 0.25°C global surface warming between 1998 and 2016, which is why ‘no warming’ warped into ‘no significant warming.’ However, because of the record-shattering global heat of the past three years, the myth is likely to reset its cherry picked starting point to 2016. Between 2006 and 2014, the myth of ‘no warming since 1998’ became so pervasive on internet blogs and biased media outlets that it began to influence climate researchers. In 2015, Stephen Lewandowsky, Naomi Oreskes, and colleagues published a paper documenting what they termed “seepage” of this climate denial myth into the scientific community. It’s true that in the years following 1998, there were a number of La Niña events and other factors that acted to temporarily dampen the human-caused global warming trend, as illustrated in the above videos. And these factors were certainly worthy of investigation by climate researchers. However, the volume of research on the subject was a clear indication that the denier focus on the subject had seeped into the scientific community. As Lewandowsky and colleagues documented in their paper: across all data sets, the recent change in the rate of warming constitutes a notably smaller deviation from the overall trend than were previous periods of accelerated warming. Approximately 150 scientific papers were devoted to the slowdown, including entire special issues of the journal Nature and a discussion in the 2014 IPCC report. Similar short-term periods of accelerated warming were virtually ignored in the scientific literature.  Moreover, the scientific community adapted the use of inaccurate phrases like “hiatus” and “pause” to describe what was simply a short-term slowdown in global surface warming. Sometimes these phrases were redefined to refer to an apparent short-term discrepancy between models and observations (now resolved), which caused widespread confusion – a clear public communications failure.  Starting in 2008, public acceptance of global warming dipped, and has only now recovered eight years later. In our current post-truth state, with individuals hostile to climate science and policy taking control of America’s government, we’re likely to see a resurgence of zombie climate myths in the coming years. To stop them, we have to make it socially unacceptable to resurrect long-debunked climate myths. We have to demand that our leaders accept that facts matter, and hold them accountable for disseminating myths and misinformation. Seepage and appeasement are no longer options.  Fortunately, the scientific community is stepping up to stand up for science, evidence, and facts. To beat back the zombies, they’ll need support from the rest of the public as well."
"In the winter of 1432-33 people in Scotland “had to use fire to melt the wine before drinking it” ran a line in the research about the coldest decade of winters in the last 1,000 years. Short of real temperature readings, descriptions of such incidents and records of rivers and lakes freezing over for months at a time, tree rings and ice cores are what climate scientists have to use to trace weather extremes of the past.  Although the summers of the period 1430 to 1440 appeared to be averagely warm, the winters were exceptionally cold. Even southern France, northern and central Italy had late frosts into April ruining the wheat and wine harvests. These conditions led to widespread famine. While other cold periods in the last 1,000 years can be traced to volcanic eruptions, researchers think a number of climate anomalies must have come together to cause this problem. Part of the research is looking at how the cold decade affected society’s attitudes. The famines and subsequent epidemics among the weakened populations were often blamed on minorities, although in some cities, including London, there was a more constructive approach. Communal grain stores were built so as many people could be kept alive as possible – the medieval equivalent of food banks. With the erratic behaviour of the weather with climate change, the researchers say it is conceivable that Europe could have another run of poor harvests. That would raise food prices, but what are the other possible consequences, and who would get the blame? The researchers say we should prepare for such shocks. "
"Australia’s weather was extreme in 2016, driven by humankind’s burning of fossil fuels as well as a strong El Niño, according to the Bureau of Meteorology’s annual climate statement. That extreme weather led to devastated ecosystems both on land and in the sea, with unprecedented bushfires in regions that don’t usually burn, the worst coral bleaching on record, and has been attributed as the cause of damage to vast tracts of crucial kelp forests, oyster farms and salmon stocks across southern Australia. The statement, released on Thursday, said the country as a whole had its fourth-warmest year on record, but locally, Sydney and Darwin broke records for both their hottest maximum temperatures and hottest minimum temperatures. Hobart had its warmest night on record in 2016 and both Hobart and Brisbane had records for their hottest annual mean temperature fall as well. The hot and dry start to the year sparked bushfires in Victoria, Tasmania and Western Australia. The fires that swept through the Tasmanian world heritage forests were described as the worst crisis those forests faced in decades. The usually damp alpine forests there had been dried out by earlier dry weather and then a huge number of lightning strikes – which are expected to become more common as temperatures rise – burned through forests, killing trees that were hundreds of years old. While land burned, the sea around Australia broiled. The bureau’s statement said despite the surface temperature of the seas around Australia being consistently high in recent years, 2016 reached a new record temperature, being 0.73C above the 1961-90 average. Off the coast of Queensland, those record temperatures led to the worst coral bleaching on record, where an estimated 22% of the coral on the entire 2,300km length of the Great Barrier Reef was lost. In the northern, most remote and most pristine part of the reef, coral was devastated by the unusually warm water, which scientists say will become the norm in fewer than 20 years. The bureau’s statement also notes that ocean temperatures were at record highs around Tasmania in 2016. The freakishly hot waters there have been attributed as the cause of damage to oyster, salmon and abalone industries, as well as increased stress to kelp forests, already devastated by warmer waters in recent years. The record hot waters in Tasmania were caused by a strengthened east Australian current, which drags warm waters from the tropics, along the coast of Australia. “This was associated with the longest and most intense marine heatwave on record for the south-east Australian region,” thestatement said. It added: “The pattern of above average temperatures over land and in the oceans reflects the background warming trend. The Australian climate in 2016 was influenced by a combination of natural drivers and anthropogenic climate change.” The hot temperatures around the country were followed up by unusually wet conditions for much of Australia too. The bureau said Adelaide had its second-wettest year on record and its wettest since 1992. Sydney, Canberra and Hobart had above average rainfall. But the pattern wasn’t uniform, as Perth and Melbourne were close to average and Darwin and Brisbane were significantly drier than average in 2016. “Widespread, drought-breaking rains led to flooding in multiple states,” said Neil Plummer from the Bureau of Meteorology. “Even northern Australia saw widespread rainfall, during what is usually the dry season, greening regions that had been in drought for several years.” "
"Donald Trump’s US election victory and the UK’s vote to leave the European Union will cast a long shadow over the global elite’s annual gathering in the Swiss ski resort of Davos this week. This year, 3,000 politicians, business leaders, economists, entrepreneurs, charity leaders and celebrities will head to the World Economic Forum (WEF) to discuss the state of the world. As usual there’ll be big speeches, ultra-tight security, and experts in every field under the wintry sun. There’ll also be plenty of champagne and canapes for delegates gathering in expensive hotels to discuss issues such as inequality and the backlash against globalisation.  But this year’s WEF won’t be the same. Twelve months of seismic shocks have shaken Davos Man and Woman’s world view, and left them struggling to understand and address the new reality. These seven key themes will dominate this year’s meeting: The official theme of this year’s forum is “responsive and responsible leadership”. It’s a timely issue, as Donald Trump heads to the Oval Office. Trump is the living, breathing, tweeting antithesis of the WEF and its belief in “multi-stakeholder” solutions: the idea that big problems are solved by working together, rather than by isolationism and protectionism. The president-elect’s ability to tap into public anger and disenchantment has shocked Davos into talking of a crisis of western democracy. WEF founder Klaus Schwab wants leaders to respond to populism by sticking to their core values and “honestly explaining the breadth and complexity” of the world’s problems. But he admits that regaining public trust is a daunting task. “There has to be a recognition that we are in unmapped territory that placed the status quo, and by extension leaders themselves, into question,” he said. Trump won’t be at Davos, but one of his top advisers, financier Anthony Scaramucci, will outline the new administration’s priorities on Tuesday. The Obama era will be represented by outgoing vice-president Joe Biden, who will hold meetings and keep pushing his Cancer Moonshot project. Eight years after the financial crisis, Davos recognises that stronger economic growth alone isn’t enough to fix the world’s problems. WEF’s global risks report, released last week, argues that a “growing mood of anti-establishment populism” means market capitalism must now be reformed, and several panels will examine how this could happen. One panel will consider the plight of the “squeezed and angry” middle classes, with contributions from International Monetary Fund chief Christine Lagarde and hedge fund billionaire Ray Dalio. Davos will also examine whether it’s time to give all citizens a basic income, to cushion them from the impact of technological change. “Machines, the argument goes, can take the jobs, but should not take the incomes: the job uncertainty that engulfs large swaths of society should be matched by a welfare policy that protects the masses, not only ‘the poor’,” said World Bank senior economist Ugo Gentilini. “Hence, basic income grants emerge as a straightforward option for the digital era – one seemingly backed by Silicon Valley and trade unions alike.” Being lectured on the importance of “inclusive globalisation” by a communist leader will be a new experience for Davos delegates. Trump’s election is expected to create a vacuum in global leadership, and Xi Jinping could be the man to fill it. He’ll become the first Chinese president to attend Davos, and will lead an unprecedented 80-strong delegation of business leaders, economists, academics and journalists. Xi will deliver the opening plenary address on Tuesday, and use it to defend cooperation and economic globalisation. He’s expected to warn that countries could face rising confrontation, poverty and war if they descend into protectionism and isolationism. With Trump committed to withdrawing from the Trans-Pacific Partnership, Xi can now push for a Beijing-led trade deal. But he’ll also face pressure from European leaders, who are unhappy about Chinese firms dumping cheap exports, including steel, on their markets. Environmental issues are as important as ever this year, with campaigners worried that the Trump administration will scrap US commitments to tackling global warming. A group of scientist are setting up an “Arctic Basecamp” summit in Davos, to lobby delegates about the dangers of climate change. Temperatures at the top of the world were “alarmingly high” last Christmas, they say, with some parts of the Arctic region 20C warmer than usual. Former US vice-president Al Gore is attending, as is Christiana Figueres, who led the UN convention on climate change. They should find a receptive audience: environmental issues dominated the WEF’s annual survey of global risks for 2017 behind the threat of nuclear war. The “fourth industrial revolution” will once again be a key theme at this year’s Davos, where the focus will be on the problems created by technologies such as smart robots and driverless cars. The WEF will examine whether the loss to these innovations of millions of jobs is undermining social cohesion and contributing to the rise of populist parties. Davos will also consider whether increased use of artificial intelligence and the “internet of things” are laying firms open to a new wave of cyberthreats and security beaches. This area of technology has until now been only lightly regulated; is the world ready to hand more decision-making powers to machines? Delegates will also ponder the dangers posed by “weaponised” AI systems and smart robots. The WEF warns that autonomous weapons systems could be designed to “swarm” over a nation’s existing military defences, overwhelming them in a massive coordinated attack. “This risks upsetting the global equilibrium by neutralising the defence systems on which it is founded,” it goes on. “This would lead to a very unstable international configuration, encouraging escalation and arms races and the replacement of deterrence by pre-emption.” A year ago, it was hard to find many people at Davos who though that Britain either should, or would, vote to leave the European Union. Like Trump’s victory, the Brexit vote dealt a blow to WEF’s underlying principles – and fuelled the argument that they don’t really understand today’s world. On Friday, chancellor Phillip Hammond will outline his vision for the UK-EU relationship, and its implications for investment and migration. Barclays chief executive Jes Staley will give his views, amid fears that the City could lose tens of thousands of jobs. London mayor Sadiq Khan is taking his fight against a “reckless”Brexit to Davos. He will give a speech to business leaders, and hold talks with other politicians as part of his push for “privileged access” to the single market. More than half of the sessions at Davos are on the subject of social inclusion and development, as the WEF tries to live up to its commitment to improve the state of the world. A sprinkling of celebrity stardust among the snow may help get these issue noticed. Musician Shakira will discuss her work establishing schools for underprivileged children in Colombia, and actor Forest Whitaker will outline his foundation’s efforts to foster peace and reconciliation in disadvantaged parts of the world. They’re both collecting awards from the WEF – along with musician Anne-Sophie Mutter for her support for young musicians. Hollywood star Matt Damon is also back at Davos, to promote his Water.org charity, which seeks to end deaths from unclean drinking water."
"The number of devastating floods that trigger insurance payouts has more than doubled in Europe since 1980, according to new research by Munich Re, the world’s largest reinsurance company. The firm’s latest data shows there were 30 flood events requiring insurance payouts in Europe last year – up from just 12 in 1980 – and the trend is set to accelerate as warming temperatures drive up atmospheric moisture levels.  Globally, 2016 saw 384 flood disasters, compared with 58 in 1980, although the greater proportional increase probably reflects poorer flood protections and lower building standards in the developing world Ernst Rauch, the head of Munich Re’s corporate climate centre, said: “Flood events together with wind storm events are the two perils where we have the biggest increase in frequency worldwide. “In Europe, we’ve seen a steep increase in flood events related to severe convective [thunder] storms. The frequency of flash floods has increased much more than river floods since 1980.”  Storm intensity had also surged in Europe and abroad, he added. In the past month alone, 18 people have been killed by unusually intense rainfalls in Thailand, while British government advisers have warned that floods of the sort that devastated large parts of the UK last winter are becoming the new normal. Munich Re cautions that the trend is a non-linear one, following a pattern that will be significantly determined by manmade greenhouse gas emissions. “Unfortunately this is in line with climate change,” Rauch said. “It is amazing how closely these developments fit with the outcomes of climate models.” Eight of the 10 deadliest natural catastrophes in Europe since 1980 have taken place in the past 13 years, Munich Re’s data shows, and one of the other two incidents was not weather-related. Phenomena such as earthquakes are included in the company’s figures, but more than 90% of the natural catastrophes logged since 1980 have been climate-related.  Worryingly, the rate of extreme weather events appears to be increasing around the world, with 750 natural catastrophes last year, compared with an yearly average of 590 in the past decade. The 30-year mean figure was 470 disasters a year. The
first legally binding global climate deal, agreed in Paris in 2015, is meant to limit global warming to 2C, with an aspiration to keep it to
1.5C, to mitigate the effects of climate change. Records show global temperatures have already risen by 1.1C, with 2016 breaking the record for hottest year for the third year running. While the Earth’s temperature does fluctuate, the effects of current rapid warming are already being felt: Arctic ice is melting, the Great Barrier Reef is dying off and according to the UN, 60 million people now face food insecurity.  Since the 1950s, annual precipitation has increased in northern Europe and declined in the Mediterranean, a trend that UN climate scientists expect to increase. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change’s fifth assessment report also predicted with “high confidence” that northern Europe would see a rise in extreme rainfall in the decades ahead. “We have very strong evidence that extreme rainfall events are increasing whichever way around you look at it,” said Peter Stott, the head of the Met Office’s climate monitoring and attribution team. “That’s simply a result of the physics of how the atmosphere works.” For every degree of global warming, the earth’s atmosphere is able to hold about 6% more moisture, increasing the energy available to be fed into thunderstorms, Stott said. The circulation of weather systems is also affected, with warmer air that has risen in the tropics descending in more northerly latitudes. For northern Europe, the result is wetter winters. In the south, the Mediterranean faces potentially arid conditions, similar to those in north Africa. “The increase in record-breaking precipitation can only be explained by increasing temperatures caused by climate change,” said Fred Hattermann, a hydrologist and expert on regional climate impacts at the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research. Peter Höppe, the head of Munich Re’s geo-risks research unit, said there were “many indications” that the incidence of storms and persistent weather systems was increasing because of climate change. Even so, Hattermann’s research has found that soil moisture in Germany – a climatic border zone – has declined by up to 25 litres per square metre in the past 50 years, because of another result of global warming: drier summers. “In central Europe, the vegetation is changing,” he said. “Plants start to grow and flower earlier in the year. They start to suck up water and to transpire it.” EU scientists believe that at least half a million Europeans will be affected by floods every year by 2050, under a “high-end” 4C scenario for global warming that is eerily close to current trends. By 2080, almost a million Europeans could be affected by floods each year if the projection is realised. Last year, Munich Re estimates that $175bn was lost as a result of natural disasters, $50bn of which was covered by insurance policies. "
"Leading climate change experts have urged Donald Trump not to turn his back on the biggest global challenge facing mankind, arguing that he can make America great again – and the world safer – by standing up to global warming and embracing the trillion-dollar green tech revolution.  As new data showed that 2016 was the hottest year on record, scientists, government advisers and people closely involved with global climate talks said it would be self-defeating for Trump to pull the US out of the global Paris climate change deal as he has threatened.    Reversing action on climate change would mean the US gets left behind in the fast-growing, trillion-dollar market for clean energy, transport and infrastructure, experts told the Guardian, with one warning that this course of action would instead “make China great again”. “The best way to make America great again is by owning the clean technologies of the future,” said Michael Liebreich, who has advised the UN and World Economic Forum on energy. “Not only will this create countless well-paid, fulfilling jobs for Americans, but it will also lock in the US’s geopolitical leadership for another generation.”  “I would say to [Trump], if you want to make China great again, you have to stay the course you have promised,” said John Schellnhuber, a climate expert who has advised Angela Merkel, the pope and the EU.   Lord Stern, a former UK government adviser, added: “If you want to make America great again, building modern, clean and smart infrastructure makes tremendous commercial and national sense. In the longer term, the low-carbon growth story is the only growth story on offer. There is no long-term, high-carbon growth story, because destruction of the environment would reverse growth.” The Guardian interviewed more than a dozen leading global voices on climate change in the run-up to 24 hours of live, uninterrupted digital coverage, which runs from Thursday morning through to Trump’s inauguration on Friday. Reporters have investigated countless examples of climate change utterly transforming lives and livelihoods, from Bangladesh to Egypt, west Africa to the south Pacific, even Europe and the United States itself, despite Trump’s repeated claims that it is all a hoax.

While the Earth’s temperature does fluctuate, the effects of current rapid warming are already being felt: Arctic ice is melting, the Great Barrier Reef is dying off and according to the UN, 60 million people now face food insecurity.  The 2016 data released on Wednesday showed that global temperatures have already soared more than 1C since pre-industrial times – halfway to the 2C considered a crucial ceiling under the Paris deal. UN officials said a redoubling of efforts was required, and hoped Trump would be part of that.  “It will be a long journey and only a sense of urgency will get us to the ‘well below 2C target’,” said Patricia Espinosa, head of the United Nations framework convention on climate change, adding she was looking forward to working with Trump “to make the world a better place for the people of the US and for peoples everywhere”. Trump, who once called global warming “bullshit”, appears to have softened his stance a little since his election win, saying there is “some connectivity” between human activity and climate change. However, he also claimed climate action was making US companies uncompetitive. Key global players have scrambled to shore up the Paris deal before Trump’s inauguration, with China and India both indicating they have no plans to renege on the pact if Trump tries to unravel it. Barack Obama sought to leave a stake in the ground with a $500m payment to a global green fund designed to underpin the Paris agreement. Along with the US and Russia, the EU, China and India are the leading emitters of greenhouse gases – but they also sense the opportunity of stepping up if America falters.  China is already acknowledged to be leading the world in renewable energy and its president, Xi Jinping, firmly asserted his country’s commitment to climate action at the World Economic Forum (WEF) in Davos and said the nation’s green investments were already “paying off”. China served notice of its ambitious intent earlier this month with an eye-watering $360bn investment earmarked for renewable energy over the next four years. Chinese insiders told the Guardian that a combination of flourishing businesses and terrible smog made climate change a critical issue for Xi.  Zhang Haibin, a professor at Peking University’s school of international studies, said: “President Xi Jinping considers this [a question of] political security.” The EU environment commissioner, Miguel Arias Cañete, said that climate change was “bigger than any one country” and that the EU and China would be at the forefront regardless of what happens in Washington. “China is demonstrating a strong commitment to implementing the Paris agreement,” he told the Guardian. “EU-China cooperation is therefore needed for a strong political leadership in global climate action.” In a sign of the centre of international gravity on climate action shifting east, Cañete described cooperation with China as “fundamental” to the climate process, and said that bilateral cooperation with China would be strengthened in the next two years. Later this year, China is planning to open the world’s largest carbon market to enable full-scale national emissions trading by 2020. Cañete said that the EU would co-organise a global conference in 2017 with China and other countries and regions operating carbon pricing schemes – which could collectively cover a quarter of the world’s carbon emissions. “We will stand by Paris, we will defend Paris, and we will implement Paris,” he said. “The global clean energy transition is here to stay.” The commission expects a very different type of engagement with Washington after 20 January. Trump has repeatedly called for more fossil fuel exploration and exploitation, and the dismantling of key parts of Obama’s climate legacy. Obama’s clean power plan may be first in the firing line, but energy-efficient building codes, appliance standards, federal procurement policies and even renewable energy tax credits could also find themselves in the new administration’s crosshairs. EU officials could at least point to the qualified support for remaining “at the table” of the Paris climate talks, expressed by Trump’s secretary of state pick, Rex Tillerson, in senate hearings last week. “It is relatively reassuring in the sense that we’re not facing an immediate apocalypse,” one EU source said. “The signals so far are that they won’t be actively destructive. “But if the US is making every effort to dismantle its climate policy, it is going to set completely the wrong tone for [future] negotiations, and it will take the wind out of the sails of momentum generally.” Laurence Tubiana, the French climate envoy during the Paris talks, said that distributed leadership had been vital to the deal’s success but that the EU and China would now be first among equals. “There is no other option, so it has to happen,” she told the Guardian. “The EU and China can count on many actors – cities, companies, regions, even in the US – who are pushing in the same direction, so their leadership will not be lonely.” Tubiana said Trump would be able to create far more jobs in the buoyant renewable sector than in the moribund coal industry. Others concurred.   “If President Trump wants to deliver greater job security for Americans, he should focus on clean and sustainable industries where the US has a competitive advantage,” said Dame Julia King, an eminent engineer and one of the UK government’s official advisers at the Committee on Climate Change. “Those are the sectors that are set to prosper. He needs to build an economy for 2050, not one for 1950.” Jim Hansen, the scientist whose 1988 testimony to Congress arguably kick-started the entire movement to combat climate change, said there were grounds for optimism, particularly if a carbon tax emerges as a preferred option for the Trump administration. “If [Trump] wants to achieve the things that he claimed he would – improving the situation of the common man – the best way he could do this would be a programme of a rising carbon fee with the money distributed to the public.” Zhang Junjie, an environmental expert from Duke Kunshan University in eastern China, said it was too soon to assess how Trump’s administration might treat climate change even if it appeared that the issue appeared not to be “such a top priority on his agenda”. “We can’t read his Twitter literally. His policy might be different,” Zhang said. Additional reporting by Wang Zhen"
"You rather spoiled your commendable editorial (19 January) on making America great again by going green, when you dismissed the idea of protectionist carbon tariffs on those US exports made artificially cheap by being produced using subsidised fossil fuels. This could be an important transitional step to shifting a world economy already falling out of love with globalisation towards one shaped by green “progressive protectionism”. At its heart would be an emphasis on protecting and rebuilding sustainable local economies. This would offer a far more secure future for the majority than the socially and environmentally destructive form of global economic warfare inherent in international competitiveness and export-led growth. Prioritising the domestic would allow massive funding for a long-term, climate-healing “jobs in every community” approach of making all buildings and transport systems energy efficient and powered by decentralised renewables. It would also see off rightwing populists by providing long-term employment for those parts of the “left behind” that can’t be reached by any other form of economic activity. The threat of carbon tariffs on relevant US exports could well be a useful tool towards pushing Trump to shift his promised increase in infrastructure investment into one that would be a nationwide, decentralised job generator that also helped tackle climate change.Colin Hines(Author, Progressive Protectionism) London • Thank you for your G2 special on climate change (19 January). Chris Goodall (Look on the bright side, page 4) argues that cheaper renewables may mean that “the end of the fossil-fuel era is already in sight”. This is too optimistic: large amounts of fossil fuel are still very cheap to extract, and will be competitive even with much lower prices for green energy. This will be part of the reason why the leading scientists quoted by Andrew Simms (Another degree closer to disaster, page 8) are saying that we are not going to keep the global temperature rise below two degrees. We have to accept that the changes in personal lifestyle which you rightly advocate (The heat is on, ) and the developments in green energy are not going to be enough. We also need to invest in technology to remove carbon dioxide (carbon scrubbing) and to artificially lower global temperatures (geoengineering).Richard MountfordHildenborough, Kent • Trump’s tweet (‘The concept of global warming was created by and for the Chinese in order to make US manufacturing non-competitive’, G2 front page, 19 January) may not identify the subtle distinction between causation and cause and effect, but there is a justified underlying observation. By our own consumer choices we support economies that show no concern for their climate pollution or human sweatshops.Christopher CoombeLondon  • Join the debate – email guardian.letters@theguardian.com • Read more Guardian letters – click here to visit gu.com/letters"
"1 Air travel is usually the largest component of the carbon footprint of frequent flyers. A single return flight from London to New York – including the complicated effects on the high atmosphere – contributes to almost a quarter of the average person’s annual emissions. The easiest way to make a big difference is to go by train or not take as many flights. 2 The second most important lifestyle change is to eat less meat, with particular emphasis on meals containing beef and lamb. Cows and sheep emit large quantities of methane, a powerful global warming gas. A vegan diet might make as much as a 20% difference to your overall carbon impact but simply cutting out beef will deliver a significant benefit on its own.  3 Home heating is next. Poorly insulated housing requires large quantities of energy to heat. If you have properly insulated the loft and filled the cavity wall, the most important action you can take is to draught-proof the house, something you can do yourself. Those with solid brick or stone walls will also benefit from adding insulation, but the financial benefits are unlikely to cover the cost of doing the work, over time. 4 Old gas and oil boilers can be hugely wasteful. Even if your current boiler is working well, it’s worth thinking about a replacement if it is more than 15 years old. Your fuel use may fall by a third or more, repaying the cost in lower fuel bills. 5 The distance you drive matters. Reducing the mileage of the average new car from 15,000 to 10,000 miles a year will save more than a tonne of CO2, about 15% of the average person’s footprint. If car travel is vital, think about leasing an electric vehicle when your existing car comes to the end of its life. A battery car will save you money on fuel, particularly if you drive tens of thousands of miles a year. Even though the electricity to charge your car will be partly generated in a gas or coal power station, electric vehicles are so much more efficient that total CO2 emissions will fall. 6 But bear in mind that the manufacture of an electric car may produce more emissions than the vehicle produces in its lifetime. Rather than buying a new electric vehicle, it may be better to keep your old car on the road by maintaining it properly and using it sparingly. The same is true for many other desirable items; the energy needed to make a new computer or phone is many times the amount used to power it over its lifetime. Apple says 80% of the carbon footprint of a new laptop comes from manufacturing and distribution, not use in the home. 7 Within the last couple of years, LEDs (light-emitting diodes) have become cheap and effective. If you have any energy-guzzling halogen lights in your house – many people have them in kitchens and bathrooms – it makes good financial and carbon sense to replace as many as possible with their LED equivalents. They should last at least 10 years, meaning you avoid the hassle of buying new halogen bulbs every few months. Not only will your CO2 footprint fall, but because LEDs are so efficient, you will also help reduce the need for national grids to turn on the most expensive and polluting power stations at peak demand times on winter evenings. 8 Home appliances. Frequent use of a tumble dryer will add to your energy bill to an extent that may surprise you. But when buying a new appliance, don’t assume you will benefit financially from buying the one with the lowest level of energy consumption. There’s often a surprising premium to really efficient fridges or washing machines. 9 Consume less. Simply buying less stuff is a good route to lower emissions. A suit made of wool may have a carbon impact equivalent to your home’s electricity use for a month. A single T-shirt may have caused emissions equal to two or three days’ typical power consumption. Buying fewer and better things has an important role to play. 10 The CO2 impact of goods and services is often strikingly different from what you’d expect. Mike Berners-Lee’s book How Bad Are Bananas? takes an entertaining and well-informed look at what really matters. Bananas, for example, are fine because they are shipped by sea. But organic asparagus flown in from Peru is much more of a problem. 11 Invest in your own sources of renewable energy. Putting solar panels on the roof still usually makes financial sense, even after most countries have ceased to subsidise installation. Or buy shares in new cooperatively owned wind, solar or hydroelectric plants that are looking for finance. The financial returns won’t be huge – perhaps 5% a year in the UK, for example – but the income is far better than leaving your money in a bank. 12 Buy from companies that support the switch to a low-carbon future. An increasing number of businesses are committed to 100% renewable energy. Unilever, the global consumer goods business, says its operations will be better than carbon-neutral by 2030. Those of us concerned about climate change should buy from businesses acting most aggressively to reduce their climate impact.  13 For a decade, investors ignored the movement that advocated the divestment of holdings in fossil fuel companies. Large fuel companies and electricity generation businesses were able to raise the many billions of new finance they needed. Now, by contrast, money managers are increasingly wary of backing the investment plans of oil companies and switching to renewable projects. And universities and activist investors around the world are selling their holdings in fossil fuels, making it more difficult for these companies to raise new money. Vocal support for those backing out of oil, gas and coal helps keep up the pressure. 14 Politicians tend to do what their electorates want. The last major UK government survey showed that 82% of people supported the use of solar power, with only 4% opposed. A similar survey in the US showed an even larger percentage in favour. The levels of support for onshore wind aren’t much lower, either in the US or the UK. We need to actively communicate these high levels of approval to our representatives and point out that fossil fuel use is far less politically popular. 15 Buy gas and electricity from retailers who sell renewable power. This helps grow their businesses and improves their ability to provide cost-competitive fuels to us. Renewable natural gas is just coming on to the market in reasonable quantities in many countries and fossil-free electricity is widely available. Think about switching to a supplier that is working to provide 100% clean energy.          "
"Donald Trump is likely to face unprecedented opposition from environmental groups during his presidency as activists prepare to battle the new administration on a number of fronts across the US.  While environmentalists clashed with Barack Obama over the Keystone and Dakota Access oil pipelines, these fights could pale in comparison to the array of grievances Trump will face over water security, fracking and climate change.   The president-elect has vowed to approve the Keystone pipeline, which Obama blocked, and “very quickly” resolve the Dakota Access project, currently held up by the federal government after months of protests by Native Americans. Trump has pledged to remove “roadblocks” to oil, gas and coal developments and threatened to end all climate and clean energy spending.  Opposition to this agenda has already begun in earnest, following a prediction by former vice-president Al Gore that there will be a “huge upsurge” in environmental activism, stoked by the new administration’s plans to cut science funding, remove the US from the Paris climate deal and appoint Scott Pruitt as administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency – an agency he has sued multiple times as Oklahoma attorney general. 350.org, an international environmental organization, pledged to make January a month of a resistance against Trump’s cabinet picks. On 9 January, the organization will mobilize its chapters in all 50 states to stage protests at senators’ district offices. It will be the beginning of what they say will be a sustained protest throughout the year.  In New York City in December, the Sierra Club protested Pruitt’s nomination by projecting an image of rising seas and the words “Don’t Trump the planet” on to the side of the Trump Building on Wall Street. It’s the opening salvo of what is likely to be a war of attrition waged by America’s largest environmental group, which has drawn in more monthly donors in the weeks since Trump’s election than it has in the past four years.  “If Trump keeps choosing to drag us backwards to the dirty energy of the past, he will find unfettered opposition every step of the way,” said Michael Brune, executive director of the Sierra Club. Here are some of the flashpoints for environmental activists protesting issues relating to climate change happening around the country now and likely to erupt in the first few months of Trump’s presidency:  South of Standing Rock, the sprawling Dakota Access pipeline faces another dispute. Landowners in Iowa are challenging the government seizure of their land to build the pipeline.  The pipeline is almost 90% complete in Iowa and will eventually run through 200 parcels of private land granted to Energy Transfer Partners, the Texas-based company building the Dakota Access pipeline. But 17 of those parcel owners are suing the Iowa utilities board (IUB), arguing that the pipeline should be dug up and removed because the government violated the law in its use of eminent domain, which is the power the government has to seize private land for public use. Bill Hanagan, the lawyer representing the plaintiffs in the case, explained that an Iowa law passed in 2006 prevents the state from using eminent domain to grant farmland to a private company if it is not in the public good. Energy Transfer Partners argues that the state will reap significant financial benefits, and the approval of the IUB is all that is required. A judge heard the arguments for the eminent domain lawsuit on 15 December and will probably issue a decision in the coming weeks. But regardless of what he decides, the losing side is expected to appeal and protests are expected to continue. Environmentalists and some from the Meskwaki tribe held protests, conducted a hunger strike, and faced 200 arrests, according to Edward Fallon, a former state lawmaker and lead climate advocate Hanagan predicts the legal dispute may ultimately be settled in the US supreme court. Campuses across the country have been pushing universities to divest from from the fossil fuel industry over the past few years. Organizers are hoping the environmental threats posed by Trump’s cabinet nominations of energy industry leaders will further galvanize the movement.  The divestment movement calls on a range of different holding funds – including public pensions and university endowments – to sell off their investments in fossil fuel companies. According to a report by Arabella Advisors, holding funds controlling more than $5tn have joined the divestment movement. “I see a choice: to give up and give into fear or transform that into the hope and anger that we will need to fuel this movement,” said Greta Neubauer, director of Fossil Fuel Divestment Student Network. She said there was a “growing moral consensus that investing in the fossil fuel industry is unacceptable”. Neubauer and others are fearful of the prospect of having a climate denier in the White House and the damage that could be wrought by cabinet appointments such as those of former Exxon chairman Rex Tillerson for secretary of state and Scott Pruitt to head the Environmental Protection Agency, which he has rallied against throughout his career, including as attorney general of Oklahoma.  She said students were planning to walk out of classes on the the Monday following Trump’s inauguration to “reject his climate denial”. “There is no room for neutrality in the face of the administration that is threatening the very future of life on this planet,” Neubauer said. Olivia Rich, the spokeswoman for New York University’s divest campaign, said fossil fuels were not a tenable long-term investment. “The reason why is either the fossil fuel industry continues to do really well, and then the entire economy tanks because we end up with a catastrophe of monumental proportions, or the fossil fuel industry stops doing well because there’s climate action,” Rich said. It’s not just Dakota Access and Keystone XL. Environmental reform leaders say resistance is escalating to numerous proposed oil and gas pipelines around the country.  “I think there is a growing opposition to the buildout of gas pipelines and the opposition crosses party lines,” said Kelly Martin, deputy director of the Beyond Dirty Fuels campaign for the Sierra Club. “The concerns range from impacts on our land and water and private property to impacts on the climate.” Martin points to opposition to the Sabal Trail Transmission,which would stretch approximately 515 miles through Alabama, Georgia and Florida, as emblematic of future resistance. Activists have been protesting the pipeline since construction began last fall, with 16 people arrested in total and rallies held in five cities across Florida on 29 December.  In several spots along the route near where construction is planned, protesters have set up encampments.  Debra Johnson, 58, said she helped to found a camp that has been running since late September. She called the camp, in Live Oak, Florida, a “refuge” and a “unity camp” where people gather then head to demonstrations, such as a sit-in planned for later this month in Suwannee river state park. About 35 people are currently staying there, she said, though the number varies.  Merrillee Malwitz-Jipson, a campaign organizer with the Sierra Club in Florida, said she had been fielding calls about how people can donate to two camps established along the Suwannee and Santa Fe rivers. She said said the pipeline poses a range of environmental concerns, including endangering the local groundwater supply and the risk of sinkholes. Martin said there are also major environmental justice concerns that the locations of compressor stations, which she said affected air quality, would have a disproportionate impact on African American communities. Malwitz-Jipson has been encouraging people to document construction violations and reach out to lawmakers. The project also faces legal challenges, including by the Sierra Club. Sabal Trail, a joint venture of Spectra Energy Corp, NextEra Energy and Duke Energy, according to a website for the pipeline, is slated to become operational in the fall.  In an email, Andrea Grover, the director of stakeholder outreach with the Sabal Trail Transmission, wrote: “Sabal Trail believes that this project, as authorized by the federal and state agencies, is a balanced plan for the route, construction techniques, and the approved measures to avoid, minimize or mitigate impacts.” She cited a company newsletter entitled “Common Misconceptions” and recently penned an op-ed on the subject in the Tallahassee Democrat. Other pipeline projects eliciting opposition include the Atlantic Coast pipeline, which would travel from West Virginia to North Carolina; the Bayou Bridge pipeline in Louisiana; and the Mountain Valley pipeline, which would travel through West Virginia and Virginia."

"His hands tucked tightly in the pockets of his jeans, Gilbert Sark nodded at the ice-covered bay stretched out before him. Decades ago, his grandfather – at the time one of the few in this First Nations community to own a truck – would spend winters ferrying people across the frozen bay to Prince Edward Island. One wintry day, the truck hit a patch of soft ice, sending it plunging into the frigid waters below.  His grandfather didn’t make it out of the truck in time. “That bay has claimed a lot of people,” said Sark. “Now it’s claiming land.” For as long as anyone can remember, life on Lennox Island – a community of some 450 people on the east coast of Canada – has been set to the rhythm of the waters that lap its shores of red sand. But climate change is drastically altering this relationship, sending sea levels rising, pelting the small island with fiercer and more frequent storms and bringing warmer winters that eat away at the ice cover that traditionally protected the shores for months at a time. The result is impossible to ignore. “We’re losing our island,” said Sark. A survey of the island carried out in 1880 counted 1,520 acres of land. In 2015, surveyors mapped out 1,100 acres of land on Lennox Island – suggesting more than 300 football fields worth of land have been swallowed by the sea within the span of a few generations.  Sark pointed to the shoreline next to the cemetery where his mother and many other members of his family are buried. “There used to be a field right there. We used to play football in that area.” The community recently spent tens of thousands of dollars to save the graveyard from the encroaching waters, building a wall made up of three layers of rock. “They had to fix it or there would be caskets going out into our bay,” said Sark. “It was that close.” The scars of the island’s battle against climate change are visible across this low-lying island. Local people recall playing baseball where boats now bob in the water; homes that once sat 20ft from the shore now teeter precariously close to the sea. The shoreline has crept up to the edges of the community’s decade-old sewage lagoon, sparking concerns that a storm surge could send waste into Malpeque Bay, a world-renowned site for harvesting oysters. The community’s sacred burial grounds, located on an adjacent island, have also started washing away, revealing arrowheads, ceramic bowls and the skeletal remains of the community’s ancestors. Each time, the exposed sites have been moved inland, said Sark. “But it’s only a Band-Aid solution, because they’re just going to wash out again after.”  In his role as community planner, Sark is among those tasked with guiding a community scrambling to respond to the rapidly changing island – a confrontation that pits thousands of years of history and identity against the effects of climate change. “This is our home,” said Sark. “It just isn’t that everybody’s got individual houses here. There’s carbon dating on a lot of our artefacts that are here – we’ve been here for over 10,000 years.” At one recent meeting Sark asked residents where they saw the community in 25 to 50 years. “One of them said underwater,” said Sark. “Their energies and thoughts now are more geared towards where are we going to live, how are we going to get housing out there for our community members, are we going to be more one community – or are we going to be stretched out over different plots of land?” The community has yet to come up with concrete answers to these questions, he said. Over the past three decades, Danny Tuplin has watched the island’s shoreline inch closer to his two-storey house. Only a few years ago, his home sat 10ft from the water. Then in 2004, a hurricane-strength nor’easter blizzard brought the ocean to his doorstep.  “I went out the back door, I took five steps and I was in salt water,” said the 58-year-old. He has since reinforced the nearby shoreline, pouring 40 truckloads of filler and raising it higher. “It’s not going to stop it, inevitably it will come, I’m thinking. But hopefully I’ll be dead and gone by then.”  Lennox Island – an area roughly 1.5 times the size of New York’s Central Park – is losing about a hectare (2.47 acres) a year, offering a microcosm of what climate change could do around the world, said Adam Fenech, who leads the Climate Lab at the University of Prince Edward Island. Fenech has been working closely with local residents to map out what the future of Lennox Island could look like. So far, the suggestions of what’s to come are dire, with the worst-case scenario forecasting a rise in sea levels of as much as three metres in the next 50 years – which would leave about half of Lennox Island underwater. “But you never really know,” said Fenech. “Our estimates of sea level rise keep changing year to year and it’s going in the bad direction.”  The community is taking few chances. While Canadians were debating the need for climate change action – the previous Conservative government pulled out of the Kyoto protocol in 2011 – the community commissioned a series of computer simulations aimed at understanding the full impact of climate change on their land.  “It’s been always on the radar,” said Chief Matilda Ramjattan. “My biggest concern is not so much of a quick fix as much as long-term sustainable, because I have to think about generations in the future.”  Consultations are under way to determine how best to save the island. Something like the rock wall built to shore up the cemetery would be ideal but it is simply too pricey to implement all the way around the island.  The community is also exploring the possibility of developing a few pieces of property on Prince Edward Island that the First Nation bought in recent years. But Ramjattan stressed that this didn’t mean the community would abandon the island to the effects of climate change. “We’re not going anywhere. We’re resilient. We’re going to do what we can to protect our little island.”  As he looked out at the partially frozen bay that claimed the life of his grandfather, Sark wondered how his own battle with the sea would pan out. “All you can do is slow it down. We lost hundreds of acres in that one little span, but if we can slow it down to a crawl then maybe we can keep what we have for a little while longer.”  The 37-year-old pointed to his mobile phone. “Humans can do these incredible things, we can make all these advancements, no problem,” he said. “But a lot of the stuff we take for granted – what you see once you look out the window – those are the things that we need to fix. And nobody’s lifting a finger to do it.”"
"Scott Eustis did not stop smiling for hours. The coastal wetland specialist with the Gulf Restoration Network was attending a public hearing in Baton Rouge. Its subject was a pipeline extension that would run directly through the Atchafalaya Basin, the world’s largest natural swamp. Eustis was surprised to be joined by more than 400 others. “This is like 50 times the amount of people we have at most of these meetings,” said Eustis, adding that the proposed pipeline was “the biggest and baddest I’ve seen in my career”.  The company behind the pipeline, Energy Transfer Partners (ETP), had seemed to turn its attention to Louisiana just one day after Native American protesters thwarted the company’s Dakota Access project last month.  A spokeswoman for ETP, Vicki Granado, said the Bayou Bridge pipeline extension was announced in June 2015. If approved, the project will run though 11 parishes and cross around 600 acres of wetlands and 700 bodies of water, including wells that reportedly provide drinking water for some 300,000 families. At the public hearing in Baton Rouge on Thursday, the first speaker, Cory Farber, project manager of the Bayou Bridge pipeline, said it was expected to create 2,500 temporary jobs. When Farber then said the project would produce 12 permanent jobs, the crowd laughed heartily. “Those who have airboat companies and equipment companies that specialize in putting in equipment, they’re not opposed to pipelines because of the short-term jobs,” said Jody Meche, president of the state Crawfish Producers’ Association, one of dozens who spoke at the hearing.  “But once that pipe is in there, the jobs are gone.” Other attendees applauded in favor of the pipeline, and former US senator Mary Landrieu of Louisiana, a supporter, was in attendance. But Native Americans also dotted the crowd, many of them fresh from Standing Rock.  “The Native Americans in North Dakota get a lot of credit for showing people their power,” Eustis said. Protester Cherri Foytlin, organizer of the pro-sustainability Bridge the Gulf project, brought her teenage daughters, Jayden and Erin. In November, Erin and 20 other kids from around the country filed a lawsuit against the federal government for ignoring climate change. The suit will soon go to trial. Meche not only makes his living in the Atchafalaya Basin, but he also calls it home. Where most in attendance worried about potential oil spills and their effect on drinking water, Meche was more concerned with ways existing pipelines have, he said, “crippled” the fishing industry. “They excavated the trench that they put the pipe in and then [they didn’t clean up] and it leaves a dam behind that blocks the water flow,” he said on the microphone, “until there’s not enough oxygen in the water for the crawfish, the fish, or anything.” Meche said these left-behind “spoil banks” also disintegrate and slip down into the interior of the swamp, filling it with silt. “Areas that were 8ft deep 20 or 30 years ago are now a hill,” he claimed, adding that it all increases flood risk to boot. After his three minutes were up, he left the microphone, breathing heavily. Debate was fierce. Pro-pipeline speakers – oil industry reps, state representatives, a retired Louisiana State University professor – pointed out that many pipelines already run through the Atchafalaya Basin and said pipelines were in general the safest way to transport oil – in the case of the Bayou Bridge pipeline, 280,000 barrels per day of crude to the Gulf coast region, with the potential for 480,000.  At a pre-hearing teach-in outside in the long shadow of Baton Rouge’s capital building, Anne Rolfes and her Louisiana Bucket Brigade activists repeated how pipelines caused 144 accidents in Louisiana alone last year.  Pipeline supporters countered by citing a Frasier institute study from 2015 that said rail transport of oil was more than 4.5 times more likely to experience an accident than pipelines, and that 99% of pipeline accidents from 2003 to 2013 did not damage the environment. Pipeline PR materials also say pipelines are cleaner and more environmentally safe than rail transport because they don’t burn fossil fuels. ETP’s new pipeline plans also acknowledge the need to deal with spoil banks, and include a suggested post-construction initiative to improve water quality and flow to the basin. If he thought this was true, Meche said, he would support the idea. “I have no problem with the pipeline if they do it right,” he said. “I do like my oil and gas.”  He just suspected that ETP would not go the extra mile. “You know how much money you’re talking about, bringing tractors back in the basin to fix all that? They’re only going to pay what they are obligated to do, and nothing else.” Rolfes also scoffed at oil industry promises. “The best way to determine the future is to look at the past,” she said. “And you can see how honest they were about filling the old canals: there’s not a single example of them fixing the existing spoil banks.” At least, as activists see it, Louisiana residents are starting to really care about environmental issues and, more importantly, to make themselves heard. “A lot of times we don’t get this opportunity to speak up,” said Eustis, still admiring the surprisingly large crowd. “[These oil companies] want to just roll over us.  “But after Katrina, and the BP spill, and the Baton Rouge flood last year – 100,000 people displaced from their homes because of climate change – I guess we’re finally just sick of this.”"
"My twins are “studying” Jack and the Beanstalk, and I’ve just packed them off to school with my battered copy of Ladybird’s Well-Loved Tales. I’ve collected a few old Ladybirds from car boot sales because they are beautiful and nostalgic, hailing from a time when truths were simpler and there was faith in the future. My favourite is The Story of Newspapers, a Ladybird Achievements Book that is testimony to the speed of terrifying technical obsolescence – and welcome progress. A drawing of a newsroom where all 14 journalists are men shows the past wasn’t always lovely.  Now our affection for perhaps the most perfectly packaged objects in publishing has been reawakened by the satirical Ladybird series for adults. Like more than a million others, I received one – The Dad – for Christmas. The next Ladybird relaunch sounds like another spoof: Prince Charles is co-writing a book explaining climate change, the first in a new Expert series. While Ladybird’s spoofs clock in at about 800 words, the Expert range, covering topics from evolution to the Battle of Britain, are 5,000 words. Charles’ co-authors are the polar scientist Emily Shuckburgh and the environmental campaigner Tony Juniper, and Penguin stresses that their words have been peer-reviewed by other scientists. Hooray for Ladybird’s championing of expertise, but I wonder if it will chime with readers reprogrammed to see the books as satire. Perhaps Ladybird should commission Michael Gove to write The Ladybird Book of Brexit. I’m sure there would be a readership for a spoof Ladybird called Climate Change Deniers. A few laughs might be an effective educational tool too. The cover of Prince Charles’ book was inspired by the flooding of the Sussex town of Uckfield in 2000, which led him to criticise humanity’s “arrogant disregard of the delicate balance of nature”. Much-trailed floods failed to materialise along Britain’s east coast this weekend, and non-appearing blizzards were much mocked as #snowmageddon. One popular meme of a two-dimensional snowman created by laying a carrot nose and two twig arms on to two puddles is the sum total of the snowmen my children have witnessed during their five years on this warming planet. I recently interviewed Greenland residents, for whom adapting to climate changes is part of everyday life. We don’t really consider ourselves to be living climate-changed lives in Britain, but my childhood 30 years ago was enlivened by two winter blizzards that each shut down my village for a week. That snowmaggedon was great for community spirit. I’m convinced that the gales and sleet that dusted my home with white for an hour last Friday would have been a proper blizzard back in the 1980s. I’m saddened that those days are unlikely to return for my children, but we needn’t mourn any loss of extreme weather-induced community spirit. There’s been plenty in evidence during the recent precautionary evacuations along the east coast. And there’ll be plenty more in the future. We humans may be hopeless at acting in our long-term interests over climate change, but our ingenuity can be boundless when desperate. Take HMP Channings Wood, in Devon, where staff have reportedly had to ban sugar and fruit used by inmates to brew homemade booze after smoking was banned. After the Isle of Man’s prison became the first in Europe to ban smoking in 2008, prisoners improvised roll-ups from pages of Gideons Bibles packed with tumble drier lint and pubic hair. But will we devise something equally clever to stop the planet smoking?"
"Oslo will ban diesel cars from the road for at least two days this week to combat rising air pollution, angering some motorists after they were urged to buy diesel cars a few years ago. The ban will go into effect on Tuesday on municipal roads but will not apply on the national motorways that criss-cross the Norwegian capital. Better atmospheric conditions are expected on Thursday. Motorists violating the ban will be fined 1,500 kroner (£174).  This is the first time Oslo has implemented a ban of this type after the city council – made up of the Labour and Greens parties – agreed in principle in February 2016 on the use of such a measure. While diesel cars emit less CO2 they emit more nitrogen dioxyde. “In Oslo, we can’t ask children, the elderly, and those suffering from respiratory problems to remain holed up at home because the air is too dangerous to breathe,” a Greens city councillor Lan Marie Nguyen Berg said. The measure has angered some motorists, who were encouraged in 2006 by Norwegian authorities to opt for diesel vehicles, which at the time were considered a better environmental choice than petrol-fuelled cars. “Make up your minds. It wasn’t very long ago that diesel was recommended over petrol by Jens (Stoltenberg, Norway’s former prime minister, now Nato’s secretary general). Not sure you really know what is best,” wrote an annoyed Irene Signora Maier Tziotas on the Facebook page of the newspaper Verdens Gang. Mazyar Keshvari, an MP from the populist right Progress Party, which is a member of the coalition government, urged motorists to seek compensation. “The biggest swindle of Norwegian motorists has now become a reality,” he told the Norwegian broadcaster TV2. “This was part of the red-green government’s (Stoltenberg’s coalition) ingenious climate measures “Not only did they recommend motorists to buy diesel cars, they also changed the taxes to make them less expensive. That led a lot of people buying a car that they can’t use now.” Other Norwegians were more philosophical. “Very good measure. We should introduce a permanent ban on diesel in all big cities. The fines should also be doubled,” Kenneth Tempel wrote on VG’s Facebook page. According to the Norwegian Institute of Public Health, air pollution causes 185 premature deaths in Oslo each year."
" Research touted by the resources minister that reportedly suggests Australia can rely on coal to meet emissions reduction has been attacked by experts and appears to have been misreported. The Australian reported on Tuesday that research conducted by the Department of Industry, Innovation and Science – and commissioned by Matt Canavan, the federal minister for resources – showed Australia could cut its emissions by 27% if it replaced its existing coal power stations with the more efficient “ultra-supercritical” technology. If true, that would get the country close to its 2030 target, which is a reduction of 28% below 2005 levels. However, a summary of the analysis seen by Guardian Australia suggests the new coal technology – under a very expensive demolition and construction program – could reduce Australia’s emissions by 12% at most. In fact, to reduce Australia’s emissions by 27% by relying on reductions in the electricity industry alone, the sector’s emissionswould need to be reduced to almost zero. Australia’s entire electricity sector only accounts for about a third of its carbon emissions. On the basis of the analysis, Canavan released a statement attacking “people who oppose the coal industry for ideological reasons”. “Coal has an important role to play as Australia, and the rest of the world, reduce carbon dioxide emissions,” he said. “Australia has the resources to be a low-cost and efficient energy superpower. Access to affordable and reliable power underpins our economy and is the key to long-term jobs in the manufacturing sector.” But energy analyst Olivia Kember from the Climate Institute said locking in decades of emissions from new coal generators would jeopardise longer-term commitments made in Paris, including reaching net zero emissions in the second half of the century. “Australia has committed through the Paris Agreement to achieve net zero emissions. Building new coal stations that can go no further than a reduction of 25% to 34% doesn’t achieve the net zero goal, and would lock Australia into decades of high-carbon electricity while the rest of the world is switching to clean power,” Kember said.  “That’s such a risky outcome that I doubt any financial institutions would even finance investments in ultra-supercritical coal in Australia.” Australia’s chief scientist reached a similar conclusion in his preliminary report on the future security of the electricity market, which was commissioned by the Turnbull government. In the report Alan Finkel said: “Owner-investors are exiting emissions-intensive power stations as these reach the end of their design lives. It has been clear from our consultations that no one is contemplating investing in new ones, nor would financial institutions provide finance.” Rod Campbell, an economist at the Australia Institute, said an ambitious plan to replace all of Australia’s existing coal power stations with brand new ones would drive up electricity prices. And it would do so by more than if coal was replaced with renewable energy. Campbell pointed to government-funded clean-coal research from 2015, which already showed energy from some new-built wind farms was cheaper than advanced coal power stations. And that report claimed that by 2030, all wind and solar would be cheaper. But more up-to-date analysis from the US financial advisors, Lazard, shows that almost all new wind and and solar power is now cheaper than almost all new coal power. Labor’s spokesperson for climate change and energy, Mark Butler, said Canavan’s intervention was part of an ideological attack on renewable energy. “For a government that has been so vocal about not picking winners, the Turnbull government seems to be very comfortable picking coal as Australia’s future energy source,” he said in a statement. “The latest intervention by Minister Canavan trumpeting coal isn’t about securing a reliable and affordable energy future; at its core it is just the latest ideological attack on renewables by a government desperate to draw attention away from the fact it has no plan on energy and climate,” Butler said. Brendan Pearson, the chief executive of the mining lobby group, the Minerals Council of Australia, welcomed the departmental report saying it showed “new coal generation technologies can reduce Australia’s emissions sharply while providing reliable and affordable energy to households and businesses.” “It is simply common sense that these technologies be part of Australia’s efforts to meet its emissions reduction targets while maintaining affordable and secure energy supply,” he said in a statement."
"In the last six years, some 140 million people have been forced to move because of climate-related disasters (Mongolian herders fly steppe blighted by climate extremes and social change, 5 January). Climate change is driving long-term environmental damage and sudden catastrophes, presenting a global long-term threat to human security. According to the UN, by mid-century, one in 30 people could be displaced, many as a result of climate change. Existing global inequalities are exacerbated by the injustice of climate change which severely affects the poorest and most vulnerable, those who have contributed least to the climate crisis. Although climate change and enforced migration are increasingly linked, those displaced have no legal standing under existing international refugee and asylum law. Record-breaking increases in global temperature mask the unequal impact of planetary warming. Temperature increases in Mongolia have risen by more than double the global average over the past century. Elsewhere, in Somalia, Darfur, Syria and across sub-Saharan Africa, the chronic effects of drought, water scarcity and agricultural crises in rural areas no longer able to sustain their peoples have driven hundreds of thousands of migrants into cities and across borders. Safe haven is provided overwhelmingly by other poor countries, whilst richer countries respond by building walls and fences and a political debate that is toxic and often racist.  In response, our respective organisations, with wide support across civil society and trade unions, are organising Europe’s first national conference on climate refugees in London on 11 February. Our conference will discuss the need for urgent international protection for climate refugees and migrants, and for far stronger public awareness and government leadership to tackle this fundamental issue.Suzanne Jeffrey Chair, Campaign Against Climate Change Trade Union Group Asad Rehman Senior campaigner, international climate, Friends of the Earth  • Join the debate – email guardian.letters@theguardian.com • Read more Guardian letters – click here to visit gu.com/letters"
"A new study has shown that a 2015 NOAA paper finding that the Earth is warming more rapidly than previously thought was correct.   Once again, science is shown to work. The laborious process in which scientists check and recheck their work and subject their ideas to peer review has led to another success. An independent test of global warming data has confirmed a groundbreaking 2015 study that showed warming was faster than prior estimates.  Because of its inconvenient findings, the study’s lead author Thomas Karl was subjected to harassment by Lamar Smith (R-TX), chair of the House Science Committee, in an effort to impugn his credibility. But now Karl and his co-authors have been vindicated.  Let’s take a step back and discuss the science. Measuring the temperature of the Earth is hard. There are many locations to measure and many choices to make. Should we measure the temperature of the ground? Of the ocean waters? How deep in the water? If we measure air temperatures, what height should the measurements be taken? How many locations should we make measurements at? What happens if the instruments change over time or if the location changes? What happens if a city grows near a measurement location and the so-called urban heat-island effect grows? How do we estimate the temperatures in areas where no measurements exist?  These and many other questions make measuring global warming challenge. Different groups of scientists make different decisions so that depending on the institution, they will get a slightly different temperature result.  But this diversity is also a good thing. It turns out that it doesn’t matter whose results you use – NASA, NOAA, The Hadley Centre in the UK, the Japanese Meteorological Agency, or the Berkeley Earth group – they all report a warming world. However, the rates are slightly different. So, one persistent question is, which group is most accurate? Whose methods are best? The new study looks into just this question. The group focused on perhaps the biggest differences among the groups – how they handle ocean temperatures. Specifically, global temperature values typically use a combination of near-surface air temperatures in land regions and sea surface temperatures in ocean regions. Since oceans cover approximately 70% of our planet, the way ocean temperatures are dealt with can separate the warming rates between these groups. Ocean temperatures can be measured by ship-based temperature sensors, by special floating measuring instruments, or by satellites. Prior to the advent of satellites and floating sensors, ships were the main temperature sensing platforms. Ship sensors, which measure engine intake water, are known to be slightly warmer than the actual water. So using them introduces a warm bias in the measurements.  Also, as ships have gotten larger, the depth of the engine intakes have increased – meaning the tested water was further from the actual ocean surface. Since the temperature results from buoys differs from ship measurements, the various scientific groups have tended to try to perform corrections between the different sensors. The way the correction is done affects the reported warming rate. The authors recognized that one of the biggest questions is how to stitch together different temperature results from different sensors. Therefore, they broke the temperature data up into groups according to the measurement device (buoys, satellites, ARGO floats, ships, etc.) and they evaluated warming rates separately for each group. The authors also used advanced statistics to handle areas where no data were recorded.  After applying their tests, the authors found that the results promoted by Karl at NOAA are the best, and other groups, in particular the Hadley Centre in the UK and the Japanese agency, are too cold. So what does this all mean? A few things. First, this study is a nice reminder that the proper way for science to work is for publications to be scrutinized and checked by others. This process leads the entire scientific community to a deeper understanding of the science. Second, this validates the scientists who were originally attacked by political non-scientists and in some cases by contrarian scientists. For instance, Judith Curry, a well-known critic of mainstream climate science was quoted as saying: The new NOAA dataset disagrees with a UK dataset, which is generally regarded as the gold standard for global sea surface temperature datasets … The new dataset also disagrees with ARGO buoys and satellite analyses ... Color me unconvinced.  I actually study ocean temperatures so I knew this statement by Judith Curry was complete nonsense. It is nice to see a team actually take the time to prove it. Perhaps she and others will finally admit they were wrong. This paper is another reminder why it is so important to invest in the temperature measurements that are needed to create long-term climate records. We really need uninterrupted measurements that span many years/decades if we want to truly understand the Earth’s changing climate. Even though the costs of making these measurements are very small compared to what we spend on other less important activities, I am concerned that the new US administration will decide to pull the plug on these projects. If that happens, we will be flying blind. Finally, and for those who read my posts regularly, I am sounding like a broken record. Global warming is happening, it never stopped, it never paused, and the models have gotten it right. It reminds me of a debate between creationists and scientists. One scientist whose name I cannot remember stated, “we have the fossil record, we win.” Well, a similar quote works here. “We have the data, we win.” Now let’s move on to solving the problem."

"A digital consultant from Brighton whom Donald Trump mistook for his daughter on Twitter says she is more concerned by the prospect of a climate change denier in the White House than someone who makes slip-ups on social media. Ivanka Majic, 42, a former digital director for the Labour party, said it was “very surreal” to discover that the president-elect had retweeted a message intending to praise his daughter, Ivanka Trump, that included her Twitter name instead.  Trump quoted a praiseworthy tweet directed to him by Lawrence Goodstein, a Twitter user in Seekonk, Massachusetts, that described his daughter Ivanka as “a woman with real character and class” late on Monday. But Goodstein had mistakenly put @Ivanka, not @IvankaTrump – not a significant mistake in light of Goodstein’s 160-odd followers, but of far greater consequence circulated by Trump to his 20.1 million. Overnight Majic’s Twitter followers more than doubled as she found herself thrust into the spotlight by a man who will be sworn in as president on Friday. She said she was keen to use the attention to speak out on the environment. “I’ve got my 15 minutes of fame and this is how I’m choosing to use it,” Majic told the Guardian.  Replying to Trump, she tweeted: “And you’re a man with great responsibilities. May I suggest more care on Twitter and more time learning about #climatechange.” She also tweeted data pointing out that 97.5% of publishing climatologists and about 90% of all publishing scientists supported the human-induced climate change theory. @realDonaldTrump @drgoodspine And you're a man with great responsibilities. May I suggest more care on Twitter and more time learning about #climatechange. pic.twitter.com/kBMEGZYtig Majic said Trump’s error was a careless mistake. “One would hope that the future president of the US would pay a little more attention, but I’m sure anybody could have made the same mistake. “What is of more concern to me is that we have a president-elect who is a climate change denier.”  Majic said that because of her Twitter name, @Ivanka, she had often been mistaken for Ivanka Trump on the social network, but her politics were very different from the Trump family’s.  She said: “It is not the first time I’ve been included in a tweet to him or to his daughter, but it is the first time I’ve been mentioned in something that Donald Trump has retweeted. So this isn’t new, but it is new for it to be this big. “My politics are very different from Donald Trump’s. During the election campaign I had a Twitter bot that replied to anyone who had @Ivanka and Trump in the same tweet, with the message: ‘Don’t know about you but I’m voting for Hillary.’ “The other thing I get mistaken for is a Hungarian concrete company called Ivanka Concrete, but that’s easy to deal with.”  Majic, whose father was a Croat from Bosnia-Herzegovina, said: “Ivanka is an incredible common Slavic name. It is about as boring as you can get. So Ivanka Trump and I share that at least.” She added: “I came down in morning to find lots of Twitter notifications. It’s very surreal. There is no other word for it. “None of this annoying. It is remarkable. Even 10 years ago it could have never have happened that a president-elect of the United States of America accidentally mentions a fairly normal citizen from Brighton. It is a 21st-century story that raises lots of interesting questions … about how you choose your Twitter handle, for starters.” As a freelance digital consultant, Majic advises clients to keep a low profile when caught up in social media storms. “I am probably not doing what I would advise others to do. I would advise them to switch off their phones and go for a nice walk.   “If one is given a platform for a day, I don’t think me slinging any insults or being disparaging towards the president will be helpful, but I do think mentioning climate change might invite some people to reconsider their views, or learn something, or read something.” Majic said Trump’s cabinet nominations, notably the choice of the ExxonMobile chief executive, Rex Tillerson, as secretary of state, meant these were “worrying times for the world”. Majic, who has a young daughter, is also troubled by Trump’s sexism. She said: “That a man got elected after making comments that he did about women is really worrying.  “A conversation about climate change may be slightly easier to elevate online than a conversation about being respectful to women. And that is itself a problem, but there you go.” Majic said she wanted to engage in a “polite” debate rather than trading insults with Trump. But she does not expect Trump to continue the conversation. “I don’t expect a reply – I don’t think he’s a man who likes to make mistakes,” she said.  “I am happy to tweet a polite message to Donald Trump saying: ‘Please pay attention to climate change.’ What I don’t want to get embroiled in is some flame war about calling him something.  “Of course I’m worried about Donald Trump being president of the United States, but let’s hope he does a good job.”"

"“Before we were flooded a couple of years ago, we didn’t imagine the water could reach this level,” said cafe manager Samir Gaber, gesturing at a cluster of tables overlooking the Mediterranean.  Gaber has managed the Latino cafe in Alexandria for six years, during which time the business has had to adapt to increasingly dramatic winter storms. With the storms come the floods, crashing waves engulfing large chunks of the many cafes nestled on the coastline.   “There was another wall here before the flooding, but the steel bars [supporting it] were destroyed,” explained Gaber. “Now we’ve constructed a drain to absorb floodwater,” he said, gesturing below the new stone wall running along the outside edge of the cafe. Many of the cafes and businesses on the Alexandria coast have begun adjusting to extreme weather without making the link to climate change.  On the southern tip of the Mediterranean, the coastal waters are inching closer to buildings and flooded ancient structures, including the Greco-Roman tombs at Anfushi. Seawater seeping into the groundwater has also made the fragile ground more unstable, resulting in the alarming collapse of some of the city’s buildings.  The UN estimates that global sea levels will rise between 13cm and 68cm by 2050, and say that the Mediterranean is particularly vulnerable – by 2080, up to 120,000 people living near the sea could be affected by rising waters if no action is taken to protect them.  Rising sea levels and seawater temperatures will also increase the salinity of the Nile, Egypt’s primary water source, and increasingly salty water sources could destroy farmland across the Nile Delta. In 2007, the World Bank estimated that 10.5% of Egypt’s population could be displaced by rising waters caused by climate change.  An hour to the east from Alexandria, the quiet of the town of Rosetta ignores the urgency of the lapping waters. Life in the town, famed for the discovery of the Rosetta stone, is at one with the sea.  “You have to do what you have to do, and don’t think about the bad weather – the good weather comes from God,” said fisherman Ahmed Mohamed Gowayed, reciting a local saying.  Storms annually disrupt the calm of this low-lying town where houses sit at sea level, many only separated from the coast by a winding coast road. But in recent years the weather has been more violent. “Last year the storm destroyed palm trees, buildings, cars – older people in their seventies said they’d never seen anything like it in their lives,” said Gowayed. The storm also destroyed barges and kiosks that local fishermen rely on for their livelihoods.  “If the weather continues like this I will build a stronger kiosk,” smiled Gowayed, undeterred by the prospect of the next storm.  Mohamed El Raey, professor of environmental studies at Alexandria University, believes that climate change is contributing to an increase in “extreme events”, across Egypt. “The government needs to increase awareness among the population,” he said. They also need to be more stringent about urban planning, he added. “If people don’t find places to live that they like, they build houses wherever they find an area.”  In 2011, the government released a report detailing how the country must adapt to climate change, estimating that about 13% of Egypt’s northern coastline was at risk.  Political and economic upheavals have since diverted their attention elsewhere, but in Alexandria and Rosetta the impact of climate change is becoming increasingly hard to ignore."
"A few weeks ago, a significant anniversary in Maastricht slipped by almost unnoticed: 25 years ago, the historic treaty that ushered in the euro was drafted.  But there was no fanfare, no commemoration in the European parliament, no mention at all by the commission. There was just a rather lacklustre speech by the EU president, Jean-Claude Juncker, in which he lamented that people were not sufficiently proud of what had been achieved on 9 December 1991.  This air of resignation perfectly epitomises an EU in retreat. Battered, bothered and bewildered on all sides by a succession of crises – Brexit, the euro, refugees – the union is short of ideas, perhaps shorter than it has ever been.  In his state of the union speech last autumn, the very best that Juncker could come up with was free Wi-Fi for every EU town and village by 2020, though even this sounded more like an aspiration than a concrete policy. The so-called Bratislava roadmap, announced in September, suggested a way forward for the EU, but was full of dull phrases such as: “The EU is not perfect but it is the best instrument we have for addressing the new challenges we are facing”, and “broaden EU consensus on long-term migration policy and apply the principles of responsibility and solidarity”. Few eye-catching initiatives have been scheduled for 2017, as leaders both national and supranational concentrate instead on keeping the project together and stopping the rot. Jeroen Dijsselbloem, the Dutch finance minister, captured the feeling when he said one of the reasons behind Europe’s vulnerability was a failure to complete ambitious changes. “We start projects but never really seem to finish them,” he told the Guardian and a group of European newspapers last summer.  One clear lesson of 2016 was that rightwing populism seemed to appeal to voters because it, at least, had ideas, and that the left and centre ground had come up with few counter-proposals to match. On the other hand, the message from nation states, so brutally articulated in Britain’s Brexit vote, is overwhelmingly one of “less Europe”.  And so Europe is paralysed, caught in a catch-22; torn between putting forward great ideas that can hit back against demagogues and restraining its own meddling tendencies. And this paralysis will have significant implications for the major projects the EU has started but not yet finished.  Once upon a time the environment was the EU’s next big idea. Europe as a peace project was no longer a selling point for younger generations who had grown up with wars confined to history books and films.  A decade ago, David Miliband, a Labour politician once touted as a future British prime minister, argued that the environment was the issue that could best reconnect European leaders with disaffected citizens, and rebuild trust in EU institutions. “The needs of the environment are coming together with the needs of the EU,” he wrote in 2006. “One is a cause looking for a champion, the other a champion in search of a cause.” The EU was an obvious green champion. The goal that global warming should be limited to 2C was first endorsed by the EU environment council in 1996, at the urging of a then little-known German minister, Angela Merkel. The EU had also passed numerous laws to clean up beaches, restrict factory pollution and protect more than 1,500 types of birds, animals and plants. But dreams of an “Environmental Union” were fast eclipsed by the economic crisis and the desperate scramble to save jobs. Europe’s credibility was also dented by the failure to meet sky-high expectations at the Copenhagen climate summit in 2009.  The European project – founded on coal and steel industries – always struggled to close the gap between pledges and action. According to Climate Action Tracker, EU efforts to cut greenhouse gas emissions will fall short of the 40% reduction pledged for 2030, let alone a more stretching target demanded by the landmark Paris climate agreement in 2016. Janez Potočnik, who served as environment commissioner from 2010-2014, believes that too often vested interests trump ambitions for an environmentally friendly economy. “We are defending the indefensible,” he said. Instead of putting all of Europe’s resources “into the supporting future”, Europe was “defending the past and vested interests”. Perhaps there was no better example than the VW scandal, where one of Europe’s most successful companies was found to have cheated on emissions tests. Potočnik had been warning about problems with industry tests since 2011, although he says no one was aware of the extent of the manipulation. He recently told MEPs he was surprised VW could be “so irresponsible and fundamentally stupid”. While the EU may appear to be taking one step forward and two steps back, Potočnik disputes the claim that it has run out of ideas. He argues that the pressures of scarce land, water and other natural resources, combined with the interdependent nature of modern life, means that Europe’s model of shared sovereignty has to succeed. “The European Union is destined to be important [but] it depends how we will be capable of managing the issues in our own territory so we can be a strong partner.” That heady New Year’s Day in 2002 when Europeans across the continent started pulling €10, €20 and €50 notes out of ATMs seems like a long time ago. It seemed like a good idea at the time. But now, after seven years of on-off crisis, there is no clear idea on what to do about the single currency. No major initiatives are in the pipeline to resolve once and for all the incompatibility at the heart of the euro project. Governments are terrified of scaring financial markets – and voters. Finance minister meetings are an unedifying succession of stalemates. Southern powers want more pooled sovereignty, economic and fiscal strength in numbers, to insulate their vulnerable economies. Northerners demur, until their balance sheet risk is reduced. As long as these two schools of thought exist, the cycle of debt overhang and liability risk will continue.  The European Central Bank president, Mario Draghi, has drafted a roadmap to deepen economic and monetary union. But there are no unified ideas on how to take the 19-nation euro bloc towards fiscal and financial union, and all too quickly it has started to look like the kind of integration that demagogues mock and the people have rejected. Juncker took charge of the European commission in 2014 with a promise to boost jobs and growth, after a recession and period of austerity that had battered many European economies. But the EU’s inconclusive results cannot be blamed on a lack of big ideas, argues Guntram Wolff, director of the Bruegel thinktank. Whether it is stagnant productivity, the migration crisis or corporate tax avoidance, “there is no one switch you can flick”, but instead, numerous micro policies are needed to solve Europe’s problems, many of which are in the control of national governments. In a paper to be published this month, Bruegel economists will argue that if the EU wants to promote growth, it needs to focus on small technical changes to open up the trade in services, while tackling corporate tax avoidance requires the rewriting of several highly technical regulations. It is easy to romanticise the big ideas of the past, but behind the single market – the EU’s flagship policy of the 1980s – was “lots of tedious micro work”. Wolff warns EU institutions to be wary about over-promising what Brussels can do, giving the current debate on promoting equality as an example. “Social policy is national. Redistributive social policy is national … The EU has almost no instruments to ensure income inequality and education. The fact that income inequality in the UK is very high has almost nothing to do with the EU. It is very much to do with the choices of previous UK governments.” Instead of embarking on policies of “no substance”, he wants the European commission to focus on where it can make a difference, such as fighting tax evasion and welfare fraud that arise from the EU’s free movement of labour policy. Europe may remain a haven of relative prosperity, peace and democracy, but the sense of perma-crisis is taking its toll on core values. Perhaps even more than Brexit, the agreement between Brussels and Ankara last year to send back to Turkey refugees who had arrived in Greece has create a deep unease inside European institutions. It may have served to stop the migrant influx, but at a heavy cost, taking a toll on the cardinal EU value of openness. To avoid taking in populations fleeing war zones, the EU preferred to give billions of euros to a government that is violating the principle of freedom of expression. Held to ransom by the populist governments of eastern Europe that are implacably opposed to taking their share of refugees, the EU opted instead for realpolitik. Europe can be cynical when its interests are at stake. This goes for the policy of enlarging the EU, even if that hasn’t been acknowledged: there’s no question of starting new accession procedures with any outside country. The union of 28 (soon 27) wants a pause. Turkey, Montenegro, Serbia, Albania, Macedonia, Bosnia and Kosovo may face a long wait.  Since the union seems less able to defend democracy and human rights, what message is it sending beyond its borders? What is it for? Is it just there to protect its own societies from the perils of the outside world? If so, that is short-sighted. After all, the dangers to the EU are not just external, as Brexit and the rollback of freedom in eastern Europe have amply demonstrated."
"Apprentice tradies in northern Australia will swallow capsule thermometers to track their core body temperature during work hours as part of a range of studies to address productivity lost through heat stress in the tropics. A 2015 study found that heat stress cost the Australian economy $6.2bn in lost productivity and suggested that temperature increases due to climate change would cause productivity to decrease by up to 20% globally during summer months by 2050.  Dr Elspeth Oppermann, coordinator of the Heat Stress Research Partnership and a co-author of the 2015 study, said she believed the productivity loss was already greater than estimated in the tropical zone of northern Australia, where “unbearable” conditions persist for months. The research partnership aimed to study how local workers and workplaces adapted to working in extreme heat and humidity, particularly for outdoor workers, and develop appropriate heat stress management practices. It also aimed to track differences in physiological responses to extreme heat, which is where the thermometers come in. “What we ask them to do is swallow these little capsules that contain a gastro-intestinal thermometer that transmits people’s temperatures in real time over the course of a work shift,” Oppermann told Guardian Australia. “What’s of interest to us is how people work in these conditions. What we can do by observing their temperatures is see how their particular mode of working affects their core body temperatures.” Oppermann said the dual factors of climate change and federal government plans to develop northern Australia added urgency to the need to understand how to manage heat stress. She said health and safety guidelines for heat stress, which recommend stopping work if the temperature reaches 35C or 28C with 70% humidity, were not appropriate for the tropical zone, which spans the northern coastline from Broome to Townsville. “It’s very, very difficult for employers and employees because if they were to do that they would stop work very, very frequently,” she said. Recommended cooling practices for the dry heat of southern Australia, such as laying a wet flannel on your head or sitting in the shade, also don’t work in areas of high humidity such as Darwin or Broome. Instead, people need to do “active cooling” – taking a break inside an air-conditioned space, crunching ice or even sinking into an icy bath – to cool their core body temperature. Oppermann said the symptoms of heat stress, such as headaches, irritability and a “heat hangover”, were accepted as commonplace by many people working in northern Australia during the build-up to the wet season, from October to December, and one in four workers surveyed said they experienced the symptoms of heat stress once a week.  That’s exacerbated in some workplaces by “a macho culture of pushing through”. “People would often expect to feel headaches and irritability, and going home and just going to bed is a really common story,” she said. Others turn to alcohol, which makes matters worse by increasing dehydration. “Everyone knows anecdotally that people drink more when it’s hot,” she said. “It’s a response that’s understandable if your body feels exhausted because of heat stress.” The partnership is a joint project between group training organisations in the Kimberley, Northern Territory and far north Queensland, and researchers at Charles Darwin University, the Menzies School of Health Research, James Cook University and the Centre for Urban Research at RMIT."
"My first book on climate change was published 10 years ago. I looked at how responsible individuals could choose to run their lives to cut their carbon footprint.   Inevitably minimising your carbon footprint meant making some uncomfortable choices – stopping eating meat, for example, or giving up flying. Hair-shirtism, in short. In 2009, I advised individuals on how they could cut their carbon emissions by 10%.  I then disobeyed some of my own recommendations, flying to the US to visit a daughter at university, for example. Over the subsequent years, it increasingly seemed to me that changing western lifestyles in the way my first book suggested was going to be an impossible struggle.   Moreover, the world still had more than a billion people without an electricity supply. Any solution that didn’t give them access to power was unfair and unworkable. So I switched to writing about how we could substitute low-carbon energy sources for fossil fuels.  At first it seemed that renewable electricity would always be more expensive and solar power would languish unless it was heavily subsidised. Using alternative energy sources seemed difficult, expensive and inconvenient. I now think I was completely wrong. In fact, optimism about successfully tackling climate change has never been more justified because 2016 was the year in which it finally became obvious that the world had the technology to solve the problem. Even as the political environment has darkened, the reasons have strengthened for believing that a complete transition to low-carbon energy is practical and affordable within one generation.  Andrew Simms is right that global temperatures will probably overshoot the 2C target. But that makes the urgency of an energy transition even clearer. Despair is no excuse for inaction. Solar power costs around the world fell by an average of another 15% in 2016, meaning that electricity from the sun became the cheapest form of energy generation in places as diverse as Chile, parts of the Middle East and the south-west of the US. The world saw the lowest-ever auction price for solar electricity in Abu Dhabi.   China committed to adding about 40 gigawatts annually of solar panels in the next few years, more than half the new capacity installed across the entire world in 2016. India made similarly ambitious plans, meaning that these two countries will put more solar on the ground than the entire world did a couple of years ago.  As more photovoltaics are installed, costs fall in a predictable way, so that the drive towards using solar energy in Asia and elsewhere will feed through to lower prices across the whole world, including the UK. Even in gloomy Britain, the government now sees solar photovoltaics delivering electricity at less than 2% more than a new gas-fired power station in 2020, with costs continuing to fall thereafter. In sunny places around the world, solar may fall to less than half the price of fossil electricity within a decade.  Progress hasn’t been restricted to wealthier countries. In places without access to electricity grids, new businesses grew offering pay-as-you-go access to solar electricity.   Radically new approaches to solar technologies also saw major progress in 2016. The Dresden company Heliatek raised the money to build a new factory producing solar film that is printed on plastic backing and which can be simply pinned to the walls of buildings. Investors backed Oxford PV’s plans to start production of double-layer photovoltaic panels, using cheap and widely available “perovskite” materials originating in the university’s laboratories. Both companies demonstrated unexpected advances in the efficiency of their products at converting light to electricity. Wind turbine costs declined as well, falling to levels not expected for at least another decade in the case of offshore installations in the North Sea. In a particularly good location off the Netherlands, one consortium promised to build a large wind farm for less than €55 (£48) a megawatt hour, less than half the UK government’s target for offshore wind in 2020. According to the investment bank Lazard, onshore wind in the best locations in the US is now two-thirds the cost of the cheapest new gas-fired power stations. And progress wasn’t restricted to wind and solar photovoltaics. We saw the first anaerobic digestion plant added to an African grid, new geothermal heat collectors in the US, France, Kenya and several other countries, and the building of huge plants that collect the sun’s energy as heat, ensuring 24-hour availability of power in countries such as Morocco and Israel. Worldwide, more new renewable electricity capacity was added than all fossil fuels combined in 2015. The usually conservative International Energy Agency said that 60% of new electricity generation over the next five years will come from carbon-free sources. Wind and solar, which are going to become the dominant sources of global energy, cannot provide reliable 24-hour power. But improvements in short-term storage have come at a dazzling rate. For sunny countries, this means solar power combined with batteries will offer cheap and always available electricity.  Tesla’s huge Gigafactory opened in Nevada, driving down battery costs further. Large storage systems were installed in hundreds of locations around the world to help electricity grids cope with variable wind and sun. As importantly, rapid advances in digital technology allowed electricity users large and small to respond to shortages of electricity by cutting their own use for short periods.  Meanwhile the Chevy Bolt, the world’s first mass-market, 200-mile electric car, reached showrooms in California. World electric car sales grew by more than 50%, achieving more than a quarter of all new registrations in Norway, the world’s most advanced market. Chinese EV manufacturers sold a third of a million vehicles and, very surprisingly, a senior VW executive said that electric cars may be as cheap as petrol vehicles within five years. And they are already much cheaper to run. Even with extensive use of batteries, and continuing improvements in the ability of users to adjust electricity use, northern latitude countries will need more storage to cope with the short winter days and the possibility of weeks without wind. But the German company Electrochaea opened the first full-scale “power to gas” plant in the outskirts of Copenhagen in summer 2016. When electricity is abundant, and therefore very cheap, Electrochaea converts it into natural gas using microbes. This renewable gas can then be burned to generate power when electricity is scarce. In the autumn, Hungary signed an agreement to build an Electrochaea plant 10 times the scale of the Copenhagen trial. This is a technology with extraordinary potential for northern European countries. Other new technologies showed how energy can be stored conveniently for months at a time, usually as liquid fuels similar to petrol or kerosene. Several airlines ordered aviation fuel from the many pioneers making it from sources such as wood chippings or carbon monoxide from steel mills. Much more research is needed on fuels but the outlines of how the world will wean itself off oil are clear. At its simplest, we will use the very cheap electricity produced by wind and solar to chemically convert simple carbon molecules back up to more complex and energy-carrying liquids that can substitute for petrochemicals. As the world set new records for temperature, and the worrying effects of climate change grow more obvious by the week, the encouraging developments of 2016 provide some counterweight. For the first time we can hope that the momentum of low carbon growth is now unstoppable. In many cases around the globe, clean technology no longer needs any subsidy, a finding that seemed unachievable five years ago. Even with sceptical politicians in charge of major democracies, the end of the era of fossil fuels is within view. And this is not just a renewables enthusiast talking; the CEO of Shell said that solar will eventually become the “dominant backbone” of the energy system.  The speed of change needs to increase but we can see how it might be possible to run an entirely carbon-free world, including giving abundant energy to people in the poorest countries. I hope this is not an unduly complacent conclusion; we will still need to become far more efficient in our energy use and to push our politicians and business leaders to focus on sustainability. But we no longer have the excuse for inaction that it is too expensive or too difficult to wean ourselves off fossil fuel. The Switch by Chris Goodall on a future based on solar power is available from the Guardian bookshop.

"The incoming president of the United States will assume office as a tide of hundreds of thousands of women and allies from across the country, and over 350 cities worldwide, take to the streets to demonstrate their dire concerns, resistance, opposition and demands to the new administration. On 21 January, women and men will join the Women’s March on Washington, the largest protest in response to a new president in American history, to stand for a spectrum of diverse causes – including women’s and LGBTQ rights, racial justice, indigenous rights, immigration rights, worker’s rights and environmental justice.   Within the many distinct calls being made, however, there remains a collective driving force – a fierce understanding of the need to stand boldly for the safety of our world at a critical juncture for the Earth, women’s rights and the American democratic experiment. In response to Donald Trump’s dangerous position on climate change and appointment of fossil fuel industry executives and climate deniers to the country’s top leadership positions, a coalition of diverse groups will join the march as a Women for Climate Justice contingent. The groups are calling for immediate action on climate change, an end to extraction of fossil fuels, and protection of our lands, waters and children’s futures. The new administration’s stance on climate change is a threat to the entire world, but particularly to its women – as women work everyday to stop the devastation of communities and ecosystems; and as droughts, floods, extreme weather, infectious disease, and food and water insecurity disproportionately affect global women and the world’s 1.3 billion poor, the majority of whom are women.  It is important to highlight that violence against the Earth is directly linked to violence against women – and that patriarchy, colonization, imperialism and capitalism are all based in great part upon power over and exploitation of women, the land and peoples of color around the world.  These violent paradigms are manifested clearly in the current political landscape and threaten to escalate dangerously under the Trump administration, deepening multiple crises from accelerating climate change and environmental degradation, to detrimental social and economic injustices. Women standing for climate justice across the US and around the world refuse to accept this future, and in this context, we march to declare that women are going to continue to rise ever more boldly in defense of all we hold dear – no matter what challenges we face in a climate denying administration. We as women for climate justice march for full respect for climate science and immediate action on solutions to the global warming crisis – recognizing that it is a matter of life and death, and that justice on issues of economy, gender, race and immigration are completely interwoven with preventing the destruction of the planet for profit and power. We march to send a message to the new administration that it is far past time to reject the rule of the fossil fuel industry, and that we must take immediate action to leave fossil fuels in the ground and transition to a clean, just, decentralized, democratized and sustainable energy future. To do this, it is essential that frontline, grassroots women of color and indigenous women’s voices are at the forefront of the climate conversation, because they simultaneously bear the heaviest burden from environmental impacts, and work everyday to implement solutions born from necessity and to show that another world is possible. Women from every sector of society are frequently the backbone of movements to stop pipelines; preserve biodiversity; grow sustainable economies; feed the world; implement clean energy solutions; and challenge unjust economic, political and legal systems. The Women’s March on Washington is part of a strengthened and expanded call to action, and a declaration of our intent to forge ahead for social and ecological justice because we know we must act now. As you hear our strong voices in our nation’s capital and cities around the world on 21 January, know that women in the US and women of the world have a message to the new administration starting on day one: welcome to four years of audacious resistance and dauntless re-visioning. Women will take uncompromising action to prevent harms to our families and communities, and build a healthy and just world for the Earth and all future generations. "
"To have a good chance of keeping global warming under 2C, there is only a finite amount of carbon pollution the world can emit – this amount can be thought of as a fixed budget amount, or quota. Our countdown clock shows one estimate of how long it will take to reach an amount of greenhouse gas emissions beyond which 2C of warming will be likely. The total carbon budget remaining figure used is 2900 GtCO2-e (within a range of 2550 to 3150 depending on various factors). This is one estimate of the amount emissions need to stay under to limit total human-induced warming to less than 2C relative to the period 1861–1880 with a probability of >66%. Full details of how this figure was determined are in the IPCC Synthesis Report here. The rate of emissions is based on the most recent year of global emissions from the Global Carbon Project, and assumes no increase or decrease in emissions year-to-year as a ‘business as usual’ scenario."
"It is vitally important for investors to understand the risks that climate change may pose to the businesses they have invested in – and the opportunities in transitioning to a low-carbon economy. It’s not an easy task. Climate change may be one of the world’s best-modeled processes in physics, but in finance, the information is scarce. The projections are opaque. There is no consensus on which data matters or how to interpret it.  While the US has rules requiring public companies to disclose their climate risks, the government has been lax in enforcing these rules. A compelling example of that comes from a New York state government investigation revealing that the Missouri-based Peabody Energy, the world’s largest coal producer that filed for bankruptcy in April this year, had withheld its own projection that climate change would lower the demand for coal. The arrival of the Trump administration is causing concerns that the US will fall further behind in addressing climate change. When our government isn’t willing to step up, we have to take matters into our own hands. For companies that understand the value of identifying and analyzing their climate risks, new help has arrived. Earlier this month, an international task force led by former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg issued a sweeping set of 11 recommendations that give specific instructions on how companies in every industry should disclose information about climate risk and governance, strategy, risk management, metrics and targets. Just as crucially, the task force’s report takes into account the goal of the Paris climate agreement to keep the world’s rising temperatures at no more than 2C above pre-industrial levels. The report advises businesses to use the 2C warming scenario as a model for analyzing climate risks and the progress they are making. These guidelines are voluntary, that’s true. But this is a market-led effort that will have an outsized impact. The task force developed the recommendations with the help of heavyweights in business and finance, including investment firm BlackRock, French insurance company Axa and Unilever. I hope that the two global organizations that set corporate reporting standards, the International Accounting Standards Board and the Financial Accounting Standards Board, will adopt these recommendations. The mandate of the two groups is to protect investors. But shareholders don’t have to wait. This report gives a framework – and more firepower – to demand disclosure. Measuring the impacts of climate change will help us identify companies that we don’t want to put money into and identify new investment opportunities. Having an agreed upon framework means we can get working towards that economic opportunity. We have already seen evidence of how climate change is shaping lives. Research shows that global warming has worsened the drought that has gripped California since 2012. The drought has turned acres of arable land to dust and has led to billions of dollars in financial losses. We have also seen major investment opportunities that have emerged because of climate change: there are more solar energy jobs than in oil, natural gas and coal in the US. An analysis by the California Public Employees Retirement Systems (Calpers), which manages $300bn in assets, showed that more than 50% of the emissions from the public company stocks it holds comes from just 100 of over 10,000 companies it is invested in. During the next five years, I and others at Calpers will work with global investor coalitions to demand disclosure of emissions and plans for reducing the emissions from these firms. For too long the market has been in the dark about how exposed it is to risks and the opportunities that we all know are out there. Now we have the tools to manage these risks and make the most of new opportunities. We’re going to use them."
"2016 was the hottest year on record, setting a new high for the third year in a row, with scientists firmly putting the blame on human activities that drive climate change.  The final data for 2016 was released on Wednesday by the three key agencies – the UK Met Office and Nasa and Noaa in the US – and showed 16 of the 17 hottest years on record have been this century. Direct temperature measurements stretch back to 1880, but scientific research indicates the world was last this warm about 115,000 years ago and that the planet has not experienced such high levels of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere for 4m years. In 2016, global warming delivered scorching temperatures around the world. The resulting extreme weather means the impacts of climate change on people are coming sooner and with more ferocity than expected, according to scientists. The natural El Niño climate phenomenon, which helped ramp up temperatures to “shocking” levels in early 2016, has now waned, but carbon emissions were the major factor and will continue to drive rising heat.  Gavin Schmidt, director of Nasa’s Goddard Institute for Space Studies, said: “El Niño was a factor this year, but both 2015 and 2016 would have been records even without it.” He said about 90% of the warming signal in 2016 was due to rising greenhouse gas emissions. He expects 2017 to be another extremely hot year. The new data shows the Earth has now risen about 1.1C above the levels seen before the industrial revolution, when large-scale fossil fuel burning began. This brings it perilously close to the 1.5C target included as an aim of the global climate agreement signed in Paris in December 2015. The declaration of 2016 as a year of record-breaking heat comes just ahead of the inauguration of Donald Trump as US president. Trump has called global warming a hoax and is filling his administration with climate change deniers and former ExxonMobil boss Rex Tillerson. Tillerson said recently that climate change does exist but that the ability to predict the effects of greenhouse gas emissions is “very limited”, a statement most climate scientists would reject. Trump’s team has said it will strip away funding for “politically correct environmental monitoring”. Presenting the 2016 temperature data, Derek Arndt, at Noaa, said only: “We present this assessment for the benefit of the American people.” The three temperature records are independent but reached very similar conclusions. “The datasets are all singing the same song, said Arndt. The data from Noaa showed a run of 16 successive months from May 2015 to August 2016 when the global average temperature broke or equalled previous records, while no land area experienced an annual average temperature in 2016 that was cooler than 20th-century average.  Noaa also found Arctic sea ice fell to its lowest annual average extent on record and Antarctic sea ice to the second smallest extent on record. The warming in the Arctic in 2016 was “astounding”, Schmidt said. Prof Michael Mann, a climate scientist at Pennsylvania State University, said: “The spate of record-warm years that we have seen in the 21st century can only be explained by human-caused climate change. The effect of human activity on our climate is no longer subtle. It’s plain as day, as are the impacts – in the form of record floods, droughts, superstorms and wildfires – that it is having on us and our planet.” “While there may be some cost in mitigating climate change, there are already major costs in damages,” said Prof Kevin Trenberth, a scientist at the US National Center for Atmospheric Research, who estimates the costs as already tens of billions of dollars a year. “Yet if sensible approaches are implemented in the right way for [cutting emissions] and building resilience, the increases in energy efficiency can actually make it a net gain, not only for the planet for for everyone.” Bob Ward, policy director at the Grantham Research Institute on Climate Change at the London School of Economics, said: “Any politician who denies this evidence from world-class climate scientists will be wilfully turning a blind eye to rising risks that threaten the lives and livelihoods of their citizens.  “I hope that president-elect Trump and his team in particular will acknowledge and act on this important scientific information.” The head of the World Meteorological Organization (WMO), Petteri Taalas, said in November: “The extra heat from the powerful El Niño event has disappeared. The heat from global warming will continue. Because of climate change, the occurrence and impact of extreme events has risen. ‘Once in a generation’ heatwaves and flooding are becoming more regular.” A WMO report said human-induced global warming had contributed to at least half the extreme weather events studied in recent years, with the risk of extreme heat increasing by 10 times in some cases. The record-smashing temperatures in 2016 led to searing heatwaves across the year: a new high of 42.7C (108.9F) was recorded in Pretoria, South Africa in January; Mae Hong Son in Thailand saw 44.6C (112.3F) on 28 April; Phalodi in India reached 51.0C (123.8F) in May, and Mitribah in Kuwait recorded 54.0C (129.2F) in July. Warm oceans saw coral mortality of up to 50% in parts of Australia’s Great Barrier Reef and bleaching of 75% of Japan’s biggest reef. The level of CO2 in the atmosphere also broke records in 2016, with May seeing the highest monthly value yet – 407.7 ppm – at Mauna Loa, in Hawaii, the site of the longest-running measurements dating back to 1958. Global carbon emissions have barely grown in the last three years, after decades of strong growth, according to an analysis published in November. The main reason is China burning less coal, but CO2 is still being emitted into the atmosphere at record levels. “CO2 will continue to rise and cause the planet to warm until emissions are cut down to near zero,” said Prof Corinne Le Quéré at the University of East Anglia. Amid fears Donald Trump’s administration will shatter decades of hard-won progress on climate change, the Guardian, Univision and Tumblr are uniting to deliver 24 hours of live coverage from around the world on what is at stake. Hours from Trump taking power, we will be reporting from all seven continents, in English and Spanish, hearing from those most affected, and finding out how we can all help protect the planet. "
"Not even donkeys get a worse deal in popular culture than the reindeer. Rabbits, mice, cats and even bears all have their distorted images in cartoons, but all of them show some sympathetic qualities of intelligence or kindness. Only the reindeer is forced in songs and cartoons to live down to the mangy and dispirited creatures chained up and sweating in rainy British theme parks. Even rats make cartoon heroes. Only reindeer are always caricatured as drunken, stupid and quarrelsome beasts of burden. In real life the partnership of the reindeer with the Sami peoples of northern Scandinavia is one of the great triumphs of domestication, enabling humans to build a culture in a landscape so cold, bare and hostile that without the reindeer it would have been impossible to live there at all. The Sami and their reindeer live far to the north of the Inuit of North America, and have for hundreds of years been pushed further into the wilderness by settled farmers encroaching from the south. Until recent times the reindeer supplied almost all the technology their herders needed: bone needles, and thread made of sinew to sew together warm clothes from skin.  Together the herds and their herders travel hundreds of miles every year, in search of food, minimal warmth, and escape from mosquitoes. But it is important that the warmth not be too great. One of the greatest catastrophes that can befall a herd of reindeer is a warm spell in spring, where warmth is defined as anything above freezing. If in the daytime rain falls instead of snow, it will freeze into ice when the weather returns to normal and, while reindeer can dig through deep dry snow to reach the lichen on which they live, they cannot break through a crust of ice. The food remains as inaccessible as if it were behind glass. This is a natural disaster that can wipe out an entire population – about 60,000 reindeer died in one Siberian incident in 2013 – and even those animals that survive will be greatly weakened. Now there is evidence that this effect is attacking the wild reindeer population of the Svalbard archipelago as a result of climate change. That has progressed at an astonishing rate. The mean temperature in January has risen by nearly 10C in the last 26 years. In July, over the same period, it has only risen by a 1.5C, but both changes have had profound effects. The slightly warmer summers have crossed an important threshold for plant life, so that there is now a great deal more nourishment available in the fat times. But this seems to be outweighed by the loss of food caused by wintertime warming. It might seem that a warmer world would be unambiguous good news for the plant and animal life of the arctic. Indeed, there are now more reindeer in the population studied than there were 20 years ago. But the problem of rain refreezing over plants turns out to be more important than all the gains from plants growing larger in a longer summer. The average weight of reindeer on the island has shrunk by 12% over the last 16 years as the island has grown steadily less cold. Warm summers mean more adults, but the warm, or less cold, winters mean malnourished mothers that have fewer successful pregnancies and weaker babies if they are carried to term. The disruptions caused by climate change will be greater than we can easily imagine, and much less predictable."
"The US Fish and Wildlife Service has released its plan for the recovery of threatened polar bears, acknowledging it will take no direct action to address the primary threat of greenhouse gases on the decline of sea ice habitat.  Polar bears, the first species to be declared threatened or endangered because of climate change, rely on sea ice for hunting seals and raising their young. Climate models project that rising temperatures will continue to diminish sea ice throughout this century. The plan announced on Monday calls for reduced greenhouse gas emissions but focuses on action to be taken by the agency on other conservation strategies, such as preventing contamination from spills, protecting dens, or reducing conflicts with humans. Shaye Wolf, climate science director for the Centre for Biological Diversity, which filed the petition to list polar bears in 2005, called the recovery plan toothless. The plan, she said, acknowledges polar bears will not survive without cuts in large-scale greenhouse gas pollution. The science in the plan shows the need to keep global temperature rise well below 2C for polar bears to have any reasonable chance of survival, she said. The agency’s job, she said, is to outline the steps needed to be taken for polar bears to survive. “It acknowledges the problem but fails to put the solution in the core strategy for the bear,” she said. The agency said addressing increased atmospheric levels of greenhouse gases that result in Arctic warming will require global action. Until that happens, the focus of recovery will be on US wildlife management actions that will contribute to polar bear survival in the interim “so that they are in a position to recover once Arctic warming has been abated”, the plan said. Dirk Kempthorne, who was secretary of the interior under George Bush, announced in 2008 that polar bears would be listed as threatened under the Endangered Species Act. But he added immediately that endangered species law would not be used to set climate policy or limit greenhouse gas emissions."
"This past year had so many stories involving human-caused climate change – it will be forever in our memories. Here is a summary of some of the high points, from my perspective. When I say “high points” I don’t necessarily mean good. Some of these high points are bad and some are downright ugly. Let’s do the good first.  The best news of all, in my opinion, is the continued cost reductions and huge installations of clean energy both in the US and around the word. Wind, solar, and other renewables have been on an incredible run of decreasing costs and creative financing, which has made them economically competitive with dirty fossil fuels. Improvements and expansion of grid-based power storage has also advanced. These storage abilities are needed to allow intermittent power sources (like wind and solar) to play an even larger role in delivering power to the grid. In the end, clean power will win out based on simple dollars and cents – regardless of the fact they will also help save the world.  On an international scale, the US, China, and other countries ratified the Paris climate agreement, which gives us a reasonable chance at avoiding the worst effects of climate change. In the lead up to that ratification, the US took major actions domestically to reduce its own emissions through steps like the Clean Power Plan.  Emissions have been reduced in some countries like the US for a variety of reasons. First, very cheap natural gas is displacing dirtier coal-based power. Secondly, renewable energy sources like wind and solar are expanding, and people are using energy more wisely. All of this happened with a major reduction in energy costs in the US. This shows you can have clean energy that is also cheap. In court, it was a good year. A rag-tag group of pro-bono climate scientists beat a bunch of high-paid contrarians in court. We showed that their science was nonsense and the smart judge gave a very harsh judgement to the funded deniers. And last in this part of the list, I think this is the year we can say the climate deniers and the contrarians who downplay global warming threats finally lost the science war. In the past, there were a dwindling few scientists each year that attempted to find evidence that the world was not warming, or wasn’t warming much.  Each year, the number of scientists in this group got smaller and smaller. This year, they were virtually nonexistent. The contrarians have almost given up looking for contrarian evidence – it just isn’t there. They have ceded the scientific field because their research was found to be wrong. Now, these contrarian scientists only appear in blogs, op-eds in newspapers, sometimes in pay-for-play journals – but rarely in competitively reviewed scientific venues. After being wrong for decades, they have seemingly just given up. Despite the progress above, global warming continued. In fact, 2016 marked the third year in a row that record global temperatures were set. We are well over halfway to the 2-degree mark that puts us into a real climate danger zone and we have not even come close to doubling CO2 yet (although we will). The temperature levels reached this year don’t prove the world is warming; in fact, we never look at a single year as evidence. Rather, proof was found in the oceans. Several major studies were published this year that clearly show the world’s oceans are warming and that computer simulations have been spot-on in their predictions. Simply put, the Earth is warming and the models got it right. But that said, reaching almost 1.5 degrees Celsius with only about a 45% increase in the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere means that the contrarians, like Roy Spencer, John Christy, Richard Lindzen, William Happer, and Judith Curry, are shown conclusively to be wrong. The rate of warming we are seeing, in both the air and ocean temperatures, is inconsistent with the fanciful and optimistic beliefs of this group.  But not only does the Earth not care about the contrarians; the weather doesn’t either. And it has been a crazy year with many climate-change induced weather events that should give us all cause for concern. We know that a warming climate will have many weather effects. For instance, in a warming world, there is increased evaporation which tends to dry out areas and make droughts worse. But, in some parts of the world, the warming air has more water vapor (higher humidity) so that heavy rainfalls occur and more flooding happens. The general rule of thumb is that areas which are currently dry will become more dry. Areas that are currently wet become wetter. And rains will occur in heavier downpours. And that is just what we are seeing. In the United States, we have had a continuation of the terrible drought in California. We’ve had a new heat-wave drought in the southeastern part of the US and that led to terrible wildfires. There have been terrible floods in other locations, including Maryland, West Virginia, Louisiana, Texas, Arkansas, Mississippi, Iowa, among others. Outside the US, there has been an incredible heat wave in the Arctic which has led to the lowest ever wintertime ice ever recorded there. The Arctic is looking very precarious for the important summertime low ice extent. We have a good chance at breaking the record (again).  Terrible flooding the UK, Myanmar, Argentina, Indonesia, Spain, and Egypt, and others. There have been simultaneous flooding and heat waves in Australia, crazy hot weather in India and the Middle East. And typhoons and hurricanes are getting stronger because of climate change. As we warm the planet and its oceans, there is more energy available to fuel these hurricanes. According to expert Jeff Masters, 2016 saw the strongest storms ever observed in two regions. We also witnessed seven Category 5 storms, which is a huge number. Among typhoons that hit land, two of the top five occurred this year. These listed weather events, which are increasing, have been predicted to be an outcome of global warming. The scientists making these predictions got it right.  One of the two events in this category should come as no surprise – the election of Donald Trump. While I continue to hold out hope that Trump will take climate change seriously, he is surrounding himself with people who are not scientists – rather, they are advocates for the fossil fuel industry. Many have histories of not only denying the science but working to undermine the science and the scientists who study climate change. There is very little evidence that Trump or his administration will take climate change seriously.  However, there are rumors Trump’s daughter may be more understanding of science. There is also the possibility that Trump will realize he is in a powerful position, a Republican President with a Republican Congress. If he realizes the economic and social peril that climate change poses, he may take it upon himself to be a savior of sort for the world. If, on the other-hand, he kills climate funding, pulls us out of our international agreements, and goes backwards on our own emission reductions, we will see a devastating effect for our climate and a probable rise in energy prices. It would be so ironic if, for instance, energy prices are higher in four years than they are now. The second ugly event is the continuation of the ubiquitous misinformation on climate change. With the reduction of responsible and professional staff and organizations, news has been abdicated to second-rate non-reporters. Some examples are David Rose from the UK who writes for The Mail on Sunday. In November he wrote an article wherein he claimed that the recent record temperatures were a result of El Niño, not global warming. His fake news article was embarrassingly wrong.  You might have thought Mr. Rose was a climate scientist by reading his article, but he ignored 7 out of 8 climate records, he focused on a portion of the atmosphere and threw out out most of the warming data, he cherry picked his data set, ignored records set without El Niño, and he omitted the entirety of the Earth’s oceans in order to get his result – and he was still wrong. But, when articles appear in newspapers, even ones like The Mail, they have a veneer of credibility. Simply put, the reason 2014, then 2015, and now 2016 are all-time records is that we have emitted heat trapping gases. Rose is full of baloney. But misinformation wasn’t limited to the UK, it had its normal huge presence in the US. In the Wall Street Journal, contrarian Roger Pielke Jr. published an article where he described himself as a climate heretic. His name might be familiar as a former writer for Nate Silver’s 538 blog before they rapidly parted ways. Pielke claims that he was attacked by “thought police in journal, activities groups funded by billionaires, and the White House”.  What Pielke didn’t tell his readers is that he threatened colleagues who dared to confront his faulty science (For which Nate Silver apologized).  He also wrote misleading pieces that discussed tsunamis, volcanoes and earthquakes as though they were weather events (or at the very least, he failed to distinguish the difference to his readers). They are not weather events. Roger Pielke Jr’s problems were of his own making by poor science and shoddy professionalism. There are many other examples including those of second rate scientists or non-scientists finding high-profile media venues to spin their fantasies. It has become harder for readers to discern the real from the fake, the low from the high quality, the good from the fodder. And this issue brings me to the end, and my hope for 2017.  After this year of fake news in US politics and elsewhere, I am hopeful that consumers of news will become much more discerning. I am hopeful that people who were duped this year will have higher standards next year. I hope that the thirst for reputable news and responsible sources will revitalize news media in the US.  In particular, I hope that we see a resurgence in real reporters. People who have a professional obligation to get things right. People who live and die by their reputations and therefore cultivate those reputations. I understand that the Washington Post is actually hiring news reporters. This is unheard of in US print media but I hope it is a harbinger of things to come. If news consumers ask “where is this information coming from?” “Is it reputable?” “Can I double-check this article?” “What conflicts of influence might be present with this reporter of news?” Then, 2017 will be a glorious year and set us on a path of recovery. I am also hopeful that the economic position of renewable energy continues to improve. If so, the president of the USA won’t matter. We will be on a path to a cleaner safer world just based on unstoppable economics. Here’s to 2017!"
"More than 600 businesses and investors signed and released a letter on Tuesday urging president-elect Donald Trump to fight climate change – a move that coincides with the start of the Senate hearings to confirm his cabinet nominees, who are poised to gut existing climate policies. The letter contains signatures from roughly 200 more companies and investors than when it was initially submitted after the election in November, including Campbell Soup, Johnson & Johnson and the New York State Retirement Fund. The previous plea was signed by companies like Monsanto, eBay, Levi Strauss and Staples.  “We want the US economy to be energy efficient and powered by low-carbon energy ... Failure to build a low-carbon economy puts American prosperity at risk,” says the letter. The letter urges Trump to continue policies that combat global warming, such as the Clean Power Plan created by the Obama administration to cut emissions from coal power plants. The letter also petitions Trump to invest in low-carbon energy at home and abroad and remain committed to the Paris agreement. “As a utility, we are a critical infrastructure, so we make big investments in our system,” says Melissa Lavinson, chief sustainability officer for PG&E Corp, the parent of Pacific Gas and Electric Co in California that signed the letter. “Climate change can impact our ability to safely, affordably and reliably serve our customers. For example, more heat waves mean more cooling days, and sea level rise can affect coastal infrastructure. So for us taking action on climate change is very important.” The letter reflects the hope that Trump, as a businessman, will heed the declaration of so many American companies that climate change is real and could pose a threat to their financial health. Whether the petition will make any impression on the president-elect, who has claimed in the past that climate change is a hoax and wishes to disregard the Paris agreement, is unclear. Since the letter was first released nearly three months ago, Trump has picked advisors and cabinet members who are largely hostile toward environmental regulations and have close ties to the fossil fuel industry.  For example, Trump nominated climate change denier Scott Pruitt, a former Oklahoma attorney general and a driving force behind the lawsuit against the Clean Power Plan, to head the Environmental Protection Agency. The nominee for energy secretary, Rick Perry, was governor of Texas, the oil and wind energy capital of America. While he supported the expansion of the state’s wind energy development, he made climate change skepticism part of his platform during a failed bit for presidency in 2011. Perry also once said he wanted to eliminate the very department he’s now expected to lead. Trump wants the outgoing ExxonMobil CEO Rex Tillerson as secretary of state, a decision that’s led some environmentalists to dub it “an epic mistake”. Representatives from Trump’s team did not respond to the Guardian’s requests for comment. While environmental groups are gearing up for an intense fight with the new government, evidence continues to emerge that points to the substantial business risks posed by rising global temperatures, such as dwindling supplies of raw materials and water. Extreme heat, for example, is bad for the economy, causing crop failure and reduced worker productivity, according to a new study from Stanford University and the University of California at Berkeley. The Sustainability Accounting Standards Board, a nonprofit group that sets standards for corporate sustainability disclosures to investors and is chaired by former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg, estimates that significant climate risks – such as severe weather events – exist for most of the companies it tracks, which represent $27.5tn, or 93%, of US stocks as measured by market value. There is also evidence that companies that embrace sustainability actually perform better financially than those that do not. A 2014 study by the nonprofit CDP, which provides environmental data and climate risk analysis, found that corporations that actively manage and plan for climate change achieved an 18% higher return on investment than companies that weren’t planning for climate change, and 67% higher than companies that refused to disclose their emissions. Investors are increasingly seeing opportunities to address climate change. Nearly two dozen of the world’s most successful business leaders, entrepreneurs and venture capitalists such as Amazon’s Jeff Bezos, Virgin’s Richard Branson and Alibaba founder Jack Ma, plan to invest as much as $1bn in a fund called Breakthrough Energy Ventures, led by Bill Gates, that aims to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by financing clean energy technology."
"Dawn was breaking when the campaigners used slingshots to fire ropes on to the rig. But as they began to scale the Prirazlomnaya, aiming to unfurl a banner denouncing Russia’s attempts to drill for oil in the Arctic, their hopes of another successful Greenpeace “action” swiftly faded. They had been anticipating high-pressure hoses that sprayed freezing seawater at intruders. They weren’t prepared for balaclava-wearing soldiers shooting at their inflatable boats. One soldier grabbed the rope used by one of the climbers, slamming her body repeatedly against the rig. They captured two other activists. Then the Russians demanded to board the Greenpeace ship. But the Arctic Sunrise’s captain, Peter Willcox, fearing his boat would be seized, resisted.  “I said, ‘Well, go ahead – open fire. But don’t hit that silver tank back near the stern because that’s gasoline and that’s going to blow us all up.’ They must’ve been thinking, ‘Who the fuck is this idiot?’ And then I was sitting in jail thinking, ‘Who was that idiot?’ But the adrenaline gets flowing.” Willcox’s account of his 2013 jailing, alongside 27 other Greenpeace activists and two journalists, might resemble a terrifying gangster film – except that the gangsters were in government. His memoir also documents four decades of peaceful direct action against everything from whaling off Peru to incinerator ships in the North Sea, and shows how many protests eventually trigger policy change. But it’s harder to detect positive outcomes from the jailing of the “Arctic 30”. Although Greenpeace went on to successfully oppose Shell’s drilling in the Arctic, other companies have continued, and millions of barrels of oil continue to flow from the far north. As a new political era dawns, bringing the prospect of unprecedented US-Russia collaboration over the Arctic’s exploitation, Willcox is clear that the fight against climate change is only just beginning. “I’m not sure I’ve held on to my optimism,” says the 63-year-old American, when we meet in London between his continuing missions skippering Greenpeace ships on “actions” around the world. “I’m not stopping work. I’m not giving up. I don’t want to give Planet Earth to [Trump’s nominee for US secretary of state] Rex Tillerson. But my optimism is not very high right now. Not when you’ve seen what I’ve seen.” When Willcox was first captured by the Russians on 19 September 2013, he was optimistic, at least about his team’s prospects. He assumed they would get “yelled at for three or four days” before being dispatched over the border to Norway. But despite the ship being in international waters, armed Russian special forces had shimmied down ropes from helicopters to take over the Arctic Sunrise and tow it into custody. As if that wasn’t enough, the Russian commandos seized all the alcohol on board and had a “massive party” among themselves on their way to Murmansk. The captain’s confidence in a quick release was also misplaced: the Russians were determined to end Greenpeace’s meddling in Arctic oil extraction once and for all, and the Arctic 30 were thrown into prison and charged with piracy, which carries a sentence of up to 15 years. The worst thing about prison, says Willcox, was that everyone – from lawyers to fellow prisoners – assumed they would be found guilty. “I saw instances where the investigator showed no qualms whatsoever about lying. I found that deeply chilling,” he says. When he was taken by prosecutors to re-examine the Arctic Sunrise, he was handcuffed to a security guard, because, he laughs, “they thought this little fat 60-year-old guy was gonna throw himself in the water, swim three-quarters of a mile to shore, and then run 80 miles through the woods to Norway. That gets kinda heavy after a while.” Willcox had been detained by foreign forces before, but this was different: he lost 20lb in three weeks and suffered from claustrophobia. Separated from most of his crew, he worried that they blamed him for their detention. The Russian interrogation, with prosecutors “trying to make a case” against him, reminded him of the sinking of the first Greenpeace ship he skippered, the Rainbow Warrior, when New Zealand police initially suspected that the campaigners had scuttled their own boat, thus killing photographer Fernando Pereira. In that case, detectives quickly realised Greenpeace was innocent, and two French agents, found to have planted the bombs, were arrested before they could flee New Zealand, and sentenced to 10 years for manslaughter. The agents were soon transferred into French custody, however, and released after barely two years, returning to a heroes’ welcome in France. Another French agent involved in “Opération Satanique” apologised in 2015, claiming they “did everything to preserve the life of the people on board the Rainbow Warrior”. “That’s not true,” says Willcox. “I categorically reject that notion.” He cites the huge hole the first bomb blew in the boat, and says they could have used smaller bombs. “They were either incredibly incompetent or they didn’t give a shit. If the first bomb had gone off half an hour sooner, 20 of us would have died, because we were all having a meeting below deck. None of us would have gotten out.” Was justice done? “Justice wasn’t done. It was not even close. To this day, the French authorities have never apologised to the Pereira family or to Greenpeace, and I think that’s a mistake on their part.” After the Rainbow Warrior was sunk, Willcox immediately joined another Greenpeace boat, so determined was he to continue to highlight French nuclear testing in the South Pacific. He was promptly detained again and banned for life from French Polynesia. But his arrest in Russia nearly 30 years later was, he says, more frightening than the most extreme storms he has endured on the high seas. The International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea ruled that the Arctic 30 should be released, but Russia ignored the directive. Only after objections from the Pope and 12 Nobel prize winners were the campaigners abruptly freed, after two months in detention. Willcox is convinced they were only saved by the fact that the Winter Olympics were soon to be held in the Russian city of Sochi. “I don’t think they wanted us there for Sochi. They didn’t want any demonstrations or negative vibes,” he says. To Willcox’s relief, he was greeted with hugs from his crew members. “I was like: ‘Thank God.’ I wasn’t feeling guilty but I was thinking they might think I was guilty – I’m the last person in charge.” Just as after the sinking of the Rainbow Warrior, Willcox’s detention in Russia redoubled his determination. Three months later, he helped Greenpeace block a tanker bringing Arctic oil into Rotterdam. “As far as I’m concerned we should do an action on every one of their tankers getting into Rotterdam, and hit them again and again,” says Willcox. As for Greenpeace as a whole, however, Willcox argues that the detention of the Arctic 30 appears to have had a chilling effect. Did the brutality of the Russian reaction scare the charity away from taking further action? “I’m not sure if that’s our official response. You might ask somebody a few levels higher up,” says Willcox. “But what am I going to tell my friends if I get arrested in Russia again? They are not going to be sympathetic. This time they’re gonna say, ‘You’re stupid.’ And what am I going to tell my kids? I don’t wanna tell my kids I’m stupid. They think that already maybe,” he laughs. He has never turned down a mission from Greenpeace’s Amsterdam HQ, but “if Greenpeace said, ‘We’re gonna do that oil rig again,’ I’d say, ‘I really respect that but I’m not going.’ Things are tough enough in Russia. If they decide to lock you away for 10 years, there’s not going to be much anyone can do about it.” As oil continues to be imported into Europe from the Arctic and Donald Trump’s presidency looks likely to intensify US exploitation of fossil fuel, Willcox believes Greenpeace faces its toughest battle yet. There are a few reasons for this. For one thing, “our actions are getting harder because they don’t have the punch they once had,” he says. “In a world where you have 15-year-old girl suicide bombers, it’s pretty hard to compete.” Also, while he still has faith that Greenpeace’s actions “inspire” campaigners, he’s not sure Greenpeace itself has. “That’s something Greenpeace has maybe been forgetting for the past five years. When anybody does an action and returns to their desk, they have eight times more energy than they did the week before. That’s not to be trivialised. Doing silly actions may not be appreciated anymore, and the public may be getting tired of it, but I believe there’s a place for them.” He doesn’t accept, yet, that Greenpeace has lost its radical edge: “Radical is being able to take stands that are difficult. Protesting whaling now – any hippie in the world can do that. Taking on the oil companies, that’s huge. It’s like that quote sometimes attributed to Gandhi: ‘First they ignore you, then they laugh at you, then they fight you, then you win.’ Now they [the oil companies] are fighting us. They are fighting us really hard, and it has been tough for us. The last five years have not been great at Greenpeace.” He cites “a bunch of difficult things” that have happened recently, including Greenpeace having to apologise after activists accidentally damaged a Unesco World Heritage site in Peru. “We leave some footprints and we’re the biggest enemies of Peru?” he demands. “No, we’re not. We’re the enemies of the oil companies.” Was another of the “difficult things” Greenpeace’s financial challenges, the charity having to apologise, in 2014, when a staffer lost £3m on the foreign exchange market? “That was our mistake, which I’m told can’t happen again,” says Willcox. “There’s just a general climate of things getting harder because the fossil fuel industry can see the end in sight. Now they are angry, now we’re no longer a joke, and things are getting tougher.” Willcox believes “there’ll be a place at Greenpeace for me as long as I want to keep going” – and he does. “I still wake up in the morning with an urge to burn the oil companies to the ground because that’s what they are doing to us.” Greenpeace always keeps its future actions secret, but Willcox will next sail off to highlight threats to wildlife posed by the ongoing search for oil. “I like it because it’s a serious campaign; it’s the lungs of the planet and we’re smoking,” he says. He expects Greenpeace to intensify its campaign against fossil fuels under Trump. “The fossil fuel industry is the biggest in the world. To close it down is a huge undertaking.” Willcox is worried about Trump’s position on climate change, his appointment of Tillerson and his potential co-operation with Russia over Arctic oil. “He’s appointed the head of ExxonMobil to be secretary of state. Exxon knew about global warming nearly 40 years ago, and rather than deal with it in a responsible manner, they chose to bury it. Tillerson and their ilk have been selling the futures of their grandchildren for money. I would be very happy to see the US and Russia have a less confrontational relationship, but if it’s based on the fact that both want to build up their nuclear weapons arsenals and drill for more oil in the Arctic, I don’t see much good coming out of that.” Whump! A large shiver went through the entire ship and woke me from a dead sleep. I didn’t so much hear it as feel it. Disoriented and in the dark, I tried to make sense of what had just happened. As the captain of the Rainbow Warrior, I knew that whatever that whump was, it wasn’t good. My sleepy mind slowly began to run through the possibilities. The adrenaline hadn’t hit me yet. Had we collided with another ship? Possibly. Were we at fault? I looked out the porthole in my captain’s cabin. We were tied up at the dock – Marsden Wharf, in New Zealand – so if there had been a collision, at least we weren’t responsible. Well, that’s a relief, I thought, glad that whatever had just happened wasn’t my fault. Even though I was only partly alert, at least my career survival instinct was intact. Was the New Zealand navy firing at us? At the dock? It was the only thing I could think of, and that didn’t seem very likely. Whatever was going on, it didn’t make sense and it wasn’t over. I looked down at first mate Martini Gotje and told him to pass on the word to abandon ship. Abandon ship!? At the dock!? It seemed like a strange order to both of us, but he did not argue. “Are there any more bombs aboard?” asked the fire chief who had just arrived. Bombs? Who said anything about bombs? Greenpeace was – and is – very much against the use of any kind of weaponry, violence, or property destruction. There was absolutely no way that we had bombs aboard. Still, we were all asked to go with the police to the station right across the road. Great, I thought. My ship has been sunk. Fernando [Pereira] is probably dead. The police think we did it, and they’re going to interrogate us. And I’m not wearing pants. • This is an edited extract from Greenpeace Captain by Peter Willcox, which is published by Sandstone Press at £9.99.

"In Altansukh Purev’s yurt, the trappings of a herder’s life lie in plain sight. In the corner are his saddle and bridle. By the door, he has left a milk pail. If you didn’t know better, you might think his horses and cattle were still grazing outside on the remote plains of outer Mongolia. But they aren’t. Altansukh’s milk pail stands empty. There is no horse for him to saddle. His cattle are dead. And this tent, which once stood in the countryside, is now on the fringes of the Mongolian capital, Ulaanbaatar, surrounded by pylons, rubble and the husks of old cars. Altansukh, his wife and their four children may live among rural paraphernalia, but following a disastrously cold winter a few years ago, they were forced to move to the city to survive. “We lost all our animals,” the 38-year-old says. “Thirty-nine out of 40 cows, almost 300 sheep. The cows wandered far away in the snow and never came back. And when we got up one morning, all the sheep had frozen to death. We had lost everything – so we decided to leave immediately for Ulaanbaatar.” Look down on Ulaanbaatar from the hills at its edge, and you will see a central hotchpotch of new skyscrapers and crumbling Soviet tower blocks surrounded by an unplanned periphery of white yurts, or, as they are known in Mongolia, gers. Thousands and thousands of gers. These are the homes of around 600,000 former herders who – like Altansukh – have migrated to the Mongolian capital in the past three decades. The scale of the migration is extraordinary: around 20% of the country’s people have moved to Ulaanbaatar, doubling the city’s population and significantly increasing its physical footprint. “I arrived in Mongolia in 1998, and at that time there were still some areas of Ulaanbaatar that were totally empty,” says Mitsuaki Toyoda, the head of mission for Save the Children, which runs aid programmes in the city’s deprived suburbs. “But over the years it has just expanded and expanded.” One partial explanation lies in the environment. Over the past 70 years, the average temperature in Mongolia has risen by 2.07 degrees, more than double the average global increase of 0.85 degrees over the past century. This has exacerbated a periodic weather phenomenon known in Mongolia as the dzud, which creates summers that are unusually dry, followed by spells during the winter that are unusually cold.  The dry summers make it harder to grow and harvest grass, while the harsher winters require an even bigger supply of fodder. When the cold hits, sheep and cattle have less fodder to feed on, causing widespread loss of life (for animals), and livelihood (for humans). Dzuds in 1999 and 2009 killed around 10 million and 8 million livestock respectively, and were followed by a spike in migration to Ulaanbaatar, government records show.  Aid workers fear further mass-movement in the coming months and years: another dzud is thought to be underway this winter. Herding is a way of life for over a third of Mongolians, and of symbolic importance to the whole country. Thanks in part to rural-to-urban migration, it is now under threat. But whether this migration is directly linked to climate change is a subject of debate. As the world warms, world leaders must prepare for the likelihood of refugees fleeing the weather rather than war – but the situation in Mongolia is too complex to be considered a straightforward test case. “Climate change is responsible for some portions of the loss [of livestock] – but not all of it,” says Dr Batjargal Zamba, an adviser at Mongolia’s environment ministry. “It’s a combination of change to climate, and also a change to Mongolian economic activity and lifestyle.” How much is down to the former, and how much to the latter?  The beginnings of an answer can be found about 370 miles (600km) south-east of Ulaanbaatar, on the edge of the Gobi desert, outside the ger of Begzsuren Nyangaa. Begzsuren is 68, and started herding in 1956. Unlike Altansukh, he is still at it. So are his nine children, who all live within riding distance of his ger. One of them has the largest herd in the region, with 3,800 livestock, and another was once named the country’s herder of the year.  Staring from his tent, sipping tea boiled in milk, Begzsuren can see the effects of climate change in the valley outside. The land here has become much more obviously desert-like, he says. The grass grows shorter than it used to, and it is thinning out. There is also much less rain, and dried riverbeds can be found across the surrounding region. “It’s a totally different picture now,” Begzsuren says. “When I was 17 or 18, we had a lot of rain, a lot of grass, and we could harvest the grass in the autumn. When I tell my children this, they don’t believe me! They say: how could this land produce that?” The autumnal rains have virtually disappeared, he sighs. “I really miss those autumn days. Now the climate has changed so much – you can say we only have two seasons now.” That’s a problem for herders. With little grass, there is less fodder to feed the animals over the winter. So when the cold snaps come, the cattle are at much greater risk of death. But here in the Mongolian steppe, a changing climate isn’t the only challenge. Until the fall of the Soviet Union, Mongolia was a communist country. Herding was tightly managed by central government. Livestock was owned by collectives, officials decided where you lived, and there were restrictions on the number of animals in each herd. Most importantly, officials kept a central supply of fodder that they gave to herders during the harsh winters – meaning that when the dzuds came, the worst could be averted. “Because of the socialist system, everything was well organised,” remembers Begzsuren. “Fodder was given to each family. There was a lot of winter preparation.” But that all changed in 1990, when communism ended, and the state was opened up to the market. Many herders welcomed this: they could now own as many animals as they liked, and live where they wanted. The number of livestock had remained steady under communism – fixed at around 20 million for roughly half a century. Now the headcount shot up – to over 33 million by 1999, and 70 million by this summer, according to government statistics. But there were also downsides. State support vanished, leaving herders to deal with the dzuds on their own. As private traders, they also needed to move closer to markets in order to turn a profit. Coupled with a rise in the number of livestock, this meant that more animals were grazing on less land. The climate may be getting worse, but political and social change has made Mongolians less able to deal with it, and therefore more likely to migrate to Ulaanbaatar. Just as importantly, they are now allowed to do so. Under communism, herders could move to find better grasslands, but they could not migrate to the city. After 1990, this restriction was lifted – allowing people to leave herding, whether or not they were affected by the worsening climate. And for some, the dzuds are not the only push factor. Many also head to the capital in search of better schooling for their children. “We considered both,” says Narmandakh Sainjargal, the wife of Altansukh and mother of their four children. “We lost all our animals, and a lot of other migrant families lost animals as well. But we also felt that it might be easier to find education in Ulaanbaatar.” The situation in Sukhbaatar, Begzsuren’s home province, shows how migration can still be curbed when herders receive the kind of support that they lost back in the early 90s.  On the face of it, Sukhbaatar should be one of the main areas of origin for migrants arriving in Ulaanbaatar. A bumpy drive with the region’s deputy governor shows how badly it has been affected by recent weather patterns.  “Look at all this,” says Amarsanaa Byambadorj, squatting down in the desert. “It’s July, the height of summer, so the grass should be at its greenest and longest. But instead it’s very short, and it’s almost yellow.” Nearby we find a sickening sight: a pile of dead livestock, rotting in the sun. More than a million animals died in last winter’s dzud, and this area in south-east Mongolia was one of the worst affected. Around 10 of them lie here in the dirt. There used to be many more, until Save the Children cleared them away during the spring. “In March, it was terrible,” says Amarsanaa. “There were carcasses everywhere, and you could smell the stench.” More than 10% of the 400,000 livestock in the area were killed, he says, and some families lost all their herd. The deputy governor introduces Byambadorj Zayabaatar, a 30-year-old who lost all his 320 animals during a cold snap towards the end of the winter. “I could see the animals were so cold, so in the beginning I would bring them inside the ger,” remembers Byambadorj. “But after a while there were too many, so I had to leave them outside. And they died before my eyes.” Yet very few people from this area have considered moving to Ulaanbaatar. That is partly because there is little history of rural-to-urban migration from this area – most migrants in Ulaanbaatar come from western Mongolia. But it’s also because the government and various international agencies are increasingly stepping in to provide the outside help that had been lacking since the fall of communism. This winter, Mongolia’s National Emergency Management Agency partnered with the UN development programme and NGOs such as Save the Children to provide fodder and other support to the worst affected areas.  Save the Children has been particularly active in Sukhbaatar. It paid for the worst-affected families to replace their dead livestock with animals from neighbouring herds that had largely survived the winter. The programme has been so successful that it has tempted the few families who had already left for the city to consider returning. “We have received many comments from herder families saying that if you continue to restock people’s herds, we would like to come back,” says Amarsanaa, the deputy governor. Additionally, home-schooling programmes have been provided to herder families who live in remote areas, far from school, and who might otherwise consider migrating to Ulaanbaatar to further their children’s education.  “This way, they can live their nomad life, and the kids can still live at home – without the family having to move anywhere,” says Javzandulam Myagmarjav, a local librarian who will help run the project until funding runs out in 2017. “I’m quite sad it’s ending,” she says. “It helps herder families, and the long-term benefit will be that there is less migration to Ulaanbaatar.” Yet even if people stop coming to Ulaanbaatar, the scale of recent migration will still have changed the capital beyond comprehension, and left it with a myriad of unsolved social challenges. Roughly half the population are migrant families living in the tent districts on the edge of the city – unable to access many of its services.  In Altansukh’s neighbourhood, there is no running water, mains electricity, sewage or central heating. And it’s a similar situation in all the migrant districts. To keep warm during the winter, migrant families are therefore forced to burn whatever they can find – and the fumes make their neighbourhoods more polluted than Delhi. The newcomers find the city disorienting, with the houses so close together, and society so focused on money. In the countryside, you can live off the meat and milk from your herd, and use their hides to build your home. But in the city, everything must be bought from other people. “We always miss the countryside,” sighs Altansukh’s wife, Narmandakh Sainjargal. “As herders you don’t spend any money. You have your animals and they give you everything you need. But in the city you have to pay every day for something – transport, books for school. It’s very strange to be here. We have paid such a lot of money for this small piece of land, whereas in the countryside you don’t have to pay anything, and you have all this space.” With their skills little suited to urban life, many struggle to find work, making the hidden costs of state education too much for some families. Those who can send their children to school find that the teachers have little time for them: classes are so overcrowded that sometimes teachers run three shifts a day. “Some new schools have been built, ” says Toyoda, head of mission for Save the Children, which has helped to fund their construction. “But it’s not enough. Not much has changed since [the 1990s] in terms of the living conditions there. If you’re from the countryside with just secondary education and no relevant work experience, then what proper job can you get? If you don’t have a proper job then it’s very difficult to get a bank loan. So you can’t purchase an apartment. Our conclusion is that the first generation of migrants will live in the ger districts for the rest of their lives.” And back in Sukhbaatar, one of the country’s oldest herders can’t rule out more migrants joining them. “If nature keeps changing, if the climate keeps changing, we can’t say it won’t happen,” says Begzsuren. “If natural disasters keep on happening, people won’t have any choice but to move.”"
"Something is happening to the floating sea ice of the Arctic, other than the well-documented retreat in its surface coverage each summer. Scientists are finding that Arctic sea ice is getting younger and thinner, which is set to continue in March, when US research reveals the winter maximum, and September, when it reveals the summer minimum, making it more vulnerable to a catastrophic and unprecedented break-up. Nasa researchers have found that the thicker multi-year ice, which has survived several summer melt seasons, is being rapidly replaced by thinner, more ephemeral one-year ice formed over a single winter. This change makes the polar region increasingly vulnerable to storms that could smash their way through the final remnants of thinner, one-year sea ice, making a completely ice-free summer in the Arctic increasingly likely.  An unpublished study of changes to the multi-year ice over the past few decades has revealed that a part of the Arctic that should be a “nursery” for older ice has in recent years turned into a “graveyard”. Instead of multi-year ice forming within the Beaufort Gyre, a huge circular movement of ice off the coast of northern Alaska and Canada, it is now melting away within this critical region. The result is that while older, multi-year ice typically made up more than 20% of Arctic sea ice in the 1980s, it now comprises just 3% and what little multi-year ice is left behind is behaving like the crushed ice of a cocktail, more prone to being pushed about and melting compared to a solid ice cube. The loss of multi-year ice is important because it forms an important bulwark against further ice loss as the region gets warmer, says Walt Meier, a sea ice specialist at Nasa’s Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland, who studies the loss of multi-year ice with the help of satellite imagery. “In the past, the seasonal ice loss in summer would tend to stop when it got to the multi-year ice because it’s three to four metres thick. You couldn’t melt that much ice in summertime, but now what’s happening is that things are getting more broken up,” Meier said. “Multi-year ice is more fragmented so now you are getting warm water attacking it from all sides. Previously, it was a consolidated ice pack, like a wall of multi-year ice where warm water may melt it a little bit at the edges. But now you are getting big chunks of individual floes sitting there, floating round, surrounded by water that has been warmed by summer sunlight. “The ice is getting thinner and the winds can more easily break it up. Once broken up, the winds can push it more easily. That just breaks things even further.” Arctic sea ice, the vital seal-hunting platform of the polar bear, is considered important for the wider climate because it reflects sunlight back into space. The more it melts, the more open ocean there is to soak up sunlight, raising regional temperatures even further. The Beaufort Gyre is traditionally where much of the multi-year ice forms, Meier said. Its circular winds and currents spin in a clockwise direction, keeping sea ice confined within the colder Arctic region, preventing it from slipping out into the warmer north Atlantic via the Fram Strait, separating Greenland and Svalbard. Since about the mid-2000s, the circular movement of sea ice in the Beaufort Gyre has speeded up, indicating that this multi-year ice is more “slushy” and fragmented. At the same time, older ice within the gyre has melted, attacked in different directions by warm water. “Now we’re seeing the thicker, multi-year ice melting out completely, particularly in the Beaufort and Chukchi seas, so it’s getting harder for that multi-year ice to survive. The Beaufort Gyre was like a nursery for the older ice and now it has become sort of like a graveyard where the ice is spinning… surrounded by warm water,” he said. Computer models in the past predicted the first sea ice-free summers in the Arctic occurring mid-century, but these models have assumed a smooth loss of ice as it melts, rather than a catastrophic break-up. Now many scientists predict the first summers free of Arctic sea ice could occur within the next 10 to 15 years. “You’re going to get the first ice-free summer when you have an extreme summer, almost by definition. But with this break-up of ice cover and loss of multi-year ice, the system is becoming more vulnerable to extreme summers,” Meier said. “The ice has become more vulnerable to the weather and so more vulnerable to extremes. In that sense, things have definitely changed and it makes things less predictable in many ways because you can’t predict when or where the next storm is going to hit. “We’re obviously heading for a sea ice-free Arctic at some point, but which year it happens may very much depend on a big enough storm happening in the right year at the right time.” Although we may not see a sea ice-free Arctic this summer, we are likely to see the continued loss of multi-year ice that makes that event more and more imminent."
"Across Australia a secretive network of activists are laying the groundwork for what they expect will be the biggest environmental protest movement in the country’s history. Of course this won’t materialise if Adani and the rest of the miners proposing to open up one of the world’s biggest coalfields walk away from Queensland’s Galilee basin first.  But standing idly by on the assumption that the economics of the massive coal projects won’t stack up – at a time the world is trying to reduce carbon emissions to limit global warming to under 2C – is not a choice these activists are willing to make. And so the campaign to take the fight against Australia’s largest proposed coalmine, Adani’s Carmichael project, to another level, beyond the courts and into the realm of civil disobedience, is under way. Behind the Galilee Blockade campaign is a core group of activists well versed in the “security culture” required of those intending to jam a serious monkey wrench into a major industrial project. This describes the kind of precautions people take when there’s a very real prospect that arrests and charges will follow, as well as police surveillance and leaks that could tip off direct-action targets. They share strategy via encrypted messaging. When meeting to talk specific action, phones are left out of the room.  In an era when coercive hearings by crime body “star chambers” could apply as equally to environmental protesters as to organised crime figures, this closely guarded information is being thoughtfully withheld from close family. And amid a public call for volunteers and new activists that has so far attracted pledges from more than 11,000 people, including almost 8,000 committed to direct action in their local areas, organisers remain alert to the possibility of infiltration by police or others. Among their ranks already are veterans of emblematic past environmental campaigns, those who took part in actions against the Franklin dam, the Jabiluka uranium mine and those who sank the coal seam gas industry in New South Wales. So far criminal defence lawyers in Brisbane, Sydney, Melbourne, the New South Wales northern rivers, Newcastle and Tasmania have agreed to be on hand when legal support is required.  Among the key organisers of the campaign are two women thousands of kilometres apart, who have chosen to remain anonymous.  One of them is an IT specialist with two decades’ experience working for government and the corporate sector, whose research skills are said to be formidable. A voluminous list of companies and lobbying organisations to be targeted in the campaign has been compiled. Guardian Australia has seen the list, which stretches across every capital Australian city through to regional centres and to Africa, South America, Asia and Europe. Some of these targets will be presented this month to grassroots activists, who will be invited, with strategic support, to form and execute their own specific plans for direct action in their local city or region. The industry, while not privy to the exact forms these actions will take, knows something is coming. A former Queensland Resources Council chief executive, Michael Roche, has said he expects protesters would “throw everything at Adani’’. “Even if Adani does move into construction in 2017, experience in NSW suggests the campaign against Carmichael will move to a civil disobedience phase, testing the resolve of the politicians,’’ he told the Courier-Mail.  One of the more novel future strategies in play involves an arm of the Galilee Blockade called “Grandparents for the Galilee”, and comes courtesy of one “grey nomad” volunteer who pondered how the mobility of retirees with motorhomes and caravans could best be harnessed. It’s a twist on the proverbial spectacle of the slow-going grey nomad proving a frustrating obstacle to others on the highway. Think of the obstructive power of 30 motorhomes, or 50 caravans, and the potential for one of the more unorthodox direct actions in environmental protest history. Organisers report a sense among older volunteers that they need not have so much concern as their younger peers about the impact on their careers of being arrested in an environmental protest. The public face of the Galilee Blockade is Ben Pennings, a Brisbane-based activist of 26 years’ experience and a Greens lord mayoral candidate. He quit as one of the party’s elected spokespeople to take up this new role at the pointy end of the environmental movement. Pennings began his career at 18 with Greenpeace, sailed on the Rainbow Warrior 2 aged 20, and was inducted into the “security culture” of an organisation that had its first vessel of that name blown up by French intelligence operatives.  Despite a long history of involvement in direct action he has never faced criminal charges, which he jokes is “a bad look in the environmental activist world”. Pennings says after resistance to the proposed Adani mine in the form of legal challenges and lobbying, public campaigns and petitions – including efforts led by mainstream non-governmental organisations – the time is right for more direct methods of protest. “The efforts of mainstream NGOs are reasonably predictable, especially when they’re large organisations with deductible gift-recipient status or reliant on large donor bases,” Pennings says.  “We are not predictable. We can target companies in different ways they don’t expect. Some of the NGOs may not be happy with our approach. But we think that a diverse movement is a strong movement, an unpredictable movement is a strong movement.” Pennings says there is demand from grassroots activists for this next step, with “a ton of people who want nothing to do with NGOs, who only want to do the frontline stuff”. “It’s definitely the time for this strategy. Companies and shareholders deserve to know this is what’s going to happen. Investing in the destruction of Aboriginal homelands and the reef is going to cost you big time, not only with security costs but in regards to insurance, unions, the lot. “The coal industry has already lost their PR war about the Great Barrier Reef. People will fight to protect it.” Organisers, who are funding the costs of the campaign through their own pockets, plan to target not just Adani but also “key Adani contractors, right down the line”, he says.  “If you’re in bed with Adani in any major way, you’re a target,” Pennings says. “If you’re a major contractor, you’re a target. If you’re providing finance, you’re a target. If you’re looking to provide finance, you’re a target.” Pennings is at pains to point out that the Galilee Blockade is “not Australia’s Standing Rock”. Standing Rock involved large-scale protests against an oil pipeline on the site of Sioux traditional tribal lands in the US last year, where security used attack dogs and police used water cannons on protesters. The site of the proposed Carmichael mine, inland from Bowen, is the traditional land of the Wangan and Jagalingou people. It is remote and inaccessible. “It’s not our business [to be there], it’s the traditional owners’,” Pennings says.  “We respect their right to take legal steps to protect their land. There is no way we would even consider going on site, unless we were invited. But there’s no plan for a single person to go up there.” Instead, the plan is for the campaign front to take form through a vast array of localised acts of protest. “You won’t have to go interstate, you won’t have to travel back there for court if you’re arrested,” Pennings says. “You can do it in a group with friends, repeatedly, in local blockades.” It’s a strategy drawn from the playbook of successful activists elsewhere, notably those campaigning against animal testing in the US. “They’re pretty full-on. They’ve gone as far as to target the people who supply the toilet paper,” Pennings says. He says the idea is to make clear to companies involved that “it’s going to cost them, in security, insurance, and the unions are going to freak out”. The group is determined to shun reckless acts that will put anyone in harm’s way but “people will get arrested, people will get charged”. A taste of what actions might be to come can be glimpsed in the previous campaign targeting the coal rail company Aurizon over its plans to invest $2.6bn in GVK’s Alpha venture when that looked the mine most likely to open up the Galilee. That campaign, “Over our dead bodies”, involved everything from hunger strikes, flagging plans to stop coal trains with cardboard boxes on tracks, through to Christmas stockings full of coal delivered to executives’ homes. “Board members and executives have to be made responsible for their actions,” Pennings says. “Saying I didn’t know or I was just following orders doesn’t cut it. We’re talking about runaway climate change threatening hundreds of millions of lives.” Pennings and others bought shares in Aurizon and attended its annual general meeting, where they asked discomfiting questions for the board regarding the costs to shareholders of becoming a target of activists, through the need for extra security, insurance, industrial action and recruitment costs. He was greeted by name on the way into the Brisbane Convention and Exhibition Centre by anti-terrorism police, who he says were there for a small “dry run” for the G20 meeting at the same venue the following year. Pennings says it is his hope that an unprecedented protest movement is ultimately not required and that Galilee mining plans that would create “an environmental and human catastrophe” come to nought. But if they come closer to fruition, Pennings says he has “no doubt” the direct action campaign will be the largest in Australian history. “This is going to dwarf the Franklin blockade. That’ll be nothing.” Guardian Australia has contacted Adani for comment. "
"High on the Tibetan plateau, a giant poster of the Chinese president, Xi Jinping, guards the entrance to one of the greatest monuments to Beijing’s quest to become a clean energy colossus. To Xi’s right, on the road leading to what is reputedly the biggest solar farm on earth, a billboard greets visitors with the slogan: “Promote green development! Develop clean energy!”  Behind him, a sea of nearly 4m deep blue panels flows towards a spectacular horizon of snow-capped mountains – mile after mile of silicon cells tilting skywards from what was once a barren, wind-swept cattle ranch. “It’s big! Yeah! Big!” Gu Bin, one of the engineers responsible for building the Longyangxia Dam Solar Park in the western province of Qinghai, enthused with a heavy dose of understatement during a rare tour of the mega-project. The remote, 27-square-kilometre solar farm tops an ever-expanding roll call of supersized symbols that underline China’s determination to transform itself from climate villain to green superpower. Built at a cost of about 6bn yuan (£721.3m) and in almost constant expansion since construction began in 2013, Longyangxia now has the capacity to produce a massive 850MW of power – enough to supply up to 200,000 households – and stands on the front line of a global photovoltaic revolution being spearheaded by a country that is also the world’s greatest polluter. “The development of clean energy is very important if we are to keep the promises made in the Paris agreement,” Xie Xiaoping, the chairman of Huanghe Hydropower Development, the state-run company behind the park, said during an interview at its headquarters in Xining, the provincial capital. Xie said that unlike Donald Trump, a climate denier whose election as US president has alarmed scientists and campaigners, he was convinced global warming was a real and present danger that would wreak havoc on the world unless urgent action was taken. “When I was a child, rivers usually froze over during the winter; heavy snowfall hit the area every year, so we could go skiing and skating … people weren’t very rich, and nobody had a fridge, but you could still store your meat outside,” the Qinghai-born Communist party official remembered. “We cannot do that any more.” Anders Hove, a Beijing-based clean energy expert from the Paulson Institute, said that as recently as 2012 solar power was shunned as a potential source of energy for China’s domestic market because it was seen as too expensive. No more. Costs have since plummeted and by 2020 China – which is now the world’s top clean energy investor – hopes to be producing 110GW of solar power and 210GW of wind power as part of an ambitious plan to slash pollution and emissions. By 2030, China has pledged to increase the amount of energy coming from non-fossil fuels to 20% of the total.  Earlier this month, meanwhile, China’s energy agency vowed to spend more than $360bn on renewable energy sources such as solar and wind by 2020, cutting smog levels, carbon emissions and creating 13m jobs in the process.  “The numbers are just crazy,” said Amit Ronen, director of the George Washington University’s GW Solar Institute, who described feeling “awed” by the scale of the Chinese solar industry during a recent trip to the country.  Activists now hope Beijing will up the ante once again following Trump’s shock election.  Amid fears the billionaire US president will water down attempts by his predecessor, Barack Obama, to fight global warming, campaigners are calling on China’s rulers to seize the mantle and position their country as the world’s number one climate leader. “As Mr Trump drops Obama’s legacy, Mr Xi might establish one of his own,” Greenpeace campaigner Li Shuo told the Guardian on Wednesday . That campaigners are now looking to China for green leadership underlines the once unimaginable changes that have taken place in recent years.  While China remains the world’s biggest emitter, thanks to its toxic addiction to coal, it has also become an unlikely figurehead in the battle against climate change. Last September campaigners hailed a major victory in the war on global warming when China and the US jointly announced they would formally ratify the Paris agreement.  “Our response to climate change bears on the future of our people and the wellbeing of mankind,” Xi said, vowing to “unwaveringly pursue sustainable development”.  Ronen said: “A decade ago, China’s attitude was: ‘You guys put all that carbon in the atmosphere growing your economy, we should be allowed to put a lot of pollution up there too to grow our economy. Now look at where we are.” Sam Geall, the executive editor of China Dialogue, a bilingual website on the environment, said Beijing viewed having a climate change denying US president as a rare and unexpected opportunity to boost Chinese soft power by positioning itself as the world’s premier climate change fighter.  “[China sees it as] an opportunity for them to show leadership,” he said. “I’ve already heard that from people who work in environment bureaucracy in China. They see this as an opportunity for China to step up.” Ronen said China’s renewable revolution, which has seen sprawling solar and wind parks spring up across its western hinterlands, was part of a dramatic political U-turn that culminated in Beijing throwing its weight behind the Paris climate accord last year. He said part of the explanation was air pollution – repeated episodes of toxic smog have convinced Beijing it must take action to quell public anger – and part was climate change.  “They are very much impacted by a lot of these climate change weather patterns that are particularly troublesome: drought in the north, flooding they are very vulnerable to,” Ronen said.  But Paulson Institute’s Hove said the key driving force behind China’s low carbon quest was economic. “Most of the things that China is doing related to the environment are generally things that China … wants to do for the economy as well,” he said, pointing to Beijing’s desire to rebalance the economy away from investment-led heavy industry-focused growth while simultaneously making itself the key player in an “industry of the future” and guaranteeing its own energy security.  Hove said Beijing saw a “huge investment opportunity” in exporting low-carbon technology such as high speed rail, solar power or electric vehicles to developing nations in Africa, south Asia and Latin America. “This is a 20-30 year mission to develop [clean] markets,” he said. A recent report captured how China was already dominating the global clean energy market, pointing to billions of recent investments in renewables in countries such as Brazil, Egypt, Indonesia, Pakistan and Vietnam. Xie, the Huanghe chairman, said his company was now making its first steps into Africa with solar and hydro projects under development in Ethiopia. “We are actively going global,” he said, warning that the developing world could not copy the west’s dirty development model without bringing about “the destruction of the world”. Geall said one indication of whether China was prepared to become the world’s premier climate leader would be if it was seen helping to finance more low-carbon projects beyond its own borders – such as a huge Chinese-built solar park in Pakistan. “You’d hope to start seeing more of those sorts of projects around the world being financed … rather than [China being] just a source of cheap finance for dirty energy projects.” Not all are convinced China is ready or even willing to become the world’s top climate leader in a post-Trump world. Zhang Junjie, an environmental expert from Duke Kunshan University, believed China would stick to its Paris commitments out of self-interest, particularly since the fight against global warming empowered its environmental agencies to crack down on toxic smog despite strong resistance from vested interests. “[But] if China needs to do more, to commit more, I don’t expect that is likely,” Zhang added, noting that China wanted to be a climate leader but not the climate leader. “Leadership is not just power … it is responsibility.” With China’s economy losing steam, Zhang said tightening regulations on greenhouse gas emissions further would inflict “major trouble” on its manufacturing sector. China’s clean industries were not sufficiently developed to provide jobs for all those who would be made unemployed as a result. “I would say, don’t count on [China to fill the gap left by the US],” he said. “China has its own troubles now.” China’s push to develop renewables has not been entirely plain sailing either, with concerns about over-capacity, falling demand for electricity and curtailment, the amount of energy that is produced but fails to make it to the grid. Hove said despite the rapid growth of the sector, wind still accounted for just 4% of China’s electricity last year and solar for about 1%. Government subsidies meant many of the biggest solar and wind parks had been built in “sub-optimal” locations such as Qinghai, Gansu and Xinjiang, far from the southern and eastern metropolises where the energy was most needed.  Those behind the world’s largest solar park admitted obstacles such as energy wastage and transmission had yet to be overcome, but said there was no looking back as China forged ahead towards a low-carbon future.  “New energy is surely the future ... It’s hard to predict the future but I believe that solar energy will account for 50% of the total in 50 years,” said the engineer Gu.  Xie said authorities in Qinghai were now so confident the future of China was green that they were planning two massive new solar parks on the Tibetan plateau, with the capacity to produce 4GW of power.  In a sign of the central government’s support for the renewable revolution, Xi recently visited Xie’s company, urging staff to “make every reasonable effort to develop the PV industry”.  Xie, who hosted the Chinese president, scoffed at Trump’s suggestion that climate change was a Chinese hoax and said such claims would do nothing to dampen his country’s enthusiasm for a low-carbon future. “Even if President Trump doesn’t care about the climate, that’s America’s point of view,” he said. “The Chinese government will carry out and fulfil its international commitments as they always have done in the past, and as they are doing now in order to try to tackle climate change.  Xie concluded: “I don’t care what Mr Trump says – I don’t understand it and I don’t care about it. I think what he says is nonsense.” Additional reporting by Wang Zhen"
"Producing electricity from coal, gas and oil is a surprisingly thirsty business. The United States needs around 731,920 million litres a day (161,000m gallons) to produce and burn the nearly 900m tonnes of coal it uses each year to generate just a third of the nation’s electricity. In India, plans to produce 500 gigawatts of coal-fired electricity by 2040, will require at least 58bn cubic metres per year (pdf). And in China, about 15% of national water withdrawals are used for coal mining, processing, ash control, and for cooling of its coal-fired power plants.  Global energy consumption is forecast to increase nearly 50% by 2040, driven mostly by emerging economies such as China and India. Energy strategies based on fossil fuels will require much more water to be allocated to new power plants. This additional water can come from only two sources: from those who are already using it or from the resource base, which is difficult when many river basins already face over-abstraction. The water-energy conundrum is a good example of the complicated environmental systems challenges faced by policymakers planning strategies for national economic growth.  For example, an economy dominated by rural farming activities will likely be poorer per capita than one which is more urban and industrialised. Historically, many countries have allocated the majority of their water to agriculture – 70% is the global average – yet most industrialisation strategies are based on increasing fossil fuel capacity to drive growth. Few countries plan the majority of their national energy security around less thirsty renewables, such as wind or solar. Chile may be the exception. This can become politically challenging. Trade-offs are required for regional water basins to not be dangerously overused and put at risk of drying up, leaving everyone worse off. Someone, usually farmers, will be required to effectively use less water – by paying higher water prices, for example – to free up water for an urban-focused energy strategy. Social tensions, which politicians would prefer to avoid, can flare up as a result, such as recent riots in Karnataka, India.  The outcome is usually the easiest but least ideal strategy; water resources are over-used, farmers continue to irrigate so that thirsty, fossil fuel-based industrialisation can expand, all to the point of hydrological unsustainability and, in some cases, the collapse of the water system.  This happened during the last century in many countries of the southern Mediterranean and across drier parts of the United States and the former Soviet Union – perhaps the most infamous case is the Aral Sea in Kazakhstan. Following decades of inefficient water use in farming, urban centres and industry, structural problems of water scarcity are now coming home to roost in many of these areas. They are also being replicated in water-scarce emerging economies across Africa and Asia, threatening food and economic security (pdf) unless major policy changes are put in place. Changing weather patterns combined with historic levels of water over-use can act as risk multipliers, making a bad situation worse. In France and the south-east United States (pdf) there are cases of nuclear reactors being throttled back and temporarily shut down because of drought-induced water shortages. And in March last year a new 2,300 MW coal plant in West Bengal had to suspend generation due to low water levels in the canal that feeds it. This is why the World Economic Forum encourages a systems approach to solving environment and economic problems – a strategy that brings together all the right people from across government, civil society and business, with access to the right resources – to help jointly explore and resolve these food-energy-water, climate and growth conundrums.  For example, when all costs and risks are considered, is an energy security strategy based on fossil fuels really the cheapest and smartest long-term solution? And more worrying still for a policymaker in a water-stressed country, will the pursuit of fossil fuels actually exacerbate social and political tensions over water security more than it delivers citizen satisfaction through improved energy security? At the World Economic Forum’s annual meeting in Davos this week, heads of government and leaders from science, civil society and business will tackle some of these interconnected challenges. Why, for example, are mainstream economics failing to account for these environmental risks and what can be done to better manage our global environmental commons? Are there practical partnerships that help governments solve these challenges, such as the Water Resources Group or Tropical Forest Alliance, which could be expanded? Could new production or consumption strategies, such as the circular or sharing economy, “design-out” some of these systems failures? And could new technologies such as blockchain help society to better manage these kinds of water and energy trade-offs? Unless we address these tricky challenges using a systems approach, we will never resolve the kinds of interconnected environmental risks we will face in the coming decades.

"Last year saw the highest costs from natural disasters since 2012, with two earthquakes in Japan in April accounting for the heaviest losses, a leading insurer has said.  Losses from natural disasters worldwide totalled $175bn (£142bn) last year, some $50bn of which was covered by insurance, Munich Re said in an annual survey on Wednesday. The earthquakes on Japan’s southern Kyushu island caused $31bn worth of damage, with $6bn of the costs covered by insurance. Floods in China in June and July caused $20bn in costs, only $300m of which was insured. The third-costliest disaster was Hurricane Matthew, which hit the Caribbean and the eastern US in October. It incurred losses totalling $10.2bn, of which $3.8bn was covered by insurance. In 2015, when the El Niño weather phenomenon reduced hurricane activity in the North Atlantic, global natural disaster losses totalled $103bn, $32bn of that sum insured. However, the number of people killed dropped to 8,700 last year from 25,400 the previous year. Last year’s losses were “in the mid-range” after three years of relatively low costs, Munich Re board member Torsten Jeworrek said in a statement. He stressed that “losses in a single year are obviously random and cannot be seen as a trend”. The company said there was an “exceptional” number of floods, which accounted for 34% of overall losses, compared with an average of 21% over the past decade. Those included $6bn in losses, about half of them insured, resulting from storms and flooding in Europe – particularly in Germany and the Paris region – in May and June. Jeworrek said that “the high percentage of uninsured losses, especially in emerging markets and developing countries, remains a concern”."
"Just five months after the devastating result of the European Union referendum, and the struggle against the forces of darkness seemed to have just become even harder. Donald Trump’s election left the many in the United States reeling. In particular his success has left women, people of colour and those with disabilities feeling more vulnerable than ever. The land of the free seems a lot less free than before. Americans aren’t the only ones who fear a Trump presidency. His win reinforced a right-wing populism that is resurgent across the western world, but also threatens to slow down the global movement against climate change. Not only does the president-elect not believe that climate change is man-made, but his cabinet level appointments show an utter disregard for our environment.  An astounding nine members of his top team deny even basic climate science – with his secretary of state (who is in charge of international climate policy), Rex Tillerson, the former CEO of Exxon Mobil. Trump’s policy proposals – to end the moratorium on coal mining, to support new fossil fuel infrastructure and to scrap Barack Obama’s Clean Power Plan – are exceptionally reckless. There’s a reason that the outgoing president poured half billion dollars into the Green Climate Fund this week. It’s because he knows that Trump is planning to end such payments and that global action on climate change is under threat. The boost for climate change deniers has distinct parallels here in Britain. The leave side of the EU campaign was first registered in the same building as Lord Lawson’s climate-sceptic Global Warming Policy Foundation (and Lawson chaired the Vote Leave campaign). Many politicians who were prominent in the Brexit campaign – such as Boris Johnson and Nigel Farage – are known to have been climate change sceptics. We’re in danger of such concerns being painted as some sort of metropolitan preoccupation, rather than the very real threat it poses to all of our livelihoods. Clearly, Trump’s election poses a threat to the climate movement but, worrying as it is, it is neutralised to some extent by its global nature: from the First Nations communities blocking the Keystone pipeline, to the energy co-operatives springing up across the world and the anti-fracking campaigns here in Britain. For every attempt to extract fossil fuels from the ground, there are people dedicated to keep them where they should be. The economics is also stacked against climate change deniers. Renewables are competing with and beating fossil fuels when it comes to cost. Huge investment in China has seen the country installing enough solar panels to cover three football pitches for every hour of 2016, thus forcing prices down even further. Additionally – and looking specifically at the situation in the US – Trump’s damaging plans will be curtailed in a federal system where many key Republican states have thriving low-carbon economies and will resist attempts to cut funding. Like many of those reading this, I am truly worried about the effects of Trumpism, but I am hopeful that the politics of hate will be overcome. That’s why tomorrow I will be joining one of the more than one hundred Bridges Not Walls actions taking place across the world – bringing together people who reject the idea that the future of our world is owned by a gold-plated billionaire. It’s why I’m working with climate campaigners to urge Britain to step up and fill any void left by the US by becoming a world leader on renewables and storage. There is no turning back time on the US elections, and tomorrow Trump will become president, but that does not leave us powerless – indeed his swearing-in should be a call to action, not a time to shrink away."
