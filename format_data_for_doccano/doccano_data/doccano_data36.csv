Share this...FacebookTwitterLooks like yet another model projection is about to join that now overflowing mass grave of failed climate and weather model projections. The latest to join it is the projection that 2014 would bring a “super El Niño”, and with it, the warmists are hoping, a new global temperature record.
At Weatherbell Joe Bastardi has posted his latest Saturday Summary and in it he shows us why all of it is looking more like super El Hypo. Currently the Southern Oscillation Index (SOI) is positive, which, Joes says, makes it unlikely a “super El Niño” is in the pipeline this year. He says the current SOI value “has nothing to do” with a super El Niño.
At the 5:45 mark he shows the SOI plot of 1997, when it was seriously negative, dipping below -20.
He compares the 1997 SOI with today’s situation:

2014 SOI positive in June. Image cropped from Weatherbell Saturday Summary, 7 June 2017.
Currently, it’s still in positive territory, not what would expect to see in June! Joe then adds:

You need three months of plus 2°C or greater in the ENSO 3/4 and we just don’t see that and neiter do the models really.”

The charts show that there is no similarity with the event of 1997/98, and the current situation resembles more 2002 and 2009. The south Pacific is showing a cold PDO signature which “cuts the feet out from under” a developing El Niño.

Arctic ice poised for impressive rebound
At the 10:30 minute mark, the NWS/NCEP/CPC forecast shows how Arctic sea ice is projected to be above normal by late summer, something that has been unseen since 1996.
If that forecast should indeed pan out, then naturally skeptics are going to have a major field day with this. Just warning!
The NWS/NCEP/CPC forecast is even surprising Joe:
It’s forecast to stay above normal for 5 months at the height of the melt season. That has not happened since the AMO flipped from cold to warm back in the mid 90s. And that’s our theory that the Atlantic Decadal Oscillation, not CO2, that is controlling what the Arctic ice is doing – the bulk of the Arctic ice.”
With the latest projection, the warmists absolutely must be in major panic mode right now and gearing for major damage control. Expect them to be concocting some wacky explanation for this. I can hear it already: Warming causes more Arctic ice after all! The circus that climate science is becoming is taking on ever more impressive dimensions.
In summary, Antarctic sea ice is above normal, the Arctic is projected to be above normal this summer, and the super El Niño is turning out to be nothing but super el hypo.
Though the 2014 will end as a relatively warm year, it very very likely won’t be warm enough to end the streak in the warming gone AWOL, which is now close to being 18 years long. Moreover, El Niños are usually followed by (cool) La Niñas. The situation for the warmists is looking increasingly dire.

Share this...FacebookTwitterRetired German meteorologist Klaus-Eckart Puls has written an analysis at the European Institute for Climate and Energy (EIKE) website here. He concludes:
Old and new measurement data show that sea level rise has decelerated.”
The article is a bit long and so I’ll focus on the main results only.
North Sea rise stagnates
First he discusses a 2013 study by T. Wahl, et al.: “Observed mean sea level changes around the North Sea coastline from 1800 to present”; Earth-Science Reviews; Volume 124, September 2013, Pages 51, which examined 30 North Sea tide gauges, of which some of them go back up to 200 years and most of them 100 years. The results:

Source: T. Wahl, et al.
The Wahl paper writes:
In summary the long term trends in the North Sea are not significantly different from global sea level trends, while the inter-annual and decadal variability are much bigger in the North Sea and hardly comparable to those derived from the global sea level reconstruction considered here.
The recent rates of sea level rise (i.e. over the last two to three decades) are high compared to the long-term average, but are comparable to those which have been observed at other times in the late 19th and 20th century.”
Puls concludes: “There are variations, but no acceleration on a 100-year scale!!!”
Sea level rise at the German bight
Puls then examines data from the German bight. The results are depicted by the following graphic:

Evaluation of coastal tide gauges at the German bight: “No acceleration!” Data: Albrecht, F., T. Wahl, J. Jensen and R.Weisse (2011).
Puls’s conclusion: “The data going back in part over the last 160 years show no acceleration in sea level rise. Rather there is a slight weakening as the polynomial indicates.”
Global sea level rise slowing down
Although variations at the North Sea are greater than those of global sea level, Puls writes that the overall trend is practically the same. He provides a graphic of the data taken by satellite:

Evaluation of satellite altimetry – data source: http://sealevel.colorado.edu/
Puls writes: “Even over the two most recent decades no acceleration can be detected, rather there is a weakening.”
Meteorolgist Puls then summarizes the results of the GRACE data for the last 9 nine years: “Only 1,7 mm per year.”
The EIKE article then looks at the “grotesque” discrepancy between satellite data and tide gauge data, and that to this day there is still no reasonable explanation for it. One thing is sure: the collection of tide gauges doesn’t lie.
Puls concludes
The constant stream of alarm reports of supposedly dramatic sea level rise at present and in the future cannot be confirmed by observations. Rather, the data as a whole contradict it. Worldwide neither tide gauges nor satellite data indicate an acceleration in sea level rise. Rather they show a weakening. There is a glaring contradiction between earlier and current statements from a number of institutes, climate models and the IPCC. Moreover there are strong indications that the satellite data showing higher values were “over-corrected”.

Share this...FacebookTwitterJust days ago I posted on a how veteran German Die Welt journalist Ulli Kulke was amazed at how supposedly one of the world’s best meteorological outfits, the Met Office of England, had botched 13 of  the last 14 annual forecasts. Read here.
Kulke accused the Met Office of “systematic false alarms”, saying they “refuse to accept the reality” of no warming and that it was “stunning” that they “never learn.”
Today Paul Homewood’s site features an article that focuses on the very competence of the Met Office Director asking: Can Slingo Get Anything Right? Homewood writes:
Last April, Julia Slingo told us that ‘climate change was loading the dice towards freezing, drier weather.’
Apparently, she actually meant milder, wetter weather.”
Benny Peiser at the Warming Policy Foundation site has just published a far more comprehensive list of botched Met Office predictions, the latest being the forecast for this winter:

Met Office winter forecast: For the December-January-February period as a whole there is a slight signal for below-average precipitation.“
Last summer the UK Spectator wrote a blistering piece that claimed the Met Office had “lost touch with reality” and that “ideology has corrupted a valuable British institution.” It adds:
Last year, it forecast a ‘drier than average’ spring — before another historic deluge that was accompanied by the coldest temperatures for 50 years. Never has the Met Office had more scientists and computing power at its disposal — yet never has it seemed so baffled by the British weather.
But there is no paradox. It is precisely the power of this technology in harnessing climate scientists’ assumptions about global warming that has scuppered the Met Office’s predictions — and made it a propagandist for global warming alarmism.”
Finally Tallbloke here writes that Met Office predictions on sea level rise are equally deplorable.

Share this...FacebookTwitterGermany’s top leftist, “Red Oskar” Lafontaine has a commentary in the Thursday’s print edition of the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung, where he comes out against wind power. The title: “How wind turbines are destroying the environment.”
He realizes that the whole scam is only benefitting capitalists, is causing more CO2 and is ruining the beauty of Germany’s once charming landscape.
In his opinion piece Lafontaine writes that the “well intentioned renewable energy source is destroying the natural landscape heritage and is involuntarily boosting coal power plants“. It’s time to end wind power, Lafontaine writes.
Wind turbines are growing in size, and are approaching a height of 200 meters. Lafontaine also says that despite the huge investment in wind energy, it only provided Germany with 1.3% of its power in 2012. Is it worth the price of ruining the landscape, he asks?
Moreover, Lafontaine points out that wind energy has not reduced CO2 emissions in Germany, but likely has increased it because gas-fired power plants operating part-time to compensate for windless and sunless days are not profitable. Thus power companies are putting more and more coal power plants back online.
But it’s the industrialization of Germany’s natural landscape that really has Lafontaine against it. He quotes writer Botho Strauß:

A more brutal destruction of the landscape as we see with wind turbines was never ever caused by any phase of industrialization.
“The landscape,” Lafontaine, says, “is being robbed of its poety“. It’s not about protecting nature; it’s about money.
Lafontaine writes that the wind turbines also represent a threat to wildlife and biodiversity.
He summarizes his opinion piece.

It is economically and technically senseless to stay on a path that increases the emission of carbon dioxide, increases the price of electricity. The targets can be reached more easily and cheaply by using more intelligent technology.”

Share this...FacebookTwitterThe ultra-warmist online Austrian daily Der Standard here writes about the misery being caused as the Middle East gets walloped by “unusual cold and snow amounts“, especially the refugees of the Syrian conflict.
For many days unusually cold temperatures have gripped North Africa and the Middle East and have at times brought huge amounts of snow. While the snow-blanketed buildings of Jerusalem’s old city provide an almost idyllic picture, the snow and cold are exacerbating an already precarious situation of Syrian refugees in Lebanon near the border.”
See photos of the refugee camps at the above link. Looks like David Viner’s thing of Europe’s past has now become a thing of warm deserts.
Meanwhile the online Neuer Züricher Zeitung (NZZ) of Zurich, Switzerland, also reports on the unusual “winter drama” in the Middle East.
The NZZ writes of pyramids covered by snow for the first time in a 100 years, misery in Syria brought on by extreme cold, and a city of Jerusalem that is covered by “a thick blanket of snow“.
Misery’s common factor: Lack of energy!
The NZZ adds that energy is scarce for many: “Heating oil and cooking gas have become a luxury for many.”
Both dailies describe the misery that people there have to endure. The NZZ writes: “In Israel and in West Jordanland tens of thousands were hit by ongoing power outages.”
The commonality of the winter misery boils down to one thing: insufficient energy. Solar panels and windmills are not what’s going to help these people. They need electricity and fuel to stay warm and to cook with.

Share this...FacebookTwitterIf the oceans have eaten the heat, then it certainly isn’t to be found in the Arctic Ocean – that’s for sure!
The Beeb has surprised today in reporting that Arctic sea ice VOLUME grew a stunning 50%, from 6000 cubic kilometers to approx. 9000 cubic kilometers, from 2012 to 2013, this according to measurements made by the Cryosat probe of the European Space Agency.
Yet another argument of the warmists is melting away.
Data from Europe’s Cryosat spacecraft suggests there were almost 9,000 cu km of ice at the end of this year’s melt season. This is close to 50% more than in the corresponding period in 2012.
Are sea ice models next in line to be embarrassed?
Whenever sea ice area did not cooperate, the warmists always insisted that we needed to look at volume – that, they told us, was the real barometer. But now we are seeing that Arctic sea ice volume is also no longer cooperating. According to Rachel Tilling from the UK’s Nerc Centre for Polar Observation and Modelling (CPOM).
One of the things we’d noticed in our data was that the volume of ice year-to-year was not varying anything like as much as the ice extent – at least for the years 2010, 2011 and 2012.

This is why we’re really quite surprised by what we’ve seen in 2013. We didn’t expect the greater ice extent left at the end of the summer melt to be reflected in the volume. But it has been. And the reason is related to the amount of multi-year ice in the Arctic.”
Of course scientists and the BBC are scrambling to play down the new development, saying that the Arctic ice volume is still very low.
They blame “wind patterns” for not spreading the ice out more, and thus preventing it from melting more during the 2013 summer. Yet, we recall that in 2007 and 2012 the same scientists immediately blamed global warming for the rapid melt, and not winds, which had been clearly at play. Little wonder the public is losing confidence.
More old ice
The Beeb adds: “Part of this stronger performance can be put down to the greater retention of older ice.”
Interestingly scientists say thickness/volume is the best metric with which to judge the health of the ice pack. Perhaps then we should see more plots of this metric in the future instead of the at-times meaningless sea ice area extents.

Share this...FacebookTwitterOn Consensus
By Ed Caryl
This is in response to comments made by reader G Mitchell.
We are constantly told that there is a consensus in climate science that CO2 is warming the planet, or the deep ocean, (or something) and that if we do not limit CO2 something bad will happen. As one can easily see, there is no consensus on the two “somethings” in that first sentence. We are told that CO2 is responsible for warming, cooling, less rainfall, more rainfall, less snow, more snow, less ice, more ice, more hurricanes, fewer hurricanes, more tornados, fewer tornados, and so on. Each of those things can also be good or bad, (but mostly bad) depending on where and when they happen. The “consensus” seems to morph to whatever bad thing the writer wants to prove. This isn’t climatology, it’s calamitology.
The appeal to authority is scientific fallacy 
The “Appeal To Authority” fallacy is used in each case to back up the claim. The “Trust me, I’m a Climate Scientist” fallacy is constantly used in either the first or second person. It should be pointed out that the title “Climate Scientist” is always self-bestowed, thus is as ephemeral and fallacious as the consensus.
One claim is that “97%” or “99%” of peer reviewed climate science papers support the Catastrophic Anthropogenic Global Warming (CAGW) meme. The first problem with this claim is that getting a paper past the gauntlet of peer review in many climate related journals requires bowing to the requirement for some mention of “global warming” or “climate change” or whatever phrase de jour.
Again and again we find papers that have little or nothing to do with climate change containing those phrases. There are over a thousand peer-reviewed papers taking the converse position. There are also papers cited as supporting CAGW that do not, in fact, support the premise. Fortunately, there are people keeping track of these. I direct the reader to here and here as just two collections.
No agreement on sensitivity means no consensus

There are several “facts” used to back up the claims by “Climate Science”. But there is no consensus on any of these. Climate sensitivity is the first and most important claim as it is the entire underpinning to the argument. There is no agreement on climate sensitivity, there are only opinions. Does the doubling of CO2 content in the atmosphere result in warming? If so how much? Opinions range from some small negative number to above six degrees C, including, of course, the number zero. Even the IPCC cannot settle on a number; the latest iteration being from 1.5 to 4.5°C. A range of three cannot be described as a consensus. The large numbers depend on there being a large positive feedback, as the basic radiation physics of CO2 alone describes a sensitivity of 1°C. The stumbling block of course is the unknown effect of water vapor and clouds. Water vapor is the other (and dominant) greenhouse gas.
No agreement on CO2 lifetime means no consensus
Another “fact” is CO2 lifetime in the atmosphere. This is described in peer-reviewed papers as from less than 7 years to over a hundred, the larger number of course, is used to predict doom. This is hardly a consensus.
Other “facts” in dispute include how much natural variability contribute to observed warming. Ocean cycles and solar variability are two important and heavily argued contributors. Volcanism, natural and man-produced aerosols are others. There is hardly a consensus in this area either. For some recent opinions, go here.
The “Appeal To Authority” and “Ad Hominem” attack fallacies are also used to put down the contribution of skeptical blogs and those that write for and comment on them. It is as if those that do not “believe” are refused a license to think. This is the crux of the problem. This is the reaction of the religious, not scientists. No other scientific field so denies the amateur a place. Why is this so? Follow the money.
Climate science does not require a specialist; it requires a generalist. The knowledge needed crosses all the boundaries. Knowledge in chemistry, physics, geology, biology, botany, mathematics, computers, literature, and library science are all needed, not specialist knowledge, general knowledge. The underlying data and principles involved are not difficult to understand. Anyone widely read in these fields can make a contribution, if they keep an open mind and just think.
My own contributions here are not intended as revealed truth, that would be a religious view. They are suggestions based on the data as found, meant to stimulate thought. This is the basis of science.

Share this...FacebookTwitterThe rich are mugging the poor – now in foreign countries, too.
According to online Spiegel here, a general counsel to the European High Court has ruled that consumers in one country also have to pay green energy feed-in subsidies to producers in foreign countries as well.
That means that heavily industrialized Germany may soon have to pay energy feed-in subsidies to foreign renewable energy producers as well. Spiegel writes that as a result:
The renewable energy subsidy on electric builds may soon increase further.”
The ruling arises from a recent case where a Finnish wind park had supplied energy to Sweden but was never paid the feed-in subsidy. The Finnish wind park took the case to the EU, who then ruled in favor of the Finns – claiming that the Swede’s refusal to pay represented “a discriminatory limitation of the free flow of goods“. A country must not only pay the green-energy subsidy to domestic producers, but also to those delivering from another country.
Spiegel writes, should the ruling be upheld by the EU High Court:
…it would have considerable consequences also for Germany because neighboring states like Austria, France or the Netherlands would be able to feed-in their low cost hydro-electric, solar or wind energy into the local power grid. For this they would receive the German feed-in rate. The German consumer – once again  – would have to pay.”
Already 600,000 German families are having their power cut off annually because they are no longer able to keep up with sky-rocketing electricity bills. Not only is the energy feed-in act turning out to be a huge wealth-redistribution scheme from the poor to rich property owners domestically, but one that redistributes to the rich in foreign countries as well.

Warmest November since measurements began? An analysis of global satellite data leads to a different conclusion
By Dr. Sebastian Lüning and Prof Fritz Vahrenholt
On December 21, 2013 Spiegel Online reported:
Worldwide temperature record: Warmest November since measurements began. Warm air over Russia resulted in the warmest November since 1891. The entire year 2013 jumps upwards on the temperature ranking list. Is the pause in global warming over? […]  Germany on the other hand had an average November. Westerly winds were the rule and they brought more rain than normal to Central Europe, reported the German Weather Service. While in North Germany the sun shined more than average, as a whole in Germany it was grayer than normal for the time of year. In Australia, parts of North America and Greenland it was even unusually cool. Also Great Britain and Spain experienced lower than usual temperatures. Over the ocean a mean temperature of approx. 16.3°C was measured, that’s 0.54°C above average.
A new November temperature record? How wonderful. In times when the global average temperature refuses to rise and produces only negative headlines, they are now obviously resorting to monthly temperatures. And if the monthly temperatures don’t work out, then daily temperatures are taken: i.e. the hottest 4th of April since measurements began. The main thing is to produce headlines.
A series of problems with surface stations
But now it is known that there is a series of problems with the uneven distribution of surface stations over the globe. Thus it makes sense to compare the alleged November record with the satellite data, which are recorded evenly from every corner of the globe. The established satellite datasets are UAH and RSS. You can see them at the NOAA website. But horrors. Based on the satellite data, November 2013 is not a heat champion at all. When you look at the UAH data, November 2013 was only the ninth warmest. And when using RSS data, November 2013 landed only in 16th place. What a flop. The hot area over Russia also exists in the RSS and UAH data, but is less extreme (see comment on this at WUWT).

Austrian flagship daily Der Standard here has an interview with Prof. Hans-Joachim Schellhnhuber, Director of the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research in Germany – the Vatican of climate alarmism.
Photo right: Schellnhuber (see credit below)!
In the interview Schellnhuber says that he thinks (not surprisingly) the latest IPCC report is too conservative. He also explains that global temperatures have not risen very much over the last 15 years because “93% of the global warming goes into the ocean, only 2% goes into the atmosphere“.
And in yet another classic example of PIK dramatization and alarmism at its best, he tells readers what this means:
In 2012 a paper by Levitus et al. was published. In it the warming of the ocean from 0 to 2000 meters deep from 1955 to 2010 was estimated. From the increased greenhouse gas effect a warming of 0.09 degrees Celsius was given – evenly distributed over the ocean. Now we only need to calculate the energy contained by this 0.09°C. Just imagine if the ocean released this heat into the atmosphere with a belch. That would shock-heat the first 10 kilometers of our atmosphere – the layer that we live in and where weather occurs – by 36 degrees C …36 degrees Celsius!”
To be fair, Schellnhuber then states that this of course would never happen at once and that this is just a heat conversion calculation. But he adds, “When just a fraction of that is released, such as during the next El Niño, then the air temperature will again jump significantly. Then people will say : ‘Aha, now they are there, the new temperature records.'”

The Guardian writes:
Marzeion said that by looking at sea level rises over such a long timespan – 2000 years – such short-term uncertainties would be smoothed out. His co-author, Anders Levermann, of the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research, said: ‘After 2000 years, the oceans would have reached a new equilibrium state and we can compute the ice loss from Greenland and Antarctica from physical models. At the same time, we consider 2000 years a short enough time to be of relevance for the cultural heritage we cherish.'”

Hey! That means the coldest 2 years of the decade happened just recently. Clearly the recent flurry of cold events shows that the globe is cooling, thus contradicting the global warming hypothesis. Alarmists are desperate to explain why.

Share this...FacebookTwitterThe latest Sunday print edition of Switzerland’s flagship Neue Zürcher Zeitung (NZZ) has a story blasting Europe’s failure in curbing CO2 emissions through the implementation of its CO2 emissions trading scheme (ETS). See right image.
Hat-tip Hajo Smit
The NZZ story bears the title:
Why the dreck doesn’t cost anything.
With its emissions trading, the EU wanted to be a leader in global climate protection. However it has contributed nothing to lowering greenhouse gases. A European debacle.”
Soviet-scale debacle
The NZZ reports that the emissions trading scheme started out “as a good idea” but never got anywhere. From the NZZ’s portrayal, one easily concludes that the ETS debacle is on a scale of a major Soviet central planning implosion.
The program was supposed to involve 11,000 companies, among them the worst emitters, and to get them to pay real money for each tonne of emitted greenhouse gas. But the trading scheme failed to function as hoped and the price ended up falling to the paltry 5 euros per tonne level that it is at today. Companies have no incentive to invest in energy saving technology when carbon certificates are so cheap.
The NZZ writes:
The targets for reducing greenhouse gases that the EU set to achieve by 2020 will be reached mainly because the economy in many European countries crumbled.”

With certificate prices so low, the EU is a long way from the 40 euros per tonne price level it needs to get power companies to move away from burning coal, says BP chief economist Christof Rühl.
Not only have many citizens in EU countries been burdened by the hardships of economic collapse, which has have led them to reach their emission targets, the subsidies spent on supporting completely ineffective green technologies are costing consumers an arm and a leg as well. The NZZ writes the Germany alone is paying 20 billion euros annually in feed-in charges: “Under the bottom line, this money has done very little for the climate.”
The NZZ blames the failure of the emissions trading scheme on the EU’s “fear of damaging it’s own economy with climate protection“.
In 2008, the global economic crisis led to reduced industrial production in Europe, and thus acted to dampen CO2 certificate prices further. The market was flooded with emission certificates which could be had at dirt-cheap prices and thus having no impact in getting industry off coal.
Experts blame the design of the emissions trading scheme for its downfall, saying that it never had anything to do with climate protection to begin with. What made matters even worse, the NZZ writes, was that as more and more green energy came on line, the demand (and the prices) for CO2 emission certificates dropped further, thus allowing Europe’s industry to easily skirt costly CO2 reduction measures.
The NZZ writes that Germany alone has a surplus of 2.2 billion certificates and experts say it’ll take 15 years to work them off. According to WWF Germany climate expert Regine Gunther:
Thus the flagship of the European climate protection is as good as sunk and the EU as a protector of the climate will be AWOL for the entire time.”
The NZZ writes that before anything changes, Europe has to somehow get over its fear of damaging its economy.
Imagine that. The NZZ and green climate rescuers seem to view economic damage as a sort of irrational fear. For them a rational fear is the world coming to an end in 2099.

Share this...FacebookTwitterLast Thursday evening and yesterday winter made its debut in Southern Germany and Austria  – and how! Read more here.
German RTL television last night here (starting at 4:30) called it the “most severe start of winter in 200 years!“, saying many meteorologists were caught by surprise. Up to half a meter of snow fell at some locations.
Gone are the mild winters of the sort Europe seen in the 1990s and early 2000s. Indeed for central Europe the last 5 consecutive winters have all been colder than normal – a record!
Municipalities ignoring forecasts of warm winters
These days are blockbuster times for German road salt manufacturers. In Europe municipalities have learned their lesson: ignore foolish predictions of warm winters, order huge quantities of salt, and do it early!
Municipalities and road commissioners were once led astray by climatologists’ predictions of increasingly warmer winters and led to thinking that these had become a thing of the past due to global warming (recall famous words of David Viner and Mojib Latif). One major daily even proclaimed that spring would arrive in January!
As a consequence of these false global warming predictions, municipalities unwisely kept much smaller stocks of road salt for expected shorter and milder winters. Road commissioners saw little reason to keep thousands of tons of road salt in stock.
Then beginning in 2009 came one harsh winter after another. Road maintenance crews and commissioners were caught red-faced. Suddenly municipalities were running out of salt by January and were even no longer able to keep the most vital traffic arteries cleared. Traffic chaos ensued and motorists were left to fend for themselves. Municipalities were stunned and left scratching their heads. Weather-wise the exact opposite of what climatologists had predicted had taken place. They learned the hard way. Now they are no longer heeding the foolish forecasts of warm winters.

Not surprisingly, many of the very same climatologists have since changed their tune and are now suddenly predicting cold, bitter winters for Europe….because of global warming!
German public radio SWR here reports that this year municipalities and road commissioners are stocking up on road salt:
The Salzwerke AG in Heilbronn said that municipalities had ordered large quantities of road salt. […] Over the past years road salt had often been in short supply in some municipalities because the cold periods lasted longer and longer than expected.”
The online daily Märkische Allgemeine Zeitung here reports that the city is now building up its stock of road salt, writing:
In the last season 2012/2013 about 90,000 tonnes of road salt were used. Because of the long and harsh winter considerably more than normal was used, said Mitschka. road salt had to be continuously re-ordered.
In 2010/2011 there were delivery bottlenecks. Even the autobahns in Brandenburg could not be adequately salted at the time.”

Share this...FacebookTwitterRenewable energy in Europe has just taken another nail in its coffin.
Thanks to Germany’s infamous EEG energy feed-in act, electricity prices for consumers and industry have long been rising sharply, and now there’s a looming threat of a revolt.
Today the online business magazine Unternehmen Heute quotes former German Chancellor Gerhard Schroder’s soon-to-be-published book, which warns of a revolt by consumers and industry. The timing of Schröder’s words could not come at a worse time for renewable energy proponents, and will no doubt act to take a lot of the momentum out of the already ailing renewable energy movement in Europe. A number of countries have announced major scale-backs on green energy subsidies. Unternehmen Heute writes:
Electricity must remain affordable, Bild newspaper (Saturday edition) quotes Schröder’s book ‘Clear Words’, which will appear in mid February.
The support for renewable energy through the electricity price will lead consumers, especially the ones near the bottom of the income scale, to eventually revolt and say: We can’t afford this any more.”
Schröder adds that eventually renewable energies will soon “have to compete on the market by themselves. They should not be permanently subsidized.”
The former Chancellor also thinks that Germany will not shut down its remaining nuclear power plants by the year 2022, as planned, and believes Angela Merkel acted hastily in passing legislation requiring their shutdown in the wake of the Fukushima accident in Japan. Schroder writes in his book:
My impression is that a complete shutdown will not happen that quickly: consumer and industry will revolt and put policymakers under pressure to postpone the shutdown date because of cost reasons.”

Moreover, Schroder writes in his book that German companies are already reconsidering plans to build plants in Germany, and are considering setting up in low-price-energy locations instead.
Schroder’s views are a major blow to renewable energies
Schroder’s views take a lot of wind out of the renewable energy sails and will only add to the mounting pressure that is having policymakers putting the brakes on renewable energies. Nuclear energy in Germany may not be dead after all.
Even chancellor Merkel is adding conditions to the target of achieving 80% renewable energy by 2050. At the 1:15 mark in the video at the end of the Unternehmen Heute story, she says:
With this expansion corridor, we can quite harmoniously reach the expansion target of 80%. However, only if our industry is able to stay competitive globally and electricity remains affordable for all.”
In other words, kiss the 80%-renewable-energy-by-2050 pipedream goodbye. Right now Germany has not even began to scratch the surface when it comes to powering the nation’s transportation system with green energy. Here too biofuels are being roundly rejected and its subsidies cancelled.
In summary, even as Brussels likes to beat its chest over its ambitious plans for green energies, policymakers everywhere in Europe are in reality abandoning their once lofty targets in droves.

Share this...FacebookTwitterAs Antarctica sets new maximum sea ice records, sensationalist scientists at the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research (PIK) remain relentless in conjuring up cataclysmic meltdown scenarios for the frozen continent. This is the case with a new paper by Levermann and Mengel appearing at Nature Climate Change. 
Yet, when we read a little further, we realize that their drama-filled scenario of an “uncorking” of the East Antarctic Wilkes Basin, all accompanied by a 4-meter rise in global sea level, is not even supported by any observed data. Rather it is merely the product of a computer simulation, one that is no doubt likely fraught with lots of adventurous and dubious assumptions.
Spiegel journalist Axel Bojanowski writes about this spectacular horror scenario, and dumps plenty of cold water on it.
First Bojanowski starts by writing that the PIK scientists warn that “a collapse of the ice shelf threatens”. Levermann and Mengel write that “a sole ice cork blocking the glacier mass inland is preventing it from flowing into the ocean“. They are worried about the cork melting due to run-away global warming, and thus clearing the way for the massive Wilkes Basin ice sheet to cataclysmically collapse into the ocean.
While most media outlets took the sensationalist Potsdam study at face value and ran with it (see here for example), Bojanowski and Spiegel took the time to check the facts and consulted other polar experts on the matter before irresponsibly spreading fear among the public. Bojanowski cites other (warmist) polar scientists and discovers that they have strong doubts about the latest PIK scare scenario. The chances of an “uncorking” of the Wilkes Basin are purely speculative. Moreover Bojanowski writes that the scenario is not even new and that the IPCC has already looked into the matter and is reserved about it. He writes:
The UN climate report (IPCC), which summarizes climate science, is reserved: Up to now the region shows no trend; the East Antarctic ice appears stable.”
Bojanowski writes that a significant warm-up of the East Antarctic sea would be needed for the PIK drama to occur.
He also contacted Heinrich Miller of the Alfred Wegener Institute for Polar and Ocean Research (AWI) and asked him about the PIK scenario. Bojanowski quotes Miller in the Spiegel piece:
It would necessitate a change in ocean circulation so that considerably warmer water would be led to the coast.”

Bojanowski then points out:
Currently the opposite is occurring: sea ice is expanding.”
Bojanowski also writes of the uncorking: “the study leaves open on how this would happen”.
Of course Spiegel writes that the scenario can’t be ruled out entirely because a melting of the East Antaractic has occurred before in history, such as “during the Pliocene and Miocene“.
But even Miller adds here:
Unfortunately there’s a lack of data on the deposits that would allow us to draw conclusions on whether such melts have happened already before.”
Bojanowski concludes:
You can’t get such data by running computer simulations, rather only by boring on site in the icy cold of East Antarctica.”
Indeed. This is just a nice way of saying science begins with observations and real data, and not by putting your run-away fantasies in computer code.

Share this...FacebookTwitterHere’s one of the best speeches I’ve heard in a long time.
On October 31 in the Lower Saxony capital of Hanover there was a parliamentary plenum. Dr. Gero Hocker, speaker for Energy, Environment and Climate Protection of the Free Democrat Party, made a speech calling on his parliamentary colleagues to acknowledge the facts on climate.

Hat-tip European Institute for Climate and Energy here.
Slowly, but surely, leading politicians are mustering the courage to express their doubts on climate science and to speak up. What follows are substantial excerpts of Hocker’s speech in English.
He starts by telling his colleagues that the environment is swamped in political correctness, that there’s intolerance to other views, and that spending 9 million euros on “climate protection” is a waste:
I have doubts in that we are not allowed to ask certain questions in this House. And I also have doubts about that it is perceived as correct that certain views should not be expressed. And I have doubts if what you are doing is correct, that is that climate policy is absolutely being placed above all else. I believe you are drawing the wrong conclusions from the flood of 2013. We have to improve our dikes, and not spend 9 million euros on “climate protection”.
At the 1:23 Hocker says that “the IPCC is really not a good source for advice“.
The people out there are really uncertain about the topic of climate protection, and here the IPCC has made a fundamental contribution to that. Six years ago the ‘experts’ from the IPCC projected that every year the global temperature would rise 0.2°C . And in 2013, that’s only 6 years later, ladies and gentlemen, they are forced to backpedal and recognize that over the last 10 years the temperature has risen only zero point zero-five degrees Celsius. They erred by a huge 75%! And those who want to advise us what do for decades and prophesize what’s ahead and that we’re supposed to act based on that, such an uncertain factual basis is surely not the fundamental basis on which to act politically, ladies and gentlemen!”
Of course with the temperature rise, Hocker slipped and should have said “every decade the global temperature would rise 0.2°C“. But the underlying message remains unchanged: The IPCC is nothing on which decisions can be based on.
At the 2:40 mark, Hocker says that it’s not only the experts who question the science, but also prominent publications such as Spiegel and the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung (FAZ). In front of his politically correct greenie Parliamentarians, Hocker quotes some of the most provocative headlines made on climate change:
In March 2007, the FAZ carried the headline: ‘Climate Change is Nothing But a Swindle’. In May 2013, Spiegel added: ‘There’s enough fodder for continuing an ideological climate discussion, forget the sworn consensus’, and just six weeks ago: ‘Scientists take away the foundation from climate regulators and request a retreat from global alarmism’. […] This shows one thing: The discussion is taking place everywhere all over society: in the press, among the people, with the experts – and you want to keep this discussion out of the Parliament and prevent the right questions from being asked. You are not the thought police of Lower Saxony! You are not the Inquisition to hunt down others who think differently. You have to come to terms with the fact that there are others who have a different opinion in Parliament and you have to accept this discussion, ladies and gentlemen!”

Loud applause at 3:42, and shouts protest from green parliamentarians.
At the 4:20 mark Hocker brings up Antarctica, where “there’s more ice than ever measured.”
In 2013 China emitted more CO2 than ever before, yet over the last 15 years there’s been no significant rise in global temperature. You have to get used to these facts in this discussion, ladies and gentlemen!”
At this point nervousness erupts among parliamentarians and many are clearly agitated by Hocker’s open act of rebellion. Hocker continues, reminding that science thrives on skepticism and that it needs to be welcome and not scorned. Hocker adds that the 9 million euros proposed for climate protection in Lower Saxony would be far more wisely spent on a slew of other needs, which are lacking in money.
But if you truly believe in a climate change, …then the money would be better invested in flood protection, invest the 9 million in our dikes – then you would provide a far greater service to the people of Lower Saxony than if you invested it in a climate protection agencies.”
Citizens should not be bullied into guilt by green thought
Moreover, the restrictions in personal freedom you have with your climate protection measures will not, in my opinion, achieve the success you think they will. You want to prescribe to the people how they are to take their holidays, not with their cars and not with a plane. You want to tell the people what they are to eat, you want to tell people how they are to dress, you want to tell them how they are to live. I’d like to tell you that I’d like people to go on holidays using a plane without having a guilty conscience. I’d like a future where people don’t have to feel guilty whenever they eat schnitzel. And for those who can’t afford, or those who don’t wish to afford it, they should be able to build a home the way they want to build without having to be pressured into a moral corner of some sort.
When you make one political field absolute and subordinate all other political fields, that to me is an expression of a modern absolutism which in Germany we have been wanting to cast off for centuries. And I, ladies and gentlemen, will not accept that such times transform into green and becomes socially acceptable.”
Hocker has let the cat out of the bag in Lower Saxony politics. He really gets to the heart of what this is all about – fundamental human rights, and people getting tired of being regulated to death and deceived.
Now he has to expect immediate retaliation of the most vicious sort. Expect an orchestrated campaign labeling him a denier, a dangerous populist, or heretic. I hope he’s prepared for it.
I really do hope he keeps it up and that others find the courage to follow. Three cheers for Gero.
There’s never anything wrong with demanding an open discussion – especially science.

Share this...FacebookTwitterAn insightful commentary in Germany’s flagship daily Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung looks at the status and future of global climate policy development. In the commentary, climate policy expert Oliver Geden of the Foundation for Science and Policy (SWP) in Berlin writes that “climate diplomacy has long since maneuvered itself to a dead-end” and that “global climate protection is on the verge of upheaval“. Both climate science and climate-economic science have led policymaking into an impossible situation.
Geden first points to 25 years of no progress in getting policymakers to curb greenhouse gas emissions. “When one compares the mood that prevailed between the 4th IPCC report of 2007 and the Copenhagen Climate Conference of 2009, we notice that nobody is risking announcing a coming breakthrough in climate negotiations. Moreover, also warnings of approaching large catastrophes are getting less coverage“. Climate conferences have suffered a long string of failures, and the result, Geden writes, is that a new approach appears to have been adopted by countries:
Unlike the situation before Copenhagen, no climate diplomat or NGO representative still seriously believes it is possible to get big emitters like the United States or China to obligate themselves to far-reaching emissions reductions through a UN treaty.”
The focus he writes, is “no longer on what is desired, but on what is doable; not on nice-sounding intentions but on actually achieved results.” Governments appear to have abandoned binding targets for 2025 or 2030 altogether. The focus is no longer on reducing emissions, but has shifted “to putting the brakes on the rise in emissions“. If Geden’s perception is accurate, and there is no reason to doubt it isn’t, then impatient activists will have to accept waiting many more years before to reaching the desired emissions cuts.
Geden observes that the international paradigm shift now taking hold will have considerable implications for climate science itself, as it will herald “a pragmatic change of course.” He writes that “the climate-political debate is no longer about whether climate change is happening, but rather it is irrefutable that it is for the most part only about its extent, character and speed“. The consequences, he writes:
This is going to promote a depoliticization of climate science, where scientitific uncertainties will once again be discussed with greater calmness.”
Geden also sees climate economists having taken over centre-stage in the debate as they struggle to determine which global climate targets are realistic and which ones aren’t. He writes that with each passing year, the chance of successfully reaching the “2°C target” becomes ever more diminished. Geden feels a paradox has arisen: “With each year of globally increasing emissions, model assumptions on transformation-capability are appearing more and more optimistic.” While political advisors no longer see a 3% annual reduction in emissions after 2020 as realistic, the IPCC still envisions emissions reaching a peak by 2030 with 6% annual emissions reductions thereafter as being realistic. The IPCC even adds in its calculations “negative emissions” through CCS technology. Here Geden writes that with such calculations of postponed emissions reductions and “negative” emissions, climate economists are only unwillingly confirming their “political capabilities” and that economic science is putting its reputation at risk over the midterm. Consequently one has to expect policymaking will distance itself from it. In summary, since climate science and climate sconmic science appear to have painted themselves into a corner, Geden writes:
The relationship between climate policy and climate science currently finds itself in a phase of upheaval…[…] Climate science will have to get used to the fact that its comparatively privileged status will remain restricted when it comes to its access to media, general public and research funding. Its real influence on political action will hardly go beyond the extent that is usual in other political fields.”

By Frank Bosse and Fritz Vahrenholt
(Translated by P Gosselin)
In October 2013 there was a considerable rise in solar activity as the sunspot number (SSN) climbed to 85.6. That’s 77% of the mean value reached at this time into a solar cycle since 1750. The following diagram shows the current situation:

SSN versus months since the start of the cycle
October 2013 deviates significantly from solar cycle number 5. However we continue to believe that SC 24 will be similar to SC 5. Just how large the uncertainties of the correct description of the 5th cycle is shown by a recently published paper by Rainer Arlt of the Leibniz Institute Potsdam and Ilya Usoskin of the Finnish University of Oulo, who after examining the solar cycles between 1750 und 1850 reached the conclusion that the sunspot count should be lowered by 20%. SC 24 shown by the red curve is, however, still very much below average of SC 1-23, let alone well below the large cycles of the solar maximums from 1940 – 1990.
Also in October 2013 mainly the southern hemisphere (SH) of our sun was active. In a comparison of the cycles with each other (here the SSN anomaly thus far up to the current cycle month) we see that the accumulated sunspot number is between SC5 and SC 14:

Current cycle indicate we are entering a Dalton-like minimum

In a recent publication in Space Science Reviews (2013), renowned solar scientists Ken McCracken, Juerg Beer, Friedhelm Steinhilber and Jose Abreu studied the solar minimums over the last 9300 years. Based on measurements of beryllium and carbon isotopes as indicators for the intensity of cosmic rays, which are modulated by solar activity, the scientists arrived at the result that the minimum of 2007 to 2009 had similar characteristics as the minimums occurring during the time of the Dalton Minimums of 1780 to 1820. They discovered a 208-year periodicity (Suess-de Vries) of a grand solar minimum in the past. Therefore they anticipate in the near future the events of a Dalton Minimum, but not a Maunder Minimum.
Lockwood sees elevated chance of a Maunder-like minimum
Another established solar scientist, Prof. Michael Lockwood of the University of Reading, has pointed out that solar activity since the end of the last century has diminished more strongly than it ever has in all the earlier times of the last 9000 years. Lockwood found 24 solar minimum in the last 9000 years, and nowhere did solar activity drop so strongly as it has in the current period. He now sees the probability of another Maunder Minimums at 25- 30%. Just a few years ago he said the probability of a Maunder Minimum re-occurring was 8%. Consequently Lockwood: “We found a significant relationship between the occurrence of cold winters in Europe and solar activity.“ The probable mechanism is the change in the solar UV radiation, which has an influence of the temperature gradient, ozone formation, and the winds in the stratosphere. This in turn disrupts the Jetstream in the northern hemisphere, leads to blocking weather patterns, and to easterly winds that lead to cold spells.
Already in our September report 2013 concerning the publication by Ermolli et al we pointed to a much more strongly variable UV radiation within a solar cycle then what is observed in the overall total radiation (factor 2-6). Weaker solar cycles have a considerably weaker UV radiation and lead to cold periods in the northern hemisphere. Unfortunately the measurements can no longer be continued because the SORCE satellite, which measures the radiation of the sun above the atmosphere, has stopped functioning because of battery damage, and so the cold winters that lie ahead will have to be endured without satellite UV measurements.
And we introduce a third publication. In it Friedrich Steinhilber and Jürg Beer are venturing a look at the next 500 years using two different methods. Here, phi is a measure of solar activity. M marks the Maunder Minimum, D the Dalton Minimum and G the weaker Gleisberg Minimum of 1900:

Share this...FacebookTwitterCarbon Dioxide and the Ocean
By Ed Caryl
In my last post, Figure 1 illustrated how much the annual carbon dioxide flux, the red trace, varied from year to year. Studies (here, here, and here, among others) have been done on the annual carbon flux, but they ignore this variation by using running averages, or by simply ignoring the data during El Niño periods. This seems like an effort to avoid actually learning something.

Figure 1 is a plot of the annual carbon flux into and out of the biosphere.
The shape of the annual carbon increase resembles the shape of the global sea surface temperature (HADSST3), especially after reliable CO2 measurements began by Keeling after March 1958. Several known events are visible. Counting backwards: the 1998 El Niño, the 1994-5 El Niño, Mt Pinatubo in 1991, the 1986-7 El Niño, Mt Ruiz in 1985, El Chichon eruption in 1982, the 1972-3 El Niño, etc. Every positive peak is an El Niño and  every negative peak is associated with a major volcanic eruption.
As can be seen in Figure 1, there is no relationship between the fossil carbon emissions curve and the annual carbon increase curve. That is because all the fossil emissions carbon is taken up by the biosphere or by the oceans according to Henry’s Law, and then sequestered there. The carbon in the atmosphere is controlled by temperature. This has been described by Dr. Murry Salby in this presentations at Sydney and Hamburg. He compares the CO2 curve to the integral of temperature. Here, I am going the other way mathematically, taking the differential of the CO2 curve as temperature and comparing it to known temperature data, the HADSST3 data.

Figure 2 is a plot of the annual carbon increase in the atmosphere (the differential of the Mauna Loa data) and the HADSST3 sea surface temperature anomaly.
The spikes in the SST correspond to the spikes in CO2 increase, and they go in the same direction. As the ocean surface warms, it emits more CO2 (or takes in less). The balance changes with temperature. Why should this be?

Figure 3 is CO2 solubility in water: 0.08g/kg/degree C below 20C. Above 20C the solubility drops by half to about 0.04g/kg/°C. 
The ocean surface area is 360 million sq. kilometers, or 360 trillion sq. meters. The top meter is 360 trillion tons of water. A change of temperature of one degree for cold water changes the solubility by:
360 X 1012 tons = 360 X 1015 kg X 0.08 g/kg = 28.8 X 1015 g CO2 or 28.8 Petagrams CO2. A tenth of a degree temperature change changes solubility by 2.88 Petagrams CO2. This is about 780 Gigatons carbon equivalent. (3.7 grams CO2 = 1 gram carbon.)
The tropical oceans are well above 20°C so the solubility there will be roughly half the above figure. The plots in figure 3 indicate about 1 Gigaton carbon change from a tenth of a degree temperature change. A scatter plot trend line will give us a more exact figure.

Figure 4a is a scatter plot of SST versus annual CO2 change. Figure 4b uses the linear trend formula from 4a to convert SST to the carbon equivalent.
Studies of the CO2 emission and absorption have shown that the tropical seas emit CO2 and the cold, sinking, north Pacific and Atlantic absorb CO2. This has even been mapped. This is all due to the variation in CO2 solubility with temperature.

Figure 5: Source link for the above figure and caption.
The sea surface CO2 partial pressure is always very close to the CO2 partial pressure in the atmosphere above it. The sea surface is always in equilibrium with the atmosphere. This means that as we add CO2 in burning fossil fuels, some is taken up by the land biosphere. The remainder CO2 is dissolved and added to the CO2 reservoir in the surface waters. The mixed layer in the ocean is the top 20 to 200 meters, depending on the amount of wave and current mixing. That mixed layer is about 1/50th of the ocean volume. It contains roughly the same amount of CO2 as the atmosphere, as dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC). The difference, whether the ocean is emitting CO2 or absorbing it, is driven by temperature. As can be seen in the above figures, an El Niño can drive 2 or 3 Gigatons of carbon into the atmosphere and a La Niña can take it right out again. The rise in CO2 is due to rising SST, not fossil fuel burning.

Figure 6 is a plot of figure 4b and the biosphere increase from the previous biosphere article here, subtracted from the annual carbon increase.
The above is a residual. But the curve looks familiar.

Figure 7 is Figure 6 with the average annual AMO index inverted.
Note on the map, figure 5, that the warm tropical seas emit CO2, and the cool northern seas absorb CO2. The AMO index is a temperature index for the North Atlantic. It is derived by subtracting the global SST from 60°N to 60°S from the total SST, or alternatively, the Atlantic temperate and tropical SST from the whole north Atlantic. This means that as the tropical ocean warms more than the average global ocean, this drives the AMO index negative. This shifts the CO2 solubility (figure 2) downward and to the right. That peak in the 1970’s occurs because the tropical oceans were warmer than the average during that period, emitting more CO2. Since that time, the difference has gone the other way, the biosphere is taking up increasing amounts of CO2, lowering the amount of CO2 left in the atmosphere. You can also see a one year lag between AMO and the carbon flux. This is because the AMO lags the tropical Pacific by about a year.
The point of all this is that temperature is driving CO2, not the other way around.
We have good measurements of atmospheric CO2 only since 1958. Before that time our measurements were at the mercy of whatever ice does to captured CO2. We have good global measurements of temperature only from 1979, the beginning of the satellite era. This means that all of our measurement periods are shorter than the natural cycles. We have hints only from surface and ship measurements that go back 120 years, that some of the natural cycles are ~60 years long. We are presently at a convergence and peak of several of those natural cycles. There are suggestions that we are past the peak of some longer solar cycles. I use the words “hints” and “suggestions” because of the large errors, lack of global coverage, and wishful thinking adjustments to these measurements. There are two possibilities. If CO2 drives temperature, then temperatures should continue to climb. If it doesn’t, then temperatures will fall, then, shortly, CO2 will fall also. Nature is in the process of demonstrating which is which. We can just watch.

According to the reports, Danish Climate and Energy Minister Rasmus Petersen “plans to scrap future offshore Wind Power projects” and wants “the price reduced for electric power produced at off-shore wind parks. Otherwise, the minister is ready to drop future projects.”
According to the Jyllands-Posten, the minister said:
“I am unhappy that the price of power from the Anholt offshore wind farm is so high. I think paying 1.05 kroner per kilowatt-hour (kWh) is too much,” he told the newspaper.”

Borse writes:
New projects can be dropped.
The current market price for electricity is DKK 0.25. This means that the Anholt offshore wind farm is costing companies and Danish electricity customers 1.3 billion DKK in green electricity charges annually.
The Minister thus told Jyllands-Posten that he is ready to drop the two large-scale offshore wind turbine projects Horns Rev 3 and Krieger’s Flak with a total capacity of 1000 MW.
In comparison, the Anholt offshore wind farm produces has a capacity of 400 MW and is the largest Danish offshore wind farm.”

We can mock and have fun because they predicted this stuff would not going to happen anymore and of course now that it is happening they’re all saying it’s consistent with their theory. It’s unscientific claptrap at this point.
On radical climate scientists proposed measures to deal with skeptics Morano says:
It’s scary stuff. This is their, in many ways their doomsday type, cultist religion where they believe we have brought our own destruction, and it’s a lot of Medieval witchcraft mixed in.”
Morano reacts to Barbara Boxer’s proposals to protect the climate by levying taxes on carbon: “This is witchcraft.”
Morano calls the beliefs of global warming science “pagan culture, primitive civilization“. He also ridicules the New York Times for claiming, “Bundle Up, It’s Global Warming!”

Share this...FacebookTwitterOff the subject today: a short report on Obama’s popularity in Germany, which likely won’t get much attention from the US mainstream media.
The NSA spying scandal and Edward Snowden have taken a massive toll on Barack Obama’s and the USA’s approval rating among Germans, new surveys reveal.
According to Germany’s online Die Zeit weekly, “Only 43 percent are satisfied with his political work, 52 percent are dissatisfied. That’s a profound popularity loss: In April 2010 Obama’s approval reached 88 percent.”
The spying affair not only has had a catastrophic impact on Obama’s popularity in Germany and the rest of Europe, but it has also badly tarnished the USA’s image overall. Only 35 percent of Germans rank the USA as a trustworthy partner and 61 percent say that the USA is not a partner that can be trusted.
The survey results were released by ARD-Deutschlandtrend. The numbers are shocking as Germany has long been considered as one of the USA’s most steadfast and trusted allies.

When it comes to whistleblower Edward Snowden, 60% of Germans view him as a hero and only 14% regard him as criminal.
These are devastating numbers and overall represent an almost unprecedented foreign policy debacle, to say the least.
72% think Obama is lying
Germany’s no. 1 daily by circulation, BILD here, also conducted a survey of Germans on whether or not they believed Obama was telling the truth about eavesdropping on Chancellor Merkel’s mobile phone calls. BILD writes:
According to a survey by BILD, 72% of the Germans DON’T believe the US president when he claims he was not aware the NSA was eavesdropping on the mobile phone of Angela Merkel (59, CDU).”

Share this...FacebookTwitterIf Russia doesn’t behave responsibly soon, then there’s going to be a price to pay, Greenpeace is warning. Greenpeace thinks it can put the political pressure on Russia. We suspect that Russia as a result is getting really nervous by now and that she will soon cave in to Greenpeace’s mighty demands…maybe even within a few days. (Some sarcasm here).
In its recent blog piece Greenpeace is sending a message that it lining up a formidable political army against Russia, writing:
Let me take you on a small world tour, which illustrates the depth and breadth of the support we have received. Especially when you remember, that this is just a small selection, a snapshot.”
Greenpeace writes that even Iran and 13 Nobel prize winners have joined. Gee, Russia better back down real soon.
Hope at COP 19 already fading
Ingemar Nordin’s Swedish climate blog Stockholms Initiativet here today is already warning COP 19 is already looking like a failure, citing Reuters, which writes:
World governments are likely to recoil from plans for an ambitious 2015 climate change deal at talks next week, concern over economic growth at least partially eclipsing scientists’ warnings of rising temperatures and water levels. […]
Since 2009, scientists’ warnings have become more strident and new factors have emerged, sometimes dampening the impact of their message that human activity is driving warming. […]. Emerging economies such as China and India, heavily reliant on cheap, high-polluting coal to end poverty, are reluctant to take the lead despite rising emissions and pollution that are choking cities. […]

…many governments, especially in Europe, are concerned that climate policies, such as generous support schemes for solar energy, push up consumer energy bills.”
Nordin concludes: “The old hope that these mega-summits will lead to a binding international agreement is small.”
Renewables Cheerleader Germany Spews More CO2
Lastly, Germany’s flagship daily the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung here writes that despite the hundreds of billions of euros Germany has spent or committed on curbing its CO2 emissions, its emissions of the “climate gas” increased in 2013. Not only are Germany’s efforts very costly, but they are also proving to be completely ineffective. And even if they were effective, Germany’s CO2 reduction would result only in less than a tenth of a degree of reduced warming by 2100. Either way it all represents economic imbecility.
The FAZ writes that Germany’s emissions are expected to be 20 million tonnes more in 2013, a sharp rise of 2%.
The reason for Germany’s failure to combat the supposed climate-warming gas? The FAZ writes: “Foremost the cold winter has driven the consumption of gas upwards. Emissions from greater coal and petroleum consumption have also increased considerably.”
In a nutshell: Cold weather is foiling Germany’s attempts to fight warming! The tremendous nonsense never ends.

Share this...FacebookTwitterUpdate:  Reader Kåre Kristiansen comments below that electric vehicle owners also get “free electricity for electric cars at some public charging places and no payment for an electric car on ferries.”
=====================================
Germany’s online daily TAZ has an article on how an electric car has reached the No. 1 position when it comes to new car registrations in Norway. This will certainly cause tree-huggers globally to run out and praise the Scandinavian country as a model of green, responsible living and demand that the rest of the world adopt its way.

Nissan Leaf no. 1 seller in Norway. Photo source: M 93, licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 3.0 Germany license.
The TAZ writes that the Nissan Leaf took the number one spot in new-car registration in the Nordic country in both September and in October, reaching a market share of 5.1% and 5.6% respectively. And because almost 100% of Norway’s electricity comes from hydro-electric power plants, transportation with an electric car is practically carbon-neutral (so long you do not look at the car’s manufacture).
Norway is the first country in the world to be able to boast having an electric car as the no.1 seller. The TAZ reports that the electric car market in Norway has doubled in one year alone and that 50,000 electric vehicles will be registered in the sparsely populated country by 2016. That would be about 2% of the country’s entire fleet.
Made attractive with $90,000 in subsidies
So why all the success in Norway? Has there been some kind of technological breakthrough that has made electric cars attractive to consumers? The answer is no.
All the good news ends as soon as you take a look at the price tag that’s been attached to entice consumers to buy the electric vehicles. It’s a whopper.

The TAZ writes that each vehicle gets subsidized to the tune of up to €70,000 per car (more than $90,000). So do not expect to see too many environmentalists running around preaching the virtues of the Norwegian electric car model. Very few countries, even among the rich ones, are able to afford that kind of money.
So what do all the subsidies include? First the TAZ writes that buyers are exempt from paying Norway’s notoriously formidable 25% value added tax on the purchase of the vehicle. Moreover they are also exempt from paying the registration fees, import duties (Norway doesn’t have a domestic auto manufacturer), and buyers are allowed to deduct more expenses with e-cars when filing their income taxes. Furthermore, electric vehicle owners are exempted from paying tolls on highways and bridges.
Another perk is that electric car drivers also are free to use bus lanes in bigger cities. Everything together tallies up to big money. The TAZ writes:
Calculations showing that state coffers subsidize buyers of luxury electric cars like the Tesla S to the tune of 60,000 to 70,000 have sparked a debate on whether or not the state subsidies are exaggerated.”
Norway’s prosperity stems largely from oil and gas
Ironically Norway’s high standard of living is in large part due to its huge North Sea reserves of fossil fuels, mainly gas and oil, which have been exploited over the last decades. What made Norway rich is today being villianized. Gas and oil are what has helped to make the country prosperous and made it possible for the country to afford its current foray in costly electric cars.
How much would it cost the USA to adopt and implement Norway’s model, ignoring the cost of expanding the electric power generation needed to charge the cars?  According to Wikipedia there are approx. 250 million cars on the road in the USA. Subsidizing every electric car with say $50,000 per car in order to replace the fossil fuel cars would produce a price tag of $12.5 trillion – an astronomical sum of money. Never mind the monumental technical problems involved.
The sheer size of the subsidy needed to get people to buy the electric vehicles alone tells you that they have a very long way to go before they make any economic sense. In fact, technological progress in the improved design and efficiency of internal combustion engines have resulted in far greater fuel savings than any green energy subsidy program has ever yielded thus far.

Share this...FacebookTwitterProf. Hans von Storch at his Klimazwiebel has an interview with Swedish meteorology expert Lennart Bengtsson, who just announced he is joining Benny Peiser’s Global Warming Policy Foundation (GWPF). Bengtsson represents yet another high-profile warmist scientist who has decided that “skeptics” have arguments that need to be heard in a far more open debate.
Klimazwiebel writes (and quotes…with emphasis added):
On the occasion of the press release by GWPF: “Professor Lennart Bengtsson Joins GWPF Academic Advisory Council” I wanted to hear Lennart’s own position on this mattter and prepared some question. Here are his answers:
Before I try to reply to your questions I need to provide some general background
My interest i climate science and in weather prediction has always been driven by scientific curiosity and I have increasingly been disturbed by the strong tendencies to politization that has taken place in climate research in recent years. I believe most serious scientists are sceptics and are particularly frustrated that we are not able to properly validate climate change simulations. I have always tried to follow the philosophy of Karl Popper that I believe is particularly important when you are dealing with complex systems of which the climate system is a primary example. For this reason empirical evidence is absolutely essential. The warming of the climate system since the end of the 19th century has been very modest by some ¾°C in spite of the simultaneous increase in greenhouse gas forcing by 2.5-3 W/m2.
I am concern that this as well as the lack of ocean surface warming in some 17 years has not been properly recognized by IPCC. Nor have the cooling and increase in sea ice around Antarctica been properly recognized. Climate science must be focussed to understand such matters much better and for this reason it is appropriate to have an open mind and not follow the IPCC as believers of a religious faith.
I certainly believe that most scientists are potentially worried because of…”

Bengtsson is a scientist who was always highly regarded, that is until he opened the debate door to let in skeptics and announced he was joining GWPF. The reaction from the alarmists is proving to be harsh, as expected. But already it’s going below the belt.
Putting the GWPF in the same basket as the KKK?
At Klimazwiebel physicist and settled-science insister Georg Hoffmann left a comment where he parallels the GWPF to the Ku Klux Klan:
If Lennart Bengtsson thinks that he has to better understand ‘people with different views’ he has not necessarily to join their club. I am also interested in understanding racism but I wouldnt join the Ku Klux Klan just for better empathy.”
By comparing climate change to racism, Hoffmann attempts to turn it into a moral issue. And questioning it as the GWPF does is deemed as detestable as being in the same camp as the Ku Klux Klan.
And they wonder why sober scientists like Bengtsson and Curry are turning their backs on the alarmist camp.

Share this...FacebookTwitterI got an email from the head of an Ontario wind-turbine protest-group seeking information about wind power development in Germany.
Ontario, it appears, is poised to industrialize its landscape – thinking this will somehow lead to nicer weather. The head of the protest group wrote that the Ontario windpark promoters and lobbyists “are continually referring to Germany and their Energiewende and how successful their implementation of renewables is in that country.”
First off, the claim that the Energiewende in Germany has been successful is an outright lie, and it shows that Ontarian leaders haven’t done their homework on wind power and renewables. The German politicians and activists who spread that myth forgot to mention that 1) German power rates have skyrocketed due to the feed-in act, 2) industries are now threatening to leave, citing costly and unreliable energy supply, and 3) protests against windparks in Germany are becoming increasingly fierce as nobody wants them in their backyard anymore. Moreover, the outputs are far from what was promised. More than ever plans for new windparks are being forced offshore. But there too the technical problems, and thus profitability problems, are great.
So it shouldn’t come as a surprise that Germany is drastically scaling back its subsidies for renewable energies and windparks. Last year alone Germany saw a 55% plunge in solar investments, and over the last 2 years Germany’s solar manufacturing industry has been all but obliterated. So much for the green dream.
How has Germany been coping with its struggling Energiewende? Answer: they’ve been quietly bringing coal power plants back on line. Last year CO2 emissions climbed for the second year in a row. In a nutshell: Germany’s landscape has been littered with windparks and and solar panels, yet it’s burning more coal today than ever.
10H rule
With all the failure you’d think Germany would be reconsidering its Energiewende. It turns out that the country is doing precisely that.
For example in the idyllic German state of Bavaria, Minister President Horst Seehofer has put into place a 10H rule for new proposed windparks in order to protect citizens and their property. The 10H rule requires wind turbines to keep a minimum distance from of 10 times the turbine’s height from residential areas. For example, a 200-meter tall turbine would need to have a distance of 2000 meters from the nearest home. The result: it disqualifies most plans for new wind parks.

Seehofer says that while he wants to see wind turbines in the state, citizens have to be protected from them.
But the powerful wind lobby is howling in reaction: “The consequence will be the end of the Energiewende,” said Günter Beermann, Chairman of the state association for wind energy.”
The online Main Post here also writes:
The head of the Greens in the state parliament had even harsher words. Ludwig Hartmann from Landsberg: ‘With the 10H distance rule wind energy in Bavaria is dead. […] If wind energy cannot find a home in Bavaria, then the Energiewende in Bavaria will not function.’ The environment expert is calling for sticking to the plan of expanding wind turbines in Bavaria to 1500. Currently there are 600. Minister president Seehofer has distanced himself from the expansion target. ‘I assume that the number will be considerably less with our new concept,’ he told the Süddeutsche Zeitung.”
The oxygen for the wind industry is getting fatally thin in Southern Germany. And even if Seehofer should fail to uphold his 10H rule, then chances will still remain bleak for the wind industry in Bavaria. This is due in large part to the considerable technical and economic shortcomings of onshore wind power. The Main Post writes:
Behind this there is the question of how much wind is there at a location and how profitably can a turbine operate. The rule of thumb: Wind turbines at the coast can produce about 100 percent, wind turbines offshore out in the open sea about 140 percent, wind turbines inland however only about 70 to 80 percent. Which wind turbines are to get subsidized in the future remains the decision of the federal government. Should the limit be set at 80%, then wind energy in Bavaria no longer has a chance. On that experts of the CSU and the opposition both agree.”
And in an interview with the Neue Energie magazine here, German federal parliamentarian Josef Göppel said:
If the pincer movement using the rule with minimum distance of ten times the turbine’s height and minimum performance of 75% gets used, then there will be no chance left for wind power in Southern Germany.”

Share this...FacebookTwitterThis year western Europe has experienced a mild winter as a parade of low pressure systems coming in from off the Atlantic has fed the continent with a steady supply of mild southerly winds.
For Germany this winter will be the first mild one in 6 years after a record 5 consecutive winters of colder than normal winters. The warm winter here may be in part due to the massive cold that has dipped and remained deep into North America over much of the winter. As cold Arctic air clashes with warm Atlantic air off the southeast coast of the USA, low pressure systems are spawned and travel across the pond to Europe.
Yesterday Ulli Kulke of Die Welt writes that this milder winter is more the exception than the rule, resulting from the positive North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO). Despite this year’s warm winter, the winters for Europe over the coming decades are expected to be on the cold side. Kulke writes:
Meteorologist Dominik Jung of ‘wetter.net‘ recently examined the temperature development for many ski areas in Germany, Austria and Switzerland and reached the result that ‘in the last 20 years, its has gotten cooler’ and ‘in some place quite massively’. The trend looks good for skiing.”
The winters, Kulke writes, are very much dependent on the natural ocean cycles.
The changeovers between positive and negative NAO occur in roughly 30 year cycles. And so that means after the last large changeover just before the millennium, there are still over 15 years of ‘good skiing and sliding left’.

Share this...FacebookTwitterFormer IPCC Author Kevin Trenberth admits in a new paper: PDO ocean oscillation contributed to the 1976-1998 warming phase
By Dr. Sebastian Lüning and Prof. Fritz Vahrenholt
(Translation, editing by P Gosselin)
It took a while, but ocean cycles have finally been adopted by the IPCC as an important climate factor. With John Fasullo, Kevin Trenberth has written in a new paper appearing in the journal Earth’s Future that the warming pause taking place since 1998 indeed may have something to do with the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO). Also even Trenberth’s pal Stefan Rahmstorf suddenly thinks it’s a good possibility, writing in his Klimalounge blog on December 16, 2013:
Leading US climatologist Kevin Trenberth has been conducting research in this field for 20 years and has just published a comprehensive enlightening article on the subject. Trenberth emphasizes the role of the ENSO’s long-term fluctuations, the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO). Said in simpler terms: It’s about phases in the tropical Pacific that have more frequent El Niños and phases that have more frequent La Niña conditions (like right now), which can last up to decades. The latter brings with it an ongoing somewhat slower warming of the earth’s surface temperature because more heat gets stored deeper in the oceans. One important point here: even if the surface temperature is stagnating, our planet continues to absorb a net amount of heat.”
The other “important point” that Rahmstorf fails to mention is of even greater importance. Trenberth explicitly admits in his new paper that the 1976-1998 warming phase is attributed in part to the positive phase of the PDO (original text):
The picture emerging is one where the positive phase of the PDO from 1976 to 1998 enhanced the surface warming somewhat by reducing the amount of heat sequestered by the deep ocean, while the negative phase of the PDO is one where more heat gets deposited at greater depths, contributing to the overall warming of the oceans but cooling the surface somewhat. The Pacific Ocean appears to account for the majority of the decadal variability… Nevertheless, the events in the Pacific undoubtedly also affect the Atlantic, Indian, and Southern Oceans as the system acts collectively to equilibrate to these changes in the flow of energy.
In 2012 when we brought up the PDO as one of the triggers for the 1976-1998 warming in our “Die kalte Sonne” book and proposed ocean cycles as a sort of pulse generator for temperature cycles on a decadal scale, we were met with fierce resistance from the German climate science establishment. Now less than 2 years later, “Die kalte Sonne” finds itself as mainstream science.

At a Royal Society meeting in 2013, Julia Slingo of the Met office played devil’s advocate and posed the following question to Prof Jochen Marotzke of the German Max Planck Institute of Meteorology, see the 42:46 mark royalsociety.org/marotzke.mp3:
“…it’s a great presentation about 15 years being irrelevant,  but I think, some of us might say if you look at the Pacific Decadal Oscillation and it’s timescale that it appears to work, it could be 30 years, and therefore I think, you know, we are still not out of the woods yet on this one. … If you do think it’s internal variability, and you say we do think the Pacific Decadal Oscillation is a key component of this, and it’s now in it’s particular phase, but was previously in the opposite phase, could you not therefore explain the accelerated warming of the 80s and 90s as being driven by the other phase of natural variability?”
Simplifying Slingo’s  incoherence: “If the current cooling is due to the negative PDO phase, then wouldn’t the warming of the 80s and 90s be a result of the positive PDO phase back then?”
Marotzke answers after much incoherence of his own:
Um…I guess I’m not sure.”
These people make no sense at all. They are sure it’s the oceans’ cold phase gobbling up heat when temperatures fail to rise. But when temperatures increase, they just can’t be sure that the oceans are involved at all, and insist they would not bet much money on it. Of course it just can’t work only one way. Marotzke is delivering only what would call unadulterated absurd science.

Share this...FacebookTwitterPolar scientist Dr. Peter Lemke of Germany’s renowned Alfred Wegener Institute was interviewed here about climate change, its affect on the Earth’s polar regions and about his recent winter expedition to Antarctica.
In the Arctic part of the interview, Lemke repeats the usual man-is-melting-the-Arctic narrative that you often hear from many state-funded alarmist climate scientists. No surprise here.
But as always, when it comes to sea ice, eventually warmist polar scientists get tripped up by Antarctica. And sure enough, Lemke trips and stumbles when Antarctic sea ice gets brought up. Before too long he is forced to concede he is stumped and has to admit that sea ice at the South Pole has grown and that he has no real explanation.
Peter Lemke has been on several expeditions to Antarctica: in 1989, 1992, 2006, and now 2013. And each time they collected data. Today, after comparing the preliminary results of the 2013 to those of 1992, here’s what Lemke says:
“…from our early results, it looks like that the sea ice mass around Antarctica has increased slightly. Our measurements showed that the sea ice was more extensive, thicker and more densely packed as compared to our 1992 expedition, which was on the same track during the same season.”
Increased slightly? In the following chart I’ve highlighted the winter of the years 1992 and 2013 to show what Lemke means by “increased slightly“:

It’s obvious that Lemke is attempting to seriously downplay the Antarctic sea ice growth that has occurred since 1992. Indeed the above chart shows that sea ice has grown by more than 1.5 million square kilometers. That’s not increasing “slightly”.  We suppose that if the trend had been the other way around, we’d be hearing terms like considerable reduction or even possibly dramatic reduction.
What’s more, Lemke also confirms that this extra 1.5 million square kilometers is “thicker” and “more compact”, meaning there’s much more ice mass.
So why is the ice growing? This goes against all the claims of global warming. Here, typical of warmist scientists who are confronted with inconvenient data, Lemke acts like he has the answer…before admitting he really has no clue (my emphasis):
One explanation is that in the Southern Hemisphere the westerly winds are increasing, and through friction this drives the ice towards lower latitudes and the extent is getting a bit bigger.  When the ice expands there is open water between ice floes, and it’s still cold enough in winter that ice freezes in the open patches.
There are other physical processes that may be involved, such as the heavy snow cover that blankets the Antarctic sea ice. Sometimes the heavy snow load submerges the ice floe underwater so that the interface of ice and snow is actually below sea level, and seawater drains into the snow and freezes. That may be one process, but there are others that are not really resolved yet.
We don’t yet have the answers to these questions, because there are very few measurements and you cannot deduce snow from satellite remote sensing data, yet. To find out, you have to go there and make measurements yourself. But winter expeditions are very rare. There are very few icebreakers that can actually go into the Antarctic winter into the sea ice.”
The science is settled, except for the majority that isn’t.
Never trust a climate scientist who acts like he’s sure. It’s a dead give away that he hasn’t got a clue about what’s really going on.

Share this...FacebookTwitterMy  last post on sea level rise here led to Swedish blog site Stockholms Initiativet to post on the subject as well.
That post in turn sparked a reader comment from top Swedish climate scientist Lennart Bengtsson, translated in English (my emphasis):
Hi
We now have satellite measurements for 20 years which indicate a steady rise of about 3 mm per year, and during that time no acceleration, See: http://sealevel.colorado.edu/.
However, it is important to be clear that this is an average and that there were considerable local variations related to tectonic changes, among others, after the last ice age. The isostatic adjustment that needs to be done in order to obtain useful data are being evaluated by the experts now. As you can see from the graph, it is clear that we need a relatively long time to obtain a realistic trend, but 20 years is certainly enough. On Monday I was involved in a public panel discussion with Pachauri who insisted that this is an acceleration. I found that I think I know more about this than Mr. Pachauri. The reference above appears to me quite compelling.“
You just gotta love it. So even though the observations show there is no real detectable acceleration in sea level rise, Pachauri “insists that this is an acceleration“. It’s all in their fantasies and crystal ball models. None of it is real. This is what the panic is based on.
Also note that Bengtsson calls the comprehensive compilation of by K.E. Puls “quite compelling”. No surprise here as real observations tend to be so.

Share this...FacebookTwitterThe online German daily Die Welt here  has an interview with ARD public television chief meteorologist Karsten Schwanke on why it’s so cold in North America. He attributes the severe cold to an “unusually stable pattern by the Jet Stream“.
As I read the interview I waited for the “is global warming the cause?” question. It didn’t come until the very end. Overall the interview was quite factual throughout, much to my relief.
Schwanke tells Die Welt that the cold air mass was brought down to the states by a “polar vortex” and that “North America is geographically predestinated for cold air to come south very quickly because there are no mountain ranges to block the way.”
So we see from Schwanke’s explanation that such a phenomenon is not unknown and is natural; it happened in the past. Time magazine for example blamed global cooling for the development of “circumpolar vortices” back in 1974: Read here. And Princeton physicist William Happer says: “Polar vortices have been around forever. They have almost nothing to do with more CO2 in the atmosphere.” Read here.
Schwanke tells Die Welt that currently there is a very clear pattern in the northern hemisphere, one that is made up of four main blocks of weather: “There are two cold regions, namely North America and Central Siberia, and two warm regions: Europe and Eastern Siberia.” Schwanke describes the current Jet Stream as having very few dips and rises, thus causing large regions to remain stuck in a certain weather pattern for weeks.
Forecasts beyond 8 days are “rather uncertain”
On how long the cold pattern will continue keeping North America in its grip, Schwanke says this is very difficult to say: “There are various weather models that are still currently contradicting each other. Forecasts more than eight days into the future are in any case rather uncertain.”
On how the cold weather in North America impacts the weather in Europe, Schwanke says:

Very cold air masses that flow from North America into the Atlantic end up mixing with warmer air from the south. This is how gigantic low pressure systems are formed over the Atlantic and produce south west currents – this is why it’s so warm where we are.”
There we have it: mid and north Atlantic storms are triggered by cold air masses.
On the question as to when winter will finally arrive in Germany, Schwanke thinks there may be a fundamental change in the works over the next two weeks, but the models are still too uncertain on this.
When asked if man can have an impact on the weather, Schwanke replies that “today there is not really any serious scientific evidence to show that really works – getting clouds to rain for example. The energy movements in the atmosphere are so great that a few human measures would be smaller than pin pricks.”
At the very end: He is asked if there a connection between extreme weather and climate change? Here Schwanke replies saying that cold snaps “will not change global warming, which we are experiencing: Eastern Siberia is warmer than it has been in a long time. Europe will have one of the warmest winters in a long time.”
Unfortunately Schwanke obviously has not looked at the global temperatures for the last 15 years. NO WARMING!
He then tells Die Welt there were some papers out that showing that Arctic sea ice extent could have an impact on the Jet Stream waves. But he didn’t come across as being too convinced. Why should he be? The great US cold snaps of the 1960s and 1970s were delivered by polar vortices at a time when Arctic sea ice extent was high.
Also there are papers showing a strong correlation between solar activity and European winters.

Share this...FacebookTwitterMeteorologists warned us that snow was on the way and would fall below the 500 m elevation in southern Germany and elsewhere. Moreover, they warned us that this winter could be one of the worst in 100 years for Central Europe.
No one knows if it’s really going to be such a winter, but one thing is sure: it sure is starting out like one! At least in parts of Central Europe.
Wetteronline.de has put up a video (Schneefall auch in München) of snow falling in Munich this morning, October 11, 2013. Normally the first snow arrives in the Bavarian capital weeks later.
20 cm of snow

‘It began to snow in the Bavarian capital of Munich yesterday evening at about 6 p.m. Many of my meteorologist colleagues had believed this to be improbable,’ said meteorologist Dominik Jung: ‘This year winter has struck early and unusually severely. South of Munich up to 20 centimeters of snow was able to pile up.'”
Die Welt adds that schools have been closed in some localities, 22,000 households in Austria have lost power, trains have come to a standstill, and traffic has been in chaos.
Frost is expected to spread across southern and middle Germany this weekend, reports www.wetter.net, “Temperatures down to -4°C are expected under clear skies in some local areas.
Global warming alarmists claim that such incidences have nothing to do with a climate trend. Yet, climate warmists are now scrambling to explain the increasing frequency of cold weather events now taking hold globally. Whether it’s a killer winter in South America, increased snow cover globally, record Arctic sea ice recovery, recovering glaciers in the Alps, record high sea ice extent in Antarctica, extreme cold in southeast Europe, or 5 consecutive colder than normal European winters, just to name a few, the ominous signs of global cooling are compounding rapidly.

CORRECTION: David Lessmann, Communications Manager of the Copenhagen Consensus Center, has written by that it is indeed “For €100 billion Climate Change Delayed 37 Hours“.
===========================
Hat-tip Die kalte Sonne.
The online schwäbische.de here presents an interview with warmist Bjorn Lomborg. His conclusion on Germany’s Energiewende (transition to renewable energy): It’s “inefficient and too expensive.”
Photo by: Emil Jupin
Lomborg, a former green activist, is just latest expert to give a failing grade to the German energy-man-on-the-moon project, which is clearly on a crash-and-burn trajectory. And despite the Energiewende’s imminent failure don’t expect the government to abandon it ever. With typical Teutonic obstinance, expect them fight to very the bitter end – until the energy system is completely ruined and the last trembly-handed-green gets ferreted from his bunker reality-surrounded bunker. That’s the German way.
The schwäbische.de writes:
Taken globally, the German Energiewinde delays global warming only a few hours.”

Though Lomborg commends Germany for its noble effort in tackling the “climate problem”, the Danish economics professor sees it as a huge waste of resources. Lomborg tells the schwäbische.de (translated from the German):
The Germans are achieving very little and are paying too much for it. This is only serving as a deterrent for other countries. With the investment of approximately 100 billion euros in solar systems, climate change is being delayed only 37 hours and is only making electricity expensive. That in turn is making your production more expensive and thus threatens jobs.”
Here I believe the schwäbische.de misquoted, and likely meant to write “approximately 100 billion euros”. In the end it boils down to a grotesque sum of money for virtually nothing.
So what should be done? According to Lomborg the answer lies in technical innovation, and this can be already be witnessed in the USA. Through the technology of fracking for natural gas, the “US-economy is experiencing through the drop in energy prices a revitalization valued at 125 billion dollars per year. At the same time the US has massively reduced its CO2 emissions.”
Lomborg also suggests that German R&D in renewable energy has been failure up to now. He adds: “Instead of investing 100 billion in subsidizing wind and solar, why not just invest the 100 billion directly into developing a better kind of renewable energy?”
Clearly the indications that the German Energiewende as we now know it is going nowhere except over a cliff are mounting. The question is: Will the government bail out before the plunge, or is it going to go over the edge and hope it miraculously survives the crash landing?

Share this...FacebookTwitterSwedish climatologist and meteorologist Lennart Bengtsson, former director of the Max Planck Institute for Meteorology in Hamburg, one of the most eminent climate scientists, has joined the London-based Global Warming Policy Foundation (GWPF) and an impressive roster of skeptic scientists and experts.
The move has sent shock waves across the climate science community, blogosphere, and into parts of the major media, for example Spiegel.
Science journalist Axel Bojanowski at Spiegel conducted an interview with Bengtsson to find out more about the motives behind the move. What follow are some excerpts.
A need to open the debate
On why Bengsston joined the skeptical GWPF, he says that he saw a need for more debate in climate science:
I think it is important to enable a broad debate on energy and climate.”
He also felt compelled to join the GWPF because he wants to contribute his meteorological knowledge “to open the debate“.
Debate in climate science is something that has been horribly lacking and it has been the target of massive suppression and censorship efforts.
Climate science consensus is senseless
Bengsston is also harshly critical of the efforts to enforce consensus:

I see no necessity on the part of the IPCC to make efforts to usher a consensus. I think it is essential that society has areas where a consensus cannot be enforced. Especially in an area like the climate system, which is incompletely understood, a consensus is senseless.
Climate models in need of review
Another aspect swaying Bengsston to speak up has been the abject failure of climate models. In the interview Bengsston maintains that he’s a friend of climate prognoses, but that they are now due for major review in order “to secure their credibility“. He says the IPCC has not been critical enough over the models:
It is frustrating that climate science is not able to validate their simulations correctly. The warming of the Earth has been much weaker since the end of the 20th century compared to what climate models show.”
Solving problems of future generations “pointless”
Many policymakers claim that it is our generation’s responsibility to solve the problems of future generations. Bengsston characterizes this notion as senseless and pointless. To illustrate why, he asks readers to look back to 1914 and asks if it is reasonable for the people back then to solve the problems of 2014. “It would be pointless!”
On the future Bengsston says civilization…
…will require twice as much primary energy as today. We need to promote new science and technology. We need a more open approach, especially here in Europe, which includes the issues of nuclear energy and genetic engineering so that the growing world population can be supplied with energy and food.”
Policymakers instead are creating problems for future generations
Right now as Bengsston sees it, global policymakers are totally on the wrong path and they risk leaving behind a planet that will not be able to cope with the needs of future generations. In trying to solve the future problems, they are only going to succeed at causing great big ones.

Share this...FacebookTwitterMeteorology professor emeritus Dr. Horst Malberg writes at the European Institute for Climate and Energy (EIKE):
As is evident from the last 15 years, the CO2-driven climate models (and the people pushing them) have a fundamental problem: They did not, or falsely predicted, the current climate development.”
Malberg writes in the conclusion:
The anthropogenic CO2 impact on climate is greatly over-estimated by the climate models and uncritical media, as the recent climate development clearly shows.”
To support this he presents charts that clearly tell us the warming has stopped:

Global annual mean temperature and climate trend since 1970 and climate prognoses since 2001 (blue curve). Chart source: Horst Malberg
 It’s not only global atmospheric temperatures that have been cooling, but so have sea surface temperatures:
 Annual sea surface temperature anomalies in the Pacific ENSO region. Chart source: Horst Malberg
Malberg also cites a paper appearing in Nature (August 2013) by Yu Kosaka and Shang-Ping Xie, who conclude that the missing warming since 1998 can be explained in large part by the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO), i.e. a natural climate process. Their model of global warming showed that about 60% (0.4°C) of the 0.68°C warming occurring between 1975-1998 can be explained by the PDO.
The decline in PDO intensity that then began in the late 1990s corresponds to the end of global warming:

In his report at EIKE, Malberg goes into further detail on the PDO’s impact on global climate. He writes that the ocean alone is an internal, secondary climate factor, and that it is not the primary climate driver. And because global temperatures are not responding to rising CO2, the trace gas can no longer be regarded as being a main driver behind climate.
Solar activity today comparable to Dalton Minimum

As the primary factor driving climate, Malberg believes it is the sun. The following charts shows the mean value for sunspot activity since 1679 along with mean Central European temperature anomaly:


Chart source: Horst Marlberg
The above two charts show a striking similarity. Malberg writes at EIKE:
Because of empirical analyses on climate change since the Little Ice Age and analyses of the behavior of the ENSO (BWK SO 18/10 and SO 05/12), we can assume that the integral (direct and indirect) solar impact on decadal climate scales is the primary and original factor.”
And adds:
With solar cycle 23 came a drastic decrease in solar activity, with a mean sunspot count of 40 in the current solar cycle 24. Such a collapse in solar activity was last seen 200 years ago during the solar Dalton-Minimum.”
The German meteorologist also says that the sun’s current activity is “without a doubt comparable to that of the Dalton-Minimum and corresponds to the approximately 200-year solar activity oscillation of the de Vries cycle“.
No warming until the middle of the 21st century
Malberg writes near the end of the essay that according to the 200-year cycle, no warming can be expected until the solar activity starts picking up again in the middle of 21st century:
The observed data of the last 300 years speak a clear language: The ‘fickle sun’ as the primary driver is what decides the fundamental extent of the cooling and the warming. The climate hypothesis of the dominance of the anthropogenic climate influence belongs immediately under scrutiny. The anthropogenic CO2 influence on climate behavior is greatly exaggerated by climate models and the uncritical media – as the recent climate developments clearly show.”
Professor Dr. Horst Malberg is the former director of the Meteorological Institute at the Free University of Berlin and a member of the EIKE Committee.

Share this...FacebookTwitterA couple years ago, Europe was acting deadly serious about forcing the rest of the world’s airlines flying in out of Europe to purchase airline emissions certificates. The rescue of the planet was at stake.
Photo: NASA, public domain.
European bureaucrats actually deluded themselves into thinking the USA, China, Russia and other global powers would dance to their tune. Background info: here, here and here.
That was the fantasy.
Now reality has hit European bureaucrats once again. Suddenly Connie Hedegaard and her EU bureacrats have decided they don’t need to charge foreign airlines to purchase CO2 emission certificates every time they fly over, into, or out of the kingdom of the EU after all. They’ve realized that 14% of the planet in favor of Kyoto can’t really boss around the other 86% who are not. It turns out that protecting multi-billion euro Airbus orders and avoiding trade sanctions are more important than climate protection after all. Thank God for the wonders of the self-correcting free market.
European media outlets are (barely) reporting that international flights may continue flying over, in, and out of Europe without having to buy pollution permits. The law applies only to flights between two European airports, so reports the Wall Street Journal here.
The climate bedwetting Klimaretter here reports that Germany’s Greens are outraged by the European compromise, saying the compromise is “clearly too little for the challenges stemming from the worldwide growth in air traffic.”
Klimaretter adds that the compromise may be only be stopped by the EU-Parliament, whose official vote is still pending.”
Boy, that’s a going to be a really tough vote: Do we commit economic suicide or not?

Share this...FacebookTwitterIt’s not a secret that scientists and politicians have been deeply disappointed by the spectacular failure of climate models. 98% of the long-term climate models failed to project the 16-year warming stop, all having overstated the warming.
So maybe it should not come as surprise that recently the German government quietly put out a bulletin describing a midterm climate forecasting system that is raising some eyebrows.

(Caption translation at end of post).
The first 4 pages of the bulletin discuss and extol the then-upcoming IPCC AR5. Pages 5 – 7 then describe three projects that aim to answer some open climate questions.
Project MiKlip first result shows cooling North Atlantic 
The most interesting project among them is the Midterm Climate Prognoses project (MiKlip) described on Page 6 of the Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF) bulletin. Page 6 shows the above chart and poses the question: “How warm is it going to be in 10 years? Business and policy need reliable climate forecasts.”
The bulletin adds that “in business and politics there is an increasing need for reliable forecasts for climate developments in the range of years up to a decade.”
And to fulfill that midterm need the German government is funding the MiKlip 10-year forecasting system, which comprises 60 individual research projects. Excerpts from page 6:



<!--

It is mainly about computer simulations that use recorded measurement data. … The MiKlip projects have been taking place since spring 2012. The first tangible results are expected to be available in September 2014. … Compared to the long-term scenarios, the results should be more exact. … The model will not deliver a forecast such as the weather at a specific location in a few years. Instead it looks more at the probable mean temperature in Europe in a certain month.”

The above chart on page 6 is a plot of North Atlantic temperature anomaly with respect to the 1971-2000. The chart comes from the Max Planck Institute for Meteorology. The caption reads:

Test forecast with the first MiKlip forecast system. The figure shows the anomaly of the sea surface temperature from the mean in the North Atlantic with the observed data shown in black from 1990 to 2011. White and orange show the test forecast beginning in 2012. Multiple decadal simulations are conducted for forecast in order to take the uncertainty of the initial conditions into account. The mean of the simulations is depicted by the white curve. The confidence intervals of the forecast (%) are shown in orange.”

Again we have to stress that this is only a “test forecast” with the first MiKlip system. But even so, the preliminary result is interesting in that it points to a serious drop in North Atlantic sea surface temperatures, which of course would have major global climate repercussions, especially in combination with a negative PDO and low solar activity.
So why are we being told that warming is continuing unabated when clearly it is not, and is not expected to for another 10 years at least?
And why is the German government funding the MiKlip models to start with? Is it because the 100-year climate models have been such a huge failure? Obviously they have been. And if the 100-year climate models failed spectacularly for even the first 10 or 20 years, then how can they be regarded as reliable for longer terms?
MiKlip is an important step back towards responsible and serious climate modeling and a sign that governments are finally abandoning the failed long-term models, having recognized that over the mid-term they are grotesquely flawed and have been terribly misleading, e.g. see here.
MiKlip is a nice step away from the dubious 100-year climate fortune-telling (which is naively, simplistically and solely based on the concentration of a single trace gas) and a real step back towards sound science. We are very much looking ahead to the first results.

Share this...FacebookTwitterI’ve gotten a few emotionalized, angry e-mails from veggie readers on the story about how meat-eaters are by far much healthier in every respect than vegetarians. They insist that their nutrition is superior and that the University of Graz study is “bullshit”. It’s bought and paid for by the bacon industry!
Yet, nothing better illustrates the fallacy of vegetarianism than looking at the children of vegetarians. The vegetarians, you will recall, like to make it a moral issue in that they blame climate change and animal abuse on meat-eating. They claim it’s the healthiest diet.
But vegetarianism for kids is turning out to be even worse than smoking for adults. One example of the impacts that vegetarianism has on children is vividly illustrated in an article appearing in the Daily Mail here. (There are many on this subject).
Rotting teeth, bone wasting…some excerpts:
…”‘I couldn’t work out what was going on,’ says Holly, who lives in Totnes, Devon. ‘We all ate exceptionally healthily, with plenty of vegetables, nuts and seeds.'”
…”I was assured by the people who devised the diet that we would get all the protein we needed from nuts and seeds, and we also took a daily supplement to replace the nutrients found in animal foods.”
…’But then I started noticing that something wasn’t right. … Bertie and Lizzie’s muscles seemed weak and they had problems seeing at night. … I couldn’t understand why this well-fed child was behaving like this. I was so brainwashed that the fact our bodies were craving dairy products had passed me by.’
…”Her parents, ‘well-known figures in Glasgow’s vegan community’, had unwittingly starved her of necessary nutrients found in fish and meat, causing her to develop the bone-wasting disease usually associated with 19th century slums.”

…'”is mother’s mistake was to follow a fad diet, hyped up by magazines and endorsed by celebrities, to a growing child.”
Sound familiar?
Thankfully, the mothers of the children realized they had been duped by junk science peddled by fashionable fanatics, and eventually brought a responsible diet back to their kids.
Yet, there are many tree-hugging vegetarians out there who insist their way of life has to be imposed on others and demand we stop eating meat. These happen to be the very people who want to tell us what’s best for the climate and the planet…based on, as is the case with vegetarianism, crackpot science peddled by charlatans experts.
If you want the entire human civilization to end up with rotting teeth, brittle bones, weak muscles and blind, then let the nutjob alarmist environmentalists run the show.
It’s clear: Bad science leads to bad results. Example: Greenpeace and golden rice.
The problem with climate science is that it is even worse than vegetarian science! And even scarier, the two are merging.
The calls for a shift away from meat because “it is bad for health and climate” are growing louder by the day.

Share this...FacebookTwitterGermans generally are very critical people, and when things aren’t exactly as they should be, they tend to get awfully bent out of shape over it.
Anything outside specifications quickly gets labeled by Germans as a “disaster”. And if it meanders beyond that, it gets labeled a catastrophe. Example: if Germany loses a World Cup football game, say 2 to 1, the game is immediately called a disaster. And should the German squad get trounced, say 3 to 0, then it is: a catastrophe.
“Katastrophe” is one of the favorite words of the German media. It gets used all the time.
Anything that finds itself not in a normal state is automatically described as “catastrophic”. That’s just the way Germans are. And since global temperature has been 0.8°C above “normal”, it’s no surprise that Germans have called it the Klimakatastrophe (climate catastrophe).
And since then, every severe storm and weather anomaly has routinely been called a “catastrophe” by the media. All departures from normal weather are called “catastrophes”. But because there have been so many “catastrophes” lately, the word itself has lost all its psychological and emotional impact. The word catastrophe in Germany is literally worn out. That has become a real problem for the German media. Today using the word “Katastrophe” produces yawns from Germans. It has no effect at all.
So what are the German media to do now that the word catastrophe no longer delivers the desired punch?
No problem- since Haiyan struck the Philippines the German media have found a new replacement word with which to wow the audience: apocalyptic, or apocalypse. Over the last few days the German public have been bombarded by these two words everywhere in the German media. The apocalypse has arrived!
For example Spiegel here, never one to refrain from sensationalism, writes of “apocalyptic conditions” in the Philippines. So does the Sueddeutsche Zeitung here.

Naturally, when the big ones like Spiegel start employing hyperdramatics, the other media outlets are forced to follow. In today’s world of diminishing media credibility and audiences, it’s a question of bare survival. The race to out-hype is on.
The Austrian website FORMAT.at here describes the Philippines as an “apocalyptic situation“. For the German media it seems the world is really coming to an end. Fanning the fans of fear and panic has become their top priority. FORMAT writes: “The dimension of Haiyan’s destruction is enormous.”
The Ruhr Nachrichten here writes of the “storm’s apocalyptic dimensions“.
The online Berlin daily Berliner Zeitung here calls Haiyan the “apocalyptic horseman“.
That the media is no longer content with sticking to the usual words for describing disasters and feels it has to upgrade to the “Sensationalize Deluxe” media package likely has a lot to do with headline grabbing.
The disaster left behind by the Haiyan is a truly serious and newsworthy. Yet when one considers that its death toll is likely to remain well below 10,000 and that history has seen far deadlier storms, the language is way over the top. The media are behaving like desperate merchants on the last day of a disaster clearance sale.
People have lost their fear of climate overall, and when the data lack and fail to stir the desired emotions of fear, panic and general hysteria, then hyperbole and extreme drama have to be resorted to. This is the sorry state to which the German media have devolved.

By the European Institute for Climate and Energy
Copenhagen/Hamburg: A Danish study that cost the taxpayer more than €2.6 million and supported by the freeloaders of the wind power, led by world’s largest wind turbine manufacturers Vestas, Siemens, and Vattenfall in Denmark, is to provide for a smooth and unobstructed process for wind turbine projects – without any protests.

Thanks to the Ministry of Research and public financing, an interdisciplinary study was written by scientists from three universities from Denmark, Ireland and England and supported by representatives of those with an interest in the wind industry. The study investigated the exchange between the organizations of the wind energy opponents, covering topics such as windpark fraud, species protection, sleep disturbance and Nina Pierpont, doctors from the state of New York who researched wind turbine syndrome which causes illness owing to low frequency noise, which 30% of Swedish residents living near windparks suffer from.
The connections between 323 websites of national and international wind opposition organizations and associations were monitored and analyzed.
Just in tiny Denmark alone there are currently 200 citizens’ initiatives and associations. Worldwide there thousands of groups and associations with hundreds of affiliated initiatives.
In response the websites of wind power opponents worldwide published a graphic of the study 2050 in order to confirm their strong network structure and to make it clear that they are a force to be reckoned with. The citizens have a democratic right to transparency and participation – worldwide. Preserving nature and its biodiversity, the landscape and human health is the mutual target of this global movement.
Vestas is providing a scandal in that it continues to spread the myth there are no adverse impacts on human health from infra and low frequréncy noise, despite a recently uncovered Vestas-PPP from 2004, which indicates to the contrary: windwahn.de/skandal-in-der-sauberen-windkraftbranche.

Share this...FacebookTwitterIf you think things couldn’t get more absurd with Germany’s Energiewende, think again.
The German Bundesverbandes der Energie- und Wasserwirtschaft (Federal Association of Energy and Water Management) or BDEW, released its latest report on electricity production in Germany. The BDEW represents about 1800 companies of the energy and power sector.
Germany burns more coal, emits more CO2!
According to the German Press Agency (dpa), the BDEW reports coal power plants provided 45.5% of Germany’s electric power needs in 2013 compared to 44% in 2012. That’s an increase of more than 3%. Although Germany has invested hundreds of billions in green energy, CO2 emissions are rising. In 2013 renewable energy provided 23.4% of Germany’s electricity needs, up from 22.8% in 2012.
Natural gas, often considered a reliable alternative to coal and nuclear, fell in Germany from 12.1% to 10.5% German power companies say natural gas is too expensive. The dpa writes that “the share of electricity produced by burning lignite reached the highest level since 1990.”

Solar energy’s share, despite billions in investments, only rose from 4.2% to 4.5%. Wind power production in Germany took a hit in 2013. Its share of German power was only 7.9% in 2013 compared to 8.0% in 2012 (a drop of 3.5%). The BDEW says this was due to the weather (less windy than 2012). Overall wind power in Germany is facing new hurdles. The dpa reports:
Energy Minister Sigmar Gabriel (SPD) wants to present a framework for a more affordable Energiewende by Easter – foremost subsidies for wind turbines onshore may be cut back.”
Cold weather foils Germany’s fight against global warming
For whatever reason the Süddeutsche zeitung left out the following from the dpa:
The increasing CO2 emissions that threaten Germany’s climate targets are traced back, according to Müller, foremost to the long heating season at the start of 2013 and the falling share of gas.
In other words: Cold weather foiled Germany’s fight against global warming in 2013.

If the IPCC had truly examined past temperature developments and compared them to solar data, they’d have seen there is something remarkable there.
Yet in the IPCC AR5, Working Group 1 takes only a cursory look at solar activity and its possible impacts on climate in IPCC AR5 before simply dismissing the sun altogether. The Earth’s sole supplier of energy, the sun, and all its dynamism, in fact gets only a couple of pages in a 2200-page report, about 0.1%. That alone is a monumental scandal. It’s incompetence and negligence on the grandest of scales.
This will certainly go down in the books as one of the greatest scientific debacles of human history.
If the IPCC had directed the same energy and resources to make the sun and natural factors the culprit for climate change as it has with CO2, they’d certainly have a far more convincing case today,and many of the questions it claims are still open would be closed. But obviously the IPCC’s sole intent is to frame mankind and its CO2 emissions as the culprit for something that stopped happening 16 years ago. This is fraud, not science.
The IPCC took the same negligent approach with sea levels: dismissing non-alarmist science in favor of nutty, doomsday scenarios.
I spent half a day searching for papers that provide evidence of a significant impact on climate by the sun and natural factors, and another full day sorting through them. I limited the scope of the search to 2008 – 2012, i.e. papers since the last IPCC report. There are many more papers of course prior to 2008.
What follows is a list of papers I found in just a few hours that the IPCC should have taken a much closer look at instead of just dismissing. The list of course is not complete.
An excellent resource that really speeded things up was the site:
Popular Technology.net
Popular technology is actually a list of 1100 papers that the IPCC wishes did not exist.
For some of the papers I’ve included links to additional information and some important quotes. Unfortunately I was not able to do this for every paper as time is limited.
Because of this gross negligence/incompetence on the IPCC’s part, the AR5 fifth is at best a woefully incomplete work and thus has reached a faulty conclusion.

Share this...FacebookTwitterIf you’re in Berlin next month, here’s an event you’ll want to put in your calendar.
Dr. Peter Heller of Science Skeptical writes here that Germany’s Helmholtz Association is holding a podium discussion in Berlin on March 17, 2014. The title:
“What can we believe? The climate debate and its impacts”
So even some prestigious German science research institutes are starting to second guess claims that climate science is settled and the debate is over. Moreover, skeptic views (the very backbone of scientific progress) are being given a serious platform for open discussion once again.
The podium discussion invitation reads (my emphasis):
The next segment in our Fokus@Helmholtz discussion series is titled: ‘What can we believe? The climate debate and its impacts’. At the end of March the second part of the IPCC Report will presented to the public  in Yokohama, Japan. It will once again cast questions about climate change, its impacts on man and environment. International scientists are already discussing amid controversy and are jockeying for a mutual answers in the climate question. When scientists are struggling, how can citizens understand what is going on with our climate and act responsibly? Why is the dispute among the scientists so fierce? What’s driving the climate skeptics? And: Which questions can climate models answer at all? Many people are asking what should be believed: Is climate change not really as bad as first thought? What impact does man have on it and to what extent? What roles do political interests play when it comes to forecasts?
We warmly invite you to the fourth of the Fokus@Helmholtz series taking place Monday, 17 March 2014, at 7 p.m. (entrance starting at 6:30 p.m.) in the DKB Atrium (Taubenstraße 7, 10117 Berlin). Under the title: “What can we believe? The climate debate and its impacts“ we would like to mutually discuss with you and with representatives from business, advanced education and non-university research.
Please register.
The event series Fokus@Helmholtz brings research, politics and society together on a regular basis in order to discuss the controversial questions of the future. The Helmholtz Association and its invited guests would like to look beyond the horizon, to question options for action, and to provide food for thought.”
Wow! Hard to believe but the Helmholtz here is testing a return back to science. Gone, at least for the moment, are the claims the discussion is over and the crude attempts to marginalize alternative viewpoints. Are we seeing a climate science renaissance?
The Helmholtz provides the program itenary:

Welcome:

Prof. Dr. Jürgen Mlynek, President of the Helmholtz Association

Podium discussion:

Frank Drieschner, Die Zeit
Dr. Oliver Geden, Foundation for Science and Policy
Dr. Peter Heller, “Science Skeptical Blog”
Prof. Andreas Hense, University of Bonn
Prof. Hans von Storch, Helmholtz Centre Geestacht Ventre for Material and Coastal Research

Moderation: Jan-Martin Wiarda, Helmholtz Association
“Four or five years ago this hardly would have been possible”
Peter Heller, a named participant in the above podium discussion, writes at Science Skeptical:
Also even if I am just the “quota skeptic ” it is indeed courageous of the Helmholtz Association to invite someone like me. Four or five years this hardly would have been possible or even considered. By the way, my participation is not because of the profile and impact of Science Skeptical, but solely because of the recommendation by Hans von Storch, whom I wish to thank.
The event description, however, still shows a deficit in partiality. ‘What is driving the skeptics, I don’t know and it is also not relevant. Indeed the question is foremost what is it that the alarmists find so neat about their horror scenarios and transformation fantasies. In the end, reason needs no further justifications. However insisting there’s a need to believe in something, does. Believe what you wish, but keep in mind there is a difference to knowledge.
I’m really curious to see how things will go. And at the and of the evening should people go home with the knowledge that skeptics are not people who practice occult rituals and worship Satan, but rather are the ones with a clear and calm heads in the climate debate, then that will certainly suffice.”
Any readers who happen to be in the Berlin area and who command the German language, this is one event you may not want to pass up. German skeptics can look forward to a good discussion – should Heller not get disinvited, that is.
For now let’s just say that Helmholtz Association is on “Disinvitation Watch” for the next few weeks.

The Climb Out Of The Ice Age
Part 2
By Ed Caryl
Below is a plot of sea level and temperature for the last 21,000 years, when the world warmed out of the last ice age, and civilization became possible. This is the end of the Upper Pleistocene and the dawn of the Holocene. Note, that at the end of the last ice age it took 12,000 years for all the ice to melt. It was a long slog out of the caves. That first warm period, from 10,200 Before Present (BP) to 8200 BP was warmer than it is today, even though a third of the ice was still melting. The last major ice melted about 6500 years ago.

Figure 1 is a plot of the last 21,000 years. The heavy purple and green traces are sea level with the scale on the right. The thin rust and blue traces are temperature from a greenland ice core and the Antarctic Dome C ice core respectively with the scale on the left. Three other time lines are: thick blue, the time of the last North African Pluvial period, when the Sahara was a grassland; dark orange, the time of the Persian Gulf flooding; and the light orange timeline, interrupted several times, were times of Alpine glacier recession. The short 8.2 kilo year cold period is marked in light blue. Various sea level high stands just above the green sea level trace are labeled in the legend. The grey time-line is the time of the Clovis Amerindian culture. The pink timeline is the time of the Folsom Amerindian culture.
I call your attention to several things in Figure 1. From right to left, old to more recent: The end of the ice age began about 20,000 years ago, when the northern hemisphere suddenly warmed by 5°C as seen at the source of the Greenland ice, the North Atlantic. The Southern Ocean, as seen at Dome C, did not warm for another 2000 years. But, the Bølling Interstadial warming took place simultaneously, globally, 14,500 years ago. During that short warming interval, the ancestors of the American Indians made their way across the Beringian plain, down either the west coast of what is now Canada, or down through an ice-free corridor through Alaska and central Canada, thence down across the length of the Americas to as far south as Terra Del Fuego in just a couple of thousand years.
In North America, by 13,500 years BP, the Amerindian Clovis culture was living off the megafauna, the large mammals present in this era, using beautifully worked large stone spear-points. 1500 years later, after the megafauna were killed off, either by the Clovis people or the cold Younger Dryas period, they morphed into the Folsom Culture, using smaller stone spear-points more suited to the smaller remaining animals.
In North Africa, and southwest Asia, beginning 15,000 years ago, because earth’s axis tilt began to favor the northern hemisphere during summer, the deserts were favored with additional summer monsoon rainfall. This allowed more human migration from north Africa into the Levant. At this time the Persian Gulf was a low valley watered by the Tigris and Euphrates rivers and several others, some now dry wadis, combining into the Ur Schott river, and before the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM), at least two large lakes. Fresh water springs, now 4 or 5 fathoms under the gulf off Bahrain, supplied additional water.

Figure 2 is a history of the Persian Gulf over the period from 74,000 years before present to 6,000 years ago. Source here.

There must have been people living in this valley, though because it is now flooded with 40 to 60 meters of water, the archeology necessary to prove it will be very difficult. But we do know that those occupation sites shown in the Stage IV panel above appeared very suddenly 8500 years ago on the Arabian shore and the people in those sites came from somewhere close by as they share a common and unique culture, the Ubaid culture. This valley may have been the source of the Eden stories. The sea level at the time of the Ubaid culture didn’t stop rising when it reached the level it has now. It rose an additional 5 meters in this area, flooding what is now southern Iraq for a hundred miles inland. Ur was established as a port, on the shore of this inland sea. There is evidence of reed-hulled sail boats in this time period, including bitumen fragments of the coating used to protect the reed structure, ceramic toy models, and an image on pottery showing a bipod masted craft. The ruins of Ur are now in the desert northwest of Basra, Iraq, far from the sea.
In this same period, Doggerland in what is now the North Sea, was also being flooded. The last bit of land there, what is now Dogger Bank, was an ever-shrinking island for several thousand years. Human produced artifacts have been dredged up by fishermen for many years. The last bit of land there went under about 6500 years ago.
Florida was also much larger before the sea level rose. Any coastal activity by Clovis culture people along the coast of the Americas is now under water. This is also true of many areas along in the Red Sea, the coast of India, and southeast Asia. A large area in what is now the South China Sea, the Sunda Strait, was also dry land and almost certainly settled.
The warm period from 11,500 to 8200 years ago was a time of many important advances for the human race. In this period, most of the important animals and agricultural crops we know today were domesticated in the Persian Gulf and Fertile Crescent region. Before this time people were nomadic, moving from one food source to another in the course of each year, building shelter as needed or living in caves. After this time many people lived in villages in permanent dwellings. By 8000 years BP, corn (maize) was domesticated in central Mexico.
As an example, Jericho is the oldest permanently occupied town, with the oldest level dating from 11,400 years BP. Before this time, the site had been used only as a temporary camp, as there is a large permanent spring nearby. The oldest level even had a 2 meter wall all around it with a watchtower that is still standing as it was buried in the tell. The dwellings were round pit houses, half sunken into the ground, with stone walls and a “wattle and daub” or adobe roof. World-wide, this type of house appears as the first permanent type dwelling in many cultures. It is still found in Northern Syria. At a similar village 5 miles north of Jericho, seedless domesticated figs have been found dating from this era. These would have had to have been propagated by cuttings, as the seeds never developed beyond the embryonic stage. Grains found at early Jericho were still of the wild variety, though they were gathered in quantity and stored for later use.
At Ur and H3 (above map, Figure 2, stage IV), domesticated grains were found, and 8200 years ago, evidence of irrigation, as well as domestic cattle, sheep, and goats. At this time, the domestic cat is found, though who domesticated who has not been established. Cats seem to have wandered in from the desert, found a source of food (domestic mice and domestic house swallows feeding on the stored domestic grain) and shelter, and decided to stay on. Some authors say this is “self-domestication.” I suspect cats domesticated us.
The first Holocene cold snap occurred 8200 years ago. Global temperature dropped about 2 degrees as seen at both poles. This lasted for about 200 years and was accompanied by drought and famine. This forced an increasing reliance on domesticated crops and animals, triggered the use of irrigation in Mesopotamia, and the domestication of corn (maize) in Central America. In North America, this split up the Folsom Culture people and drove the beginning of tribalism in the Paleo-Amerindians. This cold and arid spell was overcome by the technology, and the animal and plant domestication, that had developed in the earlier warm period.
Advances were made possible by the warm period that began more than 3000 years before all the ice melted. Sea levels were rising to be much higher than today and the human race was thriving on all continents except Antarctica. Warm is good. Cold is bad.
Next: The later Holocene and the rise of empires.

Share this...FacebookTwitterCorrection: A reader has pointed out that the paper is an analysis of some models which shows albedo, often claimed by alarmists as the primary Arctic climate driving factor, is not the number one Arctic amplifier after all, as skeptics have long maintained. The paper itself says nothing about the integrity of models, and thus the title above has been changed.
On model integrity, climate models have been compared to observations, see here and here. The results speak for themselves.
==============================
Spiegel here reports on a paper appearing in Nature titled: Arctic amplification dominated by temperature feedbacks in contemporary climate models – by Felix Pithan and Thorsten Mauritsen of the Max Planck Institute for Meteorology in Hamburg.
Hat-tip: DirkH
Climate science often claims that nowhere is the climate changing faster than in the Arctic. Scientists have often attributed these changes to albedo effects. But the new study finds that amplification can also occur without changes in albedo. Spiegel writes that the authors, based on an analysis of models, found the largest contribution to Arctic amplification comes from a temperature feedback, where at lower latitudes warmed air rises faster and more easily than it does in the Arctic. As the surface warms, more energy is radiated back to space in low latitudes than in the Arctic. Thus polar air radiates less heat out into space than tropical air does.
In a nutshell, the two authors have found that the primary amplification factor is the “stolidness” of Arctic air, and less so albedo. In the Arctic warmed air tends to remain more at the surface and heat does not escape as readily.

Spiegel writes:
To balance out the radiation budget at an ambient temperature of 30°C, an increase of 0.16° is enough. However at minus 30°C, an increase of 0.31 °C would be needed, i.e. almost double, which gives Pithan und Mauritsen cause for thought. According to their calculations the lower start temperature in the Arctic is an important reason for the more rapid temperature increase in the Arctic compared to the tropics.”
They found that the surface albedo feedback is only the second main contributor to Arctic amplification, and that other contributions are substantially smaller or even oppose Arctic amplification.
This casts many of the assumptions made in earlier climate models deep into doubt. It’s back to the drawing board (again) for the modelers.
For a science that is more than 95% certain, we sure do see quite a steady stream of surprises with each passing day.
UPDATE: As reader Kurt points out, the claims made by the authors are based on “model simulations”. And we know that over 97% (114/117) of the models have completely missed the barn since 2000.  So if models cannot tell us the temperature, what could they possibly say about the mechanisms driving climate?

Share this...FacebookTwitterI had to shake my head when I came across Peter Gleick’s Twitter comment about a Toys R Us spot. Incredibly he writes: “My wife and I saw this ad and looked at each other speechless. And angry. Perhaps the most offensive we’ve ever seen.”

Warning: If you hate happy kids, then you aren’t going to like the above clip!
At first I thought Gleick was joking, but then I was horrified to discover he and his wife really mean it. Gleick and his ilk are freaking out because a teacher has 8-year olds playing with toys instead of collectively learning the names of tree leaves.
Damn it! Those little brats have got to learn and love tree leaves!
To me this confirms that Gleick is a…well, never mind – I’m not going to accomplish anything with insults, as deserved as they may be.
Gleick’s remark reminds me when I was in science class the in 5th grade. Three or four weeks long the teacher tried to pound the names of ferns into us – I’m not kidding. And she even expected us to love the subject as much as she did. And if you didn’t, she punished you with a failing grade. And that’s what I got.  And to this day I have no regrets about it. Those 4 weeks were a period in my life when I completely tuned out science, and I remember thinking how utterly boring it was. I recall demonstratively refusing to participate in the nonsense.
On the other hand, my oldest brother had a telescope and I remember using it often, even buying a book about astronomy and learning all the names of the planets and knowing their distance from the sun. That was fun. But ferns?
The Toy R Us teacher deserves a medal for outstanding education
If anything the teacher on the Toys R Us bus deserves a medal because he refuses to destroy the scientific curiosity of his school kids with the senseless, trivial and excruciatingly boring activity of collective and regimented memorization of tree leaves.

Believe me, with a toy they love, kids can learn magnitudes more about physics, science, mathematics, sociology and engineering than they ever will with communist-style, repeat-after-me collective programming and thought control.
Nothing stimulates a child’s mind more than a toy
Just look at the kids’ faces in that Toys R Us store. Imagine what’s going through their minds and what they will do with the toys of their choice.
How many hours will they spend playing in the dirt or sand with that truck? What is that child going to discover under that microscope, and about optics in general? What dreams and fantasies is that little girl going to experience with the doll house? What physics is the little girl going to learn from the spinning doll? How much is that bicycle going to expand the child’s world and improve his motor-coordination? Can’t the Gleicks see this?
The Toys R Us spot is wonderful just watching all joy in the kids’ faces. But I guess all that happiness is a bit too much to take for the Gleicks and the wackos at Grist and Sierra Club. Horrors! Kids experiencing their own dreams and not being collectively tortured and turned off by instituted boredom. In the narrow mind of the zealot environmentalist, small children have to be terrified of climate and nature, they have to learn to love trees – and to not be happy discovering through toys.
Gleick and his ilk display an astonishing level of blind-mindedness in that they are unable to see the obvious benefits of children freely selecting their own toys and pursing their own interests. One little girl in the spot says something that even Professor Gleick could learn from:
A princess is always loyal and never gives up, and always follows her dreams.”
Right you are, and never forget it. Never give up, and always follow your dreams.
Kids don’t need green thought control.
PS: Write to Toys R Us and tell them that the spot is the best they’ve ever had.

Update: Read here.
This post is about an interview by the online Swiss Der Bund here with Swiss geology giant Christian Schlüchter titled: “Our society is fundamentally dishonest“. In it he criticizes climate science for its extreme tunnel vision and political contamination.
Geologist Sebastain Lüning sent me an e-mail where he writes: “This is probably the best interview from a geologist on climate change that I have read for a long while. My highest respect for Prof. Schlüchter.” Fritz Vahrenholt calls it “impressive”.
Hat-tip: Bernd Felsche and Wolfgang Neumann at Facebook.
Photo credit (Christian Schlüchter): University of Bern
His discovery of 4000-year old chunks of wood at the edge of glaciers in Switzerland in the 1990s unintentionally thrust the distinguished geologist into the lion’s den of climate science. Today the retired professor and author of more than 250 papers speaks up in an interview.
Almost glacier-free Alps 2000 years ago
Early in the interview Schlüchter reminds us that during Roman times in the Alps “the forest line was much higher than it is today; there were hardly any glaciers. Nowhere in the detailed travel accounts from Roman times are glaciers mentioned.” He criticizes today’s climate scientists for focusing on a time period that is “indeed much too short“.
In the interview, Schlüchter recounts how he in the 1990s found a large chunk of wood near the leading edge of a glacier. The chunk of wood, he describes, looked as if it had been dragged across a cheese shredder. It was clear to Schlüchter that the specimen had to be very old. Indeed laboratory analysis revealed that it was 4000 years old. Next they found multiple wood fragments with the same age, all serving to fill in a major piece of the paleo-puzzle. His conclusion: Today where one finds the Lower Aare-Glacier in the Bernese Alps, it used to be “a wide landscape with a wildly flowing river“. It was warmer back then.
Until the 1990s, scientists thought that the Alps glaciers had been more or less consistently intact and only began retreating after the end of the Little Ice Age. Schlüchter’s findings showed that glacial retreats of the past also had been profound.
This threw climate science into chaos and it remains unreconciled today.
Ice-free 5800 of the last 10,000 years
But not all scientists were thrilled or fascinated by Schlüchter’s impressive discoveries. He quickly found himself the target of scorn. Swiss climate scientist Heinz Wanner was reluctant to concede Schlüchter’s findings. Schlüchter tells Der Bund:
I wasn’t supposed to find that chunk of wood because I didn’t belong to the close-knit circle of Holocene and climate researchers. My findings thus caught many experts off guard: Now an ‘amateur’ had found something that the Holocene and climate experts should have found.”
Schlüchter tells of other works, which also have proven to be a thorn to mainstream climate science, involving the Rhone glacier. His studies and analyses of oxygen isotopes unequivocally reveal that indeed “the rock surface had been ice-free 5800 of the last 10,000 years“.
Distinct solar imprint on climate
What’s more worrisome, Schlüchter’s findings show that cold periods can strike very rapidly. Near the edge of Mont Miné Glacier his team found huge tree trunks and discovered that they all had died in just a single year. The scientists were stunned.

//-->




The year of death could be determined to be exactly 8195 years before present. The oxygen isotopes in the Greenland ice show there was a marked cooling around 8200.”
That finding, Schlüchter states, confirmed that the sun is the main driver in climate change.
Today’s “rapid” changes are nothing new
In the interview he casts doubt on the UN projection that the Alps will be almost glacier-free by 2100, reminding us that “the system is extremely dynamic and doesn’t function linearly” and that “extreme, sudden changes have clearly been seen in the past“. History’s record is unequivocal on this.
Schlüchter also doesn’t view today’s climate warming as anything unusual, and poses a number of unanswered questions:
Why did the glaciers retreat in the middle of the 19th century, although the large CO2 increase in the atmosphere came later? Why did the earth ‘tip’ in such a short time into a warming phase? Why did glaciers again advance in 1880s, 1920s and 1980s? […] Sooner or later climate science will have to answer the question why the retreat of the glacier at the end of the Little Ice Age around 1850 was so rapid.”
On science: “Our society is fundamentally dishonest”
CO2 fails to answer many open questions. Already we get the sense that hockey stick climate claims are turning out to be rather sorrowful and unimaginative wives’ tales. He summarizes on the refusal to acknowledge the reality of our past: “Our society in fundamentally dishonest“.
“Helping hands for politicians”
In the Der Bund interview Schlüchter describes a meeting in England that turned him off completely. The meeting, to which he was “accidentally” invited, was led by “someone of the East Anglia Climate Center who had come under fire in the wake of the ‘Climategate’ e-mails“:
The leader of the meeting spoke like some kind of Father. He was seated at a table in front of the those gathered and he took messages. He commented on them either benevolently or dismissively. Lastly it was about tips on research funding proposals and where to submit them best. For me it was impressive to see how the leader of the meeting collected and selected information. For me it also gets down to the credibility of science. […] Today many natural scientists are helping hands of politicians, and no longer scientists who occupy themselves with new knowledge and data. And that worries me.”
Schlüchter adds that the reputation of science among young researchers is becoming more damaged the more it surrenders to politics. He indirectly blasts IPCC chief scientist Thomas Stocker:
Inventing the devil was one of man’s greatest inventions ever achieved. You can make a lot of money when you paint him on the wall.”
Northern hemisphere still gripped in ice age mode
Schlüchter also says that the northern hemisphere is still in the ice age mode and that the glaciers during the Roman times were at least 300 to 500 meters higher than today. “The mean temperature was one and half degree Celsius above that of 2005. The current development is nothing new in terms of the earth’s history.”
At the end of the interview Schlüchter says that solar activity is what is sitting at the end of the lever of change, with tectonics and volcanoes chiming in.

In the last part of the article Jung writes:
What’s climate change got to do with it?
As always: immediately after an event is observed on the planet that supposedly ‘had never happened before’, a discussion about the cause breaks out. And once again the discussion turns to the term: ‘climate change’.

‘Haiyan was one of the most powerful typhoons ever observed’ – at first that sounds very suspenseful, but an important small piece of information gets left out, namely: ‘Since weather records started being kept’.  And when it comes to tropical storms, regular weather records have been kept only for a few decades! When we speak of the strongest storm of ‘all time’, this ‘all-time’ is not even 100 years long.
The earth is really already more than 100 years old, and we don’t know at all what natural catastrophes occurred 500 or 1000 years ago – and we also don’t know which tropical storms took place. 
For many ‘climate expert’ this recent event is a feeding frenzy that allows them to pound the drums of ‘evil climate change’. And here not a single one of these ladies and gentlemen are able to show that such storms never existed over the past hundreds of years, let alone that this storm is connected to a man-made climate change.
What came out of the mouths of climate experts after the last cold winters had gripped Central Europe?:
‘A few colder-than-normal winters are in no way any indication of a trend change when it comes to climate change.’ Well, using that logic, how is a single large typhoon then supposed to confirm climate change? A truly fascinating thought process!

The Sun in January 2014 and News of the Sun’s Polar Field
By Frank Bosse
(Translated, edited by P Gosselin)
Over the last month solar cycle 24 (SC24) has seen some rather brisk activity. The sunspot number (SSN) reached a value of 82.0, which however was only 77% of the normal value (106) for the 62nd month into a cycle. The southern hemisphere (SH) contributed to most of the overall result in January, outperforming the northern hemisphere (NH) 61:21. The following graphic depicts current activity (in red) and normal activity (in blue):

Figure 1: The course of SC24 in relation to the mean value of all observed cycles.
The figure also shows SC5 in light red. SC5 has some degree of similarity to the current cycle so far. The next figure shows a comparison of the acti9vity of each indiviual cycle after 62 months into the cycle with little changing over the past few months:

Figure 2: Accumulated SSN anomalies of the cycles.
The chart depicts the anomaly of the accumulated sunspots for each cycle 1-24, from the mean value for month 62 into the cycle. SC24 began in December 2008.
So what is the activity determined by and are there indicators for the strength of the upcoming cycle? There is a lot of thought going on over this question. The favorite indicator is the strength of the polar magnetic field during the minimum between 2 cycles.
One of the very good predictions was developed by Leif Svalgaard already at the end of 2004 when he pegged the current cycle would be the weakest in the last 100 years. His 3-month smoothed maximum SSN of 75, which was derived from observations of the sun’s polar field, matches up very well to the present counts.
Since this has been confirmed, polar magnetic fields of the sun are recognized early indicators. At Stanford University they are being measured with great meticulousness and have been on the decline since recording began in 1976.

Figure 3: Polar fields of the sun since 1976, source.
Here we see that the field always reverses at the cycles’ maxima, and that it reaches a maximum when during the minimum of a cycle. The theory on this: The remnants of sunspots drift to each of the poles of the NH and SH (they do not cross the solar equator) and they provide for the reversal of the polar field. It’s a sort of see-saw that has been in steady decline since the SC21/SC22 minimum. Thus, pole reversal is a result of the activity of the ongoing cycle. Data can be downloaded from the above mentioned source. Our main interest is aimed at the behavior at the maximum, i.e. pole reversal. Here we evaluate the smoothed data of the magnetic field and the following diagram is yielded:

Figure 4: Polar solar magnetic field (in centi-Gauss) at the maxima of cycles 21-24. 
The data for the period of 30 days before until 30 after crossing the zero-point were evaluated and they determine the slope of the quite linear behavior. Also here falling activity is very well depicted. If we set 1980 equal to 100%, then it drops in 1990 to 51%, to 43% in 2000, and to only 22% in 2013. Not only the maximum magnitude of the polar magnetic field at the cycle minimum for sunspots has always gotten less over the last 30 years, but so has the speed of the pole reversal during the periods of SSN maxima!
So what’s with the polar field? That we are witnessing an especially weak effect is also depicted by the following diagram, which shows the course of the first 320 days after pole reversal:

Figure 5: The course of the unsmoothed data of the polar field after pole reversal.
What we see is a record: After almost one year since pole reversal, we have once again reached a zero-point, which was measured on January 12, 2014. Never has such a behavior been recorded since the beginning of data recording.
Could this delayed build-up of the polar field be an indication of the strength of the SSN minimum in about 5 years? This magnitude is namely the first predictor for the upcoming SC25. Looking at the data shown here, should we expect a Maunder-like “grand minimum” beginning in 2020? To date all indications point to low numbers…surprises cannot be excluded!

Share this...FacebookTwitterIt’s increasingly obvious that warnings of a “rapidly warming planet” are coming from another alien world, one where the climate is completely different from the one we have here on Earth.
Recently we have been seeing headlines telling us that the GLOBAL WARMING STOP has been extended yet another month, now at 17 years and 9 months, read here and here.

17 years and 9 months take us all the way back to the end of 1996, i.e. before the Kyoto Protocol was adopted. That means there hasn’t been any warming since activists and bureaucrats declared it a problem that needs to fought.
The question remains: How much longer will the period of zero-warming need to continue before scientists, activists and bureaucrats come to their senses and wake up to reality of our non-warming world?

Topic for the Geritol generation
Lord Monckton even writes at WUWT (my emphasis):
On the RSS satellite data, there has been no statistically-significant global warming for more than 26 years. None of the models predicted that, in effect, there would be no global warming for a quarter of a century.”
That means no children or young adults know what real warming is. Soon global warming will be something that only old folks will be discussing while consuming Geritol at the retirement home. By then the younger generations will only think that old folks believing in warming have all gone senile and have lost it. many of us are beginning to believe this today.

Share this...FacebookTwitterEurope and especially Germany have been enjoying an unusual, weeks-long spell of mild weather with temperatures in the double-digit Celsius range. Southerly winds have kept the continent mild for weeks. Warmists have been coming out and saying: Aha! Just as we predicted! And they are even claiming the same about the deadly cold weather gripping North America. 
Meteorologist: extremes are natural and nothing new
However, yet another veteran German meteorologist has come out and dumped cold water on the claims that the supposed weather extremes are signs of a warming planet. Meteorologist Udo Baum at wetter.net here tells readers that the extreme cold wave gripping the US and the mild weather in Europe are nothing unusual and are all part of natural weather.
Far greater fluctuations were common in history 
Baum writes:
Indeed a look back at the last 2000 years shows that there have been already even far greater fluctuations. Individual winters were so cold that rivers and lakes froze over. But also some winters were so mild that it never snowed in the flatlands and that flowers and fruit trees blossomed  two months earlier than normal.
The fluctuations between individual years are much too great to allow us to attribute them directly to long-term climate trends. And this winter is still not over and surprises are completely possible. […]
There are still too many inconsistencies and too many unknowns within the complex and chaotic climate system. Here it’s warmer; there it’s colder. The role of the oceans is still not sufficiently researched, carbon dioxide is not the only problem-gas in the atmosphere, says the team at wetter.net.
Methane plays a considerably more aggressive role. The interactions of water vapor content in the atmosphere play a large role.
Thus we maintain that the USA is not facing an ice age and that winter is not going to disappear in Central Europe in the future. In two or three weeks the weather may be entirely different, never mind next winter.”
Natural factors under-stated – can reverse man-made impacts

On natural climate factors, Baum writes:
The warming trend that is enhanced by man over the last four decades can suddenly switch back because of natural cycles or natural catastrophes and their one-time effects.”
Winter returning to Europe
On another topic, people have been asking me if we’re going to see any winter this year. Unfortunately the spring-like weather is about to end across much of Europe in a couple of days. The weather models are now pretty much unanimous and show a fundamental change in weather patterns in the works.
Donnerwetter here writes:
For the coming weeks almost all computers are showing a weather change to winter. Many centimeters of new snow are expected at temperatures at around -2 Grad C in the central mountains and 0 Grad C in the lowlands. Next week the eastern winds are back. At times frost of up to -10 Grad C are expected at night.”
The cold pole over the high north now has the chance to move closer to Europe and Asia. In addition in the days ahead continental, permanent sub-freezing air is gathering in Siberia and deep into Russia.
Thus the huge cold snap in the USA indirectly could level the way for winter to reach Europe, but likely in a less dramatic manner. Currently signs are mounting that  the downward temperature trend will get a boost next week. More and more models are pointing to the possibility a cold air mass extending out to Central Europe from the northeast.”

Share this...FacebookTwitterFlood Analysis in Spain Shows No Trend In 40 Years
By Sebastian Lüning and Fritz Vahrenholt
(Translated by P Gosselin)
For years the insurance industry toldus that flooding was becoming more common. The main reasons was man and his CO2 emissions. Homeowners living near rivers got scared, and rushed to buy new insurance policies. The insurance companies beamed.
And the gig worked as long as nobody checked over the calculations made by the insurance companies. When objective science finally did take a close look, the surprise was big: Over the long term there was absolutely no detectable increase in flooding. The insurance companies had created fear among the homeowners for nothing. Actually “nothing” is the wrong word to use here because the new insurance policies weren’t for nothing.
In the jounal “Natural Hazards and Earth System Sciences” appearing in May Mai 2012, another regional study on flooding appeared. Jose Barredo of the Institute for Environment and Sustainability of the European Commission and two other colleagues studied the development of Spanish flood damages for the past 40 years. Indeed insurance damages for the period truly had gone up. However this was solely due to the increase in the insured value. A trend in flooding frequency and intensity was not found by the scientists.
Here’s the abstract of the study (emphasis added):
Economic impacts from floods have been increasing over recent decades, a fact often attributed to a changing climate. On the other hand, there is now a significant body of scientific scholarship all pointing towards increasing concentrations and values of assets as the principle cause of the increasing cost of natural disasters. This holds true for a variety of perils and across different jurisdictions. With this in mind, this paper examines the time history of insured losses from floods in Spain between 1971 and 2008. It assesses whether any discernible residual signal remains after adjusting the data for the increase in the number and value of insured assets over this period of time. Data on insured losses from floods were sourced from Consorcio de Compensación de Seguros (CCS). Although a public institution, CCS compensates homeowners for the damage produced by floods, and thus plays a role similar to that of a private insurance company. Insured losses were adjusted using two proxy measures: first, changes in the total amount of annual surcharges (premiums) paid by customers to CCS, and secondly, changes in the total value of dwellings per year. The adjusted data reveals no significant trend over the period 1971–2008 and serves again to confirm that at this juncture, societal influences remain the prime factors driving insured and economic losses from natural disasters.
==============================
So profitable can global warming and fear be.

The storm is ‘unprecedented for the past 50 years, with two metres (almost seven feet) of snow falling since Friday,” a Mazandaran provincial official said, quoted by the media.”

In the northern hemisphere this winter at times has been showing extreme events that have not been seen in the named regions in decades.”
USA sets more than 5000 winter records!
Parts of southern Europe like Austria and Slovenia have seen heavy snowfalls and ice storms. The USA has also been hard hit by polar conditions this winter. James Spann tweets that 4406 U.S. cold weather records for the U.S. in January – 1073 snowfall records: pic.twitter.com/9krTAp5Fue.
These events all fly in the face of warnings issued by climatologists who 10 years ago warned of snowless winters becoming increasingly the norm. Turns out precisely the opposite is occurring. Places all over the globe are seeing snow like they have not seen in decades.
Today Climate Depot reports that leading meteorologist Don Easterbrook is now forecasting at least 2 more decades of cooling. Global warming is becoming increasingly remote with each passing month.

In essence, this expedition was trapped by a preconceived, but false, perception of global warming.
Let us make no mistake about this expedition. A major part of it was indeed to stoke up global warming publicity. It is not for nothing four journalists were on board, among them two from the Guardian and one from the BBC.
And again today Andrew Revkin of the New York Times at Twitter refers to Turney’s expedition as a “fiasco”.

First I’m really thrilled to see that NoTricksZone made it all the way to the number 13 14 spot, even bumping out RealClimate. I’m really surprised by this result. Not bad for something I’m doing on the side with the help of reader contributions such as those from Ed Caryl. Thanks to both loyal and occasional readers!
65% are skeptic or luke-warmer
Having done a quick count of the warmist sites, I came up with 48 from a total of 137. That’s crunches to be only 35%. That’s a far cry from the 97% the warmists like to try to have the rest of the world believe.
That means that almost two thirds of all climate science blogs are very skeptical or somewhat skeptical of the IPCC science (skeptic or luke-warmer). That’s hardly a consensus! Many of the skeptic sites are run by scientists and meteorologists…also showing that that “consensus among experts” is a complete myth.
Moreover, the top 20 sites are clearly dominated by skeptics.

 Part 1, The Late Pleistocene, A Story of Survival
By Ed Caryl
The story of the human race, Homo Sapiens, is really a story driven by climate, particularly temperatures, rainfall, and sea level. Most of that history has taken place in the last 20,000 years, since the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM). But there was also some pre-history. Before we could advance to civilization, we needed to survive the the last glacial period. This was not easily done. 100,000 years ago, there were several species of Homo. By 10,000 years ago there was just us, and that was just by the skin of our teeth. There is genetic evidence that in the period around 70,000 years ago, there may have been as few as 10,000 Homo Sapiens in the world.

Figure 1 is a plot of Deuterium in a Greenland ice core, GISP2, a proxy for temperature.
Several points are indicated in figure 1. Reading from oldest at the right to the present day at the left, the Toba super-volcano in Indonesia caused an abrupt severe cooling that dropped the global temperature by about four degrees in a very short time. Prior to that, the climate had already cycled by similar amounts several times, but this cooling was much more severe. At that time, our ancestors were mostly confined to tropical Africa, but the cooling was accompanied by severe drying, putting pressure on the savannas in Africa that were our preferred habitat. Fortunately for us, after about a thousand years of starving out, the temperature and rainfall swung the other way, the Sahara Desert became green for a time, and we were able to migrate out of Africa through the Middle East, filling the vacuum left by Homo Erectus and putting pressure on the Neanderthals. Before the Eemian interglacial, Homo Erectus had gone extinct in Asia, except for locally adapted populations like Homo floresiensis in Indonesia and the Denisovans in central Asia. The last non-Modern Human population to die out was the Red Deer Cave people in China. They disappeared about the time Jericho was first settled in the Jordan Valley, 11,500 years ago.

Figure 2 is a detail from figure 1 of the period from 60,000 to 75,000 years ago.

This period is a perfect example of what happens in a cold period (we die) versus what happens in a warm period (we thrive). In a span of 4000 years, mankind went from a severe population bottle-neck, to spreading across three continents.
15,000 years later, about 50,000 years ago, another warm spell triggered a further migration to what is now New Guinea and Australia. All through this period, and for much of the last glaciated phase, sea levels were much lower than today, as much as 120 meters lower, joining islands and continents with dry land. Except for the migration to Australia, this meant that ships and rafts were not necessary for these migrations. Walking sufficed.
About 40,000 years ago, another super volcano erupted, Archiflegreo on the Italian coast. This triggered another 1000-year cold spell, putting more pressure on our neighbors in Europe and Western Asia, Homo Neanderthalensis. After many cycles of warm and cold, even though they were cold-adapted, their population finally collapsed 30,000 years ago.
15,000 years ago, the last great migration, that of the ancestors of the Amerindians to the New World, took place during a period nearly as warm as at present, but before the great ice sheets had melted sufficiently for Beringia to be flooded. Beringia is the continental shelf in the Bering Sea joining Asia and North America, now under 50 to 100 meters of cold sea water.

Figure 3 is a map of Beringia 21,000 years ago. Source here.
The great migrations, out of Africa, the crossing into New Guinea/Australia, the migration into the New World, were all made possible by warm, wet, periods during an ice age. When it is cold and arid, we huddle in our caves, starve and freeze. When it is warm, we multiply, innovate, and go on the move. When possible, we move to warmer and more hospitable climes, or at least empty areas. From Beringia, we populated North America and expanded to South America in about a thousand years. Just like today, when we move to Arizona or Florida, southern France or Spain.

Share this...FacebookTwitterThe (tired) sun in September 2013 and spectral progress
By Frank Bosse and Fritz Vahrenholt
(Translated/edited by P Gosselin)
Currently solar activity is especially low. Solar sunspot number (SSN) in September was at 36.9, and thus was just 36% of the usual mean value 58 months into the cycle. The sun continues to remain in an unusually weak cycle 24, which was characterized by a 1-2 year delayed start in November 2008. The following graphic shows the mean value (blue) and the current cycle (red) and the very similar sunspot cycle SC5 (light gray) which occurred during the Dalton Minimum of the early 19th century:

 Dark blue shows average sunspot cycle; red shows current cycle 24 and light gray shows SC5. Horizontal axis is the number of months after the start of cycle.
Several publications suspect that the current cycle could have a double hump. Yet there are lots of indications that a second peak already occurred in April/May 2013. It’s possible that the maximum of SC24 is already behind us and that solar activity is now trending downward. It also appears that the magnetic field of the sun has also reversed. The comparisons between the documented cycles 1-24 is as follows:

 
Since SC 1 (1755-1766) until today the difference between the mean value and the observed monthly sunspot number is summed up. The diagram above shows up to SC24, and it shows that no cycle has been weaker since SC7 (1828). Here the Waldmeier discontinuity correction of 1945 was accounted for.
Since the end of the Dalton-Minimum 190 years ago, never has the sun in its last 7 years been so inactive 
Many people have been doing a lot of thinking about what the implications for the Earth may be. After all, the sun is practically the sole source of energy for our planet. At the top of our atmosphere it provides a gigantic 1365W/sqm. Here the solar radiation is distributed over a wide spectrum from infrared to gamma rays and we receive most of it within the visible light spectrum. And it is precisely this part that is hardly impacted by the solar activity fluctuations. The variation between a quiet sun and one of maximum activity is a mere 0.1%. That’s one reason we are still around. With more variation life on the planet very likely would not have been able develop over the 3 billion years our planet has existed.
All the frequencies within the solar radiation spectrum is what we call Total Solar Irradiance (TSI). In the past in climatology often only this magnitude was taken into consideration and the following conclusion was drawn: The sun cannot account for more than 0.1°K of temperature variation, whether it is active or inactive. This is the argument presented yet again by the latest 2013 IPCC Report. The radiative forcing is given as 0.05 watts per sqm. That is less than 2% of the anthropogenic radiative forcing (2.24 W/ m²).
But there is one massive argument against the IPCC’s view. During preindustrial times, the climate fluctuations in relationship between solar activity were observed to be much larger. Countless studies show this. Yet the IPCC obstinately sticks to its verdict that the impact of greenhouse gases has been the dominant force on climate since mankind has been adding greenhouse gases such as water vapor and CO2 into the atmosphere.  In 2007 in the previous IPCC report a warming rate of 0.2°C per decade was assumed should CO2 rise at a modest rate which indeed has been the case. Using the climatically relevant period of 30 years, global temperature thus should rise 0.6°C by 2030 compared to 2000. In the latest AR5 2013 report, an increase of 0.3 to 0.7°C is forecast for the period 2016 to 2035.
So where do we stand today 13 years after the start? The observed reality has deviated markedly from the prophecies since 2006. The following diagram depicts the monthly observations as to GISS, and its departure from the postulated 0.2°C warming per decade as well as a 60-month low pass.

Where did the heat go? In the deep ocean as some are trying to tell us? In the blog of Hans von Storch (Klimazwiebel) one finds a very telling chart produced by Eduardo Zorita. It shows foremost that winter temperatures of the northern Eurasian continent contributes the most to the observed deviation:

Source: Klimazwiebel
The winter temperatures in the northern hemisphere really don’t give much back to the oceans, rather it’s the land mass between 30 and 60° latitude north! Also the thermal energy amount in the sea down to 700m in the region of the extra-tropical northern hemisphere everywhere refuses to cooperate with the climate models, and shows having reached a peak value in 2007 and since then it has gone downwards:

 
Chart source: Climate explorer
The extra-tropical southern hemisphere shows very little change. There the thermal energy in the oceans increased slightly. How does this fit with the theory of greenhouse gas forcing or the escape of heat to the depths of the ocean below 700 meters? Could the sun be playing a major role?
A new study very well worth reading by Ermolli et al. (2013) looks at the influence of the spectral variation of solar radiation (SSI), especially the ultraviolet spectrum: It is fluctuating much more strongly, by up to 10% between a quiet and an active sun. And at low solar activity, it generates precisely the pattern in the wintertime that we’ve been seeing since 2006: The North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO), which impacts the temperature in the Eurasian region especially in the wintertime, is controlled and effected by the UV radiation of the sun. When there is less solar activity, it gets colder in the region. This is precisely what we are observing, and the large part of the deviation observed in the pure GHG models stems precisely from that. Shouldn’t this be a wake-up call for the climate scientists to look more closely at SSI? This should have been done long ago. However, that would have meant conceding that CO2 is not everything.
The new IPCC report squandered the opportunity to produce scenarios that include the large impact of the sun, which we know always played a major role in the past. The IPCC limits the sun’s impact to the TSI only and they estimate it to be close to zero: -0.1 to +0.1°C.
However, the longer the chasm grows between climate models and reality, and the longer the projected warming fails to materialize, the more the world of science will have to acknowledge the questions of natural variability, especially UV radiation.

Share this...FacebookTwitterGermany’s WirtschaftsWoche here (Business Week) reports on German steel and engineering giant ThyssenKrupp’s reaction to rising renewable energy costs, warning that “unless the correct decisions are made concerning renewable electricity, Germany as a location for steel production is in jeopardy.”
ThyssenKrupp is struggling to keep its steel-making operations alive in Germany in the face of skyrocketing energy costs owing to renewable energies, and joins the list of endangered German industries in the famous Ruhr Region, home to heavy industries such as steel and coal-fired power production. The statement by ThysssenKrupp aims “to increase the pressure on the German government,” WirtschaftsWoche writes.
According to Chief Financial Officer Guido Kerkhoff, the company is reeling from hefty losses of almost 8.3 billion euros incurred over the last 3 years, most coming from its US operations.
Although the company is still eking out profits in Germany, much of that is due to the company’s partial exemption from having to pay the feed-in tariffs for renewable energy. But the exemption is being seriously challenged in Brussels on the grounds that it represents an unfair competitive advantage, and thus may be revoked. WirtschaftsWoche quotes ThyssenKrupp’s CEO Heinrich Hiesinger, who in an interview with the Düsseldorf based Rheinische Post said:
Last year ThyssenKrupp paid out 85 million euros in renewable energy feed-in surcharges. If we had had to pay the full feed-in amount, it would have meant a burden of 350 million euros for us.“ That’s more than what the company earns in its European steel plants. As a comparison, in the fiscal year 2012/13, the company earned before interest and taxes (EBIT) 62 million euros.”
Industry is sending a loud and clear message to German lawmakers. Even North Rhine Westphalia’s socialist Minister president Hannelore Kraft is getting the message. Flashback: Read here.

Share this...FacebookTwitterUPDATED: Joe has contacted me and I’ve added a correction concerning the AMO-hurricane connection, which I misinterpreted from the video. See his comment below after my post.
=====================================
Veteran meteorologist Joe Bastardi presents lots of interesting background information on hurricanes in his newest Saturday Summary, reminding viewers that they were much worse back in the middle of the 20th century than they are today. But now we are (again) in a setup where we may see some harsh hurricanes as we did in the 1950s – see 11:50 mark.
Arctic melt grinds to a halt
Also interesting is the part at the end (12:30) about the upcoming Arctic ice melt season. Surprise! The latest NCEP forecast for the summer melt continues showing a positive anomaly, flying in the face of predictions of a disappearing Arctic ice.

Image cropped from: Weatherbell Saturday Summary
Joe believes the Arctic will be returning to normal by 2030, maybe even sooner, thanks to the seemingly approaching cold phase of the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation (AMO) where we see the start of the transitional phase beginning.
Warmists’s arguments melting away

With Antarctic sea ice near record high levels and Arctic sea ice starting its rebound, the Arctic death spiral” argument so often used by the warmists is on the verge of a complete meltdown.
With the polar ice cap argument disappearing and the observed lack of warming for almost two decades, it will be interesting to watch what tactics the global warming crowd will be resorting to in the future. Expect to see them push lots of weather horror stories…future scenarios generated by hocus-pocus computer models cooked up from “renowned” institutes. when reality doesn’t cooperate, then fantasy is all that’s left.
============================
Joe has sent me a comment providing more information about the AMO, etc:
The latter stages of the warm AMO, when cooling starts in the North Atlantic, is when the warmest water is near the coast. This is not the cool AMO, rather it’s the transitional phase that is starting now. At the end of the warm AMO, the warmest water is near the east coast, just as we saw in the 1950s. By the 1960s the expanding pool of colder water, and the end of the last Arctic ice melt of the 1950s, were taking over. That then proceeded to have ice at high levels through the early 1990s. But as soon as the AMO flipped, the Arctic ice decreased.
The linkage is this: The jamming of the warmest water up near the east coast in the waning stages of the warm AMO (example the 1950s) heightens the east coast threat, and is a sign the cold AMO is around the corner, and with it the end of the scam.
It should be obvious now…one season of cooling and the summer ice melt will be weakest since the end of the cold AMO. The cold AMO is not the reason for increased east coast hurricanes. It’s the end game of the warm AMO that is telegraphing the coming cold. Look at the classic signature of the warm AMO 1997-2013 and you notice the water has been slightly cooler near the east coast, opposite the cold AMO signature of 1981-1996. The end game, when water starts to cool in the north Atlantic (and ice increases as we are seeing) has the warmest water jammed near the east coast. Please read http://patriotpost.us/opinion/26136
The set up now is the sign it’s about to end and with it the reversal. CO2 has NOTHING TO DO WITH IT, which is what they will claim in spite of science and history showing that is not the case.

The online Der Spiegel writes how global CO2 emissions are projected to keep rising strongly, 1.1% annually, at least until 2035 – thanks to strong economic growth in emerging countries like India and China.
Obama’s newly announced actions to curb CO2 emissions by America’s coal fired power plants will do almost nothing to prevent global energy trends from progressing in the opposite direction, the DPA writes.
Moreover, not even drastic global action would prevent CO2 emissions from rising. The DPA writes that “energy generation would need to be revamped worldwide  – up to going totally without coal, or catching the CO2 from the power plants. That is hardly realistic.”
Decrease in global poverty adding to energy demands. Number of automobiles worldwide to more than double by 2035!
As emerging countries continue to develop, so will their need for energy. Spiegel cites studies from the World Energy Outlook of the IEA, the BP Energy Outlook 2035 and the World Oil Outlook 2013 from Opec. One sector that is expanding massively is automobile production. Spiegel writes:

Just the number of cars alone will more than double by the year 2015, from 1.1 billion 2.3 billion.”
India’s car ownership will jump from 20 cars per 1000 Indians today, to 130 by 2035. In China that measure will go from 80 today to 360.
Clearly the measures implemented by Obama will have no noticeable impact on the climate of the future, but threaten burdening Americans will trillions in added costs.
Global population will also increase strongly over the next 20 years. As a result, the even most sober studies see no chance of curbing CO2 emissions. The IEA writes that also in the year 2035 worldwide energy demand will be predominantly covered by fossil fuels. Today that figure is currently 86%. The DPA writes:
Here neither the new plans from Obama to reduce greenhouse gases will change anything – nor the German plans.”
So CO2 will continue its unstoppable rise along with human prosperity and population. And should the temperature fail to rise much by 2035, as many scientists are predicting, then we will know that all the climate hysteria was for nothing. That, we suspect, is what the warmists are fearing the most. The truth is coming – like it or not.

Share this...FacebookTwitterThe online Ria Novosti news service has a report on the 30 activists who Russian officials have locked up for allegedly trespassing and attempting to storm onto a platform facility in the Arctic last month.
According to the latest report from Ria Novosti, the Russians are now “hinting at drug charges against the Greenpeace activists” and that they are considering pressing charges that could lead to life sentences for some of them. The Russians aren’t fooling around and they are playing major league hardball. Obviously some people out in the ‘open and tolerant’ west are having a hard time understanding the situation.
Hat tip: John from Quebec.
Perhaps the threats of life in prison are in response to the combative tones coming from Greenpeace bosses lately. For example Greenpeace’s international executive director, Kumi Naidoo, declared that the world needs people who are “prepared to go to prison, put their lives on the line if necessary, in the struggle for climate justice and addressing the reality of runaway catastrophic climate change.”
Well, if activists are willing to put their lives on the line for Greenpeace causes and are incapable of reasonable dialogue, then perhaps it is indeed best to keep them locked up.
Strangely, Greenpeace seems to be convinced that it can use protests to “out-bully” Russia. Good luck with that.
According to Ria Novosti, investigators on Wednesday said that substances presumed to be poppy straw and morphine “have been found on board a Greenpeace ship seized last month“. This, Ria Novosti writes, raises “the threat of new charges against a group of activists and journalists awaiting trial on suspicion of piracy.”
Moreover, “investigators were trying to determine which of the detainees had ‘intentionally rammed’ border guards’ boats – an act that could constitute an assault on the ‘life and health’ of officials. Under Russian law, the punishment for this crime could range from 12 years to life in prison.”

Ramming into ships? Gee, like this is something Greenpeace would never ever do. Actually, the Russians caught Greenpeace red-handed doing just that. Reader Observer found the following video of a Greenpeace boat ramming the smaller of the Russian coast guard boats:

Moreover all the shows of moral indignation by European officials, haughtily implying that Russia is a sort of a despotic state, likely made things worse.
My advice to Greenpeace and Greenpeace-huggers is that they should tone down their belligerent and condescending rhetoric quite a few levels, and begin to consider that perhaps the activists were acting illegally after all. Humility sometimes is not a bad thing. It can be learned – the easy way, or the hard way.
Yes, we know that admitting you’ve erred is something that is totally foreign to the infallible Greenpeace – but now it’s something they need to learn how to do very quickly.
Life in prison – that sure would send a clear message to those with comprehension disabilities.
==============================
UPDATE: Here’s a letter Naidoo has sent to Putin, asking if he could be meet face-to-face on the world stage with Putin. Talk about being publicity-hungry. From the letter, he definitely has toned it down. But it doesn’t look like he’s aware of the boat ramming escapade his “peaceful” activists have indulged in – see video below.

Share this...FacebookTwitterAlarmist Stefan Rahmstorf of the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research and contributor at RealClimate has not wasted any time in climate ambulance chasing at his Scilogs site here, trying to get as much mileage as possible out of tropical storm Haiyan.
His piece is predictably titled, “Tropical Storms Are Getting Worse“. What is remarkable in the piece is that he singles out the non-alarmist skeptics who resist climate protection measures and asks them how they are still able to sleep quietly at night.
It’s an emotional outburst.
First his introduction reads as follows:
Tropical storm Haiyan was probably the most powerful recorded that ever struck land since records began. For this reason there have again been many inquiries about the impact of climate change on tropical storms. Here I summarize briefly the following: (1) The most powerful storms have become more frequent in the last deacdes, (2) Models show a further strengthening is expected for the future, and (3) warmer water and sea level rise will worsen the consequences like downpours and storm surges.”
And in typical Rahmstorfian fashion, he proceeds to build his case by selecting only the studies that support his doomsday narrative, and ignores a huge body of science that contradict his claims…SOP.
What I found remarkable was his concluding paragraph at the very end, which is much harsher and provocative than normal, and I think it deserves to be translated in English:
Regrettably those who diminish and downplay climate change are already on the prowl. At the popular ‘climate-skeptic’ website Watts Up With That Haiyan is kind of dismissed as just ‘another over-hyped storm’. Even if the chances that our greenhouse gas emissions worsen such catastrophes are only 50:50, how quietly can those who with all their might resist climate protection measures, and in view of the pictures coming out of the Philippines, still sleep at night?”
Here Rahmstorf blames skeptics in part for the storm disaster in the Philippines. This guy is a scientist?

Share this...FacebookTwitterThe IPCC corrects projected temperature range for 2100 downwards by 1°C
By Michael Krueger, Science Skeptical
(Translated and edited by P Gosselin)
The IPCC AR5 Summary for Policymakers was released at the end of September, followed some days later by the Working Group 1 Report. The press directed much of its attention to sea level rise, as this magnitude was corrected upwards compared to the last 2007 report.
But the media gave  little attention to the expected temperature increase until 2100 for the various scenarios. Let’s take look at the temperature scenarios of the 2013 report and compare them to those of 2007. Taking a closer look we see a less alarmist picture than what we are told about sea with sea level.
Compared to the IPCC report of 2007, the range for projected temperature for the various scenarios until 2100 were corrected downwards by almost a full degree Celsius in the 2013 report. This is clearly depicted by the side-by-side comparison of the two charts from the respective 4th and 5th climate reports:

Range of projections of 2007 (left), 2013 (right)
In the 4th report (left) the range of the temperature scenarios up to the year 2100 was between 1.1°C (scenario B1, lowest value) and up to 6.4°C (scenario A1Fl, upper value).


<!--

google_ad_slot = ""6412247007"";
google_ad_width = 200;
google_ad_height = 200;
//-->




But now in the 5th report (right), the values have been corrected downwards and now range from only 0.2 to 0.3°C (scenario RCP2.6, lowest value) to 5.5°C (scenario RCP8.5, highest value). Thus the range of the temperature scenarios have been corrected downwards by approximately 0.9°C.
Because this is now a less alarming scenario and contradicts the notion of a more rapidly warming world, the media likely shifted their focus over to sea level rise.
In the following comparator the red arrow shows how the range for the temperature scenarios for 2100 was corrected downwards approx. 0.9°C. The latest range starts with a temperature that barely rises over the next 87 years, thus assuring in the future that climate scientists will always be able to say their models were right.

This downward correction was never presented as good news, and the media continue spreading fear and horror.
And with the temperature scenarios being corrected downward, one would logically think that sea level rise would also be less than projected in 2007. But the IPCC sees that in the opposite way. Instead of correcting sea level rise downwards, it jacked them up. Obviously there’s a lot of confusion about the climate system.
Also the absence of global warming over the last 15 years has been insufficiently communicated by the IPCC and the press. Here it is best keep quiet about it rather than uncovering and informing the public.
The press so far has failed to notice that the temperature scenarios and climate sensitivity have been corrected downwards by the IPCC. Yet the fact that both these parameters were corrected downwards is presumably owing to the fact that global temperatures have not risen in 15 years. This is how models and observations can be made to agree.

Share this...FacebookTwitterMore an eight years ago Al Gore, according to Laurie David, prophesized that unless we acted immediately we had only “ten years left to save the planet from a scorching.” The ever skeptical Rush Limbaugh put up his countdown clock (see below) on January 27, 2006.

Rush Limbaugh’s countdown to a scorching clock. Cropped from: www.rushlimbaugh.com/earth_cooks
With less than 2 years away to go to the prophesized “scorching”, now is a good time to check to see how much closer we have gotten to it temperaturewise – to see if we should be making plans to move up into the Arctic.
What have global temperatures been doing since then? The chart shows: nothing!

Chart: www.woodfortrees.org/
If anything, the trend is showing a slight cooling and there are no signs of any “scorching” in sight.
Conclusion: Al Gore’s prophesy has been nothing but a hoax. And because Al Gore continues to claim to the contrary, despite what the data show, and continues to profit by perpetuating the scare, he stands accused of defrauding the public.

Almost every energy policy that Europe has imposed on its citizens here is in the process of being or about to be exported to the USA. The USA is a little behind on this because of the “unsophisticated cowboys” and “climate deniers” resisting it.
For example many places are already forcing Germany’s renewable energy feed-in model. Never mind that Germans every year are paying more than 25 billion dollars for electricity that has only 2.5 billion dollars value on the market and that the system in Germany has become an abject failure. The power grid has lost its once impeccable stability.
It’s not my intention to be the bearer of bad news, but unless Americans wake up from their apathy and send a clear and loud rejection, they are going to wake up one morning soon and realize that the government has taken control of private life. Having lived in Europe for a number of years, and observing from a distance, I’m amazed at how fast this is happening. Next on the agenda is what we eat.
The time is approaching for Declaration of Independence 2.0.
This time it needs to be sent to Washington.

By Ed Caryl
There are many indications that sea level was much higher immediately after the last ice sheets melted 7000 years ago. There were other high-stands in the intervening years. Two sources are presented here that attempt to measure past sea levels.
Most Holocene sea level studies depend on geological and archeological evidence and a good deal of speculation. Two studies were found that have substantial evidence, presented in detail.
The first (Aus K.-E. BEHRE, Probleme der Küstenforschung, Bd.28, Isensee-Verlag, Oldenburg, 2003) was found as second and third hand charts in Frans J.P.M. Kwaad’s paper here, in Dutch, translated with Google Translate. The original Behre papers are behind a paywall, here. Other sources cite Behre, but some cast doubt on his work without offering alternatives.
From the charts, new curves were constructed in Excel so that Post Glacial Rebound (PGR) corrections could be made, and curves compared. Behre never took PGR into account in his work. He was also charting the high water marks, not MSL, so his charts set the present sea level to 1.75 meters. To correct for this, 1.75 meters were subtracted from his data. The data were collected in the stretch of seacoast called the German Bight, the area from Dutch Friesland to Danish Friesland, the south coast of the North Sea, centered on Wilhelmshaven.
I took the Wilhelmshaven PGR uplift figure as the starting point for the correction. PGR changes over time, doubling in about every 2000 years as one goes back to the end of the glacial retreat 7000 years ago. 
Figure 1a above

Figure 1b. Both Figures 1a and 1b are from F. J. P. M. Kwaad here. Click for larger view. 
The next data are from the Western Pacific, specifically the Yellow River Delta and the Sunda Strait, taken from J. P. Liu et al, 2004, Holocene Development of the Yellow River’s subaqueous delta, North Yellow Sea. Marine Geology, 209(1-4): page 60. This chart describes the sea level rise at the end of the last ice age. Don’t be confused by the reversal in the horizontal axis. In the literature, time can run left to right or right to left. The time scales can also have zero at the birth of Christ, or at the present day.

 Figure 2 is the sea level rise from 22,000 to 6000 years ago.
The data from these charts, with PGR and High Water correction, results are shown in Figure 3:

Figure 3 is a plot of the last 10,000 years of sea level, combining data from figures 1a, 1b, and 2.
In Figure 3, we can see the agreement between the two data sources for the period from 6000 years before present to 10,000 years before present, validating the procedure.

Figure 4 focuses on the last 8000 years.
By focusing on the last 8000 years, we can also see the sea level high stands at the Medieval Warm period, the Roman Warm Period, and the Egyptian/Minoan Warm Period as well as the Holocene Climate Optimum after all the great ice sheets melted. These latter two high stands are roughly two meters above the current sea level. The low stands are about one meter below current sea level.
When looking at these, keep in mind that there is a delay between temperature and sea level. That delay depends on the amount of temperature change and the level from which the temperature changed. In Figure 4, the delay seems to average at least 200 years.
In the last 8000 years, sea level has been substantially higher than at present, up to 2 meters or more higher in two periods four to seven thousand years ago. Sea level during the Holocene has been falling since that period.

Share this...FacebookTwitterJudging by the German government’s own press release (from the Ministry of Environment) regarding the release of the new IPCC report, one could easily argue that it is in a state of complete confusion.
Federal Environment Minister Barbara Hendricks and Federal Research Minister Johanna Wanka see the latest IPCC report “as further proof that urgent action on climate change” and are therefore “advocating ambitious, rapid climate action in order to slow down the global increase in temperatures.”
Federal Environment Minister Hendricks commented:
Climate change is happening every day. This is why we have to do two things: firstly to combat climate change and make sure that global warming does not exceed 2 degrees Celsius, and secondly to prepare for the consequences of unavoidable climate change.”
The press release states that the government is “taking the risks very seriously” and has “already developed an adaptation strategy and an action plan“.
The press releases outlines a range of actions, “from developing early warning systems for extreme weather events to adaptation concepts for urban planning and specific changes to building legislation“. Then the press release boasts about all the money it is going to spend in “honoring international commitments like funding climate and biodiversity projects in newly industrialising and developing countries with a total of 1.4 billion euros” and allocating “more than 250 million euros for adaptation-related projects.”
If that were not enough of a waste of money, the press release also writes that German Research Minister Johanna Wanka will be using climate models to prepare regionally for the future:
In recent years we have considerably advanced the development of climate models. We will now focus on using and implementing our findings at regional level, for example to back up local investment decisions or develop targeted regional adaptation strategies. Climate and adaptation measures are particularly effective when planned regionally and implemented with scientific support.”
Unfortunately, news of the performance of the climate models have yet to reach the German government:
 
Germany’s Research Minister Johanna Wanka is impressed by the climate models’ performance.

The Federal Research Ministry is so impressed by the climate models that it boasts having “spent a total of 750 million euros on projects and research institutions in the areas of climate and energy in 2013 alone“.
Moreover, the press release keeps talking about adaptation measures, and makes no mention of curbing greenhouse gases.
Adapting to climate protects climate?
Federal Research Minister Wanka then states that its “KLIMZUG funding programme facilitates the testing of strategies for adaptation to climate change and related weather extremes in various regions“.
Minister of Research Johanna Wanka adds:
Education and research can make a difference in changing climate awareness worldwide. If people are successfully adapting to climate change at home, in their communities, this will make an important contribution to protecting our climate in general.”
So adaptation is climate protection? I’ve always understood it as our protection from the climate. Germany’s Ministry of Environment didn’t do itself any favors making the press release public. One would be hard pressed to find a press release that is more confused. She seems to be mixing up adaptation with mitigation.
Also the German government is pledging more money for climate research in order to close the “knowledge gaps” and for “understanding how climate change works” in a field where it is claimed everything is already understood and the science is settled. Federal Research Minister Wanka:
The report shows that there is a further need for research on climate change. Closing knowledge gaps and understanding how climate change works will help us develop more effective adaptation strategies and protect ourselves better against the effects of climate change.
On the surface the press release tells us that the German government’s plan is all about adaptation and shows no plans to knock down CO2 emissions 80% by 2050. There’s no mention of rapidly expanding renewable energies nor of scaling back fossil fuels.

Share this...FacebookTwitterRichard Tol tweeted here a link to an article appearing at the Deutsche Wirtschafts Nachrichten (German Business News) about the country’s much ballyhooed Energiewende, in English: transition to renewable energies. The title:
Max Planck economist: ‘Transition To Renewable Energy Borders On Suicide’
Leading economic experts are firing harsh criticism at the energy policy of federal super minister Sigmar Gabriel. Germany as a friendly location for business is not only being weakened, the transition to renewable energy even borders on suicide and is an unimaginably expensive folly.”
Recently Angela Merkel’s grand coalition government just decided they would water down the scale-back in renewable energy subsidies. The Deutsche Wirtschafts Nachrichten quotes Max Planck Institute researcher Axel Börsch-Supan, who has fired harsh words at Federal Economics Minister Sigmar Gabriel:
With their policy, the grand coalition is weakening Germany’s location as a place to do business. This is especially true when it comes to the Energiewende, which is bordering on suicide.”
According to the Deutsche Wirtschafts Nachrichten, other experts are also slamming Germany’s “Energiewende”. For example Ifo Institute director Hans-Werner Sinn calls it an “unimaginably expensive folly“. Marc Tüngler director of a German financial association, calls it “a planned economy without a plan” that makes the Energiewende “unbearably expensive“.
The Deutsche Wirtschafts Nachrichten concludes:
According to experts, the big losers are the consumers, who will have to expect continued increasing electricity prices.

But that pattern was interrupted by a blast of cold air from the East about 10 days ago. The results have been deadly.
13 die of cold in Romania
First, Spiegel here reports that 13 people have died of cold in Romania over the last week as temperatures there have dipped to -18°C. In Austria 2 people were killed in an avalanche after heavy snowfalls.
Poland hard hit
www.wetter.com site here reports that 26 people have recently been killed by the bitter cold in Poland. Since November 1, at least 52 people have died of cold in Poland. In Germany the bitter cold claimed the life of a 57-year old Saxony Anhalt man who died of hypothermia as temperatures dipped to -16°C.
Almost 60 dead in the Baltic countries

The bitter cold has also taken a severe toll in the Baltic countries. The online German language Das Baltikum-Blatt here reports that at least 58 people have died due to cold so far this winter with temperatures recently dropping to -20°C.
In Bulgaria at least 4 people have died of the cold over the last few days, so reports the online SOTT site here.
Anomaly storm and unusual cold in USA
Düsseldorf’s online RP here reports that a winter “anomaly storm” and unusual cold are now gripping the USA (a spell cast by black carbon witchcraft, no doubt).
The RP calls the current US cold snap “historic”.

The latest to be hit is wind-turbine transmission manufacturer Bosch Rexroth AG, which announced it will slash 210 jobs and give up a production plant in Nuremberg.

Image cropped from: www.youtube.com/kGXoE3RFZ8
Klimaretter writes that the reason behind the move is “the changing wind market“, which according to Bosch-Rexroth spokesperson has seen immense fluctuations.
Because 2013 saw 10 gigawatts less wind energy power installed than a year earlier, ‘capacities have to be scaled back’.”
The layoffs come on the heels of Bavaria’s move to restrict the installation of wind parks in its idyllic countryside. However, the company claims that Bavaria’s policy had no impact on the decision.
Bosch Rexroth is just the latest in a series of setbacks the wind energy industry has seen over the last months. Germany’s solar industry has already collapsed and wind energy is just the latest victim in Germany’s rollback of renewable energies. Spiegel here writes that Germany’s solar industry has shed half its jobs in the last two years alone!

Last month German wind energy investment company Prokon filed for bankruptcy. The Local here writes that the company attracted 75,000 investors through a successful advertising campaign, where an 8 percent return on investment was promised. Today these investors are uncertain if they will ever see their money returned at all. The Local writes:
Investors had reportedly pulled €227 million of a total investment of €1. 4 billion, leaving the company far short of the 95 percent capital investment it needed to stay solvent.”
Spiegel here also reports on the dwindling returns and “broken promises” of wind energy investments.
Not only are windparks losing their appeal as a source of energy or as a secure investment in Germany, but resistance from citizens’ groups and environmentalists to planned projects is also rapidly mounting worldwide. Now windparks are facing lawsuits for killed birds. Benny Peiser’s GWPF site here writes:
A $1 million settlement with a renewables business for birds killed at two of the company’s wind farms marks the first time the U.S. government has pursued legal action against a wind developer for bird deaths caused by turbines.
Research published in the peer-reviewed scientific journal Biological Conservation last year estimated that between 140,438 and 327,586 birds—or a mean of 234,012—are killed annually due to collisions with turbines across the U.S.”
Expect more strong headwinds against wind power in the months and years ahead.

Share this...FacebookTwitterAfter Monday’s April Fool’s release of the IPCC WGII SPM and the subsequent gasps of horror coming as a reaction from top government officials, you’d think little time would be wasted in taking clear, decisive actions to “protect the climate”. Recall how the situation is urgent and that decisive, immediate action needs to be taken quickly!
It turns out that the gasps of horror were mere show – designed to appease green activists. In reality, it turns out governments really aren’t that alarmed by the IPCC’s science and don’t take it that seriously after all. As you are about to read, actions speak much louder than words, no matter how quietly and discreetly the actions are carried out.
The German DPA press agency has just released a report: EU postpones climate fees on international flights until 2017.
“Climate protection”, no matter how urgent it is said to be, will just have to wait.
For a number of years the European Commission threatened to force all airlines flying into, out of, and over Europe to pay carbon emission charges, or else face being locked out of it’s busy airspace. Background info: here, here, here and here. But countries like the USA, Russia, China protested loudly and threatened to retaliate massively.
Brussels shoots kneecaps of European airlines
Today the DPA announces that Brussels has backed off and decided to postpone charging international airlines for emission permits until 2017. News of this loss of face is being buried in the back pages of the internet and media outlets. But Internet site CO2 Handel here writes:



<!--

In the view of the aviation industry, the postponement is only going to be a burden on the airlines in Europe. The president of the German Association of Aviation (BDL), Klaus-Peter Siegloch, spoke of a European-island-solution. ‘It distorts competition, does not help the climate, and weakens the aviation companies in Europe.'”
What better present could foreign, non-European airlines possibly dream of. Now they have a nice competitive advantage – served to them on a silver platter, courtesy of Brussels.
The Greens are fuming – not because of the unfair competition, but because Europe has decided once again that the climate isn’t really that much in trouble. It can wait, after all.
European green Parliamentarian Rebecca Harms of Germany called the move “irresponsible”:
Originally the law was supposed to cover one third of the global aviation emissions. It’s lunacy to considerably weaken this effective climate protection instrument now.”
The move to postpone this “effective climate protection instrument” just goes to show you what Europe really thinks of the IPCC’s latest warnings. Not much!

Share this...FacebookTwitterGermany’s energy feed-in act is skidding out of control – and risks causing a social uprising. The power grid is becoming ever more precarious and electricity prices for consumers are at record levels. The German government, on the other hand, is reacting like a petrified deer caught in the headlights. It doesn’t know what to do.
Yesterday, Germany’s number 1 daily by circulation, BILD here, launched a campaign to get the government to take real action – to do something, and quickly!
Hat/tip: Benny Peiser
Germany’s feed-in act forces power companies to buy all energy produced by green sources (wind, solar, bio, etc), whether it’s needed or not, and to force-feed it into the power grid. Power companies are also forced to pay exorbitant prices to the green energy producers. This gross market interference is wreaking havoc on the European power markets. On windy and sunny days, huge amounts of excess energy end up getting dumped on the market and power producers incur huge losses, which of course just get passed on to the consumers.
Sometimes prices on electricity exchanges even go negative. Despite these negative or ultra low prices on the electricity exchanges, consumers are paying record prices. So distorted has the market become.
So Bild newspaper is taking action and is openly demanding the government take action. Bild presents the facts:
What’s absurd: Even when prices on the power exchanges fall (last year it fell from 4.2 to 3.6 ct/kWh), the green energy producers get their money. Effect: The cheaper electricity becomes, the more the consumers have to pay.”

This is what happens when mastermind green bureaucrats, obsessed with the fantasy of rescuing the climate, start interfering with markets with completely nutjob ideas. Bild adds:
The feed-in surcharge is the main driver behind electricity costs. Currently it represents 14 percent of the price. At the beginning of this year the surcharge jumped again by 1 cent to 6.2  cents per kilowatt-hour. A sad record!
To blame for this is a design fault in the EEG Feed-In Act. Here prices are guaranteed for the wind and solar park operators.”
No risk! Bild writes:
This guaranteed price is financed by the feed-in surcharges – paid by the consumers!
Never before have rich, large property owners seen such a risk-free bonanza. Who pays? The poor consumers who cannot afford property on which to install a windpark or solar system! Indeed every year 600,000 Germans get their power cut off because they no longer can afford the exorbitant electricity prices. This is how Germany is reducing its CO2 emissions: The poor are having to go without!

Share this...FacebookTwitterLast week I wrote how an expert government committee recommended scrapping Germany’s once widely ballyhooed EEG renewable energy feed-in act.
Photo: Dr. Klaus-Peter Krause. Source: freiewelt.net
Today at the Freie Presse here economics expert and veteran journalist Dr. Klaus-Peter Krause slams the EEG act, saying “it belongs in the dustbin”: “Too expensive, and too unstable.”
Increasingly as energy poverty in Germany mounts, companies close their factories due to soaring electricity prices, power supply becomes too unstable, and one renewable energy company after another bite the dust, the pressure for the government to scrap renewable energies is growing. Yet the German government obstinately refuses to admit it the act is mortally flawed.
Krause writes that although the share of renewable energy in Germany’s energy-mix has increased, “it has done so at an enormous cost.” According to Krause the costs of the feed-in subsidies have risen form €883 million per year in 2000 to a whopping €23 billion in 2013. Meanwhile over the same period the share of renewable energy rose from 7% to 23%.
Worse, Krause writes that the EEG law has done nothing to reduce CO2 emissions across Europe. Germany’s coal consumption has actually risen over the last few years. “The EEG has not delivered more climate protection, rather only higher electricity costs.” Krause cites Prof. Helmut Alt of the University of Aachen, who calls the EEG act “the most gigantic subsidy law of the postwar period.”

Krause also believes that the EEG act is dividing the country:
The EEG act has created a two-class society of those exploiting the act, and the losers. Those exploiting it are going all out in securing their financial advantage.“
Krause ends by quoting a government official who wishes not to be named:
 The EEG must be regarded as an instrument of abuse by state power and especially contradicts the social-civic responsibility of the legislators.”

Share this...FacebookTwitterClimate alarmists like to claim there’s a 97+% consensus that CO2 is driving our climate…a claim that is patently false, of course. But even if it were true, it wouldn’t mean the science is settled and that they are right.
Having been on the subject of meat-diets and nutrition over the last few days, here too we have another long held belief supported by a overwhelming consensus of doctors and experts that is turning out to be completely wrong. It is the claim that cholesterol is bad for you. Data is showing the opposite is likely true.
It turns out that there’s no data supporting the hypothesis that that it leads to heart disease. In fact it is being revealed that patients have been misinformed by doctors, medical associations and their governments for decades now. The consequence of this false information has been a mass pandemic of obesity along with all the killer diseases associated with it.

Note “Michael Mann” hockey stick at 25:00-minute mark…stunning parallels with climate science. 
Let’s all recall how the science was settled and that 99.9% agreed that cholesterol was dangerous and would kill us if we allowed it to reach levels over 200. It is emerging that this long-supported claim may very well all be completely wrong. In fact there is a massive growing volume of new literature that shows cholesterol is beneficial, and thus it’s only a question of time before medical science will soon be forced to admit to the greatest medical debacle of all time.
Today there is even an international association of cholesterol skeptics. Like climate skeptics, they too were and are being labeled crackpots and so cannot be taken seriously. And as is the case with climate skeptics, it’s emerging that the skeptics are right.

Share this...FacebookTwitterOnline Spiegel as of right now has an unflattering report on the UN IPCC AR5 climate report as its top headline.
This hardly helps the credibility of climate scientists.
The headline article is dubbed: Contradictory Prognoses: Scientists Discover Discrepancies In UN Climate Report, written by Spiegel science journalist Axel Bojanowski.
The bold print introduction:
The UN warns in 2200 pages in its new climate report of a dramatic change in the environment. Renowned scientists now criticize the inconsistencies in the report. They aim 5 accusations at the IPCC.”
Among the discrepancies and contradictions Bojanowski mentions, a big one is the IPCC’s unscientific approach used to arrive at it’s infamous “95% certainty” that man is causing the climate change. Spiegel writes, citing Judith Curry:
How can science be certain about man’s impact when over the last 15 years the natural impacts surprisingly have stopped the warming of the air, asked climate scientist Judith Curry of Georgia Institute of Technology, Chairperson of the Climate Forecast Applications Network.”
Spiegel also writes that other scientists accuse the IPCC of not mentioning the uncertainties surrounding its scenarios: “In the summary of the IPCC’s report, the word pause, scientifically ‘hiatus’, is not mentioned at all.”
And the fact that only 3 of 114 models were able to correctly reproduce the 15-year hiatus, Spiegel notes, gets ignored altogether in the summary. Spiegel quotes Eduardo Zorita of the Helmholtz Center GKSS:



<!--

google_ad_slot = ""6412247007"";

google_ad_height = 200;

This point should have been more clearly addressed because it underscores that the important deficits of the climate models are still not understood.”
Spiegel is also highly skeptical of the claims made that the oceans have absorbed the heat. Bojanowski writes: “The proof of an additional buffer however appears difficult to find: Precisely at the lower depths of the oceans, which they say have especially warmed up – there, very few measurements have been made.”
Bojanowski also notes that in the previous reports, the IPCC always showed an increasing temperature curve. This time however, the usual line curve was replaced with a decadal “trapeze” chart. “Good PR“, says Reiner Grundmann of the University of Nottingham, “but is that sustainable?”
Bojanowski mentions the IPCC’s failure not to inform the public that there is no connection found between extreme weather and climate change. That should have been pointed out in the summary.
Bojanowski writes that signs of trouble for the IPCC’s AR5 report were already evident at the press conference for its presentation in Stockholm. A “reporter from a British tabloid” asked why the computer simulations failed to predict the 15-year stop in temperature rise. That, Spiegel writes, was a question that the chief of the World Meteorological Organisation WMO, Michel Jarraud, was not pleased to hear.
Bojanowski concludes from that:
Apparently the meteorologist was not used to this; critical questions do not particularly belong to the tradition of press conferences on climate science.”
Another shortcoming of the IPCC report for some scientists, Bojanowski writes:  A “faction” of scientists claims the report underestimates the seriousness of the climate.

Share this...FacebookTwitterGerman Physical Society: Solar doldrums of the last years led to a cooling of the Earth’s surface
By Fritz Vahrenholt and Sebastian Lüning
(Translated/edited by P Gosselin)
The Deutsche Physikalische Gesellschaft (DPG), in English: The German Physical Society, is wringing its hands over the sustainability of the climate catastrophe. After all, hundreds of physicist jobs are in danger should the catastrophe sputter out. In the March 2014 edition of the information newsletter PhysiKonkret, the DPG poses the rhetorical question (pdf hier):
Climate change: warming pause yes or no?
The DPG lists a number of reasons, but noteworthy is Point 3:
3. Influence of solar radiation. The last decade was characterized by a solar maximum in the year 2000 as well as an above average long solar minimum surrounding the year 2009. That led to a cooling of the earth’s surface.”

In order to not upset the circle of IPCC friends, of course black holes in the ocean which made warmth mysteriously disappear without a trace a la Bermuda Trianagle, were also listed. And: The President of the German Physical Society, Johanna Stachel, announced in a large bold print:
We warn against the view that climate change has stopped. Global warming is advancing unhindered.“
What she most likely means to say is:
We warn climate change not to make a pause. Global warming must immediately continue on.”
Of course this is not written. Overall, it’s all a first good step in the right direction. Finally the sun is being taken as an important factor in the climate interaction scheme.

Share this...FacebookTwitterIt’s long been known that Greenpeace environmentalists are condescending, know-it-all activists, who believe to hold the moral high ground, to be the keepers of the truth.
That sort of mindset has led Greenpeace activists to a false belief they are above the law, that their perceived law is supreme to everyone else’s. Time and again Greenpeace activists have been arrested for illegal activity only to be let go the next day. Unfortunately that ritual of always being set free almost immediately and knowing you have the full power of Greenpeace’s formidable legal team working tirelessly on your behalf have only emboldened Greenpeace activists. Now comes Russia.
Slowly realizing that the situation this time is different, that his activists aren’t going to be walking out of their jail cells like heroes anytime soon, Greenpeace International director Kumi Naidoo is softening the tone. Compare earlier comments to those of today:
Earlier comments from Naidoo before he realized the seriousness:
– “…we believe that intensifying peaceful civil disobedience is not only ethically justifiable but morally necessary.”
– …the world needs people who are “prepared to go to prison, put their lives on the line if necessary, in the struggle for climate justice and addressing the reality of runaway catastrophic climate change“.

– “I make no apologies, by the way, the fact that we are morally and ethically having to break the law, because history teaches us,...”
– Russian authorities are making “absurd accusations“.
Now today, realizing that the situation has become very serious…
– “They, we, Greenpeace, do not believe ourselves to be above the law. We are willing to face the consequences of what we did, as long as those consequences are within a nation’s criminal code as any reasonable person understands that code to be.”
“- My own personal history as a young activist in the anti-apartheid movement has taught me that dialogue is paramount, that in the interests of finding a common understanding we must be willing to talk.”
Suddenly he has stopped viewing Greenpeace as being above the law. Now he wants to engage in dialogue. Imagine that!

Democrats “running very scared”
On the political front, Morano adds that the only climate that is going to change is the political climate, with many Democrats “running very scared of this“, saying it “could be devastating for them politically because the American public is not going to like an unelected bureaucracy taking over energy goals…” On the EPA, Morano warns:
Once you give them this expanded bureaucratic power, there is no limit.”
The other two guests on the show were fans of the EPA, and seemed to be saying: C’mon, give big government the chance to have unlimited, unchecked regulatory power, and you’ll see that it can do something good. History certainly has heard it before. Do we really want to repeat that?

Share this...FacebookTwitterWhat would George Clooney have against brutally throttling the plentiful supply of affordable fossil fuel energy that billions of people living on the planet rely on? Nothing, he recently said.

George Clooney puts on an Oscar-winning green act. And an act is all it is. Hollywood actor has a mammoth carbon foot print. Photo: Nicolas Genin, licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 2.0 Generic license.
“All you’d be doing is cleaning up the planet a bit,” the actor said in a recent interview. Who cares if the poor have to go without it – so long he has more than enough to taxi between his two multi-million dollar mansions in California and Italy.
How green is Clooney really?
Expensive mansions in Italy and California
According to celebritynetworth.com, Clooney owns an 18th century mansion in Laglio, northern Italy. The “house” overlooks Italy’s famed Lake Como and “boasts 25 grand rooms” and has “magnificent decorated ceilings”. The house contains an outdoor theater, a large swimming pool and a garage for Clooney’s assortment of motorcycles and scooters.
According to Bornrich, Clooney’s net worth is estimated at $160 million
The Hollywood actor also owns a 7354 square-foot home in Los Angeles which he bought in 1995 from “Stevie Nicks” for $2.2 million. Today the home is surely valued much higher. The LA home features “comfy and well cleaned spacious rooms with brilliant light systems” and includes “a well equipped bar and a modern kitchen fully equipped with up to date appliances including custom cabinetry, oven and stainless steel fridge with George’s favorite salads and juices”. Outside the home has a basketball court and tennis court.
“Almost always flies via private jet…despite his claimed environmentalism”

Do you think Clooney commutes between his LA and Italian villas on a regular commercial jet, maybe even in economy class from time to time? No way, not for him. And what is not good enough for Clooney in air travel is much too much for the regular folks. Regular folks are supposed to forgo flying in order to save the planet. According to this site here: “George almost always flies via private jet…most of the time nowadays Clooney flies by private jet despite his claimed environmentalism as anyone who follows him knows.”
Clooney has the “ultimate solution to the world’s energy problems”
Clooney owns a variety of vehicles, such as a 1958 Chevrolet Corvette V8 C1 convertible. He even lined the seats with high end leather. And in addition to expensive Italian scooters and classic motorcycles, Clooney also sports around in a Tango 600, which features “a unique battery-powered car design with dimensions measuring 39 inches wide and 102 inches long and offers an ultimate solution to the world’s environmental and energy problems”. Gee, now why hasn’t the “ultimate solution” been mass-produced in the hundreds of millions for the rest of the world’s regular drivers? Clearly neither the clueless Clooney nor the Clooney-ass-kissing Bornrich writer have an idea what’s involved in manufacturing the”ultimate solution” for the world’s energy problem. They likely don’t even know where the power to charge the batteries comes from.
Clooney also owns a 2008 limited edition Signature 100 model Tesla Roadster – er, well, he used to. Apparently it was auctioned to support a Sudan Charity. What the heck, the car only had 1,700 miles on the odometer anyway. Driving green wasn’t much fun after all.
Jet-pit-stop in LA on the way to Europe – to dine with friends
So where does Clooney spend his vacations? Do you think he vacations locally, you know, to help save the planet? Well, that’s the little people, and not for Hollywood sex-gods like Clooney. Bornrich reports how he jets to places like the French Riviera with his green pals, like U2’s Bono or super model Cindy Crawford. There they spend much time “jet skiing and chilling out in sun on a yacht.”
While in Europe, Clooney and his girlfriend Stacy Keibler might be “spotted boarding a boat with some other close friends in Lake Como” or visiting George’s Italian mansion – before jetting off across the Atlantic to “relax in the Mexican sun”. And before jetting back to Europe together, “they stopped in LA and dined out with his best pals. Reportedly, Jennifer Aniston also managed to link up with pal George Clooney recently while off on her European vacation”.
Burning all that jet fuel.
Acting all concerned about the climate and saving the planet, you’d think Green George would cut back a bit. Not chance. Clooney’s green act truly deserves an Oscar. In reality he is just a jumbo-sized eco-hypocrite.

This cat is out of the bag, and it’s not about to be put back in and forgotten. The German media, once coddlers of the environmentalist Greens, are no longer holding back. The news of Germany’s Green Party earlier involvement in supporting rights of adults to have sex with kids is threatening to be the party’s worst ever scandal.
Germany’s Green Party leader regrets campaign to ‘legalise paedophilia’
The head of Germany’s Green Party has expressed regret about a two-decade-old political pamphlet containing calls to legalise some forms of pedophilia.

Share this...FacebookTwitterAt his latest Saturday Summary, Joe Bastardi serves up a few observations about the current weather across the globe.
Let’s recall that global warming was really supposed to be having an impact over the land masses, especially during the winters. But the land masses, at least this winter, aren’t cooperating at all. Globally temperatures are in the basement.

The above chart from NCEP shows that currently global temperatures are running below normal. Where’s all the heat gone to? Joe then shows how the alarmist claims that all the frigid US weather is due to global warming are completely bogus.

The above chart shows that except for Europe, all the other global land masses are colder than normal. Joe comments:
What’s remarkable about this is, with the exception of Europe, most of the land masses on the globe are cold. […] This is about the third or fourth winter in a row I’ve seen the hemispheric temperature and the land mass, especially the northern hemisphere, have been colder than normal, and this is part of this process that we described now you know since 2007, 2008, the triple crown of cooling.”
Joe expects that cooling to continue another 15 years – until 2030.
The global anomaly is currently at about -0.1°C. The only ones escaping especially brutal winter conditions in the northern hemisphere are Europeans and polar bears.

Share this...FacebookTwitterThe European Institute for Climate and Energy (EIKE) here presents a blistering report by retired climate scientist Prof. Horst-Joachim Lüdecke and meteorologist Klaus-Eckart Puls on how a German and Swiss network of IPCC scientists who, using pernicious methods, thwart legitimate scientists and media reporters who they view as a threat to the AGW hypothesis.
German climate scientist Horst Lüdecke and meteorologist Klaus-Eckart Puls say German climate science has been ruthless with dictatorial traits. Photo Lüdecke private, Puls EIKE.
Warnings of ruthless scientists
The piece is too long and my time too short to allow a full translation, and so I will present the main points.
Lüdecke and Puls write that these IPCC scientists should serve as “warning signals that should never be forgotten. This is especially so when an eco-dictatorial planned “Great Transformation” of avoiding CO2 is being propagated.”
Lüdecke and Puls of EIKE then remind readers that such threat was seen already once early in the 20th century.
Smearing of Jan Veizer and Nir Shaviv
In 2003 the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research (PIK) led a smear campaign against Slovakian geoscientist Jan Veizer and Israeli astrophysicist Nir Shaviv. Both are renowned scientists and have won many awards. In July 2003 Veizer and Shaviv published a ground-breaking paper on the climate impacts from the Earth’s orbit through the galaxy titled: ”Celestial Driver of Phanerozoic Climate?”.
However, the paper only inflamed the wrath of AGW colleagues, who saw themselves obligated to rescue the planet from natural gas CO2 using any possible means. Engulfed in fervor, the angry scientists, however, missed that the Veizer/Shaviv publication had nothing to do with the anthropogenic impacts of Co2. Rather the paper dealt with climate changes of the last 500 millions years, and did not even look at the 20th century climate.
The PIK immediately sent out a press release to the media, denouncing the findings of the two scientists.
Lüdecke and Puls write that disagreement in science is nothing new. But when scientists disagree, there’s an academically accepted approach to contest theories from other colleagues, which is usually done through the publisher and not carried out in the mass media.
Scientists stoop to smearing through the media
But the traditional approach was brushed aside by a group of German and Swiss IPCC scientists, who viewed Veizer’s and Shaviv’s publication as a potentially lethal threat to AGW hypothesis. But instead of properly contesting the publication, they embarked on a campaign to discredit the Veizer and Shaviv. EIKE writes:
The climb-down to near yellow journalism by the PIK’s press action had absolutely nothing to do with scientific etiquette and debate. Of the PIK press release signatories, many are known to readers as Germans and Swiss AGW activists and are still preaching ‘end-of-the-world’ by CO2.

Today EIKE calls that particular action “scandalous” and that it will be “infamous in German and Swiss science history.” Today many of these scientists act like nothing ever happened. The media, EIKE writes, were all too willing and aided and abetted the smear action, thus prompting Lüdecke and Puls to wonder if anything has ever been learned from Germany’s dictatorial past.
Veizer leaves Germany
Eventually, Veizer ended up leaving science-hostile Germany and the University of Bochum to join the University of Ottawa. EIKE writes that it is not sure how much the move to Canada was due to the smear campaign, but adds:
Nevertheless, the scientific exodus because of public pressure in the dictatorial past of Germany is well known.”
Here Albert Einstein serves as a classic example from the past. Climate science dissent in Germany is openly hounded and smeared.
The leaked Climategate e-mails put Stefan Rahmstorf at the center of the campaign. The press release smearing Veizer and Shaviv was authored by PIK and Climategate e-mails show Rahmstorf bringing up the matter more than once. In one e-mail Rahmstorf writes:
I feel another recent paper may require a similar scientific response, the one by Shaviv & Veizer (attached). …This paper got big media coverage here in Germany and I guess it is set to become a climate skeptics classic:

I think it would be a good idea to get a group of people together to respond to this paper (in GSA today). My expertise is good for part of this and I’d be willing to contribute. My questions to you are:
1. Does anyone know of any other plans to respond to this paper? 2. Would anyone like to be part of writing a response? 3. Do you know people who may have the right expertise? Then please forward them this mail.
Best regards, Stefan”
Not about science. It’s about silencing dissenters 
Lüdecke and Puls remind us that honest disagreement is fine but here we are dealing with another issue. What they see here is a clear strategy of “mafia-like methods by a network of AGW alarmists“. Lüdecke and Puls use another Climategate  e-mail presented by a US blogger to illustrate that it’s not about finding out what the truth is, but about attacking anything that disagrees with the AGW hypothesis:
The paper will be thoroughly refuted. I do not know as yet by who, or on what grounds, or where the definitive refutation paper will appear. But it will be refuted and dismissed in no time, never to be talked about again (except by ”deniers” and ‘flat-earthers”). That is thankfully the way we operate in climate science, trust us, we’re scientists. Everything is under control. Nothing to see here, move on.”
That is completely remote of science and very characteristic of dictatorships. EIKE characterizes the attack methods used by the German and Swiss IPCC scientists as “ruthless“. This was also the view of Spiegel, who in 2007 wrote:
The ruthless methods of climate scientist Rahmstorf:  Stefan Rahmstorf is the most famous of the top climate scientists in Germany – and at the same time the most tenacious. Journalists have complained of intimidastion attempts. Scientists are distancing themselves from the Potsdam Professor. In the meantime the conflict is being waged in newspapers.”
Rahmstorf demands control of the press
EIKE adds that “climate scientists like Rahmstorf firmly believe they are the keepers of the absolute truth”, and at the same time they are so sure of their politically supported power that they are demanding absolute control over the press.”
The methods used by the AGW scientists resemble earlier historical attempts to purify thought, culture and science, EIKE suggests. Spiegel wrote of Rahmstorf:
Rahmstorf threatens with a ‘Black List’: How Rahmstorf goes about upbringing journalists is explained in a notable commentary he wrote in “Zeit” in February 2005. At his private internet site he has a list of ‘classic media blunders’ where ‘I require every journalist to attend an obligatory lecture before an interview’. If the journalist reports something sensational, then he will feel the consequences: ‘Such journalists get put on my black list,’ Rahmstorf wrote in ZEIT.”
Dissenters see jihadist undercurrents
Lüdecke and Puls write that intimidating media outlets is part of the Rahmstorf’s strategy. Germany’s flagship Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung once published an op-ed piece by climate skeptics, who wrote:
It’s a holy war, a jihad that Rahmstorf is leading. And no prisoners are taken: He takes quotes out of context, deletes, and thus does not permit his end-of-world announcement to ever be threatened.”
Lüdecke and Puls write that Rahmstorf does not directly confront the journalist who writes something disagreeable, rather he goes directly to the editor-in-chief.
Court fines Rahmstorf for smearing an uncooperative journalist
Once Rahmstorf took his hounding and bullying of a non-conforming journalists too far when he wrote an unflattering piece about a journalist in attempt to discredit her. Eventually a court in Cologne found in favor of the journalist, ruling that Rahmstorf had maliciously spread falsehoods about the journalist, even suggesting that she had once plagarized. The court ruled in favor of the journalist and Rahmstorf was fined.
Spiegel commented on the affair:
Rahmstorf seems to have learned little from the court’s ruling – rather he complains that there is no control over the end-product of the classic media.”
Thank God for that. Let’s hope it stays that way.

Share this...FacebookTwitterAt his blog, Die Welt veteran journalist Ulli Kulke writes about the British Met Office’s seemingly obstinate refusal to cast off its ideological addiction to planetary warming and the Office’s consequently resulting overblown annual global temperature forecasts year after year.
Systematic false alarms
As the data roll in, it’s now clear that 2013 was “among the top 10 warmest years” and is thus good enough for the media to proclaim that global warming is happening unhindered and that everyone has to remain in a state of alarm.
And climate institutes just keep on sounding alarms of hotter years ahead. Kulke writes:
Example: The climate scientists at the British Met Office. They have always issued false alarms, and today we can even say systematic false alarms. Of all the annual forecasts on global temperature made this century, 14 in total, the scientists have wound up landing above the actual value 13 times. Paul Hudson, climate and weather expert of the BBC, points this out.”
Flipping a coin would already represent a vast methodological improvement for the Met Office. Kulke writes that it is obvious that the Met Office has “learned nothing from their experience“, and adds:
Apparently they just refuse to accept the reality that the trend is no longer going up in any significant statistical way (as even the IPCC has admitted this in the meantime). It is stunning, but some never learn.”

For 2014 the Met Office predicts that global temperature again will be 0.57°C above the long-term average.
It sounds as if the Met Office scientists are just playing a broken record.
===========================
Minus 73°F in Siberia
Aside from the story of failed forecasts from the Met Office, extreme cold is now gripping large parts of Siberia, with some locations showing temperatures at 60°F below zero and colder. One location taken from early this morning shows -73°F. So much for melting permafrost!

Share this...FacebookTwitterThe European Institute for Climate and Energy (EIKE) has posted a video of Richard Lindzen’s presentation delivered at the 7th International Climate and Energy Conference in Mannheim, Germany in April.

Overall Lindzen slams the IPCC models, claiming they act like they have everything all figured out, when in reality they do not. On ocean cycles and their important interaction with the atmosphere, Lindzen says at the 23.00 min. mark: “No models gets those things in a reasonable manner.”
The IPCC also appears to be only guessing with aerosols, and tends to fudge around with the numbers involving aerosols. On natural variability, at the 37:40 mark, Lindzen mentions a PNAS 2013 paper by Tung and Zhou who find that at least half of the warming is likely due to natural factors.
Lindzen ridicules the UN climate view its models, the ones near the center of the range and the bad outlier ones: “In the democratic processes of the UN, all models are equal.”
On extreme weather, at the end of his presentation, Lindzen calls the science surrounding it”one of the crazier things”.
Extreme weather is pure propaganda. The IPCC itself acknowledges no relation.”
At the end he reminds the audience that many things in the IPCC actually argue against the hysteria. This naturally leads us to assume these things have gotten filtered out of the Summary for Policymakers and press releases, and thus the public has gotten the wrong picture.
Also posted at EIKE is the presentation by Donna Laframboise.

I’m very pleased to say NoTricksZone played an important role in contributing to the FORBES’ piece.
This is an important issue because many countries in the world are, or are considering, following Germany’s green energy blueprint. Unfortunately, Germany’s approach is tragically a blueprint on how not to overhaul an energy infrastructure.

Will Cooling Temperature And Economic Climates Finally Take The Wind Out Of Failed Energy Policies?
Larry Bell, Contributor
There can be no disputing the fact that despite rising atmospheric carbon dioxide levels, global climate temperatures have been flat for at least the past 16 years, and perhaps a good deal longer. And upon issuing its latest Summary for Policymakers Report (AR5), the UN’s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) has finally been forced to admit that its climate models that predicted an impending global warming crisis have grossly overestimated climate sensitivity to carbon dioxide, a trace “greenhouse gas”.
Such unwarranted alarmism has influenced colossally costly and economically destructive anti-fossil energy policies in the United States, Western Europe, Australia and other regions of world. The question now remains how long it will take before broad segments of these populations realize that they have been duped by unaffordable and unreliable climate benefit-premised “green energy” promotions. …

Share this...FacebookTwitterVeteran German journalist Ulli Kulke of Die Welt writes a summary of 2013 in terms of the global warming debate at his blog donnerunddoria.welt.de. He concludes: “Once again evidence has mounted that we are slowly but surely departing from the view of a global apocalypse.”
On 2013 global temperature, Kulke writes:
We will hear that 2013 was one of the ten warmest years of recent history (probably one of the seven warmest). And with great certainty the following will be concluded from all this: This is proof that global warming is galloping unhindered, if not accelerating. But according to the statistics this is not the case at all, especially the latter. It cannot be emphasized enough: One of the ‘ten warmist’ or ‘seven warmest’ in fact shows that global warming has reached a relatively high level, but also that the dynamic for a further warming has halted, at least for the time being. […]
In the meantime there’s another observation that has been officially recognized. Even the IPCC confirmed in its fifth assessmernt report from last September: There has been no statistically significant warming in the last one and half decades. […]
Thus global warming has stopped – and has done so even while CO2 emissions have increased unhindered.”
2013 was a blow to the credibility of climate models and CO2 sensitivity. Kulke:
It was just last year – and regrettably this was kept away from the public’s attention – that many scientific peer reviewed papers appeared in scientific journals showing that CO2’s effect on the climate, its ‘climate sensitivity’, had previously been estimated to be much too high.”
2013 saw the death of the science that claimed CO2 is causing more storms. Kulke writes:
Here there are no indications that the number or intensity of hurricanes and typhoons have increased over the last decades. Quite to the contrary. The tendency is, for both strength and frequency, significantly less, as shown by this compilation umistakably shows. Also the last 2013 report from the IPCC: The authors downgraded the statements on the probability with respect to the previous report of 2007.”

And 2013 saw another grand climate conference failure in Warsaw:
No one expected there would be an agreement on a binding reduction of CO2 emissions. And of course there wasn’t. What a surprise…just like every year before. […]
Once again what became clear in Warsaw: In the end it’s not really about CO2 emissions – it’s mostly about money and a redistribution from North To South.”
Also Kulke writes it is very clear that in countries like Canada, Japan, Russia, Great Britain and Germany have been sending out loud signals that their enthusiasm about climate protection is waning.
The list of naysayer countries has gotten considerably longer.”
Kulke adds that even climate refugees seeking asylum from sea level rise were turned away:
All that remains to be mentioned for 2013 is the court case in New Zealand where a citizen of the Pacific island nation of Kiribati attempted to be recognized as a a climate refuges because his island nation is supposedly going under. The judge threw out the case – mainly due to formal reasons. That’s a pity because she could have provided the Polynesian with a real factual reason: namely that the islands of his nation are not going under. Quite to the contrary in the last 50 years the islands are growing, as you can read about it here.”
2013 was in fact so bad that even after almost everyone had closed the books on the year and unanimously called it a knockout for the skeptics, 2013 delivered two other massive bonus blows that left the warmists reeling at the very end of the year: the Chris Turney Antarctic expedition debacle and the record North American cold wave. These last-second blows are carrying well into the year 2014.
Never has a new year started off so well for the skeptics. The debate tipping point is steadily getting closer.

Share this...FacebookTwitterWhat implications could a low-activity sun have on earth? Fritz Vahrenholt’s and Frank Bosse’s latest solar report.
===============================================
The Sun in December 2013: Coming Back To Life
By Frank Bosse and Fritz Vahrenholt
Translated and edited by P Gosselin)
For solar observers there was quite a bit of activity last month, namely sunspots, and not too few of them. Activity even reached 84% of the mean value calculated from cycles 1-23. With an official SSN (sunspot number) of 90.3 the sun reached a second peak in December 2013, see the following chart:

Figure 1: Comparison of solar cycle 24 activity to the mean value of the previously observed cycles and to that of solar cycle 5.
As far as sunspot activity is concerned, the peak was comparable to what we observed 25 months ago (November 2011), but this time most activity occurring in the sun’s southern hemisphere: 82%. In the sun’s first cycle 24 outbreak, most of the activity happened in the northern hemisphere. To compare the activity of the current cycle to that of past solar cycles, we plot the sunspot anomalies from the mean for the number of sunspots up to 61 months into the cycle (blue curve in Figure 1). This yields Figure 2:

Figure 2: Accumulated number of sunspots since the beginning of the cycle, taking modified method of counting before 1945 though the “Waldmeier- Discontinuity” (see Cliver et al. 2013). Cycle 24 so far is the 5th least active cycle in over 250 years.
The low level of activity of the Dalton Minimum at the start of the 19th century is plain to see, as well as the rather relatively subdued activity that followed until about 1950. Then there was a significant increase until cycle 23 which heralded a drop that is now continuing today. Single months with increased activity hardly change the overall trend. As before we are currently seeing the lowest level of solar activity in terms of sunspots in the last 170 years.

So just what are sunspots?
From the sun’s moving plasma, magnetic fields are generated and they are able to strongly impact the energy flow in the sun’s upper convective layer.

Figure 3: The sun’s general structure. At the core the energy is generated by nuclear fusion. This energy is transported outwards by radiation, and then by convection through moving plasma. Source: Wikipedia. Kelvinsong: This file is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 3.0 Unported license.
These fields can cause convective energy flux to reduce locally, and so dark spots form on the sun’s surface. When that happens multiple times at nearby regions, different poled magnetic field lines interfere with each other and a short circuit is created. As a result the magnetic fields collapse and the pent up energy can suddenly burst. This is what we call a so-called flare – a solar explosion. When it is powerful enough, solar material gets ejected out into space with such violence that it literally escapes the sun’s gravitational field and flies out into space. This is the so-called coronal mass ejection (CME). It can have adverse consequences should it strike the earth and the material cloud reacts with the earth’s magnetic field and strong fluctuations occur. These in turn induce large currents within conductors at the earth’s surface (geomagnetic storms).
Our networked world is thus more prone to such events than 60 years ago. Power and communication networks and satellite outages can have consequences. However, very often such risks do not occur because several conditions have to be present before a serious outage takes place. A discussion on the impacts of CMEs in cycle 24 was held in December 2013 at the autumn American Geophysical Union conference. It was determined that that the latest geomagnetic storms have been really low in strength compared to what we observed before. They are even faster than they were in previous cycles. That can be traced back to a 40% reduced counter-pressure in the corona (see Figure 3). As a result the CMEs were able to move faster, yet have less impact. You can see the video of the presentation on the subject here.

On the other hand one can conclude: The reduced solar activity since 2006 reduced the density of the corona by a considerable amount. This not only has great impacts at the sun’s surface, but also out within the sun’s sphere of influence, which is also where the earth happens to orbit. So we can continue to wait with suspense what will be discovered next. Should it end up (as many scientists suspect) that solar activity continues to decline until the middle of the century, then there remains lots of potential. As Leif Svaalgard says at the end of the video: “None of us alive have ever seen such a weak cycle.”
Interesting times!

Share this...FacebookTwitterLots of reports on bitter cold gripping various parts of ther globe.
German site wetter.net here reports on cold gripping Turkey and the Turkish Riviera, which is typically a place tourists like to go to for warmth and sunshine.
These locations are far away from the Arctic, and are certainly a result of weather driven by patterns taking place at the middle latitudes, and have nothing to do with Arctic sea ice in September. The claim that September Arctic sea ice is controlling December weather in Turkey and the Middle East is absurdity of grotesque dimensions.
That aside, wetter.net writes:
Right now it’s cracking cold especially in the middle of Turkey. Permanent frost has taken hold even down at the lower elevations. Already on Tuesday and Wednesday the residents of Istanbul had to deal with lots of snow. Now foremost it has gotten cold just north of the Turkish Riviera. Also in the generally warm holiday area of Antalya local residents and tourists have had to settle with top temperatures of 8°C  and lows near the freezing point. At the capital of Ankara, which is situated almost 1000 meters above sea level, permanent frost is the forecast. Minus 3°C during the day on Thursday and minus 14 at night.”
Website Ice Age Now also reports on the cold in Turkey. 900 roads had to be closed, thus paralyzing large regions.

Sicilian Nicosia sees “first snow in years”
Ice Age Now here also reports that Mediterranean Sicily has been hard hit by unusual winter conditions.
As of Dec 13, many areas remain cut off due to the heavy snowfall. The bad weather has also caused power cuts and forced schools to close. […] Last night, Nicosia got its first glimpse of snow in years. Snowfall on Thursday night was reported in the villages of Pera Chorio, Alambra, Larnaca district, Latsia and Dali. […] Tonight, temperatures at the mountains will drop to -5 degrees Celcius.”
This is all because there was some missing sea ice 6000 and more kilometers away 3 months ago, some quacks claim. Snake-oil science in its purest form.

Share this...FacebookTwitterIf you think it just couldn’t be possible for any weather outfit to perform as poorly as the UK’s Met Office in long-term outlooks (13 out of 14 wrong), think again. It appears the US national weather services are right on their heels when it comes to who can make the all-time least accurate outlooks.
And we’re supposed to believe these people when it comes to their climate forecasting?
At this week’s Weatherbell Saturday Summary here, Joe Bastardi puts up the results of how well the NOAA winter outlook issued last fall ended up doing.
Here’s what their outlook called for:
Note how they said the chances for normal temperatures were about even for much of the country and warm down south. Averaging it out: a moderately warmer than normal winter. Today we see that the Midwest is having one of its harshest winters in decades and that the Great Lakes are almost completely frozen over.
Here’s how the winter has been so far:

One couldn’t be more wrong even if he tried like hell to be so.

 Weatherbell’s outlook for winter 2013/14. Source: Weatherbell.
Weatherbell pretty much nailed it dead on.
Unfortunately, the outlook situation for this winter by the same US weather services is just as sorrowful for Europe. Last fall some German meteorologists, basing their outlooks on charts from the US weather services, were warning of strong chances that the winter would “be really cold“. But instead of a brutal cold winter, Europe is now ending up with one of its mildest ever. The opposite is what has actually happened.
I think taxpayers and citizens deserve much more than getting information that is constantly turning out to be consistently wrong – for both weather and climate outlooks. We’re getting sick of it. How about getting some competent people back into these organizations for once?
With private meteorologists, we at least have the option of firing them. But with the state weather offices, we have to put up with their screw ups and keep hearing that we’re just deniers whenever we lift a finger and that we ought to just keep quiet. And if that weren’t bad enough, at NASA GISS they are even altering and rewriting the temperature history in a twisted desperate effort to make their faulty forecasts appear correct!
To Joe’s credit, he says we ought to respect the people at the US weather services for their work.
But I don’t – not anymore. What for? I guy flipping a coin would do a far better job.

Share this...FacebookTwitterThe European Institute for Climate and Energy (EIKE) writes of the German reaction to the “announcement” made by a prominent Chinese figure, He Jiankun, who yesterday stated that CO2 in his country would be capped. The announcement sent waves of euphoria throughout the global media and top climate officials. It appeared to be the long-awaited breakthrough. But the euphoria was short-lived. Jiankuntook it all back, claiming: “That was my personal opinion.” […] “What I said does not represent the position of the Chinese government or organization.”

 Director of Low Carbon Economy Lab
At first the announcement was viewed as a major policy shift, all coming on the heels of President Obama’s announcement to take action against CO2 emissions. But the euphoria turned to disappointment just hours later.
There is more on the farce in New York Times: Behind the Mask – A Reality Check on China’s Plans for a Carbon Cap.
The media and activists greeted the “announcement” as covetously as a craving junkie welcomes his next long-overdue fix, EIKE describes. This is shown by the reactions from German top officials and activists.
Hans-Joachim Schellnhuber, Director of the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research was ecstatic and spoke of a boost for climate policy worldwide:
It is remarkable that both China and the USA appear to be ready to take over once again the leadership role. Also for Europe it could now be the time to wake up from its climate fatigue.”
The PIK press release with Schellnhuber’s comments has since been taken down from the PIK website.

‘Should China indeed introduce an absolute upper limit for its emissions of greenhouse gases, it would be a boost for climate policy worldwide,’ commented Hans-Joachim Schellnhuber, Director of the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research. ‘Science shows that the planet is approaching more and more tipping points in the climate system.’ The big question is: How strict will China’s emissions level be?”

German activist group Germanwatch wrote:

Today’s announcement of China introducing an absolute emissions upper limit is viewed by Germanwatch as a possible turning point in international climate negotiations. ‘The USA and China are providing dynamism in international climate policy.  The EU must follow this example by adding on really ambitious climate and energy targets for 2030,’ demands Christoph Bals, policy director of Germanwatch. ‘Europe risks going from once being the most important forerunner, to being the biggest climate brake.’

Even though the Chinese announcement has since turned out to be a farce, Germanwatch has no qualms about leaving its false comments up and continuing to fool the press.
End-of-world theorist and activist website Klimaretter also gleefully welcome the “announcement”. It writes:

With the plans from the USA and China, observers anticipate there will be movement in the climate negotiations.

But of course then came the bitter disappointment. For the activists it was a very late April Fools’ prank.

Share this...FacebookTwitterScience journalist Axel Bojanowski, a trained geologist, at Spiegel writes how scientists think they may have solved the riddle of growing Antarctic sea ice in a warming world.

Mysteries surround Antarctica…scientists realizing oceans play huge role on climate. Photo: NASA-JPL.
No question the planet has warmed some since 1900 as it crawls out of a little ice age and back to a new Holocene optimum. Bojanowski writes:
For a long time scientists thought the problem would simply pass. They expected it was only a fleeting oddity.”
It turns out that the high level of Antarctic sea ice hasn’t been an oddity at all and continues to set new record highs. Now red-faced scientists are desperately searching for an explanation, even a temporary one, that will at least allow them to buy some time. Bojanowski writes:
Never before since measurements began in the late 1970s has there been so much ice at the southern continent at this time of the year.”
Bojanowski cites climate scientist Hugues Goosse of the Université Catholique of Louvain in Belgium, who says that Antarctica is behaving differently due to the fact that it is surrounded by oceans, and not continents as is the case in the Arctic. Goosse tells of ocean dynamics acting as a likely driver in polar ice behavior.
News for Goosse: Ocean cycles are a climate factor that climate scientists always had a habit of denying in the past. Skeptics argued again and again that oceans indeed acted as one of the earth’s primary thermostats, but were always dismissed. This is one reason why climate models have been so wrong.
Yet, Goosse insists the phenomenon is “temporary”. Spiegel writes:
Goosse believes in “temporary fluctuations in weather patterns”, for example changes in the prevailing wind directions. In the meantime winds are blowing over the southern continent more outwards towards the sea and thus are blowing ice outwards in all directions.”
Why this is happening is unclear. But Bojanowski cites a theory proposed by the National Snow and Ice Data Center, who think the ozone hole over the South Pole may be playing a role.

The mystery of Antarctic sea ice seems bigger than ever. Bojanowski writes of yet another explanation: Finnish researcher Petteri Uotila thinks the answer is that the Atlantic and the conditions in the Antarctic are linked:
‘I think this explanation solves the Antarctic sea ice paradox,’ believes Petteri Uotila of the Finnish Meteorological Institute in Helsinki, who was not involved in the theory.”
The theory is proposed by scientists at the New York University (NYU) who claim they see an “amazing relationship” between the Atlantic and Antarctica via the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation (AMO).
The Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation is the water temperature in the Atlantic fluctuating over decades, depending on how strongly the currents flow. And the fluctuations have an impact on years-long climate data all the way to Antarctica.”
Bojanowski cites Xichen Li of NYU, who says it’s no coincidence and is even confirmed by computer simulations. Bojanowski summarizes:
Obviously the Atlantic climate see-saw has the sea level around Antarctica fluctuating. As a result sea ice extent is changing. How this precisely functions remains unclear, however. ‘It appears we have discovered a surprising remote effect,’ Li says.”
So it’s obvious that the science of sea ice is still massively fraught with overwhelming uncertainty and will remain so for a very long time. The proposed Atlantic-Antarctic link does confirm what many skeptics have been claiming for years: the oceans play a massive role.
Veteran meteorologist Joe Bastardi has been telling us for years that the Arctic sea ice extent is driven in large part by the AMO and that today’s low Arctic sea ice levels are directly linked to the currently positive (warm) AMO. If the warm AMO has an impact on Antarctic sea ice, why wouldn’t it have an impact on the Arctic, which is directly next door? Once again the scientists are only realizing (admitting) what has been obvious to skeptics for a decade now.
Finally scientists like Goosse are waking up. Bojanowski quotes:
Here we are dealing with natural fluctuations that are only masking the warming.”
I.e. Goosse is finally admitting that we haven’t been seeing any warming for years. We suspect that in about 10 years from now, when the mask is off, scientists like Goosse will also see that there never was much warming behind the mask to begin with.

Share this...FacebookTwitterUlli Kulke, veteran journalist at Germany’s flagship daily Die Welt, writes at his Die Welt blog that “scientists from Potsdam not long ago were talking about a global temperature increase of four, five or even more degrees Celsius.” But with the recent news leaking out about the upcoming IPCC AR5, that scenario is looking more like fantasy than ever.
If the reports leaking out are accurate, then it appears that, Kulke writes, “the alarmists are backpedaling and one could roughly sum it all up as follows: Nothing is even half as bad.” Reports of exaggerated CO2 climate sensitivity are now filtering through even in Germany and it’s becoming increasingly obvious even to Europeans that the whole issue had been grossly exaggerated.
Kulke writes that he already mentioned recently that the IPCC had significantly scaled back CO2 climate sensitivity in its first draft of the upcoming report. “The way it appears now the IPCC has in the last few days once again scaled back its estimates in the updated drafts and has conceded stark errors in the past report.” Here Kulke cites the Wall Street Journal, the Daily Telegraph, the Mail on Sunday and The Australian.
Kulke continues:
Moreover, they expressly bring up the pause in global warming – and also admit that they cannot explain it and that the computer models, which the IPCC relies on, failed to predict it.”
Nobody knows what the final draft is going to look like. But the IPCC will have to ultimately decide whether to bring up these inconvenient, even embarrassing, facts. Failure to do so would cost the IPCC as a scientific body a lot of respect, of which it is already very low on. On the other hand bringing the glaring shortfalls will make the IPCC appear as prone to error and cost it credibility.

Mann’s flawed hockey stick discarded for good
Kulke also writes that the Medieval Warm Period has reappeared in the latest draft, thus disposing once and for all of Michael Mann’s infamous hockey stick chart.
Not long ago it was inconceivable, but apparently the IPCC is now admitting that during the years between 950 and 1250, i.e. the Middles Ages, most parts of the world were just as warm as they are today. That is during a time when CO2 values in the atmosphere where only a fraction of what they are today.”
Kulke believes that the IPCC’s claims of high certainty on the question of man’s impact on the climate through greenhouse gases will have no impact because “very few scientists have doubts on this“. The real question remains: How big is that impact?
The answer appears to be growing smaller with each passing day.

The German-language Turkish news site Deutsch Türkische Nachrichten here reports that the EU has passed another law designed to save people from dangerous drugs: a ban of chocolate cigarettes.
Hat-tip DirkH
The Deutsch Türkische Nachrichten writes:
Also sweets are on the EU’s verboten-list. Chocolate that is shaped like cigarettes must no longer be sold in the future. In the EU parliament’s view, chocolate cigarettes are dangerous starter drugs”.
Real cigarettes and cigars to remain legal
Ironically, the real cigarettes and cigars with addictive tobacco will continue to be legal, the Deutsch Türkische Nachrichten reports. Tobacco in Europe, it seems, is far safer than chocolate.

Share this...FacebookTwitterIt’s obvious: The alarmists have run out of arguments and lost the debate. North America shivers in a nasty cold snap, global sea ice is approaching the highest levels in decades, and global temperatures haven’t risen in over 15 years. Nothing is going right for them.
Ironically, maybe the debate is over. It just ended up with the alarmists as the losers.
Recall how the debate used to be about whether or not the warming was caused by man-made CO2. Today it’s not even that anymore. Now it’s about whether or not the Earth is warming at all!
Yesterday in a CNN debate with Marc Morano, Sierra Club executive director Michael Brune reaffirmed that the alarmists have lost. Brune doesn’t even bother citing data any more…and is left with nothing but to repeat the bogus “the science is settled” claim and thinks that weather anecdotes are proof of man-made climate change. If a cold winter or a couple of cold winters cannot be a trend, then how can a single one-day storm be evidence of global warming?
LA Times becomes the sister of The Inquisition

Things are so pathetic for the alarmists that the only strategy left is declaring the debate over and refusing to let other views be made known. Such is also the case at the LA Times.
At their Die kalte Sonne website, German scientists Sebastian Lüning and Fritz Vahrenholt have reacted to the LA Times’s move to keep dissenting views on climate change out of their newspaper, and even compare the daily’s draconian tactics to something from Medieval times…you know, the Dark Ages. They write:
The Los Angeles Times has now resorted to unusual measures in order to avoid inconvenient discussions: In the future no more reader letters to the editor coming from climate skeptics shall be printed. Thus this finally clears the way for the followers of the climate alarmist side. It’s the end of inconvenient discussions where in the recent times things just got too uncomfortable for the friends of the climate catastrophe.”
To summarize, Lüning and Vahrenholt quote Johann Nepomuk Nestroy (1801 – 1862), an Austrian dramatist, actor and playwright:
Censorship is the younger of two disgraceful sisters. The other is called Inquisition.”
