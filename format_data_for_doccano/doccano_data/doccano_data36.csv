==========================
CNN reports here on the latest UN World Happiness Report, issued from the comfy confines of their New York or Geneva offices. I’m a little confused here. Is the report from the UN or Columbia University? Is there really a difference?
The study assessed people’s happiness in 156 countries, based on western metrics having to do with economics, social support, generosity, mental illness, etc..
Europe ranks highest in happiness
Their findings: Denmark, Norway, Switzerland, the Netherlands and Sweden are the world’s happiest countries, and Rwanda, Burundi, the Central African Republic, Benin and Togo are the unhappiest.
Let’s all rush to be like hip Europeans, the report wants to tell us. But can we really trust the elitist authors of the report? One could easily interpret the report as racist. Look at the study’s message: Northern European, socialist secular societies (the whitest of the whites) are the happiest. Sub-Saharan African countries, on the other hand, are just all so miserable. Of course the authors surely are not at all racist, but they are indeed very ARROGANT.
I don’t trust the yardstick used by the authors here, and I ask: Are the European countries really the happiest?
Europe is a basket case in terms of suicide rates
Let’s look at suicide rates. Surely it must be very very low among all those happy European countries. But according to Wikipedia statistics here, it appears happy Europeans aren’t coping very well at all with all their “happiness”. They seem to be jumping off bridges with uncontrollable glee. According to suicide statistics, many of the “happiest countries in the world” are also among the top 50 when it comes to suicide rate!

Worldwide, No.1 happy Denmark ranks No. 41 in suicides, No. 2 happy country Norway ranks No. 35 in suicides, No. 3 Switzerland ranks 45th in suicides, No. 4 happy country Holland ranks a relatively non-suicidal no. 53 and no. 5 Sweden in terms of happiness comes in at no. 44 in not wanting to live. Quite happy Finland, ranked no. 7, is also quite happy about ending it all, coming in at a whopping no. 19 in suicides.
Europe on suicide watch
Europe likes to insist that it’s happy, but the statistics show that the continent is a basket case when it comes to suicides. Thirteen of the top 20 countries in terms of suicide rate are in Europe.
Lo and behold, not a single African country is in the top 30 for suicides. I guess they’re just too unhappy to jump off bridges.
In summary what we have is a group of elitists trying to convince the whole world that we should all live like secular, socialist Europeans. This study is certainly blinded and biased by western arrogance. You can throw it in the dustbin. It’s just more quack science in service of an agenda.
Climate change ending Happy Days for northerners!
There’s a new study out claiming that climate change leads to depression. Ironically the study comes from Canada, also a nation ranked high on the happiness list. Seems like they are having unhappiness problems, and are content to blame it on climate change. The study’s abstract writes (my emphasis):
Recently, research is beginning to indicate that changes in climate, and the subsequent disruption to the social, economic, and environmental determinants of health, may cause increased incidences and prevalence of mental health issues, emotional responses, and large-scale sociopsychological changes. Through a multi-year, community-led, exploratory case study conducted in Rigolet, Nunatsiavut, Labrador, Canada, this research […] reported that changes in weather, snow and ice stability and extent, and wildlife and vegetation patterns attributed to climate change were negatively impacting mental health and well-being due to disruptions in land-based activities and a loss of place-based solace and cultural identity. Participants reported that changes in climate and environment increased family stress, enhanced the possibility of increased drug and alcohol usage, amplified previous traumas and mental health stressors, and were implicated in increased potential for suicide ideation. While a preliminary case study, these exploratory findings indicate that climate change is becoming an additional mental health stressor for resource-dependent communities and provide a baseline for further research.
So there you have it today. Two studies that are complete nonsense.

Share this...FacebookTwitterFlood Analysis in Spain Shows No Trend In 40 Years
By Sebastian Lüning and Fritz Vahrenholt
(Translated by P Gosselin)
For years the insurance industry toldus that flooding was becoming more common. The main reasons was man and his CO2 emissions. Homeowners living near rivers got scared, and rushed to buy new insurance policies. The insurance companies beamed.
And the gig worked as long as nobody checked over the calculations made by the insurance companies. When objective science finally did take a close look, the surprise was big: Over the long term there was absolutely no detectable increase in flooding. The insurance companies had created fear among the homeowners for nothing. Actually “nothing” is the wrong word to use here because the new insurance policies weren’t for nothing.
In the jounal “Natural Hazards and Earth System Sciences” appearing in May Mai 2012, another regional study on flooding appeared. Jose Barredo of the Institute for Environment and Sustainability of the European Commission and two other colleagues studied the development of Spanish flood damages for the past 40 years. Indeed insurance damages for the period truly had gone up. However this was solely due to the increase in the insured value. A trend in flooding frequency and intensity was not found by the scientists.
Here’s the abstract of the study (emphasis added):
Economic impacts from floods have been increasing over recent decades, a fact often attributed to a changing climate. On the other hand, there is now a significant body of scientific scholarship all pointing towards increasing concentrations and values of assets as the principle cause of the increasing cost of natural disasters. This holds true for a variety of perils and across different jurisdictions. With this in mind, this paper examines the time history of insured losses from floods in Spain between 1971 and 2008. It assesses whether any discernible residual signal remains after adjusting the data for the increase in the number and value of insured assets over this period of time. Data on insured losses from floods were sourced from Consorcio de Compensación de Seguros (CCS). Although a public institution, CCS compensates homeowners for the damage produced by floods, and thus plays a role similar to that of a private insurance company. Insured losses were adjusted using two proxy measures: first, changes in the total amount of annual surcharges (premiums) paid by customers to CCS, and secondly, changes in the total value of dwellings per year. The adjusted data reveals no significant trend over the period 1971–2008 and serves again to confirm that at this juncture, societal influences remain the prime factors driving insured and economic losses from natural disasters.
==============================
So profitable can global warming and fear be.

Share this...FacebookTwitterGermans generally are very critical people, and when things aren’t exactly as they should be, they tend to get awfully bent out of shape over it.
Anything outside specifications quickly gets labeled by Germans as a “disaster”. And if it meanders beyond that, it gets labeled a catastrophe. Example: if Germany loses a World Cup football game, say 2 to 1, the game is immediately called a disaster. And should the German squad get trounced, say 3 to 0, then it is: a catastrophe.
“Katastrophe” is one of the favorite words of the German media. It gets used all the time.
Anything that finds itself not in a normal state is automatically described as “catastrophic”. That’s just the way Germans are. And since global temperature has been 0.8°C above “normal”, it’s no surprise that Germans have called it the Klimakatastrophe (climate catastrophe).
And since then, every severe storm and weather anomaly has routinely been called a “catastrophe” by the media. All departures from normal weather are called “catastrophes”. But because there have been so many “catastrophes” lately, the word itself has lost all its psychological and emotional impact. The word catastrophe in Germany is literally worn out. That has become a real problem for the German media. Today using the word “Katastrophe” produces yawns from Germans. It has no effect at all.
So what are the German media to do now that the word catastrophe no longer delivers the desired punch?
No problem- since Haiyan struck the Philippines the German media have found a new replacement word with which to wow the audience: apocalyptic, or apocalypse. Over the last few days the German public have been bombarded by these two words everywhere in the German media. The apocalypse has arrived!
For example Spiegel here, never one to refrain from sensationalism, writes of “apocalyptic conditions” in the Philippines. So does the Sueddeutsche Zeitung here.

Naturally, when the big ones like Spiegel start employing hyperdramatics, the other media outlets are forced to follow. In today’s world of diminishing media credibility and audiences, it’s a question of bare survival. The race to out-hype is on.
The Austrian website FORMAT.at here describes the Philippines as an “apocalyptic situation“. For the German media it seems the world is really coming to an end. Fanning the fans of fear and panic has become their top priority. FORMAT writes: “The dimension of Haiyan’s destruction is enormous.”
The Ruhr Nachrichten here writes of the “storm’s apocalyptic dimensions“.
The online Berlin daily Berliner Zeitung here calls Haiyan the “apocalyptic horseman“.
That the media is no longer content with sticking to the usual words for describing disasters and feels it has to upgrade to the “Sensationalize Deluxe” media package likely has a lot to do with headline grabbing.
The disaster left behind by the Haiyan is a truly serious and newsworthy. Yet when one considers that its death toll is likely to remain well below 10,000 and that history has seen far deadlier storms, the language is way over the top. The media are behaving like desperate merchants on the last day of a disaster clearance sale.
People have lost their fear of climate overall, and when the data lack and fail to stir the desired emotions of fear, panic and general hysteria, then hyperbole and extreme drama have to be resorted to. This is the sorry state to which the German media have devolved.

"Ireland has unveiled an ambitious plan to tackle the climate emergency by weaning the state, businesses, farms and households off fossil fuels. The government published a long-awaited report on Monday outlining more than 180 measures to curb the country’s greenhouse gas emissions and set a path for net-zero carbon emissions by 2050.  It envisages a rise in carbon taxes, a multibillion-euro scheme to retro-fit houses, almost a million electric vehicles and a number of other measures to change behaviour by institutions, companies and individuals. The taoiseach, Leo Varadkar, said: “We are going to change how electricity is produced and consumed, how our homes and workplaces are heated; the way we travel; the types of vehicles we purchase, and how food is produced. Above all, we are going to decouple emissions growth from economic growth … This plan represents the sum of our hopes for the future.” Ireland is one of the European Union’s worst carbon emission offenders and is facing fines of more than €250m for missing 2020 targets on reducing emissions and adopting renewable energy. Trends in agriculture and transport mean that emissions are set to continue rising in the next few years, risking even steeper fines for missing 2030 goals and raising questions over if and how Ireland will make its bold plan a reality. The Fine Gael-led centre-right government is entering a general election cycle and is wary of alienating poorer and rural voters with higher carbon taxes – the trigger for France’s yellow-vest protests. However, support for Ireland’s Green party surged in local and European elections last month, reflecting growing concern over the climate crisis. The Climate Action Plan to Tackle Climate Breakdown drew on a report published earlier this year by an all-party committee. Richard Bruton, the minister for climate action, said it put Ireland on a “trajectory” to net-zero carbon emissions by 2050, a significantly bolder ambition than the previous commitment to reduce emissions by 80% – but it is an aspiration, not a binding target. The report also commits Ireland to 2030 EU goals – to avert fines estimated at €6bn, it must slash emissions from 60m to 33m tonnes – by planting more trees and buying carbon credits from other countries. Other goals include: Boost the use of renewable sources for power generation from 30% to 70% of electricity. New onshore and offshore wind turbines are expected to replace peat- and coal-powered power stations. Pave the way for 950,000 electric vehicles by expanding charging networks and banning the sale of petrol and diesel cars from 2030. Retrofit 500,000 homes and 400,000 heat pumps to make buildings more energy-efficient, offering householders “easy payback methods”. Oil and gas boilers will be prohibited in new homes by 2025. Eliminate non-recyclable plastic and ban single-use plastic plates, cutlery, straws, balloon sticks and cotton buds. The central strategy involves increasing carbon taxes from €20 to €80 per tonne by 2030 – a politically fraught exercise that will require cushioning poor people and rural dwellers from higher fuel and heating prices. Another measure targets financial services: pension providers will have to disclose whether they hold fossil fuel assets, giving pension-holders the option to switch providers.  Leftwing parties, including Sinn Fèin, have opposed a carbon tax increase, while farmers have assailed Varadkar for saying he is trying to eat less meat to reduce his carbon footprint. Protesters greeted him last month with the chant: “Where’s the beef, you vegan?”"

Share this...FacebookTwitterAt his latest Saturday Summary, Joe Bastardi serves up a few observations about the current weather across the globe.
Let’s recall that global warming was really supposed to be having an impact over the land masses, especially during the winters. But the land masses, at least this winter, aren’t cooperating at all. Globally temperatures are in the basement.

The above chart from NCEP shows that currently global temperatures are running below normal. Where’s all the heat gone to? Joe then shows how the alarmist claims that all the frigid US weather is due to global warming are completely bogus.

The above chart shows that except for Europe, all the other global land masses are colder than normal. Joe comments:
What’s remarkable about this is, with the exception of Europe, most of the land masses on the globe are cold. […] This is about the third or fourth winter in a row I’ve seen the hemispheric temperature and the land mass, especially the northern hemisphere, have been colder than normal, and this is part of this process that we described now you know since 2007, 2008, the triple crown of cooling.”
Joe expects that cooling to continue another 15 years – until 2030.
The global anomaly is currently at about -0.1°C. The only ones escaping especially brutal winter conditions in the northern hemisphere are Europeans and polar bears.

Share this...FacebookTwitterIt’s now halftime for the 2013 hurricane season (June 1 – November 30) and German meteorological site wetternet.de writes that “Hurricanes are less than expected“.

Hurricane Irene, 2011. Photo by NASA
Using the mean of the 1981 – 2010 period, normally three or four tropical storms form in the Atlantic in August, with one or two growing into hurricanes.
But this year there have been only 2 tropical storms, and none of them made it to hurricane level. Meteorologist Christa Stipp at wetternet.de (meteorologist Dominik Jung’s site) sums it up: “Indeed there has not been a single hurricane so far this season and only six tropical storms.”
Stipp adds that the Accumulated Cyclone Energy (ACE) for the Atlantic this August was “70 percent below the mean“.
The recent low cyclone activity contradicts climate models that had projected global warming would increase cyclone activity. This year this is not only the case in the Atlantic, but is also happening globally. In August there have been only 4 tropical storms in the Eastern Pacific, and only one managed to become a hurricane (Category 2). Overall ACE in The Eastern Pacific is 40% below the mean.
But wetternet.de warns that there is no guarantee that a weak first half of a hurricane season means the whole season will stay that way. “There’s no indication that fewer hurricanes will occur during the 2nd half of the season, and thus less damage.”

"In May, for the second time this year, more than 1.5 million young people in more than 125 countries walked out of schools, colleges and universities in the biggest day of global climate action ever. Young people have protested en masse before – millions marched against the Iraq war in 2003 – but this child-led uprising is happening with unprecedented momentum on a global scale. The urgency of their protests reflects the very narrow window of opportunity left to make positive change. We are already living outside the climate parameters that first gave rise to humans, and the world’s leading climate scientists agree that we have only 12 years to limit global warming to a maximum of 1.5°C. Still, most governments are not doing enough to stay within these limits as set out by the United Nation’s 2015 Paris agreement. The complexities of the climate crisis have become highly politicised, but young people are able to cut through the noise. As Jamie Clarke, executive director of Climate Outreach, explains: “Climate change is the most politically divisive issue in America, more so than gun control and abortion. But young people have the social freedom to say it like it is.” UK Youth Climate Coalition’s Jake Woodier believes that climate strikes are reconfiguring the political sphere. “Children who historically don’t have a voice in politics are really thrusting their opinions into the public domain,” he says. “We are seeing thousands of incredibly intelligent and articulate children who are grasping the severity of the climate crisis better than adults in power.” Here, seven young people who are doing just that, explain where their passion comes from. Dylan D’Haeze, 16, Washington state, US This autumn, Dylan releases the fourth environmental documentary in his award-winning series, Kids Can Save The Planet. “Film-making empowers me because I can visually show problems and solutions in a way that is much easier to comprehend,” says Dylan, who directs, narrates and films his documentaries. With the next US election just 17 months away, his latest film, about voting and civic engagement, is a timely call to action for a new generation. “If you elect people the world really needs into office, then the world will change.” According to Dylan, the main hurdle is trying to convince the government and big corporations that climate change is a serious problem. “Most of them just want to make quick bucks instead of thinking what the world is going to look like for the next generation,” he says. What does he think of Trump? “It’s frustrating that we have a climate denier heading our government – that is two steps backwards from where we need to be right now.” It was ocean pollution that first struck him when he travelled through California three years ago: “The plastic debris we saw on beaches really scared me, and my mum suggested that instead of being afraid, I could do something about it,” says Dylan, who is home-schooled by his parents, Dawn and Kevin, both film-makers. “At first I felt helpless, but then I started discovering solutions that were actually really simple, like carrying bamboo cutlery and taking beeswax wrap to the deli to avoid clingfilm,” he says. Dylan and Dawn are now planning the ultimate home-schooling road trip in the run-up to the 2020 election. For six months, they will drive an electric car from their home on Orcas Island off the west coast, across America to Washington DC, filming as they go. High-profile mentors, including actor and environmentalist Ed Begley Jr, musician Moby and Cowspiracy’s Kip Andersen will join Dylan along the way. He will interview leaders spearheading green initiatives, youth activists from the nationwide Sunrise Movement and pioneers developing renewable energy.  As he travels, he will present his latest film in high schools and colleges, and speak in city halls and state capitals, asking people to make, on camera, a commitment to positive change. “It will be really powerful,” Dawn says. “Young people have to be engaged – there’s no other option.” kidscansavetheplanet.com Yola Mgogwana, 11, Cape Town, South Africa “I see the effects of climate change every single day,” says Yola, from her home in Khayelitsha, one of Cape Town’s impoverished townships. “Our weather is not normal – one day it is hot, the next day it’s raining heavily. It’s a huge problem for farmers, and mudslides wash away houses, leaving poor families without homes.” Eighteen months ago, Cape Town experienced its most severe drought in a century. Residents’ water consumption was limited to 50 litres a day and the city was just weeks away from “day zero”, when taps would run dry. “For me, that was a big sign that we need to change our ways and stand up for nature – because our government wants to profit from the environment, instead of implementing policies that protect it,” she says. In January, Yola began volunteering with the Earthchild Project, which integrates environmental education into classrooms and communities. “Our mission is to monitor our school’s food, water and electricity usage, and encourage other learners to reduce their consumption.” The school’s organic vegetable garden helps feed pupils, and a worm farm transforms food waste into compost, so the children learn how to conserve resources. “Every school should make environmental education part of their curriculum. Climate change is a foreign topic to my family – without this club I would be in the dark,” says Yola, who takes inspiration from the Zulu word “ubuntu”, meaning “I am, because you are.” In March, Yola spoke in front of 2,000 young people in Cape Town, and she presents talks at neighbouring schools. “I want to show the world that we, as black youth from Cape Town’s under-resourced communities and townships, do care about the climate – because we are the ones that get affected the most.” Her plea to the South African government is to take urgent action. “We will not accept a life of fear and devastation. The crisis is now. People are dying.” earthchildproject.org Amy, 15, and Ella Meek, 13, Nottinghamshire, UK Sisters Amy and Ella are on a mission to encourage people, businesses and schools to adopt a “plastic clever” approach to reducing single-use plastics. Three years ago, they learned about the UN’s 17 Global Goals for Sustainable Development while being home-schooled. Shocked by the impact that plastic pollution has on marine wildlife, they decided to do something about it. They founded their child-led campaign, Kids Against Plastic, and in April 2018 they presented their first TEDx talk. “Kids can have a really powerful voice when they find something they are passionate about – but the key is to be educated about it in the first place,” argues Amy, who wishes the school curriculum focused more on environmental issues. Plastic pollution is tangible and ubiquitous, but it’s only the tip of the iceberg. The girls explain that to make every one-litre single-use plastic bottle of water, one-sixth of its capacity of oil is used. “The wasteful production of single-use plastics is so interconnected with the consumption of fossil fuels and global warming, and learning about these problems really opened our eyes,” Amy says. “A youth movement in Bali called Bye Bye Plastic Bags, set up by two girls our age, really captured our imagination back in 2016,” recalls Ella, who now reports on environmental issues for FYI, a weekly news programme on Sky Kids. “I always wanted to be an environmental TV presenter, so it’s great to think others might be inspired by the features they watch on the show.”  As two of 250 British #iwill ambassadors for youth social action, the sisters recently met the environment secretary, Michael Gove: “He seemed interested in what kids like us are doing, but politicians always have so many things on their plates, so it can be hard to get them involved,” Amy says. “We are lucky that our MP, Vernon Coaker, and Gedling borough council have helped us to push change in our local area by installing water fountains and insisting that all vendors at council events adhere to the plastic clever policy (for instance, by using a returnable cup deposit scheme). Often, councillors and politicians are surprised to hear two schoolgirls stand up and talk to them – young voices get their attention and that has a powerful impact.” Last December, the education secretary, Damian Hinds, urged schools to become single-use plastic-free by 2022, something the Meek sisters are excited about. But they still have concerns over the government’s 25-year environment plan. “We worry that there’s no sense of urgency. By 2042, we’ll be middle-aged – it’s frustrating and scary,” kidsagainstplastic.co.uk Harriet O’Shea Carre and Milou Albrecht, both 14, Castlemaine, Victoria, Australia Bush fires are Milou and Harriet’s biggest worry. The teenagers experienced 46C (115F) days last summer, and January 2019 was the hottest month recorded in Australia, according to the Bureau of Meteorology. “The fire danger is really high. There’s a real risk of our houses burning down because we live right near the bush. It could be deadly. It’s really scary,” Harriet says. “All we want is a safe climate; we don’t want money or power, and we haven’t got any ulterior motive. We simply want our futures. How can you tell someone that they don’t have the right to live on and appreciate this planet, and be safe?”  Milou and Harriet started the Australian school climate strike in November 2018, together with their friend Callum Bridgefoot, 11. “Seeing Greta Thunberg leading school strikes in Sweden was really powerful – that’s what inspired us. Twenty of us started striking for climate action outside our MP’s office and it quickly escalated,” Milou explains. Weekly strikes now take place in more than 65 towns and cities across Australia, involving tens of thousands of young people, demanding 100% renewable energy by 2030 and no new coal, oil or gas projects. In February, seven other young activists joined Harriet and Milou in Canberra to present their demands to Bill Shorten MP, then leader of the opposition Labor party. “Meeting us face-to-face was a clear sign he is taking us seriously,” Harriet says. “But we haven’t had an adequate response – we want to see a real plan for change in policy.” “All the scientists agree that we’re right about climate change, so it’s difficult for people to find fault in what we are doing,” Milou says. In response to trolling comments on social media telling them to stay in school, Harriet and Milou insist that striking at the weekend would lack impact. “The people leading our country don’t want to listen to us – they want to shut us down,” Harriet says. “We can use our civil disobedience to capture the government’s attention. If they want us back in school, politicians need to start acting.” Milou says their families are behind them: “They are supportive of what we do because they love us – they would rather have us alive and uneducated than dead and educated.” schoolstrike4climate.com Lilly Platt, 11, Zeist, the Netherlands As Lilly walks to and from school, she litter-picks, often collecting up to 400 pieces of rubbish. She started four years ago, shortly after she and her family moved to the Netherlands from London. She was learning to count in Dutch with her grandfather and as they walked, they counted 91 pieces of litter within just 15 minutes. “My grandpa told me how plastic on the ground eventually makes its way to the ocean,” she says, “so I decided I had to do something about it. We picked it all up and took a photo to post on social media.” After that first pick-up, Lilly started researching plastic pollution and was horrified to read about the oceans’ “microplastic soup”. “Plastic pollution just shows that we consume too much,” Lilly says. “We all need to feel responsible. Think about how much CO2 we have produced since the Industrial Revolution. Just think how many animals have been killed for needless reasons and how many trees have been chopped down for nothing but greed.” She believes that all schools need to educate students about the climate crisis, and that politicians need to pay attention to scientists and strikers. She has been striking outside the town hall in Zeist since September 2018. “Listen, think and open your eyes and see what you have been doing to the world,” she says. “What happens to your body if you are 2C above your normal temperature? You feel very ill, so imagine how the planet will feel. We want world leaders, including Trump, to stay aligned with the Paris agreement, reduce carbon emissions and keep within 1.5C of global warming. Polluters must pay.” Follow @LillysPlasticPickup on Facebook.

Share this...FacebookTwitterIt’s obvious: The alarmists have run out of arguments and lost the debate. North America shivers in a nasty cold snap, global sea ice is approaching the highest levels in decades, and global temperatures haven’t risen in over 15 years. Nothing is going right for them.
Ironically, maybe the debate is over. It just ended up with the alarmists as the losers.
Recall how the debate used to be about whether or not the warming was caused by man-made CO2. Today it’s not even that anymore. Now it’s about whether or not the Earth is warming at all!
Yesterday in a CNN debate with Marc Morano, Sierra Club executive director Michael Brune reaffirmed that the alarmists have lost. Brune doesn’t even bother citing data any more…and is left with nothing but to repeat the bogus “the science is settled” claim and thinks that weather anecdotes are proof of man-made climate change. If a cold winter or a couple of cold winters cannot be a trend, then how can a single one-day storm be evidence of global warming?

Things are so pathetic for the alarmists that the only strategy left is declaring the debate over and refusing to let other views be made known. Such is also the case at the LA Times.
At their Die kalte Sonne website, German scientists Sebastian Lüning and Fritz Vahrenholt have reacted to the LA Times’s move to keep dissenting views on climate change out of their newspaper, and even compare the daily’s draconian tactics to something from Medieval times…you know, the Dark Ages. They write:
The Los Angeles Times has now resorted to unusual measures in order to avoid inconvenient discussions: In the future no more reader letters to the editor coming from climate skeptics shall be printed. Thus this finally clears the way for the followers of the climate alarmist side. It’s the end of inconvenient discussions where in the recent times things just got too uncomfortable for the friends of the climate catastrophe.”
To summarize, Lüning and Vahrenholt quote Johann Nepomuk Nestroy (1801 – 1862), an Austrian dramatist, actor and playwright:
Censorship is the younger of two disgraceful sisters. The other is called Inquisition.”

Share this...FacebookTwitterClimate alarmists like to claim there’s a 97+% consensus that CO2 is driving our climate…a claim that is patently false, of course. But even if it were true, it wouldn’t mean the science is settled and that they are right.
Having been on the subject of meat-diets and nutrition over the last few days, here too we have another long held belief supported by a overwhelming consensus of doctors and experts that is turning out to be completely wrong. It is the claim that cholesterol is bad for you. Data is showing the opposite is likely true.
It turns out that there’s no data supporting the hypothesis that that it leads to heart disease. In fact it is being revealed that patients have been misinformed by doctors, medical associations and their governments for decades now. The consequence of this false information has been a mass pandemic of obesity along with all the killer diseases associated with it.

Note “Michael Mann” hockey stick at 25:00-minute mark…stunning parallels with climate science. 
Let’s all recall how the science was settled and that 99.9% agreed that cholesterol was dangerous and would kill us if we allowed it to reach levels over 200. It is emerging that this long-supported claim may very well all be completely wrong. In fact there is a massive growing volume of new literature that shows cholesterol is beneficial, and thus it’s only a question of time before medical science will soon be forced to admit to the greatest medical debacle of all time.
Today there is even an international association of cholesterol skeptics. Like climate skeptics, they too were and are being labeled crackpots and so cannot be taken seriously. And as is the case with climate skeptics, it’s emerging that the skeptics are right.

"Seabirds nesting on the remote Farne Islands have been hit by heavy rain which has killed many of their young, the National Trust said. Arctic terns, puffins, guillemots and shags, all suffered losses as chicks including pufflings, or baby puffins, were battered by nearly 127mm (5in) of rain in 24 hours on 13 June.  Five times as much rain fell on the islands, lying off the Northumberland coast, as happened during all of June last year. The month is the time when fledglings are at their most vulnerable. Ground-nesting Arctic terns suffered their chicks being exposed to the elements, and puffins’ burrows were flooded. It will take time to see if the rain has a significant impact on bird numbers in subsequent years but the National Trust warned that the climate emergency could be having an effect with more frequent summer storms. Gwen Potter, countryside manager for the National Trust, said: “The significant rainfall sadly caused many ground-nesting Arctic tern chicks to perish due to exposure to the elements. We don’t know the full impact yet but estimate that tern numbers are likely to dip, by up to 35% this year. “We also know that 300 pufflings perished on one of the islands. Puffins are ground-nesting birds and unfortunately their burrows flooded. We’re continuing to monitor the wildlife on the islands closely. “The complex effects of a changing climate on nature are becoming increasingly frequent and difficult to solve. We are now seeing frequent summer storms washing out nests on the Farne Islands on a regular basis, and a decline in the numbers of surface feeding species such as terns.”"
"As much as we like to think that Australia, with its system of compulsory preferential voting, is protected from the kind of “populist” uprising that has unleashed the Brexit mess and installed Donald Trump in the White House, the result of the last federal election indicates otherwise. Just as in the UK and the United States, Australia has experienced the bewildering phenomenon of people across society voting against their own economic interests. The urgent task of social democrats the world over is to understand why, and to develop a coherent response – a task we have been skirting around for at least decade, since the limits of supply-side economics, or “neoliberalism”, became plainly evident during the global financial crisis.  The election result underlined the strong streak of self-reliance in the Australian character. While the most successful European social democracies smooth income inequality through relatively large tax and transfer systems, Australian egalitarianism was built on the ability of working people to achieve a high standard of living through secure jobs with strong conditions and good wages. The fractures in our economy brought about by globalisation, deregulation, the privatisation of primary industries and essential services, and industrial disruption through technological change, have profoundly undermined the job security of working people across the developed world. The problem is especially acute in regional Australia, where our traditional primary industries, such as mining and agriculture, around which the economic ecosystems of entire regional communities revolve, are facing existential threats from climate change. Many of these regions have for years been afflicted with high rates of un- and underemployment, a lack of options for well-paid career alternatives, and limited markets for the jobs in service industries that have kept employment in our capital cities growing. And even in those ever-growing cities, too many good, secure working-class jobs have been replaced by low-paid, insecure and often meaningless work, while our rate of underemployment is at a record high. People who live paycheck to paycheck are losing faith in the idea that, if they work hard, they will be able to provide for their families; they fear for their children’s future and for their own security in retirement. Social democrats have singularly failed to provide answers for these people. We have accurately identified the problems – the failure of “trickle-down” economics, the erosion of job security, the declining share of prosperity going to wages, the growing wealth divide, and the inevitable move away from carbon-intensive industries to address catastrophic climate change. But by repeatedly talking about the problems facing our society without offering concrete solutions, we simply exacerbate fear. Talk of “just transitions”, “lifelong learning” and such defeatist ideas as providing a universal basic income to people to compensate for the loss of their jobs, offers nothing positive or hopeful for people who are looking for government to ensure they can continue to support themselves. In the absence of real progressive policies to provide secure incomes to working people, the desperate hope that “jobs and growth” from a strong economy will trickle down to those at the bottom of the heap is all there is to fill the void. It is time for social democrats to focus on full employment. This means rejecting the economic framework of the free-market mantra that eschews an active role for government in the creation of jobs. The fact is, when working one hour a week in the gig economy for less than minimum wage takes you out of the equation, a 5% unemployment rate is no longer an accurate measure of full employment. For decades we have been told that if government stays out of the way, the market will create work for everyone who needs it, and do so in the most efficient way. Yet it is now painfully obvious that the market cannot deliver full employment that can support people to live a good life and ensure the fair distribution of our shared prosperity. The case for government intervention in the market’s failure to provide full employment is clear. Social democrats must radically reframe the accepted boundaries of the economic role of government and engage urgently with the task of creating real, sustainable, reliable jobs for people. Beyond making vague promises of skills training and redeployment packages, governments must actively invest in new industries, and put in place the necessary framework to equip people to make the shift out of their old jobs into secure work in a post-carbon economy. This is not beyond our ken. Australian governments have delivered full employment before, most notably in the three decades after the second world war. But such a project necessitates a shift away from market solutions and towards direct government involvement in job creation and industry support. Making new, government-supported jobs in infrastructure, advanced manufacturing, renewable energy and other new and emerging industries will entail all levels of government and industry cooperating across multiple policy settings, and working with local communities to understand the challenges and identify appropriate regional opportunities. This will require an active and interventionist fiscal policy, revitalised industry policy, leveraging government procurement, massive infrastructure investment – including in the care economy to lift the wages of low-paid women – government-funded skills training through an invigorated Tafe system, and guaranteed jobs from the public sector as an employer of last resort within the award wage system. While many local progressive policy thinkers are taken with the US model of a “Green New Deal”, Australia is uniquely placed to create our own comprehensive plan to achieve full employment in the post-carbon economy, one suited to our distinctive environment, population density and labour market structures. This is the most urgent task facing progressive policymakers in Australia today. When social democrats have no answer to the loss of good jobs for an inherently self-reliant populace, then “have a go, get a go” becomes the most compelling offer on the table. Surely we can do better than that. • Emma Dawson is executive director of progressive public policy thinktank Per Capita"

Share this...FacebookTwitterThe ultra-warmist online Austrian daily Der Standard here writes about the misery being caused as the Middle East gets walloped by “unusual cold and snow amounts“, especially the refugees of the Syrian conflict.
For many days unusually cold temperatures have gripped North Africa and the Middle East and have at times brought huge amounts of snow. While the snow-blanketed buildings of Jerusalem’s old city provide an almost idyllic picture, the snow and cold are exacerbating an already precarious situation of Syrian refugees in Lebanon near the border.”
See photos of the refugee camps at the above link. Looks like David Viner’s thing of Europe’s past has now become a thing of warm deserts.
Meanwhile the online Neuer Züricher Zeitung (NZZ) of Zurich, Switzerland, also reports on the unusual “winter drama” in the Middle East.
The NZZ writes of pyramids covered by snow for the first time in a 100 years, misery in Syria brought on by extreme cold, and a city of Jerusalem that is covered by “a thick blanket of snow“.
Misery’s common factor: Lack of energy!
The NZZ adds that energy is scarce for many: “Heating oil and cooking gas have become a luxury for many.”
Both dailies describe the misery that people there have to endure. The NZZ writes: “In Israel and in West Jordanland tens of thousands were hit by ongoing power outages.”
The commonality of the winter misery boils down to one thing: insufficient energy. Solar panels and windmills are not what’s going to help these people. They need electricity and fuel to stay warm and to cook with.

Share this...FacebookTwitterProf. Hans von Storch at his Klimazwiebel has an interview with Swedish meteorology expert Lennart Bengtsson, who just announced he is joining Benny Peiser’s Global Warming Policy Foundation (GWPF). Bengtsson represents yet another high-profile warmist scientist who has decided that “skeptics” have arguments that need to be heard in a far more open debate.
Klimazwiebel writes (and quotes…with emphasis added):
On the occasion of the press release by GWPF: “Professor Lennart Bengtsson Joins GWPF Academic Advisory Council” I wanted to hear Lennart’s own position on this mattter and prepared some question. Here are his answers:
Before I try to reply to your questions I need to provide some general background
My interest i climate science and in weather prediction has always been driven by scientific curiosity and I have increasingly been disturbed by the strong tendencies to politization that has taken place in climate research in recent years. I believe most serious scientists are sceptics and are particularly frustrated that we are not able to properly validate climate change simulations. I have always tried to follow the philosophy of Karl Popper that I believe is particularly important when you are dealing with complex systems of which the climate system is a primary example. For this reason empirical evidence is absolutely essential. The warming of the climate system since the end of the 19th century has been very modest by some ¾°C in spite of the simultaneous increase in greenhouse gas forcing by 2.5-3 W/m2.
I am concern that this as well as the lack of ocean surface warming in some 17 years has not been properly recognized by IPCC. Nor have the cooling and increase in sea ice around Antarctica been properly recognized. Climate science must be focussed to understand such matters much better and for this reason it is appropriate to have an open mind and not follow the IPCC as believers of a religious faith.
I certainly believe that most scientists are potentially worried because of…”

Bengtsson is a scientist who was always highly regarded, that is until he opened the debate door to let in skeptics and announced he was joining GWPF. The reaction from the alarmists is proving to be harsh, as expected. But already it’s going below the belt.
Putting the GWPF in the same basket as the KKK?
At Klimazwiebel physicist and settled-science insister Georg Hoffmann left a comment where he parallels the GWPF to the Ku Klux Klan:
If Lennart Bengtsson thinks that he has to better understand ‘people with different views’ he has not necessarily to join their club. I am also interested in understanding racism but I wouldnt join the Ku Klux Klan just for better empathy.”
By comparing climate change to racism, Hoffmann attempts to turn it into a moral issue. And questioning it as the GWPF does is deemed as detestable as being in the same camp as the Ku Klux Klan.
And they wonder why sober scientists like Bengtsson and Curry are turning their backs on the alarmist camp.

"A $10tn (£7.9tn) investor alliance has accused more than 700 companies, including Amazon, Tesco and ExxonMobil, of failing to reveal the full extent of their impact on the climate crisis, water shortages and deforestation. The major global companies, with a combined worth ofmore than $15tn, lack transparency over their effect on the environment, according to the intervention by some of the world’s biggest financial names.  Campaign platform CDP has brought together a record number of investors, including banking giants HSBC and Investec, to demand companies reveal data on the environmental cost of how they do business. The group said it was targeting 707 companies because of their “high environmental impact and lack of transparency” to date. The list includes the world’s largest fossil fuel companies such as BP and ExxonMobil as well as palm oil giant Genting Plantations and UK high street brands including Tesco, Ocado, WH Smith, Marks & Spencer and JD Wetherspoon. The CDP said 546 companies were being targeted to disclose information on the climate crisis, 166 on water security and 115 on deforestation. More than 7,000 companies already disclose their environmental impact through the CDP platform. The US is home to the highest number of companies named in the campaign, accounting for a fifth of the list, followed by Australia at 16%. UK companies make up 3.5% of the companies named and include constituents of the FTSE 100. Many of the companies on the list report on their environmental impact in their own sustainability reports but the CDP claims this is insufficient because their reports do not use standardised data. This makes it difficult to compare company performances on the environment, according to CDP. Emily Kreps, a global director at CDP, formerly known as the Climate Disclosure Project, said a growing number of investors were calling on companies to disclose in full their role in addressing the climate crisis. The number of investors lending their voices to CPD’s campaign has grown to 88, from 57 two years ago. “We know that climate change, water security and deforestation present material risks to investments, but these risks cannot be managed without proper information,” she said. Kreps hopes that by using shareholder influence the companies will agree to reveal their data through the CPD disclosure platform. Thomas O’Malley, head of corporate governance at HSBC said CDP’s “model disclosure framework” enables investors to assess how well companies manage “one of the broadest risks facing companies”. The investors involved in the campaign include pan-European asset managers Candriam and Amundi, and the NN Group as well as Taiwan’s Cathay Financial Holdings and the Washington State Investment Board. Sophia Cheng, the chief investment officer at Cathay Financial, said: “Climate change, deforestation and water security are critical challenges that require immediate action.” “Cathay believes that investors can play an important role in encouraging their investee companies to disclose environmental information – this campaign should improve corporate transparency and help investors better manage these environmental risks and opportunities.” The latest investor call to hold companies to account comes less than a week after Norwegian MPs voted in favour of ordering the country’s $1tn sovereign wealth fund, the largest in the world, to divest from hundreds of oil and coal companies to limit their exposure to climate risk. In the same week an open letter to the European Investment Bank, signed by 80 civil society organisations and academics, called on the central bank to end its fossil fuel financing, which topped €2.4bn (£2.1bn) in 2018. It follows a warning earlier this year from Mark Carney, the Bank of England’s governor, and François Villeroy de Galhau, the governor of the Banque de France, that the climate breakdown poses an existential threat to the global financial system unless there urgent reform. • This article was amended on 17 June 2019 to update some figures to reflect late changes to CDP’s report."

By Fritz Vahrenholt and Sebastian Lüning
(Translated/edited by P Gosselin)
The Deutsche Physikalische Gesellschaft (DPG), in English: The German Physical Society, is wringing its hands over the sustainability of the climate catastrophe. After all, hundreds of physicist jobs are in danger should the catastrophe sputter out. In the March 2014 edition of the information newsletter PhysiKonkret, the DPG poses the rhetorical question (pdf hier):
Climate change: warming pause yes or no?
The DPG lists a number of reasons, but noteworthy is Point 3:
3. Influence of solar radiation. The last decade was characterized by a solar maximum in the year 2000 as well as an above average long solar minimum surrounding the year 2009. That led to a cooling of the earth’s surface.”

In order to not upset the circle of IPCC friends, of course black holes in the ocean which made warmth mysteriously disappear without a trace a la Bermuda Trianagle, were also listed. And: The President of the German Physical Society, Johanna Stachel, announced in a large bold print:
We warn against the view that climate change has stopped. Global warming is advancing unhindered.“
What she most likely means to say is:
We warn climate change not to make a pause. Global warming must immediately continue on.”
Of course this is not written. Overall, it’s all a first good step in the right direction. Finally the sun is being taken as an important factor in the climate interaction scheme.

We can mock and have fun because they predicted this stuff would not going to happen anymore and of course now that it is happening they’re all saying it’s consistent with their theory. It’s unscientific claptrap at this point.
On radical climate scientists proposed measures to deal with skeptics Morano says:
It’s scary stuff. This is their, in many ways their doomsday type, cultist religion where they believe we have brought our own destruction, and it’s a lot of Medieval witchcraft mixed in.”
Morano reacts to Barbara Boxer’s proposals to protect the climate by levying taxes on carbon: “This is witchcraft.”

In the last part of the article Jung writes:
What’s climate change got to do with it?
As always: immediately after an event is observed on the planet that supposedly ‘had never happened before’, a discussion about the cause breaks out. And once again the discussion turns to the term: ‘climate change’.

‘Haiyan was one of the most powerful typhoons ever observed’ – at first that sounds very suspenseful, but an important small piece of information gets left out, namely: ‘Since weather records started being kept’.  And when it comes to tropical storms, regular weather records have been kept only for a few decades! When we speak of the strongest storm of ‘all time’, this ‘all-time’ is not even 100 years long.
The earth is really already more than 100 years old, and we don’t know at all what natural catastrophes occurred 500 or 1000 years ago – and we also don’t know which tropical storms took place. 
For many ‘climate expert’ this recent event is a feeding frenzy that allows them to pound the drums of ‘evil climate change’. And here not a single one of these ladies and gentlemen are able to show that such storms never existed over the past hundreds of years, let alone that this storm is connected to a man-made climate change.
What came out of the mouths of climate experts after the last cold winters had gripped Central Europe?:
‘A few colder-than-normal winters are in no way any indication of a trend change when it comes to climate change.’ Well, using that logic, how is a single large typhoon then supposed to confirm climate change? A truly fascinating thought process!

Max Planck economist: ‘Transition To Renewable Energy Borders On Suicide’
Leading economic experts are firing harsh criticism at the energy policy of federal super minister Sigmar Gabriel. Germany as a friendly location for business is not only being weakened, the transition to renewable energy even borders on suicide and is an unimaginably expensive folly.”
Recently Angela Merkel’s grand coalition government just decided they would water down the scale-back in renewable energy subsidies. The Deutsche Wirtschafts Nachrichten quotes Max Planck Institute researcher Axel Börsch-Supan, who has fired harsh words at Federal Economics Minister Sigmar Gabriel:
With their policy, the grand coalition is weakening Germany’s location as a place to do business. This is especially true when it comes to the Energiewende, which is bordering on suicide.”
According to the Deutsche Wirtschafts Nachrichten, other experts are also slamming Germany’s “Energiewende”. For example Ifo Institute director Hans-Werner Sinn calls it an “unimaginably expensive folly“. Marc Tüngler director of a German financial association, calls it “a planned economy without a plan” that makes the Energiewende “unbearably expensive“.
The Deutsche Wirtschafts Nachrichten concludes:
According to experts, the big losers are the consumers, who will have to expect continued increasing electricity prices.

CORRECTION: David Lessmann, Communications Manager of the Copenhagen Consensus Center, has written by that it is indeed “For €100 billion Climate Change Delayed 37 Hours“.
===========================
Hat-tip Die kalte Sonne.
The online schwäbische.de here presents an interview with warmist Bjorn Lomborg. His conclusion on Germany’s Energiewende (transition to renewable energy): It’s “inefficient and too expensive.”
Photo by: Emil Jupin
Lomborg, a former green activist, is just latest expert to give a failing grade to the German energy-man-on-the-moon project, which is clearly on a crash-and-burn trajectory. And despite the Energiewende’s imminent failure don’t expect the government to abandon it ever. With typical Teutonic obstinance, expect them fight to very the bitter end – until the energy system is completely ruined and the last trembly-handed-green gets ferreted from his bunker reality-surrounded bunker. That’s the German way.
The schwäbische.de writes:
Taken globally, the German Energiewinde delays global warming only a few hours.”

Though Lomborg commends Germany for its noble effort in tackling the “climate problem”, the Danish economics professor sees it as a huge waste of resources. Lomborg tells the schwäbische.de (translated from the German):
The Germans are achieving very little and are paying too much for it. This is only serving as a deterrent for other countries. With the investment of approximately 100 billion euros in solar systems, climate change is being delayed only 37 hours and is only making electricity expensive. That in turn is making your production more expensive and thus threatens jobs.”
Here I believe the schwäbische.de misquoted, and likely meant to write “approximately 100 billion euros”. In the end it boils down to a grotesque sum of money for virtually nothing.
So what should be done? According to Lomborg the answer lies in technical innovation, and this can be already be witnessed in the USA. Through the technology of fracking for natural gas, the “US-economy is experiencing through the drop in energy prices a revitalization valued at 125 billion dollars per year. At the same time the US has massively reduced its CO2 emissions.”
Lomborg also suggests that German R&D in renewable energy has been failure up to now. He adds: “Instead of investing 100 billion in subsidizing wind and solar, why not just invest the 100 billion directly into developing a better kind of renewable energy?”
Clearly the indications that the German Energiewende as we now know it is going nowhere except over a cliff are mounting. The question is: Will the government bail out before the plunge, or is it going to go over the edge and hope it miraculously survives the crash landing?

Share this...FacebookTwitterCarbon Dioxide and the Ocean
By Ed Caryl
In my last post, Figure 1 illustrated how much the annual carbon dioxide flux, the red trace, varied from year to year. Studies (here, here, and here, among others) have been done on the annual carbon flux, but they ignore this variation by using running averages, or by simply ignoring the data during El Niño periods. This seems like an effort to avoid actually learning something.

Figure 1 is a plot of the annual carbon flux into and out of the biosphere.
The shape of the annual carbon increase resembles the shape of the global sea surface temperature (HADSST3), especially after reliable CO2 measurements began by Keeling after March 1958. Several known events are visible. Counting backwards: the 1998 El Niño, the 1994-5 El Niño, Mt Pinatubo in 1991, the 1986-7 El Niño, Mt Ruiz in 1985, El Chichon eruption in 1982, the 1972-3 El Niño, etc. Every positive peak is an El Niño and  every negative peak is associated with a major volcanic eruption.
As can be seen in Figure 1, there is no relationship between the fossil carbon emissions curve and the annual carbon increase curve. That is because all the fossil emissions carbon is taken up by the biosphere or by the oceans according to Henry’s Law, and then sequestered there. The carbon in the atmosphere is controlled by temperature. This has been described by Dr. Murry Salby in this presentations at Sydney and Hamburg. He compares the CO2 curve to the integral of temperature. Here, I am going the other way mathematically, taking the differential of the CO2 curve as temperature and comparing it to known temperature data, the HADSST3 data.

Figure 2 is a plot of the annual carbon increase in the atmosphere (the differential of the Mauna Loa data) and the HADSST3 sea surface temperature anomaly.
The spikes in the SST correspond to the spikes in CO2 increase, and they go in the same direction. As the ocean surface warms, it emits more CO2 (or takes in less). The balance changes with temperature. Why should this be?

Figure 3 is CO2 solubility in water: 0.08g/kg/degree C below 20C. Above 20C the solubility drops by half to about 0.04g/kg/°C. 
The ocean surface area is 360 million sq. kilometers, or 360 trillion sq. meters. The top meter is 360 trillion tons of water. A change of temperature of one degree for cold water changes the solubility by:
360 X 1012 tons = 360 X 1015 kg X 0.08 g/kg = 28.8 X 1015 g CO2 or 28.8 Petagrams CO2. A tenth of a degree temperature change changes solubility by 2.88 Petagrams CO2. This is about 780 Gigatons carbon equivalent. (3.7 grams CO2 = 1 gram carbon.)
The tropical oceans are well above 20°C so the solubility there will be roughly half the above figure. The plots in figure 3 indicate about 1 Gigaton carbon change from a tenth of a degree temperature change. A scatter plot trend line will give us a more exact figure.

Figure 4a is a scatter plot of SST versus annual CO2 change. Figure 4b uses the linear trend formula from 4a to convert SST to the carbon equivalent.
Studies of the CO2 emission and absorption have shown that the tropical seas emit CO2 and the cold, sinking, north Pacific and Atlantic absorb CO2. This has even been mapped. This is all due to the variation in CO2 solubility with temperature.

Figure 5: Source link for the above figure and caption.
The sea surface CO2 partial pressure is always very close to the CO2 partial pressure in the atmosphere above it. The sea surface is always in equilibrium with the atmosphere. This means that as we add CO2 in burning fossil fuels, some is taken up by the land biosphere. The remainder CO2 is dissolved and added to the CO2 reservoir in the surface waters. The mixed layer in the ocean is the top 20 to 200 meters, depending on the amount of wave and current mixing. That mixed layer is about 1/50th of the ocean volume. It contains roughly the same amount of CO2 as the atmosphere, as dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC). The difference, whether the ocean is emitting CO2 or absorbing it, is driven by temperature. As can be seen in the above figures, an El Niño can drive 2 or 3 Gigatons of carbon into the atmosphere and a La Niña can take it right out again. The rise in CO2 is due to rising SST, not fossil fuel burning.

Figure 6 is a plot of figure 4b and the biosphere increase from the previous biosphere article here, subtracted from the annual carbon increase.
The above is a residual. But the curve looks familiar.

Figure 7 is Figure 6 with the average annual AMO index inverted.
Note on the map, figure 5, that the warm tropical seas emit CO2, and the cool northern seas absorb CO2. The AMO index is a temperature index for the North Atlantic. It is derived by subtracting the global SST from 60°N to 60°S from the total SST, or alternatively, the Atlantic temperate and tropical SST from the whole north Atlantic. This means that as the tropical ocean warms more than the average global ocean, this drives the AMO index negative. This shifts the CO2 solubility (figure 2) downward and to the right. That peak in the 1970’s occurs because the tropical oceans were warmer than the average during that period, emitting more CO2. Since that time, the difference has gone the other way, the biosphere is taking up increasing amounts of CO2, lowering the amount of CO2 left in the atmosphere. You can also see a one year lag between AMO and the carbon flux. This is because the AMO lags the tropical Pacific by about a year.
The point of all this is that temperature is driving CO2, not the other way around.
We have good measurements of atmospheric CO2 only since 1958. Before that time our measurements were at the mercy of whatever ice does to captured CO2. We have good global measurements of temperature only from 1979, the beginning of the satellite era. This means that all of our measurement periods are shorter than the natural cycles. We have hints only from surface and ship measurements that go back 120 years, that some of the natural cycles are ~60 years long. We are presently at a convergence and peak of several of those natural cycles. There are suggestions that we are past the peak of some longer solar cycles. I use the words “hints” and “suggestions” because of the large errors, lack of global coverage, and wishful thinking adjustments to these measurements. There are two possibilities. If CO2 drives temperature, then temperatures should continue to climb. If it doesn’t, then temperatures will fall, then, shortly, CO2 will fall also. Nature is in the process of demonstrating which is which. We can just watch.

"Labour will back measures deterring investment in fossil fuels as part of a new drive to stop the financial sector from funding global heating, John McDonnell will reveal this week. In the latest attempt by Labour to display its green credentials, the shadow chancellor will use a speech in the City on Monday to commit to using the “full might of the Treasury” to tackle the issue. He will commit the party to forcing the private sector into investing in the “green industrial revolution”.  He will announce a review of the financial sector’s role in the climate crisis, looking at “where and how it is causing or exacerbating problems”. It will examine measures preventing financial institutions from “actively contributing to planetary heating or exposing our economy to financial instability”. McDonnell, who has invited Extinction Rebellion, the environmental activist group, to brief his team, will promise to “marshal the resources and levers of power available to the Treasury to fund and drive the climate change emergency programme” under a Labour government. It is the latest sign that Labour is responding to the threat from the Greens, who earned more than two million votes at last month’s European elections, just 300,000 votes behind Jeremy Corbyn’s party. They more than doubled their tally of MEPs in the process. However, while Labour has upped its rhetoric on green issues, there are still few details of what the party would actually propose to do should it win the next election. Labour has committed to the target of reducing carbon emissions to net zero by at least 2050, with McDonnell saying that the party is seeking to bring the target forward. The government has committed to reaching a net-zero target by 2050. It comes ahead of a rally in London on Wednesday 26 June when more than 15,000 people are expected in Westminster to lobby for urgent action on the climate. The event, called the Time is Now, is set to be the largest ever environmental lobby of parliament – and will include schoolchildren, grandparents, nuns, farmers, doctors and surfers. McDonnell will use Monday’s speech to suggest he will implement measures pushing the public and private sectors into investing in technology needed to deal with the climate crisis. “Every one of Labour’s shadow ministerial teams has been charged with producing a programme of action defining their department’s contribution to tackling climate change,” he will say. “With the real prospect of an autumn election, we want to be fully prepared to roll out this climate change emergency programme as soon as we take over the controls of government. “State and private sector resources will be required to invest in the infrastructure of the green industrial revolution envisaged by Labour. This includes the large-scale development of alternative energy sources and a carbon neutral transport system. “Regulation as well as incentives will also be required to divert investment away from fossil fuels and into environmentally sustainable activities.” It is the first in a series of speeches by the shadow chancellor, who has been attempting to set out more of Labour’s economic policy in case a snap election is called later this year. The party is desperate to ensure that its fudged position on Brexit does not doom its chances of securing office. As part of the push, McDonnell will announce an inquiry into the so-called shadow banking system, where borrowing and lending takes place beyond the oversight of regulators. “Much large-scale investment is undertaken in the largely unregulated and opaque shadow banking system,” he will say. “I am launching an independent inquiry into the role and activities of shadow banking in our economy to examine what state intervention may be required to increase the transparency and accountability of this sector to ensure it plays its full role in addressing the climate change emergency that we face.”"

Share this...FacebookTwitterGermany’s top leftist, “Red Oskar” Lafontaine has a commentary in the Thursday’s print edition of the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung, where he comes out against wind power. The title: “How wind turbines are destroying the environment.”
He realizes that the whole scam is only benefitting capitalists, is causing more CO2 and is ruining the beauty of Germany’s once charming landscape.
In his opinion piece Lafontaine writes that the “well intentioned renewable energy source is destroying the natural landscape heritage and is involuntarily boosting coal power plants“. It’s time to end wind power, Lafontaine writes.
Wind turbines are growing in size, and are approaching a height of 200 meters. Lafontaine also says that despite the huge investment in wind energy, it only provided Germany with 1.3% of its power in 2012. Is it worth the price of ruining the landscape, he asks?
Moreover, Lafontaine points out that wind energy has not reduced CO2 emissions in Germany, but likely has increased it because gas-fired power plants operating part-time to compensate for windless and sunless days are not profitable. Thus power companies are putting more and more coal power plants back online.
But it’s the industrialization of Germany’s natural landscape that really has Lafontaine against it. He quotes writer Botho Strauß:

A more brutal destruction of the landscape as we see with wind turbines was never ever caused by any phase of industrialization.
“The landscape,” Lafontaine, says, “is being robbed of its poety“. It’s not about protecting nature; it’s about money.
Lafontaine writes that the wind turbines also represent a threat to wildlife and biodiversity.
He summarizes his opinion piece.

It is economically and technically senseless to stay on a path that increases the emission of carbon dioxide, increases the price of electricity. The targets can be reached more easily and cheaply by using more intelligent technology.”

Share this...FacebookTwitterThe European Institute for Climate and Energy (EIKE) here presents a blistering report by retired climate scientist Prof. Horst-Joachim Lüdecke and meteorologist Klaus-Eckart Puls on how a German and Swiss network of IPCC scientists who, using pernicious methods, thwart legitimate scientists and media reporters who they view as a threat to the AGW hypothesis.
German climate scientist Horst Lüdecke and meteorologist Klaus-Eckart Puls say German climate science has been ruthless with dictatorial traits. Photo Lüdecke private, Puls EIKE.
Warnings of ruthless scientists
The piece is too long and my time too short to allow a full translation, and so I will present the main points.
Lüdecke and Puls write that these IPCC scientists should serve as “warning signals that should never be forgotten. This is especially so when an eco-dictatorial planned “Great Transformation” of avoiding CO2 is being propagated.”
Lüdecke and Puls of EIKE then remind readers that such threat was seen already once early in the 20th century.
Smearing of Jan Veizer and Nir Shaviv
In 2003 the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research (PIK) led a smear campaign against Slovakian geoscientist Jan Veizer and Israeli astrophysicist Nir Shaviv. Both are renowned scientists and have won many awards. In July 2003 Veizer and Shaviv published a ground-breaking paper on the climate impacts from the Earth’s orbit through the galaxy titled: ”Celestial Driver of Phanerozoic Climate?”.
However, the paper only inflamed the wrath of AGW colleagues, who saw themselves obligated to rescue the planet from natural gas CO2 using any possible means. Engulfed in fervor, the angry scientists, however, missed that the Veizer/Shaviv publication had nothing to do with the anthropogenic impacts of Co2. Rather the paper dealt with climate changes of the last 500 millions years, and did not even look at the 20th century climate.
The PIK immediately sent out a press release to the media, denouncing the findings of the two scientists.
Lüdecke and Puls write that disagreement in science is nothing new. But when scientists disagree, there’s an academically accepted approach to contest theories from other colleagues, which is usually done through the publisher and not carried out in the mass media.
Scientists stoop to smearing through the media
But the traditional approach was brushed aside by a group of German and Swiss IPCC scientists, who viewed Veizer’s and Shaviv’s publication as a potentially lethal threat to AGW hypothesis. But instead of properly contesting the publication, they embarked on a campaign to discredit the Veizer and Shaviv. EIKE writes:
The climb-down to near yellow journalism by the PIK’s press action had absolutely nothing to do with scientific etiquette and debate. Of the PIK press release signatories, many are known to readers as Germans and Swiss AGW activists and are still preaching ‘end-of-the-world’ by CO2.

Prof. T. Stocker, Klima- und Umweltphysik, Bern [6]
Today EIKE calls that particular action “scandalous” and that it will be “infamous in German and Swiss science history.” Today many of these scientists act like nothing ever happened. The media, EIKE writes, were all too willing and aided and abetted the smear action, thus prompting Lüdecke and Puls to wonder if anything has ever been learned from Germany’s dictatorial past.
Veizer leaves Germany
Eventually, Veizer ended up leaving science-hostile Germany and the University of Bochum to join the University of Ottawa. EIKE writes that it is not sure how much the move to Canada was due to the smear campaign, but adds:
Nevertheless, the scientific exodus because of public pressure in the dictatorial past of Germany is well known.”
Here Albert Einstein serves as a classic example from the past. Climate science dissent in Germany is openly hounded and smeared.
The leaked Climategate e-mails put Stefan Rahmstorf at the center of the campaign. The press release smearing Veizer and Shaviv was authored by PIK and Climategate e-mails show Rahmstorf bringing up the matter more than once. In one e-mail Rahmstorf writes:
I feel another recent paper may require a similar scientific response, the one by Shaviv & Veizer (attached). …This paper got big media coverage here in Germany and I guess it is set to become a climate skeptics classic:

I think it would be a good idea to get a group of people together to respond to this paper (in GSA today). My expertise is good for part of this and I’d be willing to contribute. My questions to you are:
1. Does anyone know of any other plans to respond to this paper? 2. Would anyone like to be part of writing a response? 3. Do you know people who may have the right expertise? Then please forward them this mail.
Best regards, Stefan”
Not about science. It’s about silencing dissenters 
Lüdecke and Puls remind us that honest disagreement is fine but here we are dealing with another issue. What they see here is a clear strategy of “mafia-like methods by a network of AGW alarmists“. Lüdecke and Puls use another Climategate  e-mail presented by a US blogger to illustrate that it’s not about finding out what the truth is, but about attacking anything that disagrees with the AGW hypothesis:
The paper will be thoroughly refuted. I do not know as yet by who, or on what grounds, or where the definitive refutation paper will appear. But it will be refuted and dismissed in no time, never to be talked about again (except by ”deniers” and ‘flat-earthers”). That is thankfully the way we operate in climate science, trust us, we’re scientists. Everything is under control. Nothing to see here, move on.”
That is completely remote of science and very characteristic of dictatorships. EIKE characterizes the attack methods used by the German and Swiss IPCC scientists as “ruthless“. This was also the view of Spiegel, who in 2007 wrote:
The ruthless methods of climate scientist Rahmstorf:  Stefan Rahmstorf is the most famous of the top climate scientists in Germany – and at the same time the most tenacious. Journalists have complained of intimidastion attempts. Scientists are distancing themselves from the Potsdam Professor. In the meantime the conflict is being waged in newspapers.”
Rahmstorf demands control of the press
EIKE adds that “climate scientists like Rahmstorf firmly believe they are the keepers of the absolute truth”, and at the same time they are so sure of their politically supported power that they are demanding absolute control over the press.”
The methods used by the AGW scientists resemble earlier historical attempts to purify thought, culture and science, EIKE suggests. Spiegel wrote of Rahmstorf:
Rahmstorf threatens with a ‘Black List’: How Rahmstorf goes about upbringing journalists is explained in a notable commentary he wrote in “Zeit” in February 2005. At his private internet site he has a list of ‘classic media blunders’ where ‘I require every journalist to attend an obligatory lecture before an interview’. If the journalist reports something sensational, then he will feel the consequences: ‘Such journalists get put on my black list,’ Rahmstorf wrote in ZEIT.”
Dissenters see jihadist undercurrents
Lüdecke and Puls write that intimidating media outlets is part of the Rahmstorf’s strategy. Germany’s flagship Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung once published an op-ed piece by climate skeptics, who wrote:
It’s a holy war, a jihad that Rahmstorf is leading. And no prisoners are taken: He takes quotes out of context, deletes, and thus does not permit his end-of-world announcement to ever be threatened.”
Lüdecke and Puls write that Rahmstorf does not directly confront the journalist who writes something disagreeable, rather he goes directly to the editor-in-chief.
Court fines Rahmstorf for smearing an uncooperative journalist
Once Rahmstorf took his hounding and bullying of a non-conforming journalists too far when he wrote an unflattering piece about a journalist in attempt to discredit her. Eventually a court in Cologne found in favor of the journalist, ruling that Rahmstorf had maliciously spread falsehoods about the journalist, even suggesting that she had once plagarized. The court ruled in favor of the journalist and Rahmstorf was fined.
Spiegel commented on the affair:
Rahmstorf seems to have learned little from the court’s ruling – rather he complains that there is no control over the end-product of the classic media.”
Thank God for that. Let’s hope it stays that way.

Share this...FacebookTwitterOnline Spiegel as of right now has an unflattering report on the UN IPCC AR5 climate report as its top headline.
This hardly helps the credibility of climate scientists.
The headline article is dubbed: Contradictory Prognoses: Scientists Discover Discrepancies In UN Climate Report, written by Spiegel science journalist Axel Bojanowski.
The bold print introduction:
The UN warns in 2200 pages in its new climate report of a dramatic change in the environment. Renowned scientists now criticize the inconsistencies in the report. They aim 5 accusations at the IPCC.”
Among the discrepancies and contradictions Bojanowski mentions, a big one is the IPCC’s unscientific approach used to arrive at it’s infamous “95% certainty” that man is causing the climate change. Spiegel writes, citing Judith Curry:
How can science be certain about man’s impact when over the last 15 years the natural impacts surprisingly have stopped the warming of the air, asked climate scientist Judith Curry of Georgia Institute of Technology, Chairperson of the Climate Forecast Applications Network.”
Spiegel also writes that other scientists accuse the IPCC of not mentioning the uncertainties surrounding its scenarios: “In the summary of the IPCC’s report, the word pause, scientifically ‘hiatus’, is not mentioned at all.”
And the fact that only 3 of 114 models were able to correctly reproduce the 15-year hiatus, Spiegel notes, gets ignored altogether in the summary. Spiegel quotes Eduardo Zorita of the Helmholtz Center GKSS:



<!--

This point should have been more clearly addressed because it underscores that the important deficits of the climate models are still not understood.”
Spiegel is also highly skeptical of the claims made that the oceans have absorbed the heat. Bojanowski writes: “The proof of an additional buffer however appears difficult to find: Precisely at the lower depths of the oceans, which they say have especially warmed up – there, very few measurements have been made.”
Bojanowski also notes that in the previous reports, the IPCC always showed an increasing temperature curve. This time however, the usual line curve was replaced with a decadal “trapeze” chart. “Good PR“, says Reiner Grundmann of the University of Nottingham, “but is that sustainable?”
Bojanowski mentions the IPCC’s failure not to inform the public that there is no connection found between extreme weather and climate change. That should have been pointed out in the summary.
Bojanowski writes that signs of trouble for the IPCC’s AR5 report were already evident at the press conference for its presentation in Stockholm. A “reporter from a British tabloid” asked why the computer simulations failed to predict the 15-year stop in temperature rise. That, Spiegel writes, was a question that the chief of the World Meteorological Organisation WMO, Michel Jarraud, was not pleased to hear.
Bojanowski concludes from that:
Apparently the meteorologist was not used to this; critical questions do not particularly belong to the tradition of press conferences on climate science.”
Another shortcoming of the IPCC report for some scientists, Bojanowski writes:  A “faction” of scientists claims the report underestimates the seriousness of the climate.

Share this...FacebookTwitterLots of reports on bitter cold gripping various parts of ther globe.
German site wetter.net here reports on cold gripping Turkey and the Turkish Riviera, which is typically a place tourists like to go to for warmth and sunshine.
These locations are far away from the Arctic, and are certainly a result of weather driven by patterns taking place at the middle latitudes, and have nothing to do with Arctic sea ice in September. The claim that September Arctic sea ice is controlling December weather in Turkey and the Middle East is absurdity of grotesque dimensions.
That aside, wetter.net writes:
Right now it’s cracking cold especially in the middle of Turkey. Permanent frost has taken hold even down at the lower elevations. Already on Tuesday and Wednesday the residents of Istanbul had to deal with lots of snow. Now foremost it has gotten cold just north of the Turkish Riviera. Also in the generally warm holiday area of Antalya local residents and tourists have had to settle with top temperatures of 8°C  and lows near the freezing point. At the capital of Ankara, which is situated almost 1000 meters above sea level, permanent frost is the forecast. Minus 3°C during the day on Thursday and minus 14 at night.”
Website Ice Age Now also reports on the cold in Turkey. 900 roads had to be closed, thus paralyzing large regions.

Heavy snowfall in Black Sea region, central Anatolia and Eastern provinces. In the eastern provinces of Van, Bitlis, Mus and Hakkari, 951 village roads were closed on Friday due to heavy snow and blizzards.”
Sicilian Nicosia sees “first snow in years”
Ice Age Now here also reports that Mediterranean Sicily has been hard hit by unusual winter conditions.
As of Dec 13, many areas remain cut off due to the heavy snowfall. The bad weather has also caused power cuts and forced schools to close. […] Last night, Nicosia got its first glimpse of snow in years. Snowfall on Thursday night was reported in the villages of Pera Chorio, Alambra, Larnaca district, Latsia and Dali. […] Tonight, temperatures at the mountains will drop to -5 degrees Celcius.”
This is all because there was some missing sea ice 6000 and more kilometers away 3 months ago, some quacks claim. Snake-oil science in its purest form.

"Donald Trump’s administration is finalizing plans to roll back the US government’s only direct efforts to curb coal-fired power plant pollution that is heating the planet.  Trump’s Environmental Protection Agency will replace an Obama-era climate change rule with a regulation that experts warn could help some of America’s oldest and dirtiest coal plants to keep running. Obama’s Clean Power Plan would have pushed power companies to shift away from coal and toward natural gas and renewable power. Trump’s rule instead sets out ways for states to direct coal plants to increase their efficiency, with hardware fixes or operational changes. Trump’s rule will not significantly tackle the heat-trapping gases entering the atmosphere that cause extreme heatwaves, floods and other disasters. And it will lead to higher levels of air pollution, compared with the Clean Power Plan. “I believe this is the first rule in EPA’s history that acknowledges the existential threat of climate change but by the agency’s own admission does absolutely nothing to stop it,” said Obama’s EPA chief Gina McCarthy. “The Trump administration has made painfully clear that they are incapable of rising to the challenge and tackling this crisis. They have shown a callous disregard for EPA’s mission, a pattern of climate science denial, and an inexcusable indifference to the consequences of climate change.” But the Trump administration is defending the change, arguing it is limited by law in how it can regulate the emissions that cause rising temperatures. The EPA administrator, Andrew Wheeler, a former coal lobbyist, on Wednesday said the Obama rule would have raised electricity costs for poorer Americans. But even without that rule taking effect, power companies have been shutting down coal plants, which are more expensive than their cleaner competitors natural gas and renewable energy. Wheeler argued EPA is “leveling the playing field” for coal, although the rule is not expected to significantly boost the US coal industry, which has been in decline for years. The National Mining Association, which represents coal companies, praised the rule, saying it preserves “the rightful authority of the states to manage their own unique energy infrastructure and electric grids”. Wheeler positioned the policy as Republicans’ alternative to the Green New Deal proposed by progressives. Wheeler said: “Rather than Washington telling Americans what type of energy they can use or how they can travel or even what they can eat, we are working cooperatively with the states to provide an affordable, dependable and diverse supply of energy that continues to get cleaner and more efficient.” Joe Goffman, a Harvard professor and former EPA general counsel, called EPA’s legal arguments “tortured” and “deceptive”. Goffman said the rule “demonstrates the Trump administration’s determination not only to avoid taking action to address climate change but also to obstruct current and future efforts by states and successors to cut greenhouse gas pollution”. Democratic-led states and environment advocates are expected to challenge the rule in lawsuits. Attorneys general in New York and Connecticut on Wednesday quickly announced their intent to sue, and many more states are expected to join them. Trump’s agency argues it does not have legal authority to regulate climate change. If the courts agree, future US climate efforts could be in jeopardy. Coal plant air pollution – from tiny particles that enter the lungs – cause breathing problems and early deaths. According to an earlier estimate from EPA, the new rule could lead to 1,400 more deaths each year. One academic analysis estimates that over a decade the repeal could lead to 36,000 deaths, and that other Trump environment rollbacks could lead to a total to 80,000 deaths. Paul Billings, executive director of the American Lung Association, said: “If certain changes are made, we could see the oldest, dirtiest plants run more and that will increase the overall burden caused by the pollution.” Trump and many of his officials have questioned the science that shows rapid global action is needed to limit heat-trapping gases and protect people against a mounting crisis. His agencies have slashed programs designed to limit carbon dioxide from power plants, cars and trucks, and encouraged oil drilling and coal mining. The US has sent more carbon dioxide into the atmosphere than any other country. It is currently the world’s second largest emitter. America’s electricity sector has been rapidly decreasing its climate pollution, even though the Clean Power Plan was stalled by the supreme court and never took effect. Natural gas and renewable power have proved to be cheaper than coal. Power plants are responsible for less than a third of US emissions. And data shows the US saw a rise in overall carbon levels last year. Trump’s rule includes help for states to improve coal plant efficiency. That list does not include technologies to capture the carbon dioxide produced by a coal plant. Although Trump has said he will withdraw from the Paris pact to fight the climate crisis, other countries have stayed in. Still, their efforts are far behind what scientists say is necessary to avoid the worst of the climate emergency."
"Zero-carbon energy sources are poised to overtake fossil fuels as the UK’s largest electricity source over a full calendar year. This year will be the first that fossil fuels make up less than half of the electricity generated, according to National Grid, following a dramatic decline in coal-fired power and rising renewable and low-carbon energy. Instead, UK homes and businesses will rely more on “cleaner” electricity generated by wind farms, solar panels, hydro power and nuclear power reactors. A decade ago, coal plants generated almost a third of the UK’s electricity, but in the first half of this year they have provided only 3%. In the same period renewable energy has climbed from supplying just 2% of the UK’s power to a fifth of all electricity produced. The “landmark tipping point” is an “historic achievement” in the UK’s journey towards becoming a net-zero carbon economy by 2050, said National Grid. John Pettigrew, the UK power system operator’s chief executive, said: “The incredible progress that Britain has made in the past 10 years means we can now say 2019 will be the year zero-carbon power beats fossil fuel-fired generation for the first time.” “We wouldn’t have said it if we weren’t confident that this will be the year.” National Grid is able to confidently predict the 2019 record only six months into the year following the UK’s greenest ever winter, and the huge number of coal-free days recorded since then. The UK reached a record stretch of consecutive 18 coal-free days earlier this year, which ended on 4 June. The electricity system reached a second record this week after racking up 1,838 coal-free hours for this year, breaking a record set across the whole of 2018 in a little over six months. The coal-free days have effectively prevented 5m tonnes of carbon dioxide from entering the atmosphere, or the equivalent of over 12bn miles driven in a car. Chris Skidmore MP, the interim energy minister, said coal is “fast becoming the fossil of our energy system and it will soon be consigned to the history books”. He added: “We’ve set in stone our commitment to end our contribution to climate change entirely by 2050 and this is yet another step on the path to becoming a net zero emissions economy.” By the end of the winter the UK will be left with only five remaining coal fired power plants, after SSE said last week it plans to shut its Fiddler’s Ferry plant near Warrington, Cheshire, next March. SSE revealed the closure after EDF Energy said it would shut its Cottam coal plant in September. The government plans to phase out all coal-fired power generation by 2025. National Grid is spending around £1.3bn a year to adapt the grid to run on renewable energy, and believes that it will be ready to manage a completely zero-carbon electricity grid within six years. “Do I expect that this will be a reality? No,” Pettigrew said. “But we won’t be a constraint in a low carbon world. We will be prepared to play our role.” Doug Parr, Greenpeace UK’s chief scientist, said the “watershed moment” is a sign that the UK is “broadly heading in the right direction”. “The question is, are we moving fast enough?” he said. Research undertaken by National Grid alongside its record forecast has found that “climate anxiety” is rising because people believe there is a lack of urgency in tackling the climate crisis. Nearly seven out of 10 people surveyed by National Grid are concerned about climate change and believe it is not being addressed urgently enough. More than a third of young people said their concerns about climate change would drive them to join a protest. Almost a fifth of 18- to 24-year-olds said they are prepared to skip school or work to do this, possibly inspired by student activist Greta Thurnberg who visited the UK earlier this summer. “As the climate emergency hits home right across the globe from Greenland’s melting ice to India’s scorching heatwave, the clock is ticking on our chances to avoid climate breakdown and public anxiety rightly remains high about the speed of change,” Parr said. “This is no time for ministers to pat themselves on the back and uncork the bubbly,” he said. • This article was amended on 24 June 2019 to clarify in the text that nuclear is not a renewable energy source, and to change the description of the non-fossil fuels that are growing in use to “cleaner”, as they are referred to by National Grid."

Share this...FacebookTwitterJust days ago I posted on a how veteran German Die Welt journalist Ulli Kulke was amazed at how supposedly one of the world’s best meteorological outfits, the Met Office of England, had botched 13 of  the last 14 annual forecasts. Read here.
Kulke accused the Met Office of “systematic false alarms”, saying they “refuse to accept the reality” of no warming and that it was “stunning” that they “never learn.”
Today Paul Homewood’s site features an article that focuses on the very competence of the Met Office Director asking: Can Slingo Get Anything Right? Homewood writes:
Last April, Julia Slingo told us that ‘climate change was loading the dice towards freezing, drier weather.’
Apparently, she actually meant milder, wetter weather.”
Benny Peiser at the Warming Policy Foundation site has just published a far more comprehensive list of botched Met Office predictions, the latest being the forecast for this winter:

Met Office winter forecast: For the December-January-February period as a whole there is a slight signal for below-average precipitation.“
Last summer the UK Spectator wrote a blistering piece that claimed the Met Office had “lost touch with reality” and that “ideology has corrupted a valuable British institution.” It adds:
Last year, it forecast a ‘drier than average’ spring — before another historic deluge that was accompanied by the coldest temperatures for 50 years. Never has the Met Office had more scientists and computing power at its disposal — yet never has it seemed so baffled by the British weather.
But there is no paradox. It is precisely the power of this technology in harnessing climate scientists’ assumptions about global warming that has scuppered the Met Office’s predictions — and made it a propagandist for global warming alarmism.”
Finally Tallbloke here writes that Met Office predictions on sea level rise are equally deplorable.

Warmest November since measurements began? An analysis of global satellite data leads to a different conclusion
By Dr. Sebastian Lüning and Prof Fritz Vahrenholt
On December 21, 2013 Spiegel Online reported:
Worldwide temperature record: Warmest November since measurements began. Warm air over Russia resulted in the warmest November since 1891. The entire year 2013 jumps upwards on the temperature ranking list. Is the pause in global warming over? […]  Germany on the other hand had an average November. Westerly winds were the rule and they brought more rain than normal to Central Europe, reported the German Weather Service. While in North Germany the sun shined more than average, as a whole in Germany it was grayer than normal for the time of year. In Australia, parts of North America and Greenland it was even unusually cool. Also Great Britain and Spain experienced lower than usual temperatures. Over the ocean a mean temperature of approx. 16.3°C was measured, that’s 0.54°C above average.
A new November temperature record? How wonderful. In times when the global average temperature refuses to rise and produces only negative headlines, they are now obviously resorting to monthly temperatures. And if the monthly temperatures don’t work out, then daily temperatures are taken: i.e. the hottest 4th of April since measurements began. The main thing is to produce headlines.
A series of problems with surface stations
But now it is known that there is a series of problems with the uneven distribution of surface stations over the globe. Thus it makes sense to compare the alleged November record with the satellite data, which are recorded evenly from every corner of the globe. The established satellite datasets are UAH and RSS. You can see them at the NOAA website. But horrors. Based on the satellite data, November 2013 is not a heat champion at all. When you look at the UAH data, November 2013 was only the ninth warmest. And when using RSS data, November 2013 landed only in 16th place. What a flop. The hot area over Russia also exists in the RSS and UAH data, but is less extreme (see comment on this at WUWT).

"Subscribe now to receive the morning briefing by email. Good morning, I’m Tim Walker with today’s essential stories. Iran says the Trump administration’s “outrageous and idiotic” decision to impose new sanctions on its supreme leader and eight senior military chiefs has permanently closed the door to diplomacy between Tehran and Washington. Iran’s president, Hassan Rouhani, said on Tuesday that the White House was “afflicted by mental retardation”. The US is also planning sanctions against Iran’s foreign minister, Javad Zarif, who negotiated the 2015 nuclear deal that Donald Trump has torn up. ‘Strong and proportionate.’ As he signed the executive order on Monday in the Oval Office, Trump said the “hard-hitting” sanctions were “a strong and proportionate response to Iran’s increasingly provocative actions”. Jared Kushner is expected to unveil his economic blueprint for peace in the Middle East at a conference in Bahrain on Tuesday, despite the fact that neither Israeli nor Palestinian officials will be present. Kushner’s so-called “peace to prosperity” plan calls for $50bn to be invested in the occupied territories and neighbouring countries, which Kushner claims would create a million jobs and double the size of the Palestinian economy. Vanity project. Without a workable political solution to the intractable Israeli-Palestinian conflict, the plan is seen as little more than a vanity project for the president’s son-in-law. Absent enemies. The Palestinians boycotted the Bahrain conference over the Trump administration’s unequivocal support for Israel, and a late decision was taken not to invite Israeli officials. Trump has said the New York advice columnist who accused him of sexually assaulting her in a department store dressing room two decades ago is “not my type”, as he denied the latest such allegations against him in an interview with the Hill. E Jean Carroll claimed the future president forced himself on her during their encounter at Manhattan’s Bergdorf Goodman store in 1995 or 1996, in an extract from her forthcoming book about the “hideous men” she has encountered in her life. Police complaint. Carroll has said she would consider working with police on a criminal investigation into the alleged attack, though the statute of limitations on such a complaint has already passed. George Soros, Abigail Disney, the Facebook co-founder Chris Hughes and more than a dozen other billionaires have called on the US government to tax extreme wealth in order to address inequality and provide funding for climate crisis initiatives and public health projects. In a letter addressed to all 2020 presidential candidates, the 19 signatories said: “America has a moral, ethical and economic responsibility to tax our wealth more.” Warren proposal. Senator Elizabeth Warren has proposed a “wealth tax” of 2% on fortunes of $50m or more, and a further 1% on assets over $1bn, which she estimates would affect 75,000 families and raise $2.75tn over 10 years. Sanders’ plan. Bernie Sanders has unveiled his plan to wipe out $1.6tn in student loan debt owed by 45 million Americans – and to pay for it through a tax on Wall Street. A UN human rights expert has warned that the world is sliding towards “climate apartheid”, whereby the rich pay to avoid the worst effects of the climate crisis, while others suffer extreme poverty, hunger and the decline of democracy. The US government has removed all but 30 of more than 300 migrant children from a border patrol facility in Texas, after reports that the young detainees were being held in “inhumane conditions” without adequate water, food or sanitation. A former Brazilian ambassador to the US has told the Guardian he is “disgusted” by his country’s foreign policy under its far-right president, Jair Bolsonaro, whose diplomatic chiefs represent a “lunatic fringe”. The British actor Dame Judi Dench has defended the work of her disgraced friends Harvey Weinstein and Kevin Spacey, despite condemning their alleged personal misconduct. “You cannot deny somebody a talent,” she told the Radio Times magazine. Stonewall at 50: why the gay bar remains as vital as ever Fifty years after New York’s Stonewall Inn became a symbol for LGBTQ activism, gay bars are declining in numbers across the US. Yet in some areas, particularly in less progressive states and communities, they remain a rallying point at times of both trial and celebration, as Dominic Rushe reports. Toxic America: the risk  chemicals  pose to children Today in our Toxic America series, we focus on the effects on children of the chemicals in our everyday life. Lauren Zanolli explains how to mitigate the risks to infants, while Emily Holden reports on concerns over chemicals in playgrounds, and Leonardo Trasande argues banning dangerous chemicals could save the US billions. How leftwing economists are transforming capitalism Since the 1970s, the left has changed how many people think about prejudice, personal identity and freedom, while surrendering economics to the right. But now, writes Andy Beckett, a transatlantic movement of leftwing economists is building a practical alternative to neoliberalism. The police endorsing violence and racism on Facebook The Plain View project has collated a database of more than 5,000 hateful, racist and Islamophobic messages posted by officers in eight US police departments – many of whom have been removed from active duty as a result. Adam Gabbatt speaks to the lawyer who launched the project. The Democratic presidential field will engage in four hours of televised debates this week. How much of that time will be devoted to questions on the climate emergency? Not nearly enough, says Kate Aronoff. When candidate Jay Inslee inquired about doing a special climate-themed debate, the DNC threatened to bar him and any other candidate who participated from the official primary debates. Why not dare them to try? The US will face their toughest Women’s World Cup test so far when they play France in the quarter-finals, after overcoming Spain 2-1 thanks to a pair of penalties. Also on Monday, Canada were knocked out by Sweden, while Fifa launched an investigation into Cameroon’s behaviour in their loss to England. Rafael Benítez is bowing out at Newcastle United after the club and its coach failed to reach an agreement on a new contract. Though held in great affection by fans, Benítez’s dealings with the club’s owner, Mike Ashley, had long been dysfunctional, as Louise Taylor reports.

By Frank Bosse and Fritz Vahrenholt
(Translated/edited by P Gosselin)
Currently solar activity is especially low. Solar sunspot number (SSN) in September was at 36.9, and thus was just 36% of the usual mean value 58 months into the cycle. The sun continues to remain in an unusually weak cycle 24, which was characterized by a 1-2 year delayed start in November 2008. The following graphic shows the mean value (blue) and the current cycle (red) and the very similar sunspot cycle SC5 (light gray) which occurred during the Dalton Minimum of the early 19th century:

 Dark blue shows average sunspot cycle; red shows current cycle 24 and light gray shows SC5. Horizontal axis is the number of months after the start of cycle.
Several publications suspect that the current cycle could have a double hump. Yet there are lots of indications that a second peak already occurred in April/May 2013. It’s possible that the maximum of SC24 is already behind us and that solar activity is now trending downward. It also appears that the magnetic field of the sun has also reversed. The comparisons between the documented cycles 1-24 is as follows:

 
Since SC 1 (1755-1766) until today the difference between the mean value and the observed monthly sunspot number is summed up. The diagram above shows up to SC24, and it shows that no cycle has been weaker since SC7 (1828). Here the Waldmeier discontinuity correction of 1945 was accounted for.
Since the end of the Dalton-Minimum 190 years ago, never has the sun in its last 7 years been so inactive 
Many people have been doing a lot of thinking about what the implications for the Earth may be. After all, the sun is practically the sole source of energy for our planet. At the top of our atmosphere it provides a gigantic 1365W/sqm. Here the solar radiation is distributed over a wide spectrum from infrared to gamma rays and we receive most of it within the visible light spectrum. And it is precisely this part that is hardly impacted by the solar activity fluctuations. The variation between a quiet sun and one of maximum activity is a mere 0.1%. That’s one reason we are still around. With more variation life on the planet very likely would not have been able develop over the 3 billion years our planet has existed.
All the frequencies within the solar radiation spectrum is what we call Total Solar Irradiance (TSI). In the past in climatology often only this magnitude was taken into consideration and the following conclusion was drawn: The sun cannot account for more than 0.1°K of temperature variation, whether it is active or inactive. This is the argument presented yet again by the latest 2013 IPCC Report. The radiative forcing is given as 0.05 watts per sqm. That is less than 2% of the anthropogenic radiative forcing (2.24 W/ m²).
But there is one massive argument against the IPCC’s view. During preindustrial times, the climate fluctuations in relationship between solar activity were observed to be much larger. Countless studies show this. Yet the IPCC obstinately sticks to its verdict that the impact of greenhouse gases has been the dominant force on climate since mankind has been adding greenhouse gases such as water vapor and CO2 into the atmosphere.  In 2007 in the previous IPCC report a warming rate of 0.2°C per decade was assumed should CO2 rise at a modest rate which indeed has been the case. Using the climatically relevant period of 30 years, global temperature thus should rise 0.6°C by 2030 compared to 2000. In the latest AR5 2013 report, an increase of 0.3 to 0.7°C is forecast for the period 2016 to 2035.
So where do we stand today 13 years after the start? The observed reality has deviated markedly from the prophecies since 2006. The following diagram depicts the monthly observations as to GISS, and its departure from the postulated 0.2°C warming per decade as well as a 60-month low pass.

Where did the heat go? In the deep ocean as some are trying to tell us? In the blog of Hans von Storch (Klimazwiebel) one finds a very telling chart produced by Eduardo Zorita. It shows foremost that winter temperatures of the northern Eurasian continent contributes the most to the observed deviation:

Source: Klimazwiebel
The winter temperatures in the northern hemisphere really don’t give much back to the oceans, rather it’s the land mass between 30 and 60° latitude north! Also the thermal energy amount in the sea down to 700m in the region of the extra-tropical northern hemisphere everywhere refuses to cooperate with the climate models, and shows having reached a peak value in 2007 and since then it has gone downwards:

 
Chart source: Climate explorer
The extra-tropical southern hemisphere shows very little change. There the thermal energy in the oceans increased slightly. How does this fit with the theory of greenhouse gas forcing or the escape of heat to the depths of the ocean below 700 meters? Could the sun be playing a major role?
A new study very well worth reading by Ermolli et al. (2013) looks at the influence of the spectral variation of solar radiation (SSI), especially the ultraviolet spectrum: It is fluctuating much more strongly, by up to 10% between a quiet and an active sun. And at low solar activity, it generates precisely the pattern in the wintertime that we’ve been seeing since 2006: The North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO), which impacts the temperature in the Eurasian region especially in the wintertime, is controlled and effected by the UV radiation of the sun. When there is less solar activity, it gets colder in the region. This is precisely what we are observing, and the large part of the deviation observed in the pure GHG models stems precisely from that. Shouldn’t this be a wake-up call for the climate scientists to look more closely at SSI? This should have been done long ago. However, that would have meant conceding that CO2 is not everything.
The new IPCC report squandered the opportunity to produce scenarios that include the large impact of the sun, which we know always played a major role in the past. The IPCC limits the sun’s impact to the TSI only and they estimate it to be close to zero: -0.1 to +0.1°C.
However, the longer the chasm grows between climate models and reality, and the longer the projected warming fails to materialize, the more the world of science will have to acknowledge the questions of natural variability, especially UV radiation.

Share this...FacebookTwitterGeorg Ehring of German Public Radio conducted an interview with climate scientist Professor Hans von Storch, Director of the German Coastal Research Center.
The introductory text before the interview reads as follows:
The Earth has warmed considerably less than expected over the past 15 years days, says Hans von Storch. That may be due to an unforeseeable climate variability, or that CO2’s effect as a greenhouse gas was over-estimated, so says the meteorologist of the Coastal Research Institute. 

If anything, this interview shows that German climate science is beginning a slow shift and that warmist scientists starting to come to terms with the real possibility that they have been wrong all these years – possibly very wrong. It also shows that they are admitting that climate is poorly understood. The science in nowhere near understood, let alone settled.
On whether global warming has stopped, Hans von Storch says: “No. We don’t expect that. But it is indeed true that we have seen a considerably reduced warming trend compared to what our climate model scenarios showed over the last 15 years. […] We definitely have seen less warming than we expected.”
On what the cause could be, von Storch says many candidates are possible, and it points to climate variability, which would be natural fluctuations, which is what skeptics have been saying from Day 1. He also says that perhaps the climate sensitivity of CO2 was perhaps “a bit over-estimated“. Hans von Storch even mentions the S-word, claiming that it could have something to do with the sun.
On whether or not it could be the oceans eating up the heat, von Storch says that it’s possible, and that “what is obvious here is that our climate models didn’t anticipate this“.

On if models can still be trusted? von Storch obstinately insists:
Yes, completely. […]. It could be that the climate models are completely okay and that nothing bad can be said about them. But we haven’t put all the ingredients which we believe are important for the future into them.”
A most peculiar statement. Bread without flour is not bread. A climate model that does not take a number of factors into account, or that does not weight them correctly, is not a model you can trust – period. Hans von Storch elaborates further, saying that aerosols and solar activity must be better taken into account (along with the ocean cycles he mentions above). What von Storch is trying to say here is that he and the climate scientists are completely stumped as to what’s wrong with the models.
Ehring then asks von Storch what is the most likely explanation for the warming stop? Hans von Storch answers that he can only rely on his instincts, and nothing more. He adds:
There are several hypotheses that have to be looked at in detail. Personally I wouldn’t be surprised if it indeed turns out to be natural climate variations being under-estimated. That is the climate fluctuates more than we assumed.”
He then adds that this would have “serious consequences” for the understanding of climate and that as a scientist, “one must always keep possibilities open and be ready, in the case of doubt, to accept that the data in the end do not exactly fit the earlier explanation. … Us climate scientists do have some reasons to summon the courage to critically have another look to see if we really did everything okay.”

Share this...FacebookTwitterI got an email from the head of an Ontario wind-turbine protest-group seeking information about wind power development in Germany.
Ontario, it appears, is poised to industrialize its landscape – thinking this will somehow lead to nicer weather. The head of the protest group wrote that the Ontario windpark promoters and lobbyists “are continually referring to Germany and their Energiewende and how successful their implementation of renewables is in that country.”
First off, the claim that the Energiewende in Germany has been successful is an outright lie, and it shows that Ontarian leaders haven’t done their homework on wind power and renewables. The German politicians and activists who spread that myth forgot to mention that 1) German power rates have skyrocketed due to the feed-in act, 2) industries are now threatening to leave, citing costly and unreliable energy supply, and 3) protests against windparks in Germany are becoming increasingly fierce as nobody wants them in their backyard anymore. Moreover, the outputs are far from what was promised. More than ever plans for new windparks are being forced offshore. But there too the technical problems, and thus profitability problems, are great.
So it shouldn’t come as a surprise that Germany is drastically scaling back its subsidies for renewable energies and windparks. Last year alone Germany saw a 55% plunge in solar investments, and over the last 2 years Germany’s solar manufacturing industry has been all but obliterated. So much for the green dream.
How has Germany been coping with its struggling Energiewende? Answer: they’ve been quietly bringing coal power plants back on line. Last year CO2 emissions climbed for the second year in a row. In a nutshell: Germany’s landscape has been littered with windparks and and solar panels, yet it’s burning more coal today than ever.
10H rule
With all the failure you’d think Germany would be reconsidering its Energiewende. It turns out that the country is doing precisely that.
For example in the idyllic German state of Bavaria, Minister President Horst Seehofer has put into place a 10H rule for new proposed windparks in order to protect citizens and their property. The 10H rule requires wind turbines to keep a minimum distance from of 10 times the turbine’s height from residential areas. For example, a 200-meter tall turbine would need to have a distance of 2000 meters from the nearest home. The result: it disqualifies most plans for new wind parks.

Seehofer says that while he wants to see wind turbines in the state, citizens have to be protected from them.
But the powerful wind lobby is howling in reaction: “The consequence will be the end of the Energiewende,” said Günter Beermann, Chairman of the state association for wind energy.”
The online Main Post here also writes:
The head of the Greens in the state parliament had even harsher words. Ludwig Hartmann from Landsberg: ‘With the 10H distance rule wind energy in Bavaria is dead. […] If wind energy cannot find a home in Bavaria, then the Energiewende in Bavaria will not function.’ The environment expert is calling for sticking to the plan of expanding wind turbines in Bavaria to 1500. Currently there are 600. Minister president Seehofer has distanced himself from the expansion target. ‘I assume that the number will be considerably less with our new concept,’ he told the Süddeutsche Zeitung.”
The oxygen for the wind industry is getting fatally thin in Southern Germany. And even if Seehofer should fail to uphold his 10H rule, then chances will still remain bleak for the wind industry in Bavaria. This is due in large part to the considerable technical and economic shortcomings of onshore wind power. The Main Post writes:
Behind this there is the question of how much wind is there at a location and how profitably can a turbine operate. The rule of thumb: Wind turbines at the coast can produce about 100 percent, wind turbines offshore out in the open sea about 140 percent, wind turbines inland however only about 70 to 80 percent. Which wind turbines are to get subsidized in the future remains the decision of the federal government. Should the limit be set at 80%, then wind energy in Bavaria no longer has a chance. On that experts of the CSU and the opposition both agree.”
And in an interview with the Neue Energie magazine here, German federal parliamentarian Josef Göppel said:
If the pincer movement using the rule with minimum distance of ten times the turbine’s height and minimum performance of 75% gets used, then there will be no chance left for wind power in Southern Germany.”

"We are qualified medical doctors united by our distress at the minimal response to looming environmental disaster. We sympathise with current widespread protest, notably by children who will be most affected. We urge government and media to respond immediately and proportionately. As caring professionals we cannot countenance current policies that push the world’s most vulnerable towards environmental catastrophe. We are particularly alarmed by the effects of rising temperatures on health and heed predictions of societal collapse and consequent mass migration. Such collapse risks damage to physical and mental health on an unprecedented scale.  Present policies and responses are woefully inadequate. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change warns that we have only 11 years to halve global emissions to meet their 1.5C target, yet last year our global emissions rose yet again. It will be a massive task to avoid catastrophic warming and we need radical action now. Our unchecked consumption, dependence on fossil fuels and decimation of ecosystems continue. The diagnosis is clear and the treatment urgent. Yet politicians prevaricate and global emissions still rise. Governments abrogate their responsibility when pursuing grossly inadequate policies that risk environmental collapse. Non-violent direct action then becomes the reasonable choice for responsible individuals. We support the following key demands, which parallel those made by Extinction Rebellion: • governments and media should be honest about the challenges and urgency of tackling ecological disaster; • governments should effect carbon neutrality within the IPCC timeframe; • governments should establish and be led by Citizens’ Assemblies to enable climate and ecological justice.

Share this...FacebookTwitterLast Thursday evening and yesterday winter made its debut in Southern Germany and Austria  – and how! Read more here.
German RTL television last night here (starting at 4:30) called it the “most severe start of winter in 200 years!“, saying many meteorologists were caught by surprise. Up to half a meter of snow fell at some locations.
Gone are the mild winters of the sort Europe seen in the 1990s and early 2000s. Indeed for central Europe the last 5 consecutive winters have all been colder than normal – a record!
Municipalities ignoring forecasts of warm winters
These days are blockbuster times for German road salt manufacturers. In Europe municipalities have learned their lesson: ignore foolish predictions of warm winters, order huge quantities of salt, and do it early!
Municipalities and road commissioners were once led astray by climatologists’ predictions of increasingly warmer winters and led to thinking that these had become a thing of the past due to global warming (recall famous words of David Viner and Mojib Latif). One major daily even proclaimed that spring would arrive in January!
As a consequence of these false global warming predictions, municipalities unwisely kept much smaller stocks of road salt for expected shorter and milder winters. Road commissioners saw little reason to keep thousands of tons of road salt in stock.
Then beginning in 2009 came one harsh winter after another. Road maintenance crews and commissioners were caught red-faced. Suddenly municipalities were running out of salt by January and were even no longer able to keep the most vital traffic arteries cleared. Traffic chaos ensued and motorists were left to fend for themselves. Municipalities were stunned and left scratching their heads. Weather-wise the exact opposite of what climatologists had predicted had taken place. They learned the hard way. Now they are no longer heeding the foolish forecasts of warm winters.

Not surprisingly, many of the very same climatologists have since changed their tune and are now suddenly predicting cold, bitter winters for Europe….because of global warming!
German public radio SWR here reports that this year municipalities and road commissioners are stocking up on road salt:
The Salzwerke AG in Heilbronn said that municipalities had ordered large quantities of road salt. […] Over the past years road salt had often been in short supply in some municipalities because the cold periods lasted longer and longer than expected.”
The online daily Märkische Allgemeine Zeitung here reports that the city is now building up its stock of road salt, writing:
In the last season 2012/2013 about 90,000 tonnes of road salt were used. Because of the long and harsh winter considerably more than normal was used, said Mitschka. road salt had to be continuously re-ordered.
In 2010/2011 there were delivery bottlenecks. Even the autobahns in Brandenburg could not be adequately salted at the time.”

"I heard some young activists chanting, “Fuck you, CO2” at the school climate strike on 24 May. It wasn’t the most profane chant I heard that day – there were a lot about politicians. But it worked well: it was short, strong – and kids just like swearing, don’t they? So I didn’t come up with this: I nicked it from the air. But by getting it down on paper, I’m giving it more life. I can imagine people putting it in a window at home, like a party-political poster. In 2017, I did something similar with Theresa May’s words in my poster Strong And Stable My Arse [which was posted around London]. Her repetition of the phrase gave it its power. I just took it and turned it into a poster.  My other artwork for Guardian Weekend magazine – I Should Be So Lucky – was inspired by Kylie Minogue. But we should all be worried about our declining bee populations. We assume the planet will be destroyed by an apocalypse or a big weather event, but actually the death of insects will kill us. People seem to care more about the plight of pandas than everyday creatures such as ants and bees. But that’s a distraction, a magic trick. I worked closely on these with the graphic designer Fraser Muggeridge – it’s a real collaboration. He does all my books and clothing, including my Fuck Brexit T-shirts, and helped produce these covers. He works more like an artist than a designer. He just gets it. How do you make a political statement while still making art? It’s a huge question, but I don’t worry about defining my work. I came up with some slogans and put them down on paper, that’s all. Art is just one ingredient in the stew – it can help visualise and clarify a political message, but it can’t change the world on its own. Like music, or humour, it attracts people to a cause; it seduces them. I’ve been really impressed by the way Extinction Rebellion has utilised graphics and art so well. It has a strong logo, a consistent message, even a style sheet – it’s organised. There are a lot of groups in this area, but no one else has branded itself so well. It uses symbols, some of them ancient, that we all understand: bees, skulls, smiley faces. The public is more or less sympathetic to their aims, and that wouldn’t have been the case even five years ago. Things have moved on. My cover is a drawing made from sunlight. It’s generated by a Little Sun lantern, a portable, solar-powered lamp in the shape of a sunflower that my studio launched in 2012. We wanted to help people living without electricity, mainly in sub-Saharan Africa. Every lamp replaces one that uses paraffin or petroleum, and we’ve already distributed 600,000. That’s a lot of unused oil. To create the work, I set a camera to a long exposure, turned off other lights and danced with the lantern. It’s a visual record of my movement. This ties in with my show at Tate Modern in London, where Little Sun will be part of the exhibition. As an artist, I’m curious about how we turn data – hard facts – about the climate emergency into something tangible. Data doesn’t deal in feelings or emotions, and we need those to engage people, to encourage them to act. Art and culture can give language to things that are hard to articulate. Data is often rooted in fear, whereas art is positive – it can inspire us. I’ve always been interested in how we experience nature. When I did The Weather Project for Tate Modern in 2003 [Eliasson hung a giant sun in the gallery’s Turbine Hall], we knew far less than we do today about the climate crisis. With Ice Watch last year [when Eliasson placed chunks of ice that had broken away from the Greenland ice sheet around London, including outside Tate Modern], the aim was to put people in direct contact with the effects of rising temperatures. By touching, feeling, even hugging the ice, they had a more emotional response. Extinction Rebellion activists staged a “die-in” on the same spot in April, to highlight the decline in the bee population. I love that the public is owning these spaces.  Artists need to look at themselves, too, not just the topics we address. I’m constantly working on how to make my studio in Berlin greener, to reduce its footprint, to reduce my travel, to review my shipping methods. There’s an assumption that we have to wait for others – leaders, politicians – to act, but that’s a mistake: we all have this power. We must unite and become a movement. What response to my Weekend cover do I hope for? That people think about our sun, its power. Can art lead to actual change? Yes – it participates in the larger political debate. It combines our memories with our expectations of the future. • Olafur Eliasson: In Real Life is at Tate Modern from 11 July-5 January 2020. Little Sun solar lamps are for sale at the Tate shop The text on this artwork is a call to action. It comes from a frustration at the apathy surrounding the climate crisis – and I include myself in that. We understand and can articulate what the issues are, we feel strongly about them – yet still we don’t act. I write down lots of ideas, then play around with them. I think about how I would feel reading them. I consider the meaning, whether the message is obvious, direct or too obtuse. I try not to be too hostile. This piece grew from an exhibition I did in 2017 called Shouting In Whispers, which was about the choices we make, collectively and individually, in moments of crisis. It featured five monochrome prints like this – different texts on a rich background colour. The teal colour I’ve used is significant: green, representing the natural world, would have been too obvious, as would blue, which depicts the sea, the sky. Teal is neither one nor the other; it’s deliberately murky. It’s also a calming colour: if you’re trying to say something challenging, the colour has to play a part in the delivery. Red would have been too urgent. This is the first time I’ve directly addressed the climate crisis in my work. As an individual, I do the things many people do: I recycle, I don’t use plastic bags, I think about whether I need to fly. But there are other things that are just part of my life, too: I don’t eat meat, I don’t have children.  Art is incredibly subjective, but I like any art that makes me think. It’s a way of asking questions and of opening up a conversation. I’m passionate about it reaching as wide an audience as possible, whether that’s through a film or a magazine. I like galleries, but they need to be opened up. Being shortlisted for this year’s Turner prize has been incredibly exciting, and an opportunity I don’t want to waste. When it works well, art is transformative – even if you hate it. • Helen Cammock: Che si può fare is at the Whitechapel Gallery, London, until 1 September; the Turner prize 2019 is at Turner Contemporary in Margate from 28 September-12 January 2020. This feature appears in the climate issue of Weekend magazine on Saturday 29 June.

"A climate change protest orchestrated by the Extinction Rebellion activist group briefly blocked Eighth Avenue in New York on Saturday afternoon, between the Port Authority transit hub and the home of the New York Times. The New York police department (NYPD) said 70 people were arrested as they called for more effective media coverage of the dangers of climate change, in a dramatic demonstration that saw people stage a die-in in front of the newspaper building and disrupt traffic in midtown Manhattan.  Two demonstrators scaled the front of the Port Authority building, which houses a major bus terminal and subway interchange, to hang a protest banner. Protesters also climbed on to the canopy outside the Times headquarters and unfurled a banner that encouraged the use of the phrase “climate emergency” instead of “climate change”. One protester, Donna Nicolino, told the Guardian she was ready to be arrested, because “we want the New York Times as well as all the other media to treat climate change as the crisis it is”. She joined a line of people with arms linked on West 40th Street and Eighth Avenue, blocking the road. The group remained until they were arrested by New York City police officers. “The lack of coverage of the climate crisis is completely unacceptable,” said Becca Trabin, a member of Extinction Rebellion’s press and fundraising teams. “It’s a public safety crisis on a global scale.” New sign encourages the Times to use the same style for climate change as the Guardian does: climate emergency https://t.co/WiOrDJm8ny pic.twitter.com/imxWtPFjM5 Trabin said that though it might not be convenient to report on, read about and discuss climate change every day, it should nonetheless be a media priority. “No one wants to hear about the climate crisis every day but if we don’t read about it every day we endanger ourselves,” she said. A spokeswoman for the New York Times, Danielle Rhoades Ha, said that in 2018 the newspaper published 795 articles about the climate, including investigative stories and dispatches from across the globe about the impact of climate change. “There is no national news organization that devotes more time, staff or resources to producing deeply reported coverage to help readers understand climate change than The New York Times,” Rhoades Ha said. “We fully support this group’s right to express their point of view, even when we disagree with it as it relates to our coverage.” For nearly an hour, the block outside the Times building was crowded with demonstrators, onlookers and NYPD officers. A police recording repeated a warning that anyone who did not clear the street would be arrested. A helicopter flew overhead. “Seas are rising and so are we,” chanted one group of demonstrators on the sidewalk, where surprised tourists, workers and bystanders asked for more information. The block remained closed after the demonstration ended as police officers processed the arrest of several demonstrators, including two who had rappelled down the face of Port Authority to hang a sign. Passersby stopped police to ask if a movie was being shot or if there had been a terrorist attack."

Share this...FacebookTwitterUlli Kulke, veteran journalist at Germany’s flagship daily Die Welt, writes at his Die Welt blog that “scientists from Potsdam not long ago were talking about a global temperature increase of four, five or even more degrees Celsius.” But with the recent news leaking out about the upcoming IPCC AR5, that scenario is looking more like fantasy than ever.
If the reports leaking out are accurate, then it appears that, Kulke writes, “the alarmists are backpedaling and one could roughly sum it all up as follows: Nothing is even half as bad.” Reports of exaggerated CO2 climate sensitivity are now filtering through even in Germany and it’s becoming increasingly obvious even to Europeans that the whole issue had been grossly exaggerated.
Kulke writes that he already mentioned recently that the IPCC had significantly scaled back CO2 climate sensitivity in its first draft of the upcoming report. “The way it appears now the IPCC has in the last few days once again scaled back its estimates in the updated drafts and has conceded stark errors in the past report.” Here Kulke cites the Wall Street Journal, the Daily Telegraph, the Mail on Sunday and The Australian.
Kulke continues:
Moreover, they expressly bring up the pause in global warming – and also admit that they cannot explain it and that the computer models, which the IPCC relies on, failed to predict it.”
Nobody knows what the final draft is going to look like. But the IPCC will have to ultimately decide whether to bring up these inconvenient, even embarrassing, facts. Failure to do so would cost the IPCC as a scientific body a lot of respect, of which it is already very low on. On the other hand bringing the glaring shortfalls will make the IPCC appear as prone to error and cost it credibility.

Mann’s flawed hockey stick discarded for good
Kulke also writes that the Medieval Warm Period has reappeared in the latest draft, thus disposing once and for all of Michael Mann’s infamous hockey stick chart.
Not long ago it was inconceivable, but apparently the IPCC is now admitting that during the years between 950 and 1250, i.e. the Middles Ages, most parts of the world were just as warm as they are today. That is during a time when CO2 values in the atmosphere where only a fraction of what they are today.”
Kulke believes that the IPCC’s claims of high certainty on the question of man’s impact on the climate through greenhouse gases will have no impact because “very few scientists have doubts on this“. The real question remains: How big is that impact?
The answer appears to be growing smaller with each passing day.

Share this...FacebookTwitterThe high costs of wind power apparently are getting to be too much to take for even the wind-turbine-hugging Danes!
Denmark’s online Borsen here quotes the country’s famous Jyllands-Posten concerning the souring acceptance of wind parks in the Nordic country and the growing discontent with regards to the astronomical wind power prices.
Hat-tip: a reader by e-mail.
According to the reports, Danish Climate and Energy Minister Rasmus Petersen “plans to scrap future offshore Wind Power projects” and wants “the price reduced for electric power produced at off-shore wind parks. Otherwise, the minister is ready to drop future projects.”
According to the Jyllands-Posten, the minister said:
“I am unhappy that the price of power from the Anholt offshore wind farm is so high. I think paying 1.05 kroner per kilowatt-hour (kWh) is too much,” he told the newspaper.”

Borse writes:
New projects can be dropped.
The current market price for electricity is DKK 0.25. This means that the Anholt offshore wind farm is costing companies and Danish electricity customers 1.3 billion DKK in green electricity charges annually.
The Minister thus told Jyllands-Posten that he is ready to drop the two large-scale offshore wind turbine projects Horns Rev 3 and Krieger’s Flak with a total capacity of 1000 MW.
In comparison, the Anholt offshore wind farm produces has a capacity of 400 MW and is the largest Danish offshore wind farm.”

"Theresa May is to pledge that Britain’s aid budget will in future be spent in a more environmentally sustainable way and tell her G20 counterparts: “We are the last generation of leaders with the power to limit global warming.” The prime minister has been keen to burnish her green credentials as she enters in her final days in office. Fresh from announcing a new target of net zero carbon emissions by 2050 – in the face of scepticism from the chancellor, Philip Hammond – May will lead a session on the climate emergency at the summit in Japan.  She will promise that in future, the £14bn overseas aid budget will be spent in a way that contributes to the transition to a low-carbon global economy, and will urge other countries to adopt more ambitious emissions targets. “The facts, which are clear, should guide us,” she will tell her fellow world leaders, including Donald Trump, who has denied many climate science findings. “We are running out of time to act. We need a fivefold increase on existing 2030 commitments to remain below 1.5 degrees of warming. “In addition to stronger national commitments, we need determined implementation, and a change in how we invest. And we need to build resilience, both in our own societies and economies, and in the most vulnerable countries. I urge everyone here to push for ambition and consider setting their own net zero targets.” En route to Osaka, May said she had been inspired to take more action to tackle the climate crisis in part by noticing the changes in the environment on her Swiss walking holidays with her husband, Philip. Formed in 1999, the G20 is a group featuring 19 of the world's largest economic powers and the European Union. It was formed in the wake of financial crises in the late 90s, with a view to providing some governance for the global economy. Since 2008 it has held an annual leaders' summit. The 19 countries who are members are Argentina, Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, France, Germany, India, Indonesia, Italy, Japan, Mexico, Russia, Saudi Arabia, South Africa, South Korea, Turkey, United Kingdom and the United States. Collectively the members of the G20 account for about 90% of the world's GDP. As well as the 19 countries plus the EU, also attending the meetings are representatives of several permanent guests, including the African Union, International Monetary Fund, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), United Nations and the World Trade Organization. Critics argue that it is too exclusive, and the format locks a significant number of large countries out of high-level discussions on the global economy.  “Philip and I go walking, not just in Wales but also in Switzerland, and there’s a particular place we go to where over the last decade you can see the glacier retreating quickly – and this has brought home to me the importance of climate change,” she said. On Saturday, May will also reiterate the government’s offer to host COP26, the next UN climate summit. The talks are due to be held in November 2020, but no venue has been confirmed, with the UK making a joint bid with the Italian government. The summit is expected to be attended by about 30,000 delegates, including up to 150 world leaders. Turkey is also bidding to host it. In reshaping its aid spending, Britain will be following the lead of multilateral donors in placing more emphasis on tackling the climate emergency. The World Bank recently announced it would spend $50bn (£39bn) over the next five years on helping developing countries to adapt to the climate crisis. Tim Wainwright, the chief executive of the charity WaterAid, said: “It is encouraging to see the UK government recognise that all investment must be resilient against the growing number of severe droughts, flooding and storms that threaten health and livelihoods. “The poorest communities are being hit hardest by climate change and they are paying for it increasingly through negative impacts on clean and safe water supplies. These communities are the least resilient to climate events and must be prioritised. Without this, the significant development gains made over the last few decades will be rolled back, leaving hundreds of millions more people without the basic services of clean water, decent toilets and good hygiene.” Rachel Kennerley, climate campaigner at Friends of the Earth, said: “These commitments are good in the abstract sense, but the test is always in the delivery. When talk turns to infrastructure you have to question the government further, when they start saying ‘green this and green that’ they usually mean gas. There is just no room for further fossil fuel extraction anywhere in the world in a strategy compatible with stopping climate breakdown.” May’s most likely successor, Boris Johnson, has previously questioned the existence of the climate crisis. As recently as 2015, he said: “Global leaders were driven by a primitive fear that the present ambient warm weather is somehow caused by humanity; and that fear – as far as I understand the science – is equally without foundation.” In another last-minute commitment before she leaves Downing Street, after promises on mental health and housing, May will announce that the UK will allocate £1.4bn of Britain’s aid budget over the next three years to the Global Fund to fight HIV/Aids, TB and malaria. The Global Fund is a collaboration between governments, charities and the private sector that invests in projects in more than 100 countries. “We need urgent international action and a truly collective response if we are to tackle threats to global health security, prevent infections spreading across borders, and halt the continued spread of deadly diseases,” May is expected to say. Bill Gates, the co-chair of the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, said: “Infections and deaths from diseases like Aids, tuberculosis, malaria, rotavirus and pneumonia have declined more than anyone thought possible 20 years ago. Much of this progress is owed to the funding and health products provided by organisations like the Global Fund, which the UK helped create, and Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance. “But the job is not yet finished, and continued progress is not guaranteed. Today’s commitment by the people of the UK via the Global Fund is a positive step forward in the global fight against these diseases, and will help to save millions of lives.” Johnson has backed the government’s commitment to spend 0.7% of national income each year on overseas aid but he has called for it to be spent in a way that helps British businesses abroad. During a Conservative party leadership hustings event in Exeter on Friday, he again backed the aid budget. “I know that people say we shouldn’t be spending so much on overseas aid,” he said. “I think some of it probably could be much, much better spent, spent delivering British commercial and political objectives, but it delivers massive results around the world, and we should be very, very proud of the good the UK does. “I think it would be a very sad day if we were being seen to retreat from our global engagement. That is not what Brexit is about, is it?”"
"Thirteen journalists who were investigating damage to the environment have been killed in recent years and many more are suffering violence, harassment, intimidation and lawsuits, according to a study. The Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ), which produced the tally, is investigating a further 16 deaths over the last decade. It says the number of murders may be as high as 29, making this field of journalism one of the most dangerous after war reporting. On every continent reporters have been attacked for investigating concerns about abuses related to the impact of corporate and political interests scrambling to extract wealth from the earth’s remaining natural resources. These resources end up in all manner of products – from mobile phones to pots and pans – with consumers largely unaware of the stories behind them. The study was produced for Green Blood, a reporting project whose aim is to continue the reporting of local environmental journalists who have been forced to abandon their work. Led by Forbidden Stories, a group of 15 media partners, including the Guardian, El País and Le Monde, have come together to shine an international light on the way these activities affect local environments and communities. Last year, the consortium published an investigation into the murder of Daphne Caruana Galizia. The latest project comes amid repeated warnings of an environmental emergency caused by climate change, which further increases the pressure on already scarce resources. “Environmental issues involve some of the greatest abuses of power in the world and some of the greatest of concentrations of power in the world,” said Bruce Shapiro, the director of the Dart Center for Journalism and Trauma. “I’m hard put to think of a category of investigative reporters who are routinely dealing with more dangerous actors. Investigative reporting on the environment can be as dangerous a beat as reporting on narco smuggling.” The CPJ executive director, Joel Simon, added: “Reporting such stories for national and international media often involves travelling to remote communities and confronting powerful interests. This makes it inherently dangerous. “This is not a new issue, but it has become more acute as climate change has accelerated and environmental change more directly impacts people’s lives. I don’t see that changing any time soon, which is why it is so important to report on environmental issues despite the risk.” Green Blood has focused on the mining industry, with reports from different countries starting on Tuesday. While the journalists identified by CPJ have not been killed in the chosen areas, the behaviour of the police and state security forces has deterred reporters from raising the concerns of local people, meaning there can be an effective news blackout. Over eight months, the Green Blood partners worked with local reporters to gather documents and witness accounts and conduct scientific tests to identify pollution. The first investigation concerns a Tanzanian mine where journalists trying to investigate its activities and relationships found themselves harassed and their stories spiked following pressure from police and state authorities. Reporters have lost their jobs and two newspapers were shut down. The allegations concern villagers being displaced and shot dead by police and security guards. A number of women have spoken of being raped by guards. The second report features a nickel mine. Global demand for this mineral is high because it is used in stainless steel cookware and surgical instruments. Its value is expected to rise exponentially because of its use in eco-friendly electric cars, helping push up prices for all nickel producers. However, hundreds of indigenous Mayan families are paying a high price for its production in Guatemala. They have complained of evictions, criminal prosecutions and water shortages. Reporters raising the alarm have been held under house arrest and forced into hiding to avoid prison. The consortium has also been to south India, where sand mining is a multibillion-dollar industry. Minerals removed from beaches are used in everything from cosmetics to robotics. India is one of the most dangerous places to be a journalist – three of the 13 identified as having been killed in the course of their work since 2009 were from the country. Three more were based in the Philippines. The others died in Panama, Colombia, Russia, Cambodia, Myanmar, Thailand and Indonesia. Ramesh Bhushal, project manager with the organisation Earth Journalism, said menaces kept vital information hidden from the public. “What happens is that the journalists are discouraged from writing about those serious issues, and they end up writing about other issues that are easier to cover and they don’t get threats for.” Tanzania has slipped 25 places on the World Press Freedom Index produced by Reporters Without Borders (RSF), where it ranks 118th out of 179 countries. “Journalists [in Tanzania] are attacked without reason,” Ryan Powell, a media development specialist working in east and west Africa, told Forbidden Stories. “Police will harass journalists, and people do not interfere.” In south and central America, indigenous reporters are particularly at risk. Guatemala is 116th in the RSF index. Its president, Jimmy Morales, elected in 2016, made a commitment to introduce a national mechanism for the protection of the media soon after winning power, but the initiative has yet to be endorsed by the ministry of the interior."

Share this...FacebookTwitterRetired German meteorologist Klaus-Eckart Puls has written an analysis at the European Institute for Climate and Energy (EIKE) website here. He concludes:
Old and new measurement data show that sea level rise has decelerated.”
The article is a bit long and so I’ll focus on the main results only.
North Sea rise stagnates
First he discusses a 2013 study by T. Wahl, et al.: “Observed mean sea level changes around the North Sea coastline from 1800 to present”; Earth-Science Reviews; Volume 124, September 2013, Pages 51, which examined 30 North Sea tide gauges, of which some of them go back up to 200 years and most of them 100 years. The results:

Source: T. Wahl, et al.
The Wahl paper writes:
In summary the long term trends in the North Sea are not significantly different from global sea level trends, while the inter-annual and decadal variability are much bigger in the North Sea and hardly comparable to those derived from the global sea level reconstruction considered here.
The recent rates of sea level rise (i.e. over the last two to three decades) are high compared to the long-term average, but are comparable to those which have been observed at other times in the late 19th and 20th century.”
Puls concludes: “There are variations, but no acceleration on a 100-year scale!!!”
Sea level rise at the German bight
Puls then examines data from the German bight. The results are depicted by the following graphic:

Evaluation of coastal tide gauges at the German bight: “No acceleration!” Data: Albrecht, F., T. Wahl, J. Jensen and R.Weisse (2011).
Puls’s conclusion: “The data going back in part over the last 160 years show no acceleration in sea level rise. Rather there is a slight weakening as the polynomial indicates.”
Global sea level rise slowing down
Although variations at the North Sea are greater than those of global sea level, Puls writes that the overall trend is practically the same. He provides a graphic of the data taken by satellite:

Evaluation of satellite altimetry – data source: http://sealevel.colorado.edu/
Puls writes: “Even over the two most recent decades no acceleration can be detected, rather there is a weakening.”
Meteorolgist Puls then summarizes the results of the GRACE data for the last 9 nine years: “Only 1,7 mm per year.”
The EIKE article then looks at the “grotesque” discrepancy between satellite data and tide gauge data, and that to this day there is still no reasonable explanation for it. One thing is sure: the collection of tide gauges doesn’t lie.
Puls concludes
The constant stream of alarm reports of supposedly dramatic sea level rise at present and in the future cannot be confirmed by observations. Rather, the data as a whole contradict it. Worldwide neither tide gauges nor satellite data indicate an acceleration in sea level rise. Rather they show a weakening. There is a glaring contradiction between earlier and current statements from a number of institutes, climate models and the IPCC. Moreover there are strong indications that the satellite data showing higher values were “over-corrected”.

Almost every energy policy that Europe has imposed on its citizens here is in the process of being or about to be exported to the USA. The USA is a little behind on this because of the “unsophisticated cowboys” and “climate deniers” resisting it.
For example many places are already forcing Germany’s renewable energy feed-in model. Never mind that Germans every year are paying more than 25 billion dollars for electricity that has only 2.5 billion dollars value on the market and that the system in Germany has become an abject failure. The power grid has lost its once impeccable stability.
It’s not my intention to be the bearer of bad news, but unless Americans wake up from their apathy and send a clear and loud rejection, they are going to wake up one morning soon and realize that the government has taken control of private life. Having lived in Europe for a number of years, and observing from a distance, I’m amazed at how fast this is happening. Next on the agenda is what we eat.
The time is approaching for Declaration of Independence 2.0.
This time it needs to be sent to Washington.

"At the end of a week in which the Trump administration rolled back Barack Obama’s Clean Power Plan, Mike Pence declined repeated invitations to say the human-induced climate crisis is a threat to US national security.  “What I will tell you is that we will always follow the science on that in this administration,” the vice-president said, in answer to CNN State of the Union host Jake Tapper’s first posing of the question. Tapper responded: “The science says it is.” Pence said: “But what we won’t do, and the Clean Power Plan was all about that, was hamstringing energy in this country, raising the cost of utility rates for working families across this country.” Tapper interjected: “But is it a threat?” Pence did not answer the interjection, complaining instead that “other nations like China and India absolutely do nothing or make illusory promises decades down the road”. He also praised US focus on natural gas and “clean coal technology”. Tapper persevered: “But is what people are calling a climate emergency, is it a threat? Do you think it is a threat, manmade climate emergency is a threat?” Pence said: “I think the answer to [that] is going to be based upon the science.” Tapper insisted “the science says yes” and told the vice-president “the science community in your own administration, at [the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration] at the [Director of National Intelligence], they all say it is a threat … but you won’t, for some reason.” “Look,” said Pence. “What the president has said, what we have said is that we’re not going to raise utility rates.” Tapper persisted: “But is it not a threat?” Pence criticised the Clean Power Plan, the Obama-era rule which the Environmental Protection Agency rolled back on Wednesday, thereby relaxing controls on carbon dioxide admissions from coal-fired power stations. He also took aim at the Green New Deal, a package of proposed legislation which Democrats including the prominent New York progressive Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez say would boost the US economy while working to reduce the effects of the climate crisis but which Republicans say would be financially ruinous. Tapper tried once more: “OK. So you don’t think it is a threat, is all I’m saying? You don’t think it is a threat?” Pence said: “I think we’re making great progress reducing carbon emissions. America has the cleanest air and water in the world...” Tapper interrupted, laughing: “That is not true. We don’t have the cleanest air and water in the world. We don’t.” Pence said: “OK.” Tapper asked him to “get back to me with some statistics that show it”. Pence could have reached for the Environmental Performance Index, a joint initiative of Yale and Columbia universities and the World Economic Forum which does in fact rank the US joint-first in the world on drinking water. However, it also places America 10th in the world for air quality and 29th for water and sanitation combined. Pence insisted the Trump administration was “making progress on reducing carbon emissions. We’re doing it through technology, through natural gas, through continuing to support … nuclear energy, clean energy. “The answer, though, is not to raise the utility rates of millions of utility rate payers across the country.” Tapper finally gave up, and asked about Russian election interference instead."

Share this...FacebookTwitterUPDATED: Joe has contacted me and I’ve added a correction concerning the AMO-hurricane connection, which I misinterpreted from the video. See his comment below after my post.
=====================================
Veteran meteorologist Joe Bastardi presents lots of interesting background information on hurricanes in his newest Saturday Summary, reminding viewers that they were much worse back in the middle of the 20th century than they are today. But now we are (again) in a setup where we may see some harsh hurricanes as we did in the 1950s – see 11:50 mark.
Arctic melt grinds to a halt
Also interesting is the part at the end (12:30) about the upcoming Arctic ice melt season. Surprise! The latest NCEP forecast for the summer melt continues showing a positive anomaly, flying in the face of predictions of a disappearing Arctic ice.

Image cropped from: Weatherbell Saturday Summary
Joe believes the Arctic will be returning to normal by 2030, maybe even sooner, thanks to the seemingly approaching cold phase of the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation (AMO) where we see the start of the transitional phase beginning.
Warmists’s arguments melting away

With Antarctic sea ice near record high levels and Arctic sea ice starting its rebound, the Arctic death spiral” argument so often used by the warmists is on the verge of a complete meltdown.
With the polar ice cap argument disappearing and the observed lack of warming for almost two decades, it will be interesting to watch what tactics the global warming crowd will be resorting to in the future. Expect to see them push lots of weather horror stories…future scenarios generated by hocus-pocus computer models cooked up from “renowned” institutes. when reality doesn’t cooperate, then fantasy is all that’s left.
============================
Joe has sent me a comment providing more information about the AMO, etc:
The latter stages of the warm AMO, when cooling starts in the North Atlantic, is when the warmest water is near the coast. This is not the cool AMO, rather it’s the transitional phase that is starting now. At the end of the warm AMO, the warmest water is near the east coast, just as we saw in the 1950s. By the 1960s the expanding pool of colder water, and the end of the last Arctic ice melt of the 1950s, were taking over. That then proceeded to have ice at high levels through the early 1990s. But as soon as the AMO flipped, the Arctic ice decreased.
The linkage is this: The jamming of the warmest water up near the east coast in the waning stages of the warm AMO (example the 1950s) heightens the east coast threat, and is a sign the cold AMO is around the corner, and with it the end of the scam.
It should be obvious now…one season of cooling and the summer ice melt will be weakest since the end of the cold AMO. The cold AMO is not the reason for increased east coast hurricanes. It’s the end game of the warm AMO that is telegraphing the coming cold. Look at the classic signature of the warm AMO 1997-2013 and you notice the water has been slightly cooler near the east coast, opposite the cold AMO signature of 1981-1996. The end game, when water starts to cool in the north Atlantic (and ice increases as we are seeing) has the warmest water jammed near the east coast. Please read http://patriotpost.us/opinion/26136
The set up now is the sign it’s about to end and with it the reversal. CO2 has NOTHING TO DO WITH IT, which is what they will claim in spite of science and history showing that is not the case.

Share this...FacebookTwitterProven by thousands of temperature datasets, the earth’s climate fluctuated cyclically in the past, and there’s an overwhelming body of evidence showing a close correlation with solar activity and other powerful natural factors. If the IPCC had truly examined past temperature developments and compared them to solar data, they’d have seen there is something remarkable there.
Yet in the IPCC AR5, Working Group 1 takes only a cursory look at solar activity and its possible impacts on climate in IPCC AR5 before simply dismissing the sun altogether. The Earth’s sole supplier of energy, the sun, and all its dynamism, in fact gets only a couple of pages in a 2200-page report, about 0.1%. That alone is a monumental scandal. It’s incompetence and negligence on the grandest of scales.
This will certainly go down in the books as one of the greatest scientific debacles of human history.
If the IPCC had directed the same energy and resources to make the sun and natural factors the culprit for climate change as it has with CO2, they’d certainly have a far more convincing case today,and many of the questions it claims are still open would be closed. But obviously the IPCC’s sole intent is to frame mankind and its CO2 emissions as the culprit for something that stopped happening 16 years ago. This is fraud, not science.
The IPCC took the same negligent approach with sea levels: dismissing non-alarmist science in favor of nutty, doomsday scenarios.
I spent half a day searching for papers that provide evidence of a significant impact on climate by the sun and natural factors, and another full day sorting through them. I limited the scope of the search to 2008 – 2012, i.e. papers since the last IPCC report. There are many more papers of course prior to 2008.
What follows is a list of papers I found in just a few hours that the IPCC should have taken a much closer look at instead of just dismissing. The list of course is not complete.
An excellent resource that really speeded things up was the site:
Popular Technology.net
Popular technology is actually a list of 1100 papers that the IPCC wishes did not exist.
For some of the papers I’ve included links to additional information and some important quotes. Unfortunately I was not able to do this for every paper as time is limited.
Because of this gross negligence/incompetence on the IPCC’s part, the AR5 fifth is at best a woefully incomplete work and thus has reached a faulty conclusion.

"By the early 1990s, the man now dubbed the “chief climate change skeptic” in Donald Trump’s White House had already decided he was uneasy with the science that showed humans were heating the planet.  William Happer, the former Princeton physicist now on Trump’s National Security Council, was then in charge of energy research under George HW Bush. He asked experts at the Department of Energy to discuss their work with him and was displeased with the attitude he sensed from a climate researcher, according to a story recalled by two of his colleagues. “They were not just defensive; they just weren’t going to entertain questions,” said Richard Lindzen, an atmospheric physicist from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and a critic of the scientific consensus on the climate crisis. Two years later, when Bill Clinton entered office, Happer got into a public disagreement with Al Gore, then the vice-president, over evidence that refrigerant chemicals were eating a hole in the ozone layer. Happer was soon relieved of his government job. Happer, now 79, remembers standing from his seat in the back of a meeting and telling Gore, ‘What you’ve said is absolutely incorrect,’ according to Caleb Rossiter, who Happer helped recruit to run an organization he founded that questions climate science. So began Happer’s reputation as a renegade and dissident within a small subculture of academics who think the huge body of research proving a man-made climate crisis is wrong. Happer’s position veers far to the right of the typical conservative who questions the severity of the climate crisis. Trump’s former EPA chief Scott Pruitt – previously the administration’s most vocal climate denier – questioned whether humans and their carbon dioxide pollution were the main cause of global warming. But Happer’s ideology goes a step further. He thinks the extra carbon is beneficial to the planet. And he is in a position to embolden the president’s climate denial as the administration slashes environmental protections and encourages fossil fuel use. Since he was appointed last autumn as the director of emerging technologies on the White House’s National Security Council, Happer has pushed to challenge the government’s findings that climate change is a national security threat, according to documents first leaked to the Washington Post in February. No further news has come of that effort, and the National Security Council declined to comment on any possible plans. But the New York Times has reported Happer censored written testimony from the state department, noting in one draft document that it was “not objective testimony at all” and included “a lot of climate-alarm propaganda.” “There’s nothing exceptional about the current climate,” a commenter, identified to the Times by two sources as Happer, said. He’s also sent emails to Nasa administrator Jim Bridenstine criticizing his views that humans are the major cause of warming. The federal government’s own climate science assessment concludes, “the global warming of the past 50 years is primarily due to human activities, predominantly the burning of fossil fuels.” Happer was born in India when it was a British colony. His mother was a medical missionary and then worked at Oak Ridge National Laboratory on the Manhattan Project, which Happer credits with his interest in physics. He received his PhD in physics from Princeton in 1964, teaching at Columbia University before returning to Princeton in 1980. He is credited with innovations to acquire better images of peoples’ lungs and clearer views of the stars. In 1976, he became a member of Jason, an elite group of scientists who advise the government. After Happer left the energy department feeling unfairly treated, he eventually became more involved with a movement convinced that world leaders were being duped by climate scientists. People he has worked with believe humans and their carbon dioxide pollution couldn’t possibly be causing worse droughts, fires and floods. “He became very aware of the fact that these decisions were very political rather than scientific that were being made and still are,” said Patrick Moore, the chairman of the climate-crisis denying CO2 Coalition, which Happer helped start. Moore compared Happer’s quest to scientists persecuted throughout history: Galileo, Darwin, Mendel and Einstein, who each “had to fight against a so-called consensus”. In 2015, Happer co-founded the CO2 Coalition, a nonprofit that advocates for carbon dioxide, calling it “vital” to life on earth and important to crop growth. The CO2 Coalition receives funding from the Mercer family, a top Trump donor that also gave more than $2m to organisations denying climate science in 2016. The group receives money from the billionaire conservative industrialists, Charles and David Koch too. CO2 Coalition representatives can often be found at conservative conferences, touting CO2 from small booths with pamphlets. In 2017, when Happer was reportedly under consideration to be Trump’s science advisor, he sent a letter to a Jezebel reader arguing that the “demonization of CO2” “really differs little from the Nazi persecution of the Jews, the Soviet extermination of class enemies or ISIL slaughter of infidels”. In a CNN-hosted debate with Bill Nye, Happer said: “There’s this myth that’s developed around carbon dioxide that it’s a pollutant, but you and I both exhale carbon dioxide with every breath.” He believes the gas is beneficial overall, because it helps plants grow. Michael Bender, a Princeton geosciences professor, spoke with Happer several times and said he was cordial in interactions that did not concern man’s influence on climate. “I think his reputation as a physicist has been very high for a long time … this is something I’ve heard from a number of physicists,” Bender said. But he added: “To me it seems like the important things are whether his views about climate science are rational and how he wants to exert influence.”"
"Theresa May has said she was won over to the cause of tackling the climate emergency on her Swiss walking holidays. In 2017 the prime minister decided to call what would prove to be a disastrous snap general election while on a walking holiday in Wales.  Speaking to journalists en route to her last major international summit, in Japan, May said noticing the pace at which ice had receded over time in the Swiss mountains had inspired her recent announcement that the UK would target net zero carbon emissions by 2050. “I’m pleased to be going to the G20. I’m going to be talking about the importance of us continuing to work together cooperatively, and us working with international partners,” she said. “One of the issues we’ll be talking about climate change, and I’m very pleased to say that when we get off the plane our net zero target for 2050 will have entered law in the UK. And that’s obviously important to ensure that we’re not contributing to climate change in the future. Formed in 1999, the G20 is a group featuring 19 of the world's largest economic powers and the European Union. It was formed in the wake of financial crises in the late 90s, with a view to providing some governance for the global economy. Since 2008 it has held an annual leaders' summit. The 19 countries who are members are Argentina, Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, France, Germany, India, Indonesia, Italy, Japan, Mexico, Russia, Saudi Arabia, South Africa, South Korea, Turkey, United Kingdom and the United States. Collectively the members of the G20 account for about 90% of the world's GDP. As well as the 19 countries plus the EU, also attending the meetings are representatives of several permanent guests, including the African Union, International Monetary Fund, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), United Nations and the World Trade Organization. Critics argue that it is too exclusive, and the format locks a significant number of large countries out of high-level discussions on the global economy.  “Just as a small example of why this is important: as you know, Philip and I go walking, not just in Wales but also in Switzerland, and there’s a particular place we go to where over the last decade you can see the glacier retreating quickly – and this has brought home to me the importance of climate change.” She said she would urge other leaders to follow the UK’s example. “The G20 represents 80% of emissions, so actually it’s not just about what the UK does, it’s about what we can do together. So I’m going to be taking a message to the other leaders about the importance of them following the UK’s lead and acting on this issue.” The surprise net zero plan was one of a string of policies announced by Downing Street in recent weeks, as May seeks to secure some legacy beyond failing to deliver Brexit. The climate pledge met with scepticism among some of her cabinet colleagues. The chancellor, Philip Hammond, said that it could cost up to £1tn in lost economic output by the time it was met. But May was keen to respond to the increasing public concern about the climate emergency after the school strikes and a visit to the UK by the climate activist Greta Thunberg. The Treasury and No 10 have also clashed over whether the prime minister can announce a funding boost for education before she leaves office, along the lines of the £20bn-a-year settlement already agreed for the NHS. Hammond is concerned that the Conservatives risk squandering what he regards as their hard-won reputation for careful management of the public finances. But both remaining leadership candidates have made a series of costly promises to cut taxes and increase spending. May was speaking en route to the G20 summit in Osaka at which rising tensions in the Middle East are also expected to be on the agenda. She stressed the importance of Iran abiding by its commitments under the JCPOA, the international nuclear treaty that Donald Trump has pulled out of but which the UK, France and Germany have sought to keep alive. “We have been actively working with others, notably with our French and German colleagues, to do everything we can to ensure the maintenance of the JCPOA. Now obviously, as part of that, it’s important that Iran abides by its commitments,” May said. She added: “We do have, as the UK, a difference of opinion with the United States in relation to the JCPOA. As you know, the US withdrew from the JCPOA. We continue to believe in the importance of maintaining that nuclear deal.” Asked about Trump’s admission that he had come close to ordering airstrikes against Iran, May said: “I think what we need to see in relation to Iran at the moment is a de-escalation of the tensions that we’ve seen in that region.” Mike Childs, head of science at Friends of the Earth, said: “If a day is a long time in politics, a decade is a very long time for the PM to be aware of devastating climate change that she admits to seeing with her own eyes. “We know about the dangers of hitting 1.5°C of global warming so it’s incumbent on any leader to do everything possible, as quickly as possible, to get ahead of this massive risk: there’s no such thing as going too fast in mitigating climate chaos.”"

Share this...FacebookTwitterNot long ago, all of Germany’s political parties and media, whether socialist, green, liberal or conservative, embraced and voted into law the green energy feed-in act (EEG). The few remaining outspoken opponents were marginalized as political Neanderthals and climate deniers.
Now fast-forward 5 years to today. My oh my how perceptions have changed. As the costs and the technical folly become more apparent, major back-pedaling is beginning. Once the darling of the media, Germany’s renewable energy feed-in act (EEG) is now coming under heavy fire. Energy prices have been skyrocketing, and CO2 emissions aren’t going down by any measure.
The latest to fire harsh criticism is leading political daily, the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung (FAZ) in an online piece titled: Too much is too much. The introduction:
The transition to renewable energy is becoming a giant re-distribution machine. The subsidy is careening out of control. There’s far more green energy than planned. The price for emission certificates are plunging. Coal is experiencing a Renaissance. And the world is emitting more CO2 than ever.”
Granted the FAZ still is in favor or green energies, but not like this. The FAZ calls the current implementation of Germany’s green energy feed-in act a “giant redistribution machine” that is “dividing the nation“, where a “majority now fear further rising energy costs“. The surcharge for green energy will soon rise to 7 cents per kilowatt-hour, almost “double what power is traded for on the power commodity exchanges“. Consumers are now paying 30 euro-cents ($0.38) per kilowatt-hour.

The FAZ adds that the green energy subsidy “has completely gone out of control“.  Worse, the lobby of those who have benefitted massively from these subsidies has turned into a behemoth that no politician dares to challenge. The German green energy feed-in act does not only impact the German power market, but “grotesquely distorts” the European power market, writes the FAZ.
And because green energies have been massively subsidized to the detriment of other power sources, other subsidies have to enacted to counter the market distortions. The result: more subsidies for power companies to keep reserve plants on stand-by, or to pay wind park operators to shut down when there’s too much power being fed in. The green energy revolution has turned into a subsidy bonanza where investors have no risks.
Another massive error described by the FAZ article was the belief that fossil fuels would get more expensive. That hasn’t happened The opposite is true. New oil and gas reserves, thanks to fracking, for example, have caused these fuels to plummet in price. The FAZ writes:
The gas price there has already fallen 75%. Because coal there is being replaced gas, the emissions of carbon dioxide in the USA has fallen to the lowest level in 20 years. That’s perverse. Through fracking, America reaches its climate targets which it never signed on to while self anointed model climate student Germany is emitting more CO2 than last year.”
Now that the opposition greens and socialists are plummeting in German opinion polls, look for Angela Merkel and her government to take steps to shut down the ruinous renewable energy subsidy orgy soon after next weekend’s national elections.

"Whether it’s wars or elections, winners throughout history get to frame the story of what happened. Australia’s federal election one month ago is no different. If the Coalition is to be believed, they won convincingly and now have a mandate to continue their do-nothing approach on climate and to wind back Australia’s progressive tax system. If the Murdoch press is to believed, Australians voted overwhelmingly in favour of coal.  However, in this analysis you would miss that the Coalition has a one-seat majority. You would miss that their primary vote dropped. And you would also miss that in the election, Scott Morrison repeatedly chose to champion his government’s renewable energy credentials - “what we have is $25 billion invested in renewable energy in this country between 2018 and 2020, which is an all-time record.” In an election period, the fact that this renewable energy boom is occurring because Tony Abbott unsuccessfully tried to kill the Renewable Energy Target, the main driver for the current boom, is by the by. However, post-election, this fact is instructive of how challenging the Coalition will continue to find governing. While Abbott may be gone, so too are many Coalition moderates, either voted out like Sarah Henderson, retired pre-election or in the case of Arthur Sinodinos, are headed for the US. This means the Coalition Party room is filled with more people who are ideologically opposed to acting on climate and renewable energy. However, these issues aren’t going away. Indeed, the impacts of climate change are becoming more obvious and more severe. In just the last year, we have seen an almost year-round fire-season, stretching emergency services. There have been record-breaking heatwaves and floods which killed people and livestock and, of course, severe and ongoing drought. These are set to continue and likely get worse. This in turn further heightens public awareness of the climate crisis, which is saying something given that public concern about climate is at a record high. And while this public concern didn’t translate to electoral victory for parties with comprehensive climate policies, it is not going away. The climate movement activated record numbers of people in the federal election. However, it seems that given the consistent polling showing an ALP victory, many did not get involved. Since the election, sign-ups to climate organisations have peaked. The Stop Adani campaign has had 3,658 new supporters sign up since the election, while new organisation Parents for Climate doubled its membership in the two weeks after the election. And it is not just everyday citizens; everyone from the Reserve Bank and investment funds to doctors to Australia’s major trading partners to ASX100 companies are calling for greater action on climate. This groundswell of people and organisations demanding more action are backed in by global economic trends in technology that the Australian government cannot ignore. Around the world, solar PV installations are doubling every 2-3 years, and with every doubling, there is a 28.5% reduction in module costs. These exponential growth and cost reduction trends are similar for wind generation, battery storage and electric vehicles. As such, it is now significantly cheaper to build a wind or solar farm firmed by battery storage or pumped hydro than a new coal-fired power station or gas plant. As key architects of the marketisation and privatisation of the electricity system, the Liberal Party cannot now escape these market forces. All of this means that the federal government is swimming against the tide of both public opinion and economics, and that is a hard and tiring thing to do. While it will be hard going, they are going to give it a red-hot go. In March, the energy minister, Angus Taylor, announced a feasibility study for a new coal-fired power station in central Queensland. They are pushing ahead with the Big Stick legislation motivated by the desire to force AGL to sell Liddell coal power station before they plan to close it in 2022. Then there are the myriad coalmines and gas-fracking projects that the federal government will approve and support, including the Adani coal mine and the Beetaloo gas basin in the Northern Territory. All the while Australia’s carbon emissions continue to rise at a time when we must urgently reduce them. In both climate and energy terms, timing matters. In the energy system, our ageing coal-fired power stations are increasingly breaking down during heatwaves when we most need electricity. On the climate front, the situation could not be more dire. So what now must we do? 1. Learn the significant lessons from this election While thousands of people took action in the climate election and there were wins  in Indi and Warringah, we cannot afford to elect another federal government that does not take acting on climate seriously. So we must learn what worked and what didn’t and trial different ways of working on climate in the next three years. Even a month on, it is still too early to say definitively what these lessons are, as organisations and campaigns are still reflecting and parsing what happened. 2. Go back to basics We need to tell the stories of climate change, its causes and the solutions in ways that connect to people’s everyday lives. This means fewer graphs and statistics and more stories. Stories of people such as Dino Cerrachi, a stone-fruit grower who had his crop cooked on the trees in the heatwave last summer, or Janet Reynolds, who lost her home in a fire in the middle of winter last year. Or Liuanga Palu, a member of the Western Sydney Pacific community and Uniting Church who help found Voices for Power, a campaign to ensure migrant communities can access affordable and renewable power. 3. Hold the federal government to account We cannot let the federal government’s lies such as “we will meet our Paris targets at a canter” and the crown of thorns starfish not climate is the most “imminent threat” to the Great Barrier Reef flourish; they must be resisted and rejected. This is why campaigns to prevent more carbon bombs such as the Adani mine, the Betaloo Basin and other gas and coal projects will continue and ramp up. 4. Get on with it The federal government does not have a monopoly on climate action. While they can make it quicker or slower, easier or harder, there are others actors who can play significant roles in lowering carbon pollution.

"G20 countries have almost tripled the subsidies they give to coal-fired power plants in recent years, despite the urgent need to cut the carbon emissions driving the climate crisis. The bloc of major economies pledged a decade ago to phase out all fossil fuel subsidies.  The figures, published in a report by the Overseas Development Institute (ODI) and others, show that Japan is one of the biggest financial supporters of coal, despite the prime minister, Shinzo Abe, having said in September: “Climate change can be life-threatening to all generations … We must take more robust actions and reduce the use of fossil fuels.” The annual G20 meeting begins in Japan on Friday. China and India give the biggest subsidies to coal, with Japan third, followed by South Africa, South Korea, Indonesia and the US. While the UK frequently runs its own electricity grid without any coal power at all, a parliamentary report in June criticised the billions of pounds used to help to build fossil fuel power plants overseas. Global emissions must fall by half in the next decade to avoid significantly worsening drought, floods, extreme heatwave and poverty for hundreds of millions of people. But emissions are still increasing, with coal-fired power the biggest single contributor to the rise in 2018. “It has now been 10 years since the G20 committed to phasing out fossil fuel subsidies, yet astonishingly some governments are actually increasing the amount they give to coal power plants,” said Ipek Gençsü, research fellow at ODI and lead author of the report. “Momentum is growing around the world for governments to take urgent action to tackle the climate crisis and ending subsidies to coal would bring benefits to all [including reduced air pollution] and help set a level playing field for clean energy,” she said. Han Chen, energy policy manager at the Natural Resources Defense Council and co-author of the report, said: “Other governments may struggle to take Japan’s rhetoric on climate change seriously, as this year’s G20 host government continues to pour billions of dollars into propping up coal. If prime minister Abe is serious about dealing with climate change, he should end Japan’s government-backed finance for coal.” Green campaigners are planning protests in Japan against the G20’s coal subsidies and in nations where coal plants are being funded. China is supporting coal plants in the Philippines, opposed by the Oriang women’s movement, which campaigns for gender and social justice. Flora Santos, the movement’s president, said: “We cannot continue to live in peril and in the face of ever-worsening threats to the survival and security of our families. The expansion of the coal industry and projects must stop as soon as possible.” The researchers totalled the financial and tax subsidies given for mining coal and building and maintaining coal-fired power plants, including investments by state-owned companies. They found the average annual amount increased from $17bn in 2014 to $47bn in 2017. In contrast, the subsidies for coal mining halved, from $22bn to $10bn. “In reality, government support to coal is much larger than our report’s numbers show, because many G20 countries still lack transparency on the many ways they subsidise coal,” said Ivetta Gerasimchuk, at the International Institute for Sustainable Development and another co-author. Coal is seen as a sector in terminal decline across the world, from Asia to the US to Europe, and the International Energy Agency reported that total investments in new coal plants have fallen by 75% from 2015 to 2018. The reason state subsidies are bucking this trend may be because governments are choosing to prop up the sector for political reasons, said Gençsü. “They are just kicking the can down the road,” she said. “The money would be much better channelled to managing the [low carbon] transition and setting an end date. Coal use is going to end – it is the trajectory the world is on – but they are really dragging their feet.” About 5% of the subsidies identified in the report went to assisting a transition away from coal, mainly in Germany and the UK. But other programmes have been launched since 2017, including a $15bn fund in China for coal and steel workers, and a €250m scheme for coalminers in Spain, which is not a G20 nation. The World Coal Association did not respond to a request for comment."

And it’s not even a La Nina year.

Another sign is Central Europe refusing to warm further. Meteorologist Dominik Jung at Wetter.net here reports that Germany’s 2013 year was the 2nd coldest in a decade. The mean temperature was only 0.4°C over the 1961 – 1990 mean. Only 2010 was “a bit colder”.
Hey! That means the coldest 2 years of the decade happened just recently. Clearly the recent flurry of cold events shows that the globe is cooling, thus contradicting the global warming hypothesis. Alarmists are desperate to explain why.

Share this...FacebookTwitterHolocene Sea Levels
By Ed Caryl
There are many indications that sea level was much higher immediately after the last ice sheets melted 7000 years ago. There were other high-stands in the intervening years. Two sources are presented here that attempt to measure past sea levels.
Most Holocene sea level studies depend on geological and archeological evidence and a good deal of speculation. Two studies were found that have substantial evidence, presented in detail.
The first (Aus K.-E. BEHRE, Probleme der Küstenforschung, Bd.28, Isensee-Verlag, Oldenburg, 2003) was found as second and third hand charts in Frans J.P.M. Kwaad’s paper here, in Dutch, translated with Google Translate. The original Behre papers are behind a paywall, here. Other sources cite Behre, but some cast doubt on his work without offering alternatives.
From the charts, new curves were constructed in Excel so that Post Glacial Rebound (PGR) corrections could be made, and curves compared. Behre never took PGR into account in his work. He was also charting the high water marks, not MSL, so his charts set the present sea level to 1.75 meters. To correct for this, 1.75 meters were subtracted from his data. The data were collected in the stretch of seacoast called the German Bight, the area from Dutch Friesland to Danish Friesland, the south coast of the North Sea, centered on Wilhelmshaven.
I took the Wilhelmshaven PGR uplift figure as the starting point for the correction. PGR changes over time, doubling in about every 2000 years as one goes back to the end of the glacial retreat 7000 years ago. 
Figure 1a above

Figure 1b. Both Figures 1a and 1b are from F. J. P. M. Kwaad here. Click for larger view. 
The next data are from the Western Pacific, specifically the Yellow River Delta and the Sunda Strait, taken from J. P. Liu et al, 2004, Holocene Development of the Yellow River’s subaqueous delta, North Yellow Sea. Marine Geology, 209(1-4): page 60. This chart describes the sea level rise at the end of the last ice age. Don’t be confused by the reversal in the horizontal axis. In the literature, time can run left to right or right to left. The time scales can also have zero at the birth of Christ, or at the present day.

 Figure 2 is the sea level rise from 22,000 to 6000 years ago.
The data from these charts, with PGR and High Water correction, results are shown in Figure 3:

Figure 3 is a plot of the last 10,000 years of sea level, combining data from figures 1a, 1b, and 2.
In Figure 3, we can see the agreement between the two data sources for the period from 6000 years before present to 10,000 years before present, validating the procedure.

Figure 4 focuses on the last 8000 years.
By focusing on the last 8000 years, we can also see the sea level high stands at the Medieval Warm period, the Roman Warm Period, and the Egyptian/Minoan Warm Period as well as the Holocene Climate Optimum after all the great ice sheets melted. These latter two high stands are roughly two meters above the current sea level. The low stands are about one meter below current sea level.
When looking at these, keep in mind that there is a delay between temperature and sea level. That delay depends on the amount of temperature change and the level from which the temperature changed. In Figure 4, the delay seems to average at least 200 years.
In the last 8000 years, sea level has been substantially higher than at present, up to 2 meters or more higher in two periods four to seven thousand years ago. Sea level during the Holocene has been falling since that period.

"My first reaction on watching the events at the Mansion House dinner on Thursday was that junior minister Mark Field had grossly overreacted. On reflection, I am not so sure. We can never assume, as your editorial claims (22 June), that “there was no physical threat”. This cannot have been clear at the time; there have been too many occasions when unanticipated assaults have led to death or serious injuries, as in the case of Jo Cox MP. Recent attackers, both individually or in groups, have used concealed knives or explosives to carry out their murderous intentions. Dissent can only be seen to be “non-violent” after the event. I now speculate what might have been my reaction to all this if the protester had been a young man, and the individual who sought to forestall a possible tragedy had been a courageous female. Surely some credit should be given to anyone who decides to intervene when the intentions of an interloper are unclear. The really worrying question in these difficult times remains: how can a large group of people not invited to a major official occasion have managed to gain entry to make their protest, however peacefully, without any prior entrance check? Where on earth were the essential security arrangements?Roger PutnamHolmrook, Cumbria • What I’ve noticed in all the controversy after the manhandling of a Greenpeace protester is that no space has been given to the content of the protest. On Greenpeace’s website I found the alternative speech that the protesters were trying to deliver. It is about the climate emergency and addresses Philip Hammond’s remark that we can’t afford to take the action needed to bring emissions down to zero – in other words we “can’t afford” to take the action needed to safeguard the futures of our children and the people of the world. It’s an eloquent and passionate speech and it deserves to be printed in the Guardian.Morag CarmichaelLondon  • Join the debate – email guardian.letters@theguardian.com • Read more Guardian letters – click here to visit gu.com/letters • Do you have a photo you’d like to share with Guardian readers?

The Deutsch Türkische Nachrichten writes:
Also sweets are on the EU’s verboten-list. Chocolate that is shaped like cigarettes must no longer be sold in the future. In the EU parliament’s view, chocolate cigarettes are dangerous starter drugs”.
Real cigarettes and cigars to remain legal
Ironically, the real cigarettes and cigars with addictive tobacco will continue to be legal, the Deutsch Türkische Nachrichten reports. Tobacco in Europe, it seems, is far safer than chocolate.

Share this...FacebookTwitterI’ve gotten a few emotionalized, angry e-mails from veggie readers on the story about how meat-eaters are by far much healthier in every respect than vegetarians. They insist that their nutrition is superior and that the University of Graz study is “bullshit”. It’s bought and paid for by the bacon industry!
Yet, nothing better illustrates the fallacy of vegetarianism than looking at the children of vegetarians. The vegetarians, you will recall, like to make it a moral issue in that they blame climate change and animal abuse on meat-eating. They claim it’s the healthiest diet.
But vegetarianism for kids is turning out to be even worse than smoking for adults. One example of the impacts that vegetarianism has on children is vividly illustrated in an article appearing in the Daily Mail here. (There are many on this subject).
Rotting teeth, bone wasting…some excerpts:
…”‘I couldn’t work out what was going on,’ says Holly, who lives in Totnes, Devon. ‘We all ate exceptionally healthily, with plenty of vegetables, nuts and seeds.'”
…”I was assured by the people who devised the diet that we would get all the protein we needed from nuts and seeds, and we also took a daily supplement to replace the nutrients found in animal foods.”
…’But then I started noticing that something wasn’t right. … Bertie and Lizzie’s muscles seemed weak and they had problems seeing at night. … I couldn’t understand why this well-fed child was behaving like this. I was so brainwashed that the fact our bodies were craving dairy products had passed me by.’
…”Her parents, ‘well-known figures in Glasgow’s vegan community’, had unwittingly starved her of necessary nutrients found in fish and meat, causing her to develop the bone-wasting disease usually associated with 19th century slums.”

…'”is mother’s mistake was to follow a fad diet, hyped up by magazines and endorsed by celebrities, to a growing child.”
Sound familiar?
Thankfully, the mothers of the children realized they had been duped by junk science peddled by fashionable fanatics, and eventually brought a responsible diet back to their kids.
Yet, there are many tree-hugging vegetarians out there who insist their way of life has to be imposed on others and demand we stop eating meat. These happen to be the very people who want to tell us what’s best for the climate and the planet…based on, as is the case with vegetarianism, crackpot science peddled by charlatans experts.
If you want the entire human civilization to end up with rotting teeth, brittle bones, weak muscles and blind, then let the nutjob alarmist environmentalists run the show.
It’s clear: Bad science leads to bad results. Example: Greenpeace and golden rice.
The problem with climate science is that it is even worse than vegetarian science! And even scarier, the two are merging.
The calls for a shift away from meat because “it is bad for health and climate” are growing louder by the day.

Share this...FacebookTwitterGerman alarmist site klimaretter.de here reports on the latest negative developments now hitting Germany’s wind power industry. The latest to be hit is wind-turbine transmission manufacturer Bosch Rexroth AG, which announced it will slash 210 jobs and give up a production plant in Nuremberg.

Image cropped from: www.youtube.com/kGXoE3RFZ8
Klimaretter writes that the reason behind the move is “the changing wind market“, which according to Bosch-Rexroth spokesperson has seen immense fluctuations.
Because 2013 saw 10 gigawatts less wind energy power installed than a year earlier, ‘capacities have to be scaled back’.”
The layoffs come on the heels of Bavaria’s move to restrict the installation of wind parks in its idyllic countryside. However, the company claims that Bavaria’s policy had no impact on the decision.
Bosch Rexroth is just the latest in a series of setbacks the wind energy industry has seen over the last months. Germany’s solar industry has already collapsed and wind energy is just the latest victim in Germany’s rollback of renewable energies. Spiegel here writes that Germany’s solar industry has shed half its jobs in the last two years alone!

Last month German wind energy investment company Prokon filed for bankruptcy. The Local here writes that the company attracted 75,000 investors through a successful advertising campaign, where an 8 percent return on investment was promised. Today these investors are uncertain if they will ever see their money returned at all. The Local writes:
Investors had reportedly pulled €227 million of a total investment of €1. 4 billion, leaving the company far short of the 95 percent capital investment it needed to stay solvent.”
Spiegel here also reports on the dwindling returns and “broken promises” of wind energy investments.
Not only are windparks losing their appeal as a source of energy or as a secure investment in Germany, but resistance from citizens’ groups and environmentalists to planned projects is also rapidly mounting worldwide. Now windparks are facing lawsuits for killed birds. Benny Peiser’s GWPF site here writes:
A $1 million settlement with a renewables business for birds killed at two of the company’s wind farms marks the first time the U.S. government has pursued legal action against a wind developer for bird deaths caused by turbines.
Research published in the peer-reviewed scientific journal Biological Conservation last year estimated that between 140,438 and 327,586 birds—or a mean of 234,012—are killed annually due to collisions with turbines across the U.S.”
Expect more strong headwinds against wind power in the months and years ahead.

By Frank Bosse and Fritz Vahrenholt
(Translated by P Gosselin)
In October 2013 there was a considerable rise in solar activity as the sunspot number (SSN) climbed to 85.6. That’s 77% of the mean value reached at this time into a solar cycle since 1750. The following diagram shows the current situation:

SSN versus months since the start of the cycle
October 2013 deviates significantly from solar cycle number 5. However we continue to believe that SC 24 will be similar to SC 5. Just how large the uncertainties of the correct description of the 5th cycle is shown by a recently published paper by Rainer Arlt of the Leibniz Institute Potsdam and Ilya Usoskin of the Finnish University of Oulo, who after examining the solar cycles between 1750 und 1850 reached the conclusion that the sunspot count should be lowered by 20%. SC 24 shown by the red curve is, however, still very much below average of SC 1-23, let alone well below the large cycles of the solar maximums from 1940 – 1990.
Also in October 2013 mainly the southern hemisphere (SH) of our sun was active. In a comparison of the cycles with each other (here the SSN anomaly thus far up to the current cycle month) we see that the accumulated sunspot number is between SC5 and SC 14:

Current cycle indicate we are entering a Dalton-like minimum

In a recent publication in Space Science Reviews (2013), renowned solar scientists Ken McCracken, Juerg Beer, Friedhelm Steinhilber and Jose Abreu studied the solar minimums over the last 9300 years. Based on measurements of beryllium and carbon isotopes as indicators for the intensity of cosmic rays, which are modulated by solar activity, the scientists arrived at the result that the minimum of 2007 to 2009 had similar characteristics as the minimums occurring during the time of the Dalton Minimums of 1780 to 1820. They discovered a 208-year periodicity (Suess-de Vries) of a grand solar minimum in the past. Therefore they anticipate in the near future the events of a Dalton Minimum, but not a Maunder Minimum.
Lockwood sees elevated chance of a Maunder-like minimum
Another established solar scientist, Prof. Michael Lockwood of the University of Reading, has pointed out that solar activity since the end of the last century has diminished more strongly than it ever has in all the earlier times of the last 9000 years. Lockwood found 24 solar minimum in the last 9000 years, and nowhere did solar activity drop so strongly as it has in the current period. He now sees the probability of another Maunder Minimums at 25- 30%. Just a few years ago he said the probability of a Maunder Minimum re-occurring was 8%. Consequently Lockwood: “We found a significant relationship between the occurrence of cold winters in Europe and solar activity.“ The probable mechanism is the change in the solar UV radiation, which has an influence of the temperature gradient, ozone formation, and the winds in the stratosphere. This in turn disrupts the Jetstream in the northern hemisphere, leads to blocking weather patterns, and to easterly winds that lead to cold spells.
Already in our September report 2013 concerning the publication by Ermolli et al we pointed to a much more strongly variable UV radiation within a solar cycle then what is observed in the overall total radiation (factor 2-6). Weaker solar cycles have a considerably weaker UV radiation and lead to cold periods in the northern hemisphere. Unfortunately the measurements can no longer be continued because the SORCE satellite, which measures the radiation of the sun above the atmosphere, has stopped functioning because of battery damage, and so the cold winters that lie ahead will have to be endured without satellite UV measurements.
And we introduce a third publication. In it Friedrich Steinhilber and Jürg Beer are venturing a look at the next 500 years using two different methods. Here, phi is a measure of solar activity. M marks the Maunder Minimum, D the Dalton Minimum and G the weaker Gleisberg Minimum of 1900:

"“Come on, stop calling us polluters.” That was the shocking message of denial from the head of the International Air Transport Association at a summit that took place this month as it emerged that rising numbers of passengers are shunning flights because of the climate emergency. Consumers are voting with their feet. Too many perhaps for barely profitable airlines, but too few to shift the corporate inertia surrounding an environmental crisis. The trend may accelerate as planetary disaster unfolds. The industry needs a better strategy than burying its head in the sand. With ice sheets vanishing from the roof of the world and fjords disappearing in the North Atlantic, Big Air must first accept the scale of the problem. Aviation needs to be part of the global commitment to phase out fossil fuels and limit catastrophic temperature rises. Industry emissions are growing faster than original forecasts. This year, for the first time, global aviation emissions passed the one gigatonnes of CO2 mark. The industry contributes about 3% of annual global emissions but could be a 10th or more of the total by 2050. The second step needed is a radical new plan that goes far beyond the current Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation. This scheme only covers 75% of the industry, and experts calculate that a significant reduction of emissions from flying will be needed by 2030 to keep warming below 2C.   Although there’s been a buzz about electric planes, they cannot provide all the answers. Replacing fuel tanks with heavier batteries would not make sense for long flights. Even if some travellers are thinking again, passenger growth outpaces the drop in carbon emissions from greener technology. That is not to say cleaner fuels are not needed. It’s just that such innovation won’t be enough on its own. The demand for air travel needs to be damped. This is easier than one might imagine. Frequent flying is a minority sport: 75% of all flights in the United Kingdom come from 15% of the population. It is the better-off who can afford to fly all year round. They are behind the 40% rise in holiday flights in the last decade – an astonishing 11m extra trips.  To get a feel of the civilisation-wide significance of climate change, think about this fact: a UK resident making a single transatlantic round trip emits as much CO2 as they would in two months of everyday life. To change passenger behaviour might need taxation. A recently leaked EU report suggested that increasing the cost of jet fuel tax by 10% would cut the number of travellers by a similar amount. There might be a case for the first trip or two in a year to be lightly taxed and for subsequent ones to face steeply rising levies. If the UK government was serious about the climate emergency it would think again about a third runway at Heathrow. Pressing ahead with it, or any runway, would make a mockery of Theresa May’s promise to reach net-zero emissions by the middle of this century. The government’s climate advisers said we could hit that target and still be flying in 2050. The aviation sector, they calculated, would account for 31 megatonnes of CO2. If a third runway at Heathrow goes ahead that will shoot past 40 megatonnes of CO2. The polluter ought to pay. The cost of absorbing the equivalent of airline emissions should be raised to make airport expansion less attractive. Although MPs did vote for the third runway, in a few years’ time the transport secretary will have a chance to block Heathrow’s proposals. To save the planet, whoever is in the post should do so."

Share this...FacebookTwitterThis year western Europe has experienced a mild winter as a parade of low pressure systems coming in from off the Atlantic has fed the continent with a steady supply of mild southerly winds.
For Germany this winter will be the first mild one in 6 years after a record 5 consecutive winters of colder than normal winters. The warm winter here may be in part due to the massive cold that has dipped and remained deep into North America over much of the winter. As cold Arctic air clashes with warm Atlantic air off the southeast coast of the USA, low pressure systems are spawned and travel across the pond to Europe.
Yesterday Ulli Kulke of Die Welt writes that this milder winter is more the exception than the rule, resulting from the positive North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO). Despite this year’s warm winter, the winters for Europe over the coming decades are expected to be on the cold side. Kulke writes:
Meteorologist Dominik Jung of ‘wetter.net‘ recently examined the temperature development for many ski areas in Germany, Austria and Switzerland and reached the result that ‘in the last 20 years, its has gotten cooler’ and ‘in some place quite massively’. The trend looks good for skiing.”
The winters, Kulke writes, are very much dependent on the natural ocean cycles.
The changeovers between positive and negative NAO occur in roughly 30 year cycles. And so that means after the last large changeover just before the millennium, there are still over 15 years of ‘good skiing and sliding left’.

"Theresa May’s initiative to decarbonise the UK economy by 2050 has been estimated to cost £50bn per year (theguardian.com, 6 June). It is hoped that by taking leadership in this way, others will follow. However, the world’s emissions are already changing the Earth’s climate, and such changes will only get larger as emissions of greenhouse gases continue. As an example, Namibia is being forced by one of its most intense droughts on record to raise $1m by auctioning off some of its wildlife. This shouldn’t be necessary. If the UK were to give just 1% of this £50bn per year to help climate adaptation efforts in the developing world – for example, supporting investment in solar-powered desalination infrastructure in drought-prone countries – this would send a powerful signal that it is taking seriously not only its future emissions but also its responsibilities for past and ongoing emissions.Tim PalmerRoyal Society research professor in climate physics, University of Oxford  • Did the story “Extreme weather triggers fastest carbon emissions rise in a decade” (12 June) make you wonder why? The UK emissions 2018 progress report to the Committee on Climate Change showed that after nearly a decade of falling emissions from buildings, they shot up in 2018. Proffered solutions focus on more technology. Nowhere is it mentioned that modern building design itself is deeply flawed and that regulations are resulting in ever more over-serviced, climate-vulnerable building types. These are lightweight, unshaded, with overglazed walls, completely reliant on mechanical heating, cooling and ventilation life-support systems, with no internal thermal mass to absorb or release excess heat for night-time heating or cooling. Few have natural ventilation either. Two simple regulations would mean engineers, architects and planners would have to create climate-ready buildings. They could also ensure the lights stay for summer demand peaks, people do not roast in their new homes and workplaces and buildings don’t need to be evacuated when the power fails during extreme peaks. Make it mandatory on new buildings to have solar hot water and photovoltaic panels, and at least 25% of windows to be opening.

"Thousands of people, including primary school children and members of the Women’s Institute, have lobbied MPs, calling for urgent action to tackle the climate emergency and critical loss of nature. About 12,000 people gathered in Westminster on Wednesday to put pressure on politicians, according to the organisers the Climate Coalition and Greener UK, whose members include aid agencies, social groups and conservation organisations.  The Time Is Now lobby comes after months of growing environmental protests, from school strikes to actions by members of Extinction Rebellion, and increasing warnings of the need for unprecedented action to tackle the global climate. Gareth Redmond-King, head of climate change at WWF, said: “Public concern is at its highest level. It is a mainstream issue. There are lots of organisations working hard to raise the profile and focus their MPs’ minds on policies and actions to make sure we take action.” A recent survey showed two-thirds of Britons wanting faster action to tackle climate change. The Guardian has updated its style guide to introduce terms that more accurately describe the environmental crises facing the world.
Instead of “climate change”, the preferred terms are “climate emergency, crisis or breakdown” and “global heating” is favoured over “global warming”. The scale of the climate and wildlife crises has been laid bare by two landmark reports from the world’s scientists. In October 2018, they said carbon emissions must halve by 2030 to avoid even greater risks of drought, floods, extreme heat and poverty for hundreds of millions of people. In May 2019, global scientists said human society was in jeopardy from the accelerating annihilation of wildlife and destruction of the ecosystems that support all life on Earth. The editor-in-chief, Katharine Viner, says: “We want to ensure that we are being scientifically precise, while also communicating clearly with readers on this very important issue. The phrase ‘climate change’, for example, sounds rather passive and gentle when what scientists are talking about is a catastrophe for humanity.” Other terms that have been updated include the use of “wildlife” rather than “biodiversity”, “fish populations” instead of “fish stocks” and “climate science denier” rather than “climate sceptic”. Damian Carrington Environment editor Theresa May, in one of her last acts as prime minister, is signing into law a target of net zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050, which was being debated by the Lords on Wednesday. Campaigners, religious leaders and people of various faiths, led by the former archbishop of Canterbury Rowan Williams proceeded along Whitehall on a “walk of witness”. Williams said he was proud the UK was taking the climate crisis seriously. “I compare it with the great struggle 200 years ago with ending the slave trade. Parliament took an option that wasn’t easy, it must have felt risky at the time facing massive entrenched global culture – and things changed,” he said. At least 195 MPs who met campaigners were encouraged to mark their constituency with a pin on a large map of the UK before being taken by rickshaw to speak to their constituents. At 2pm the thousands present rang alarm clocks, mobile phone alarms and sirens, and cheered loudly to symbolise “the time is now”. Jane Alexander, a primary school headteacher from London, brought five pupils from her school, North Harringay primary, to the lobby. She said: “Our children may be too young to vote but they are not too young to have their voices heard.” Michelle Lowe, from Winchester, said she had joined the mass lobby to speak to her MP because “the time is now”. She said: “I have children, who are 22, 20 and 16, and I’m worried about their futures.” The Liberal Democrat leadership contender Sir Ed Davey was among MPs who met constituents. He said it was absolutely clear that the British public was telling politicians to get tough on climate change. Benjamin Halfpenny, from Greener UK, said one of the demands made of MPs was for a strong environment bill to tackle air pollution, water quality and declines in wildlife such as hedgehogs."
"As a teenager, disenchanted with religion, I turned to Shakespeare for ethical guidance. I was inspired by the work of the Royal Shakespeare Company. It represented the ultimate company of conscious artists, speaking and playing Shakespeare with humour and insight. In my 20s I was fortunate to join the company, play Hamlet and Romeo, and become an associate artist. I have been delighted ever since to be connected with thousands of artists and audiences who have made the RSC what it is. And yet today I feel I must dissociate myself from the RSC, not because it is any less of a theatre company, but because of the company it keeps.  In 2012, when the RSC first partnered with BP, I joined a number of others in expressing concern that the RSC was “allowing itself to be used by BP to obscure the destructive reality of its activities”. We felt BP was buying the impression that it, too, had the consciousness of Shakespeare and the RSC artists. At the same time, the activist theatre group BP or not BP? began a series of Shakespearean stage invasions in protest at the sponsor. In the wake of that criticism, the RSC desisted in putting BP logos on more plays. However, the following year, BP instead started sponsoring the £5 ticket scheme for 16- to 25-year-olds, and in 2016 the RSC signed a contract for the partnership to continue until 2022. The arts sponsorship business is tricky. I would love nothing more than increased support for the imaginative arts, athletics and sciences of Britain. So I met with the environmentalist Jonathon Porritt, to find out if my suspicions about BP were wrong. “I worked closely with senior leaders in BP for more than a decade, intent on helping them radically change course,” he told me. “That work came to an end when I came to the incontrovertible conclusion that BP is neither sincere nor serious in addressing the climate crisis.” He continued: “Together with other oil majors, BP has been accused of fully understanding the science of climate change as far back as the early 1980s, and downplaying and obscuring that science ever since, always in the short-term interests of its shareholders. Regrettably, its current leadership is stuck in the same pattern – all the time using philanthropy to hide its past and present culpability.” The early 1980s! This is 2019. Half the greenhouse gases in the atmosphere currently warming our planet have been emitted in the last 30 years. BP has made the third-biggest contribution to climate change of any private company in history. It apparently knew three decades ago we were about to cook our planet, and then lit the fire. And this is not just about the past; this is about the future. The climate crisis could now not be more urgent, and to tackle it climate scientists advise that the majority of known fossil-fuel reserves be left in the ground. But BP has committed to invest £41bn in new oil extraction over the next 10 years. Its current advertising campaign suggests the company is investing heavily in renewables, yet in reality 97% of its capital investments will remain in oil and gas. BP is also a powerful lobbyist. It recently topped the list of firms obstructing climate action around the world and has been successfully lobbying President Trump for access to Arctic oil. I also wonder how much BP is actually giving the RSC? Oil companies operating in the North Sea, of which BP is one of the biggest, benefit from billions in tax breaks and subsidies, so in reality they are taking much more from the public purse than they are “giving back” in sponsorship. Back in 2017 I submitted a question to the RSC’s AGM, as I thought my role as an associate artist was to press these matters reasonably within the organisation. Many months later, I was told that BP’s support was discussed and that “we assess potential donations against three principles – they must support the charitable objectives of the RSC, reflect the integrity of the RSC and not influence the RSC’s artistic decisions”. It went on: “Possible ways to further involve the RSC’s valued associate artists are already under way, welcoming their support through private consultation.” I have waited two years for that consultation. Hearing nothing, I recently let the RSC know that I feel I must resign as I do not wish to be associated with BP any more than I would with an arms dealer, a tobacco salesman or anyone who wilfully destroys the lives of others alive or unborn. Nor, I believe, would William Shakespeare. The RSC’s response? We must be “phased and pragmatic”. In reality, this means the RSC will continue pushing BP’s brand on to a generation of young people who have – in huge numbers through the ongoing school strikes – told adults they need to step up their response to the climate crisis now. Surely the RSC wants to be on the side of the world-changing kids, not the world-killing companies? I do not write this in anger or righteousness. We are all together in this crisis and we all must change. I am resigning to lend strength to the voices within the RSC who want to be progressive, and to encourage my fellow associates to express themselves, too.  The RSC is well placed to make a positive statement about the responsibility of cultural organisations to act on the climate crisis. It could turn this situation on its head and give young people much more value than a cheap £5 ticket. It could give them the support of Shakespeare in their stand against our addiction to energy dealers who would willingly destroy us for a quick quid. The children know the truth: tough love. In the face of addiction, tough love is the only path. It’s time for an artistic intervention.

"Labour plans to give the Bank of England powers to help check the readiness of City firms to cut carbon emissions and invest responsibly to tackle the climate emergency. John McDonnell, the shadow chancellor, announced proposals for an unprecedented expansion of the central bank’s role at the heart of policymaking, with officials at Threadneedle Street supporting the Treasury in checking on progress towards carbon targets. McDonnell said the Bank’s governor would also join the next Labour chancellor on a sustainable investment board to oversee lending to British businesses with the aim of boosting productivity. Speaking to City executives in central London on Monday, McDonnell said Labour planned to conduct a review of City practices and how investments could be directed to promote technologies that cut carbon emissions. The review would focus on the shadow banking sector, where borrowing and lending takes place beyond the oversight of regulators. It will report by October as part of Labour’s plans for a “green industrial revolution”. McDonnell said: “I am setting up a review group to overview the financial system as it currently relates to the climate emergency, in terms of both where and how it is causing or exacerbating the problem of climate change and where and how it could be providing solutions to problems.” He repeated his warning that firms listed on the London Stock Exchange that failed to meet environmental targets risked being denied access to the main equity market, forcing them to become private businesses or list in other jurisdictions. “This means that when we delist companies that fail to meet environmental criteria from the London Stock Exchange, investors can be confident that their money is not going on making the world uninhabitable for their children,” McDonnell said. Labour has already set out wide-ranging plans for a network of regional banks and an enhanced post office network to promote investment. McDonnell said these institutions would be given the dual role of increasing investment in green technologies and making a profit. The shadow Treasury team has already met representatives from Extinction Rebellion, the radical environmental protest group, to hear their ideas for addressing the climate crisis. Proposals from the independent Committee on Climate Change, headed by the former Tory minister John Gummer, and from the National Infrastructure Commission have already played a large part in Labour’s thinking, McDonnell said. However, while Labour has committed to the target of reducing carbon emissions to net zero by at least 2050, in line with the government’s aim, there are few policy details to say how it would get there. The review of the City would include commercial banks, investment banks, pension funds, hedge funds, private equity and asset managers to cover areas of the City that often escape scrutiny. Labour has put together a panel to review how the government and the Bank’s new responsibilities can be implemented, including the former head of the civil service Lord Kerslake and the prominent City lawyer Peter Rice. “The UK is and will remain a hub for finance,” McDonnell said. “That gives us all the more responsibility to make sure that the lending that takes place here aids the tackling of the climate crisis rather than fuelling it.” Labour plans to offer a mix of stiffer regulation and tax incentives to promote “large-scale beneficial investment” to support growth. “But we will also fulfil our responsibility to ensure adequate policing of investments using the mechanisms available to us to require companies to live up to their climate change responsibilities,” McDonnell said. The Bank’s monetary policy committee currently sets Britain’s interest rates while its financial policy committee and the Prudential Regulatory Authority oversee the financial stability of the banking sector and City firms. An expansion of the bank’s role to encompass promoting investment and higher levels of productivity while separately supporting Labour’s decarbonisation of the economy would make it the most powerful independent central bank in the developed world. Responding to questions about Labour’s stance on Brexit, McDonnell said he would prefer to campaign to remain in a referendum or general election despite representing a constituency that voted to leave the EU."

"New York state would launch the most progressive policy in the US to combat the climate crisis and one of the most ambitious in the world under a new plan devised by state legislators. The program projects that the state would produce 100% of its electricity from renewable sources by 2040 and reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 85% by 2050.  The proposed legislation, agreed by the state’s Democrat-run senate, faces a vote by the other house of the state legislature, the assembly, in New York’s capital, Albany, on Wednesday. New York’s Democratic governor, Andrew Cuomo who negotiated the proposal with top lawmakers and would have final word over any approved legislation, said it would give New York the nation’s best plan to address the causes of the climate crisis. “Climate change is the issue of our lifetime, frankly,” Cuomo said on public radio on Tuesday morning. The bill’s adoption comes amid the Trump administration’s ongoing dismantling of environmental protections. Trump has especially hampered efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, such as announcing that the US will be leaving the Paris climate agreement. The administration announced on Wednesday that it was finalizing plans to roll back the US government’s only direct efforts, initiated by the Obama administration, to curb coal-fired power plant pollution that is heating the planet. New York – which alleged in a 2018 a lawsuit that the oil giant ExxonMobil misled shareholders about climate change-related legal risks – joins a handful of states who have decided to reduce greenhouse gas emissions on their own, regardless of the federal government’s opposing actions or inaction. Hawaii and California have pledged to generate 100% of their energy from renewable sources by 2045. New York City, Miami, San Francisco and Houston are among the US cities working to fight climate change. “Today marks a historic day for New York state in the fight against climate change,” said Andrea Stewart-Cousins, state senate majority leader, in a statement. “As our leaders in Washington fail to take action, New York needs to lead in this time of great crises for our planet.” If New York state reduced greenhouse gas emissions by 85% by 2050, the remaining 15% would be offset through efforts to remove carbon from the atmosphere, such as planting more trees. In order to reach the emissions reductions goals, New York will have to ramp up production of renewable energy sources, such as solar and wind power, while promoting increased energy efficiency. Environmental advocates supporting the bill said it was a good first step, but that more had to be done; one advocate criticized Cuomo for “watering down” earlier versions of the proposal. “This legislation would move New York in the right direction, but much too slowly,” said Eric Weltman, senior organizer at Food & Water Watch. “The climate crisis demands that New York do more and faster to move off fossil fuels.” Opponents of the bill have claimed that it could prompt job loss and increased energy prices."
"National highest-ever temperature records, typically set in late July or August, are likely to be broken across Europe this week as a potentially deadly early summer heatwave sweeps across the continent. Meteorologists expect previous June highs to be approached and possibly exceeded in Austria, Belgium, the Czech Republic, Denmark, France, Germany, Luxembourg, the Netherlands and Switzerland, with all-time records likely to fall in some countries.  “The latest forecasts leave little room for doubt: we are heading for a new national record,” said Guillaume Woznica, a French forecaster, noting Météo-France was now predicting peaks of 45C (113F) in the southern towns of Nîmes and Carpentras on Friday. The highest reliable June temperature previously recorded in France was 41.5C on 21 June 2003. The country’s highest ever temperature, recorded at two separate locations in southern France on 12 August during the same 2003 heatwave, was 44.1C. “At our local Potsdam station, operating since 1893, we’re set to break the past June record by about 2C,” tweeted Stefan Rahmstorf, of the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research. Eastern parts of Germany, including Berlin, are already experiencing their hottest June on record. High temperatures are expected to climb further throughout the week, from Spain to the Czech Republic, as the combination of a storm stalling over the Atlantic and high pressure over central Europe pulls very hot air northwards from the Sahara. Scientists say heatwaves can be particularly dangerous when they occur in early summer, before people have adjusted to seasonal norms. Europe’s 2003 heatwave resulted in the premature deaths of an estimated 70,000 people. A 2015 report on heatwaves and health, by the World Meteorological Organization and World Health Organization, found early summer heatwaves had been shown to be associated with greater impacts on mortality than later heatwaves of comparable or higher temperatures. A heatmap for France for 27 June, tweeted by the university meteorologist Ruben Hallali, next to the Edvard Munch painting The Scream, was widely shared on social media.

Jamais vu ça en 15 que je regarde des cartes météo #canicule pic.twitter.com/RIJTXiCUh1 From the low to mid-30Cs on Tuesday in parts of Spain, France and Italy, most weather models predict temperatures will rise by Thursday to the low to mid-40Cs in south and central France and north-east Spain, and the upper 30Cs in much of the rest of continental Europe. As authorities placed health services and retirement homes on alert, urged children and older people to stay indoors, handed out free water and recommended vigilance against dehydration and heatstroke, the French president, Emmanuel Macron said: “As you know, at times like these, sick people, pregnant women, infants and elderly people are the most vulnerable. “We must be vigilant and have preventive measures in place in order to intervene as quickly as possible.” France’s health minister, Agnès Buzyn, said the country was better prepared than in the 2003 heatwave, when 15,000 more people died than in a normal summer. “Our plans have got better and better,” she said. “Our alerts are more efficient.” [#Canicule] Des risques existent pour votre santé, adoptez les bons réflexes.🔎 Consultez nos conseils et informations sur : https://t.co/qAfiTZAr3J pic.twitter.com/nQdIrp0ntC Societal change was going to be necessary, Buzyn said. “We will have to change the way we live, the way we act, the way we work, travel, dress … We are going to have to change our habits and stop thinking these episodes are exceptional.” Among the first to be affected have been France’s high-school students, with the national brevet exams, sat by 15-year-olds, postponed by the education minister on safety grounds from Thursday and Friday until early next week. Brussels halted horse-and-carriage rides for tourists because of animal welfare concerns, Le Soir newspaper reported, while in Germany media reported a 32-year-old man in Hemer, outside Düsseldorf, had stripped naked in the frozen food section of his local supermarket in an effort to escape the heat. Rahmstorf said the current heatwave, following unusually high temperatures last summer that caused increased mortality rates, a decline in crop yields and wildfires inside the Arctic Circle, was consistent with climate scientists’ predictions. “Weather data show that heatwaves and other weather extremes are on the rise in recent decades,” he said. “The hottest summers in Europe since the year AD1500 all occurred since the turn of the last century: 2018, 2010, 2003, 2016, 2002.” Monthly records were now falling five times as often as they would in a stable climate, Rahmstorf said, adding this was “a consequence of global warming caused by the increasing greenhouse gases from burning coal, oil and gas”."
"Greenpeace has ended its protest against BP drilling for oil in the North Sea by handing in “people’s climate injunctions” at the company’s headquarters. Greenpeace protesters spent nearly seven days occupying an oil rig rented by BP in the Cromarty Firth in northern Scotland last week, leading to the arrests of 14 activists, including three photographers hired by the pressure group.  After the rig Paul B Loyd Jr set sail on Saturday night, Greenpeace tried to prevent it reaching the Vorlich oilfield 150 miles east of Aberdeen by blocking its route with its ship the Arctic Sunrise. The oil rig evaded the Arctic Sunrise by changing course several times before arriving at its drill site on Wednesday morning. Greenpeace said the rig cost BP £140,000 a day to hire from its operator Transocean, which had nearly 100 oil workers on board during the protests. In a final attempt to obstruct the rig, Greenpeace said one of its swimmers swam into its path. It took her out of the water when the rig came within a nautical mile of her without altering course. Claiming its protest had been a success because it had delayed drilling for 12 days, Greenpeace said it had handed in two “injunctions”, documents mimicking a court order, at BP’s headquarters in Aberdeen and London urging the firm to immediately stop drilling new wells and switch to renewables. Its activists also protested outside BP’s European headquarters in Germany, accusing it of ignoring the climate emergency and breaching its pledges to honour the Paris climate agreement, which requires climate heating to be limited to 1.5C. John Sauven, Greenpeace UK’s executive director, said: “For the past 12 days we’ve seen what one Greenpeace ship and a handful of dedicated activists can achieve in the face of a giant climate-wrecking company. But they weren’t alone. There’s a movement of millions calling on companies like BP to clean up their act and truly address the climate emergency.” Eleven activists have appeared in court charged with disorderly conduct. The three photographers have not been charged. Police Scotland confirmed it had reported Greenpeace to Scottish prosecutors for further direct action on Sunday while the rig was at sea. It is understood Greenpeace inflatable boats are suspected of illegally breaching a 500-metre safety exclusion zone around the rig on Sunday morning. BP said it was glad the protests were over. “Greenpeace’s irresponsible actions have put people and property unnecessarily at risk, and diverted valuable time and resources away from public services,” a spokesman said. “Progress to a lower carbon future will depend on coming together, understanding each other’s perspectives and working to find solutions.”"

Share this...FacebookTwitterThe IPCC corrects projected temperature range for 2100 downwards by 1°C
By Michael Krueger, Science Skeptical
(Translated and edited by P Gosselin)
The IPCC AR5 Summary for Policymakers was released at the end of September, followed some days later by the Working Group 1 Report. The press directed much of its attention to sea level rise, as this magnitude was corrected upwards compared to the last 2007 report.
But the media gave  little attention to the expected temperature increase until 2100 for the various scenarios. Let’s take look at the temperature scenarios of the 2013 report and compare them to those of 2007. Taking a closer look we see a less alarmist picture than what we are told about sea with sea level.
Compared to the IPCC report of 2007, the range for projected temperature for the various scenarios until 2100 were corrected downwards by almost a full degree Celsius in the 2013 report. This is clearly depicted by the side-by-side comparison of the two charts from the respective 4th and 5th climate reports:

Range of projections of 2007 (left), 2013 (right)
In the 4th report (left) the range of the temperature scenarios up to the year 2100 was between 1.1°C (scenario B1, lowest value) and up to 6.4°C (scenario A1Fl, upper value).

google_ad_slot = ""6412247007"";
google_ad_width = 200;
google_ad_height = 200;
//-->




But now in the 5th report (right), the values have been corrected downwards and now range from only 0.2 to 0.3°C (scenario RCP2.6, lowest value) to 5.5°C (scenario RCP8.5, highest value). Thus the range of the temperature scenarios have been corrected downwards by approximately 0.9°C.
Because this is now a less alarming scenario and contradicts the notion of a more rapidly warming world, the media likely shifted their focus over to sea level rise.
In the following comparator the red arrow shows how the range for the temperature scenarios for 2100 was corrected downwards approx. 0.9°C. The latest range starts with a temperature that barely rises over the next 87 years, thus assuring in the future that climate scientists will always be able to say their models were right.

This downward correction was never presented as good news, and the media continue spreading fear and horror.
And with the temperature scenarios being corrected downward, one would logically think that sea level rise would also be less than projected in 2007. But the IPCC sees that in the opposite way. Instead of correcting sea level rise downwards, it jacked them up. Obviously there’s a lot of confusion about the climate system.
Also the absence of global warming over the last 15 years has been insufficiently communicated by the IPCC and the press. Here it is best keep quiet about it rather than uncovering and informing the public.
The press so far has failed to notice that the temperature scenarios and climate sensitivity have been corrected downwards by the IPCC. Yet the fact that both these parameters were corrected downwards is presumably owing to the fact that global temperatures have not risen in 15 years. This is how models and observations can be made to agree.

I’m very pleased to say NoTricksZone played an important role in contributing to the FORBES’ piece.
This is an important issue because many countries in the world are, or are considering, following Germany’s green energy blueprint. Unfortunately, Germany’s approach is tragically a blueprint on how not to overhaul an energy infrastructure.

Will Cooling Temperature And Economic Climates Finally Take The Wind Out Of Failed Energy Policies?
Larry Bell, Contributor
There can be no disputing the fact that despite rising atmospheric carbon dioxide levels, global climate temperatures have been flat for at least the past 16 years, and perhaps a good deal longer. And upon issuing its latest Summary for Policymakers Report (AR5), the UN’s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) has finally been forced to admit that its climate models that predicted an impending global warming crisis have grossly overestimated climate sensitivity to carbon dioxide, a trace “greenhouse gas”.
Such unwarranted alarmism has influenced colossally costly and economically destructive anti-fossil energy policies in the United States, Western Europe, Australia and other regions of world. The question now remains how long it will take before broad segments of these populations realize that they have been duped by unaffordable and unreliable climate benefit-premised “green energy” promotions. …

The storm is ‘unprecedented for the past 50 years, with two metres (almost seven feet) of snow falling since Friday,” a Mazandaran provincial official said, quoted by the media.”
German site wetter.net here writes:

Parts of southern Europe like Austria and Slovenia have seen heavy snowfalls and ice storms. The USA has also been hard hit by polar conditions this winter. James Spann tweets that 4406 U.S. cold weather records for the U.S. in January – 1073 snowfall records: pic.twitter.com/9krTAp5Fue.
These events all fly in the face of warnings issued by climatologists who 10 years ago warned of snowless winters becoming increasingly the norm. Turns out precisely the opposite is occurring. Places all over the globe are seeing snow like they have not seen in decades.

"Last night I asked the five candidates vying to be our next prime minister whether they would commit to taking the radical and drastic action necessary to tackle climate change. You may have realised from my reaction to the answers they gave that I was not impressed. As I listened to them fail to answer my question, I kept thinking, “one of these men is going to be our prime minister, the leader of this country in just a few weeks”. And I reflected on what I have been taught about leadership.  Aren’t real leaders meant to make decisions to protect the most vulnerable people in our communities? Aren’t real leaders supposed to be brave and courageous? Aren’t real leaders ultimately supposed tell us the truth? But instead we hear them say time and time again that climate change is “important” to them, that they will make it “central to their programme” if they are in government. At the same time they continue talking about their intentions to expand airports, cut support for renewable technology and set targets that are way too far away to make a meaningful difference. What they fail to realise, as I pointed out on the debate programme, is that climate change is not an issue for tomorrow, it’s an issue of today. Today, there are people all over the world who are already suffering from the devastating consequences of our inaction: droughts, heatwaves, cyclones and wildfires. Today, we’re seeing how countries are treating immigrants and those seeking asylum with intolerance and hatred. Today, we’re seeing the loss of thousands of species of plants and animals, yet those in positions of power continue to absolve their responsibilities. Over the past few months, the YouthStrike4Climate movement has drastically shifted the narrative around the climate crisis, and we’re not going to stop striking until they all commit to taking the necessary action. The UK Student Climate Network has been very clear; declaring a climate emergency is just the first step. We want to totally decarbonise the economy of the UK through a government-led, 10-year mobilisation for a just and prosperous transition which must include the infrastructure needed to benefit all communities and workers. We want to see millions of new well-paid, meaningful and secure jobs created across the UK, in communities like mine, in Glasgow, where we vitally need them. We want a Green New Deal that can protect vital natural habitats. My message is clear, this isn’t a problem for the future, it’s one for today. We need commitments now, otherwise we will continue to hurt countries across the world that are already suffering the worst consequences of climate breakdown. Last night demonstrated that none of the candidates on offer have a clear plan for how to address the climate crisis. Away from the headlines and jibes on social media, this is the opportunity for any one of them to step up and distinguish themselves as a climate leader. I would suggest they listen to the youngest in our society who are not only leading the way but channelling the energy many have for climate action into something tangible. We have the technology and we have the resources, we now need the right leader and some political will. With the UK looking likely to be the host of the next UN climate change conference (COP26) in 2020, it’s the perfect platform. Which of the five candidates to be our next prime minister will lead the UK into those climate negotiations? And which of them has the courage to do the right thing? It’s no understatement to suggest this could literally be our last chance. So, to whoever our next prime minister is, I won’t be impressed until I see more than just words. • Erin Curtis is a youth striker from Glasgow and part of the UK Student Climate Network • Comments on this piece are premoderated to ensure discussion remains on topics raised by the writer.

"An ethical investment operation by the UK’s largest asset manager has dumped shares in a string of US companies it has deemed climate crisis laggards, including oil giant ExxonMobil and insurer Metlife. Legal and General Investment Management (LGIM) said it had cut five companies – ExxonMobil, Metlife, Spam maker Hormel Foods, US retailer Kroger and Korean Electric Power Corporation – from its umbrella of ethical investment funds worth a total of £5bn. LGIM added the climate laggards to a list which already includes China Construction Bank, carmaker Subaru, Japan Post Holdings, Canadian retailer Loblaw, US food and service conglomerate Sysco Corporation and Russian oil giant Rosneft, which is part-owned by BP. The asset manager monitors companies across six major sectors: oil and gas; mining; electric utilities; carmakers; food retailers; and finance. Meryam Omi, head of responsible investment at LGIM, said investor engagement with companies can be “a powerful tool” if there are “consequences”. L&G retains shareholdings in the blacklisted companies at other funds in its £1tn investment empire and will now use those shares to vote against board appointments at the named and shamed businesses. “Talks without action are no longer fit for purpose given the urgency to address climate change,” she said. “This is no fad. The world is truly in the midst of a climate emergency, which could have drastic consequences for markets, companies and, therefore, our clients’ assets.” LGIM expects all companies to disclose their exposure to the climate crisis and set targets for reducing the carbon-intensity of their operations as part of its 2016 climate impact pledge. The investment firm warned earlier this year that the world is facing “a climate catastrophe” unless companies act, and last year said it voted against a record number of boards which are not doing enough. Omi said the investor is doing “a huge amount” to urge clients to follow the example of its ethical funds by divesting from carbon-intensive companies to protect against the financial risk of climate breakdown. She said there is also a “powerful opportunity” for investors which remain shareholders of polluting companies to use their voting power to help change the organisation. The money manager said US companies have proved the most challenging to engage with on climate concerns. LGIM said the nation is divided between companies firmly committed to tackling climate issues, and a disproportionate number of companies among the lowest-scoring of its report. Donald Trump has vowed to pull out of the Paris climate agreement, in contrast to many US states and cities which are making strides in holding fossil fuel companies to account for the climate crisis. Overall, LGIM believes there is less willingness among US companies to make even incremental changes because they are not under the same pressure to take climate action because it is not expected by US investors. ExxonMobil, the world’s largest listed oil company, emerged as the leading climate laggard in this year’s tally after refusing to report its own carbon emissions or set targets to reduce them. Omi said these measures are the minimum LGIM would like to see from a company “with a huge footprint”. Meanwhile, LGIM praised US oil company Occidental Petroleum which was reinstated as an investment candidate after landing on the laggard list last year. The report said Occidental has shown “a step change” in its climate engagement by measuring and disclosing its total carbon emissions and announcing plans to set emissions targets by the end of the year. Occidental also plans to spend $36bn (£32bn) to buy a shale oil company, Anadarko, in one of the largest US shale deals of recent years. LGIM said it plans to escalate its climate criteria in the years ahead. "

"Environment campaigners have warned that Scotland will lose vital legal safeguards because ministers have failed to ensure environment and pollution laws will be properly enforced after Brexit. They said ministers in Edinburgh had refused repeated requests to table new legislation to guarantee citizens and campaigners in Scotland the same rights they now had under European law.  WWF Scotland, the conservation group, said this meant it would be much harder – if the UK left the EU – for campaigners to legally challenge the Scottish government for failing to uphold air quality standards, or to stop wildlife being culled by Scottish Natural Heritage, a government agency, before other dispersal methods were tried. In an open letter published by the Guardian, many of Scotland’s leading conservation and civic groups have urged Nicola Sturgeon, the first minister, to introduce an environment act guaranteeing that legal rights available within the EU continue after Brexit. The letter, signed by 16 bodies including the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds, WWF, Scottish Council for Voluntary Organisations, National Trust for Scotland and Royal Scottish Geographic Society, said the climate emergency added to the need for legislation. Organised by the umbrella group Scottish Environment Link, the letter says: “Nicola Sturgeon has acknowledged that our planet faces a climate emergency. Inextricably linked to this is growing ecological crisis. “We must not let Brexit derail us from tackling these huge global challenges head on. Whatever the outcome of the current political uncertainties we need robust, binding, targets for the recovery of Scotland’s natural environment, to safeguard both nature and people.” Its signatories want the new act to create an independent regulator to police government and public agency decisions, and enforce environmental laws to at least the same standard as the EU’s. They also want principles of environmental law used by the EU enshrined in Scots law, and binding targets set to improve and protect the environment. Under EU law any citizen can go, for free, to the European commission to challenge a government’s or agency’s failure to uphold EU law. The commission can investigate and take enforcement action, including taking the member state to the European court of justice. Those powers have been used at EU level by the legal group Client Earth to make the UK enforce air pollution regulations; by the RSPB to halt a cull of barnacle geese on Islay, sanctioned by Scottish Natural Heritage; and again by the RSPB, to protect peatlands in England. Michael Gove, the UK environment secretary, is planning to introduce similar procedures after Brexit to cover environmental legal enforcement in England. The Labour-run Welsh government, which like Holyrood has devolved responsibilities for the environment, is involved in that process. Although the UK, Scottish and Welsh governments have cooperated closely on measures to transpose EU environment regulation into UK and Scots law, ministers in Edinburgh have refused to cooperate with Gove’s plans for new regulatory measures. So the Scottish government’s own expert advisory panel and the Royal Society of Edinburgh, Scotland’s national academy, have urged ministers to set up the independent regulator, as sought by the letter’s signatories. Roseanna Cunningham, the Scottish environment secretary, responded to the letter by insisting her government was committed to matching or exceeding the EU’s environment laws, but she refused to confirm it would introduce a new environment act or oversight agency. She said: “While our choice would be to remain fully within EU governance systems our approach will ensure we remain true to the EU environmental principles and ensure governance that fit Scottish needs, circumstances and ambitions. I welcome the continuing involvement of environmental NGOs and civil society in Scotland in this work.” Lang Banks, the director of WWF Scotland, said: “Citizens have a right to raise concerns but we now risk losing the ability to freely access environmental justice. We are in a climate emergency, we’re in the midst of a biodiversity crisis, and this is the point where we need to be ramping up our environmental protections. Brexit means we risk losing the protections we currently have, when we need them most.” • This article was amended on 27 June 2019. An earlier version referred to a legal process to stop wildlife being “inhumanely culled” by Scottish National Heritage. The word “inhumanely” has been removed, and text added to more accurately reflect the situation."
"Prof David King, the former chief scientist, has expressed alarm at the prospect of Boris Johnson becoming prime minister because the Tory MP oversaw “devastating” cuts in efforts to tackle the climate crisis when he was foreign secretary and then wanted to hush them up. King was serving as the UK special representative for climate change when Johnson was appointed foreign secretary. He told the Guardian that Johnson’s term in office coincided with a 60% cut in his team of climate attaches across the world from 165 to just 65. “The cuts began with the new incoming permanent secretary, which was just before Boris Johnson in early 2016,” King said. But Johnson did not stop or reverse the cuts. “The cuts were devastating because it was just at the point that we had to deliver the Paris agreement.” They meant the UK lost its global leadership role in climate negotiations, King added. In a one-to-one meeting in 2017, when King was about leave his post, Johnson claimed he knew nothing about the reduction in posts and urged King not to go public with his concerns. Recalling the conversation after raising the 60% cut, King said: “He said something like: ‘Good God, I didn’t know that.’ He then said: ‘You’re not going to spill this all out to the media?’” King, who had to sign a two-year non-disclosure agreement when he left the government in March 2017, agreed not to talk to the media about the issue if no more cuts were made. In return he said Johnson gave him a “wonderful farewell speech at the Foreign Office praising me for doing more on climate change than any other individual”. King said there was a mismatch between Johnson’s commitments in private and his lack of public commitment on the climate crisis, which have continued in the current leadership campaign. He said: “During his time in the Foreign Office, Boris Johnson never made a speech on climate change … There was a contrast between Johnson’s farewell speech to me and his action. I really tried to encourage him to make speeches on climate change and it never transpired.” Asked if he was worried by Johnson’s friendship with the climate denier Donald Trump, King said: “Aren’t we all? It’s extremely concerning.” He added: “The issue of Boris Johnson and climate change has not been clarified so far in the discussion around the leadership of the Conservative party. “It would give me tremendous comfort to know that we do have a prime minister coming in who is prepared to stick to a commitment on climate change. That’s been an all-party commitment since 2008. It could come undone by simply not saving anything or by reducing our ability to deliver which is really what happened in the Foreign Office. And in that process explicitly ignoring this enormous challenge to civilisation.” He also claimed that Johnson misled the public during his time as London mayor about King’s agreement to chair an inquiry into building a London airport in the Thames estuary. King said he backed using islands in the Thames to protect London from flooding, adding: “I said I’m happy to look at the future use of the Thames estuary, but I said we’ve got to take care of rising sea levels, you can’t start constructing large cities’ terminuses if you are then going to be faced with future flooding. “He stepped out to the media and said: ‘Sir David has agreed to chair the commission into the future of an airport in the Thames estuary,’ literally minutes after we had reached that agreement. My report saying we shouldn’t do it was never published.” Asked if Johnson had been dishonest he said: “There is no other word for it. When I challenged him he hit the top of his head and said: ‘Oh God, sorry. I didn’t mean to do that.’ Of course he meant it.” King, who was chief scientific adviser under Tony Blair and Gordon Brown, also revealed he was repeatedly blocked from talking to the media during his second stint in government as climate envoy under David Cameron and Theresa May. He said: “When I was brought back, William Hague – then foreign secretary – said we need you back as a talking head, because we need to get the information out to the public on climate change. The week after I had requests from the media to appear. And virtually every single request was turned out. The turning down was not from the communications office in the Foreign Office or from Hague, but from No 10. So, I am assuming that whoever was advising No 10 on their political campaigning must have been saying that climate change is not a vote-winner.” King added: “It was absurd. Here was Britain doing more than almost the rest of the world put together on this issue and I’m kept off the public airwaves.” A spokesman for Johnson pointed to comments he had made to the ConservativeHome website. When asked if the UK should set a zero carbon target by 2050, Johnson said: “Yes we should set ourselves a challenging target. Even if it looks tough to deliver today, the technology is changing and improving the whole time. I believe in the Promethean power of the human race to solve its problems – and Britain can be in the lead in coming up with the answers. When I was mayor of London we saw huge growth in population and GDP, and yet cut CO2 by 14%.”"
"In the salt marshes and estuaries of New England, the most dominant and fearsome predator is a voracious invader that grows to just inches and lays waste to everything in its path. The European green crab first arrived in the new world more than 200 years go, smuggling itself to American shores in the ballast holds of transatlantic ships.  But as the climate emergency warms the bountiful Gulf of Maine faster than 99% of the world’s ocean, the tiny crustacean is now seemingly unstoppable as its population grows unchecked. Along Maine’s long, wrinkled coastline, the climate crisis gives and the climate crisis takes. The warming waters have provided the ideal environment for lobsters, leading to large and profitable hauls. But green crabs have taken hold, devastating soft-shell clam populations depended on for food and income, cutting their harvest to the lowest levels in nearly 90 years while simultaneously destroying eelgrass habitats that serve as nurseries for young fish. For communities that depend on the Gulf of Maine, conversations are shifting from how to stop the warming to how to cope with it. “We’re not going to stop the warming now,” says Marissa McMahan, a fisheries scientist with Manomet, a New England not-for-profit that focuses on sustainability and climate crisis. “We have to accept this is the reality, that the Gulf of Maine is going to be different in 10 or 20 years … and we have to figure out ways to adapt and live with that.” McMahan is now part of an effort to promote green crabs as a source of food and researching other potential uses for them. As the ecosystem gets upended, she and others hope to turn the green crab into dollars and calories – and perhaps slow the damage they are doing. “ Nothing has evolved yet or appeared yet to act as a predator in terms of keeping their population in check,” said Roger Warner, a writer based in Ipswich, Massachusetts, who founded the Green Crab R&D Project. “So humans will have to be the predators.” The crabs have been most disruptive to soft-shell clams, a valuable food source dug up by clammers from the mud at low tide in marshes and estuaries in New England.  In Maine, soft-shell clam harvests have fallen off significantly over the past three decades. Brian Beal, a professor of marine ecology at the University of Maine at Machias, said that his research has found that as much as 99% of clams in many parts of Maine are dying before they reach adulthood. Many of those are eaten by green crabs. Further south in Ipswich, Massachusetts, the town pays a bounty of $0.40 per pound on green crabs, hoping to save the clams which – for those who eat them in the US – put the town on the map. Ipswich shellfish constable Scott LaPreste says the town is currently hauling up about 75,000 pounds of green crabs a year under the program. “In the past, what we depended on was really cold winters” to control the crab population, he said. “With the warming of the winters now, we’re not getting that die-off you would expect every winter.” McMahan, the Manomet scientist, first started thinking about green crabs when an art conservator from her native Maine island of Georgetown contacted her after feasting on similar green crabs in Venice, Italy. He wanted to know if people back home were eating them. Americans tend to eat large crabs with lots of meat that offer a big reward for the work of breaking through their shells. At first glance, the green crab looks like too much work for too little meat. But in Venice, green crab is a delicacy, fried up when the crab briefly sheds its hard exoskeleton to grow and eaten whole. In 2017, McMahan and her partner, lobsterman Chris Jamison, traveled to Venice to see how the crab industry worked there. And last summer, Jamison began trapping green crabs and selling molting ones to coastal Maine restaurants at $3 a piece while using other ones as lobster bait. Last fall, Manomet was awarded a quarter-million-dollar grant from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration to work towards creating a green crab market. Warner, the Green Crab R&D founder, envisions a green crab market. Molting crabs would be sold to restaurants and consumers, pulling in the highest price per crab. Meanwhile, non-molting crabs could be boiled into stock or used as flavoring. Then their shells could be used as compost; Warner is hoping to explore their potential as a fertilizer for cannabis, which is now legal in both Massachusetts and Maine. Crab roe is another potential moneymaker while some of the crabs being collected by Manomet were destined to be dog food. “People will and can trap for green crabs alongside clamming, but they need the payoff,” said Warner. “That’s why we’re working on inventing these products.” Maine fishermen once went after different species every season which meant a poor catch of one would not mean ruin. But over the years, those fisheries have mostly disappeared. Today, lobster is the dominant catch, but it is anticipated that if waters continue to warm, it too may become less productive. Fishermen such as Jamison say they see the Gulf of Maine changing in real time: he sees more typically tropical fish, lobsters are abundant and a few years ago, he saw a great white shark – rare in Maine’s waters. But while some promoting green crabs as a food source hope their efforts can restore clam populations, Beal, the University of Maine at Machias professor, believes that is unlikely. “The most damage that’s occurring by green crabs on soft-shell clams is by crabs that are smaller than your thumbnail,” he said. “There’s no way you can trap crabs that are the size of your thumbnail.” Beal calls the green crab the “consummate invader” due to its ability to “out-reproduce anything else” as well as its breadth of habitat and diet. Meanwhile, Manomet is currently exploring clam aquaculture – clam farming – that could give the shellfish better chances of surviving to adulthood and making it to the dinner plate. But on a recent Thursday morning, McMahan remained focused on the crabs as she and two graduate students measured and catalogued the angry crustaceans on a dock in Georgetown. They looked at the underside of the crabs for signs that they were about to molt – and separated those ready to shed their exoskeleton so they wouldn’t be eaten by the others once they lost their armor. McMahan says introducing a new sea food is an uphill battle in a part of the country where fish that have long disappeared from the Gulf of Maine – such as cod and haddock – are still favorites at the supermarket. But as the water warms, she says seafood consumers will have to adjust to reality.  “We need to just fundamentally think differently about seafood and what we eat – and what is seafood and what’s good – because it’s changing. We’re going to have different things on our plate going forward,” she said."

Share this...FacebookTwitterCorrection: A reader has pointed out that the paper is an analysis of some models which shows albedo, often claimed by alarmists as the primary Arctic climate driving factor, is not the number one Arctic amplifier after all, as skeptics have long maintained. The paper itself says nothing about the integrity of models, and thus the title above has been changed.
On model integrity, climate models have been compared to observations, see here and here. The results speak for themselves.
==============================
Spiegel here reports on a paper appearing in Nature titled: Arctic amplification dominated by temperature feedbacks in contemporary climate models – by Felix Pithan and Thorsten Mauritsen of the Max Planck Institute for Meteorology in Hamburg.
Hat-tip: DirkH
Climate science often claims that nowhere is the climate changing faster than in the Arctic. Scientists have often attributed these changes to albedo effects. But the new study finds that amplification can also occur without changes in albedo. Spiegel writes that the authors, based on an analysis of models, found the largest contribution to Arctic amplification comes from a temperature feedback, where at lower latitudes warmed air rises faster and more easily than it does in the Arctic. As the surface warms, more energy is radiated back to space in low latitudes than in the Arctic. Thus polar air radiates less heat out into space than tropical air does.
In a nutshell, the two authors have found that the primary amplification factor is the “stolidness” of Arctic air, and less so albedo. In the Arctic warmed air tends to remain more at the surface and heat does not escape as readily.

Spiegel writes:
To balance out the radiation budget at an ambient temperature of 30°C, an increase of 0.16° is enough. However at minus 30°C, an increase of 0.31 °C would be needed, i.e. almost double, which gives Pithan und Mauritsen cause for thought. According to their calculations the lower start temperature in the Arctic is an important reason for the more rapid temperature increase in the Arctic compared to the tropics.”
They found that the surface albedo feedback is only the second main contributor to Arctic amplification, and that other contributions are substantially smaller or even oppose Arctic amplification.
This casts many of the assumptions made in earlier climate models deep into doubt. It’s back to the drawing board (again) for the modelers.
For a science that is more than 95% certain, we sure do see quite a steady stream of surprises with each passing day.
UPDATE: As reader Kurt points out, the claims made by the authors are based on “model simulations”. And we know that over 97% (114/117) of the models have completely missed the barn since 2000.  So if models cannot tell us the temperature, what could they possibly say about the mechanisms driving climate?

Share this...FacebookTwitterThe online Ria Novosti news service has a report on the 30 activists who Russian officials have locked up for allegedly trespassing and attempting to storm onto a platform facility in the Arctic last month.
According to the latest report from Ria Novosti, the Russians are now “hinting at drug charges against the Greenpeace activists” and that they are considering pressing charges that could lead to life sentences for some of them. The Russians aren’t fooling around and they are playing major league hardball. Obviously some people out in the ‘open and tolerant’ west are having a hard time understanding the situation.
Hat tip: John from Quebec.
Perhaps the threats of life in prison are in response to the combative tones coming from Greenpeace bosses lately. For example Greenpeace’s international executive director, Kumi Naidoo, declared that the world needs people who are “prepared to go to prison, put their lives on the line if necessary, in the struggle for climate justice and addressing the reality of runaway catastrophic climate change.”
Well, if activists are willing to put their lives on the line for Greenpeace causes and are incapable of reasonable dialogue, then perhaps it is indeed best to keep them locked up.
Strangely, Greenpeace seems to be convinced that it can use protests to “out-bully” Russia. Good luck with that.
According to Ria Novosti, investigators on Wednesday said that substances presumed to be poppy straw and morphine “have been found on board a Greenpeace ship seized last month“. This, Ria Novosti writes, raises “the threat of new charges against a group of activists and journalists awaiting trial on suspicion of piracy.”
Moreover, “investigators were trying to determine which of the detainees had ‘intentionally rammed’ border guards’ boats – an act that could constitute an assault on the ‘life and health’ of officials. Under Russian law, the punishment for this crime could range from 12 years to life in prison.”

Ramming into ships? Gee, like this is something Greenpeace would never ever do. Actually, the Russians caught Greenpeace red-handed doing just that. Reader Observer found the following video of a Greenpeace boat ramming the smaller of the Russian coast guard boats:

Moreover all the shows of moral indignation by European officials, haughtily implying that Russia is a sort of a despotic state, likely made things worse.
My advice to Greenpeace and Greenpeace-huggers is that they should tone down their belligerent and condescending rhetoric quite a few levels, and begin to consider that perhaps the activists were acting illegally after all. Humility sometimes is not a bad thing. It can be learned – the easy way, or the hard way.
Yes, we know that admitting you’ve erred is something that is totally foreign to the infallible Greenpeace – but now it’s something they need to learn how to do very quickly.
Life in prison – that sure would send a clear message to those with comprehension disabilities.
==============================
UPDATE: Here’s a letter Naidoo has sent to Putin, asking if he could be meet face-to-face on the world stage with Putin. Talk about being publicity-hungry. From the letter, he definitely has toned it down. But it doesn’t look like he’s aware of the boat ramming escapade his “peaceful” activists have indulged in – see video below.

Share this...FacebookTwitterOn Consensus
By Ed Caryl
This is in response to comments made by reader G Mitchell.
We are constantly told that there is a consensus in climate science that CO2 is warming the planet, or the deep ocean, (or something) and that if we do not limit CO2 something bad will happen. As one can easily see, there is no consensus on the two “somethings” in that first sentence. We are told that CO2 is responsible for warming, cooling, less rainfall, more rainfall, less snow, more snow, less ice, more ice, more hurricanes, fewer hurricanes, more tornados, fewer tornados, and so on. Each of those things can also be good or bad, (but mostly bad) depending on where and when they happen. The “consensus” seems to morph to whatever bad thing the writer wants to prove. This isn’t climatology, it’s calamitology.
The appeal to authority is scientific fallacy 
The “Appeal To Authority” fallacy is used in each case to back up the claim. The “Trust me, I’m a Climate Scientist” fallacy is constantly used in either the first or second person. It should be pointed out that the title “Climate Scientist” is always self-bestowed, thus is as ephemeral and fallacious as the consensus.
One claim is that “97%” or “99%” of peer reviewed climate science papers support the Catastrophic Anthropogenic Global Warming (CAGW) meme. The first problem with this claim is that getting a paper past the gauntlet of peer review in many climate related journals requires bowing to the requirement for some mention of “global warming” or “climate change” or whatever phrase de jour.
Again and again we find papers that have little or nothing to do with climate change containing those phrases. There are over a thousand peer-reviewed papers taking the converse position. There are also papers cited as supporting CAGW that do not, in fact, support the premise. Fortunately, there are people keeping track of these. I direct the reader to here and here as just two collections.
No agreement on sensitivity means no consensus

There are several “facts” used to back up the claims by “Climate Science”. But there is no consensus on any of these. Climate sensitivity is the first and most important claim as it is the entire underpinning to the argument. There is no agreement on climate sensitivity, there are only opinions. Does the doubling of CO2 content in the atmosphere result in warming? If so how much? Opinions range from some small negative number to above six degrees C, including, of course, the number zero. Even the IPCC cannot settle on a number; the latest iteration being from 1.5 to 4.5°C. A range of three cannot be described as a consensus. The large numbers depend on there being a large positive feedback, as the basic radiation physics of CO2 alone describes a sensitivity of 1°C. The stumbling block of course is the unknown effect of water vapor and clouds. Water vapor is the other (and dominant) greenhouse gas.
No agreement on CO2 lifetime means no consensus
Another “fact” is CO2 lifetime in the atmosphere. This is described in peer-reviewed papers as from less than 7 years to over a hundred, the larger number of course, is used to predict doom. This is hardly a consensus.
Other “facts” in dispute include how much natural variability contribute to observed warming. Ocean cycles and solar variability are two important and heavily argued contributors. Volcanism, natural and man-produced aerosols are others. There is hardly a consensus in this area either. For some recent opinions, go here.
The “Appeal To Authority” and “Ad Hominem” attack fallacies are also used to put down the contribution of skeptical blogs and those that write for and comment on them. It is as if those that do not “believe” are refused a license to think. This is the crux of the problem. This is the reaction of the religious, not scientists. No other scientific field so denies the amateur a place. Why is this so? Follow the money.
Climate science does not require a specialist; it requires a generalist. The knowledge needed crosses all the boundaries. Knowledge in chemistry, physics, geology, biology, botany, mathematics, computers, literature, and library science are all needed, not specialist knowledge, general knowledge. The underlying data and principles involved are not difficult to understand. Anyone widely read in these fields can make a contribution, if they keep an open mind and just think.
My own contributions here are not intended as revealed truth, that would be a religious view. They are suggestions based on the data as found, meant to stimulate thought. This is the basis of science.

Share this...FacebookTwitterWhat implications could a low-activity sun have on earth? Fritz Vahrenholt’s and Frank Bosse’s latest solar report.
===============================================
The Sun in December 2013: Coming Back To Life
By Frank Bosse and Fritz Vahrenholt
Translated and edited by P Gosselin)
For solar observers there was quite a bit of activity last month, namely sunspots, and not too few of them. Activity even reached 84% of the mean value calculated from cycles 1-23. With an official SSN (sunspot number) of 90.3 the sun reached a second peak in December 2013, see the following chart:

Figure 1: Comparison of solar cycle 24 activity to the mean value of the previously observed cycles and to that of solar cycle 5.
As far as sunspot activity is concerned, the peak was comparable to what we observed 25 months ago (November 2011), but this time most activity occurring in the sun’s southern hemisphere: 82%. In the sun’s first cycle 24 outbreak, most of the activity happened in the northern hemisphere. To compare the activity of the current cycle to that of past solar cycles, we plot the sunspot anomalies from the mean for the number of sunspots up to 61 months into the cycle (blue curve in Figure 1). This yields Figure 2:

Figure 2: Accumulated number of sunspots since the beginning of the cycle, taking modified method of counting before 1945 though the “Waldmeier- Discontinuity” (see Cliver et al. 2013). Cycle 24 so far is the 5th least active cycle in over 250 years.
The low level of activity of the Dalton Minimum at the start of the 19th century is plain to see, as well as the rather relatively subdued activity that followed until about 1950. Then there was a significant increase until cycle 23 which heralded a drop that is now continuing today. Single months with increased activity hardly change the overall trend. As before we are currently seeing the lowest level of solar activity in terms of sunspots in the last 170 years.

So just what are sunspots?
From the sun’s moving plasma, magnetic fields are generated and they are able to strongly impact the energy flow in the sun’s upper convective layer.

Figure 3: The sun’s general structure. At the core the energy is generated by nuclear fusion. This energy is transported outwards by radiation, and then by convection through moving plasma. Source: Wikipedia. Kelvinsong: This file is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 3.0 Unported license.
These fields can cause convective energy flux to reduce locally, and so dark spots form on the sun’s surface. When that happens multiple times at nearby regions, different poled magnetic field lines interfere with each other and a short circuit is created. As a result the magnetic fields collapse and the pent up energy can suddenly burst. This is what we call a so-called flare – a solar explosion. When it is powerful enough, solar material gets ejected out into space with such violence that it literally escapes the sun’s gravitational field and flies out into space. This is the so-called coronal mass ejection (CME). It can have adverse consequences should it strike the earth and the material cloud reacts with the earth’s magnetic field and strong fluctuations occur. These in turn induce large currents within conductors at the earth’s surface (geomagnetic storms).
Our networked world is thus more prone to such events than 60 years ago. Power and communication networks and satellite outages can have consequences. However, very often such risks do not occur because several conditions have to be present before a serious outage takes place. A discussion on the impacts of CMEs in cycle 24 was held in December 2013 at the autumn American Geophysical Union conference. It was determined that that the latest geomagnetic storms have been really low in strength compared to what we observed before. They are even faster than they were in previous cycles. That can be traced back to a 40% reduced counter-pressure in the corona (see Figure 3). As a result the CMEs were able to move faster, yet have less impact. You can see the video of the presentation on the subject here.

On the other hand one can conclude: The reduced solar activity since 2006 reduced the density of the corona by a considerable amount. This not only has great impacts at the sun’s surface, but also out within the sun’s sphere of influence, which is also where the earth happens to orbit. So we can continue to wait with suspense what will be discovered next. Should it end up (as many scientists suspect) that solar activity continues to decline until the middle of the century, then there remains lots of potential. As Leif Svaalgard says at the end of the video: “None of us alive have ever seen such a weak cycle.”
Interesting times!

"The aviation industry is not in carbon “denial” (Stop Heathrow expansion to save the planet, Editorial, 24 June). We are carbon emitters – and we are making huge efforts to reduce our 2% share of global carbon emissions. In 2009 we set tough CO2 targets, including carbon-neutral growth from 2020 and to cut emissions to half of 2005 levels by 2050. Achieving these aims will bring aviation in line with the Paris climate target. Taxation is a red herring – not a penny of the billions raised in air passenger duty has been ringfenced for environmental action. Your editorial was dismissive of offsetting, hybrid and electric aviation, and sustainable fuels, but these are precisely the innovations that will reduce each traveller’s carbon footprint. Governments should work urgently with the aviation industry to prioritise bringing these forward. Rather than seek to punish those who fly, the focus should be on giving more people the opportunity to sustainably travel and do business around the world.Alexandre de JuniacDirector general and CEO, International Air Transport Association, Geneva, Switzerland  • UK aviation fully recognises the urgency of the climate crisis, and the need for us to do more. In 2009, aviation committed globally to a 50% emissions reduction by 2050 compared to 2005. We’ve seen real progress: cleaner aircraft and smarter flying has resulted in a 3.5% emissions reduction in UK aviation emissions between 2005-2017, while passenger numbers grew 25%. Our long-term plan to decarbonise includes many exciting technological innovations, like electric aircraft, but it is right that these aren’t the full answer. So we are making changes to how we operate. UK airspace – designed in the 1950s – is finally being modernised, using satellite-based navigation to fly more direct routes. This would reduce UK aviation’s emissions by up to 10% by (while cutting delays and reducing noise)2050. BA and Virgin Atlantic are investing in sustainable aviation fuels, made from landfill waste and waste industrial gasses respectively. These result in 70% less lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions than fossil jet fuel and will be a vital “bridge” to electric aircraft. We already are part of “a global commitment” to “limit catastrophic temperature rises”: through the UN’s CORSIA offsetting scheme international aviation emissions will be capped at 2020 levels. Crucially, CORISA will facilitate further international steps consistent with the Paris agreement. Our journey towards carbon-neutral aviation will not be easy, but ultimately, the choice between a thriving aviation sector and protecting our climate is a false one.Tim Alderslade Chief executive, Airlines UKKaren Dee Chief executive, Airport Operators Association • Simon Jenkins (Heathrow’s third runway plan beggars belief, 20 June) focused on the volume of leisure and commercial travel. He omitted the third source of passengers, and one that, while it fits the airlines’ business model, offers very few benefits to west Londoners and south-east England in general. According to Heathrow’s own data, a total of 80.1 million passengers used the airport in 2018, of whom 24 million, or almost one third, were in transit. While transit passengers by definition contribute little to the massive infrastructure and disruption linked to the project’s road transport plan, they add little to the overall economy other than the sale of millions of coffees, over-priced meals and duty-free booze and fags. This is a high price for increased air and noise pollution and blighted housing stock for – as Mr Jenkins notes – a 20th-century edifice that may well be redundant before the first aircraft lands on the new runway.Gavin GreenwoodBrighton • Join the debate – email guardian.letters@theguardian.com • Read more Guardian letters – click here to visit gu.com/letters • Do you have a photo you’d like to share with Guardian readers?

"The bosses at Heathrow must have been visiting another planet last week, or else they missed the government memo about legislating for net zero emissions by 2050. The plans unveiled today for a 50% expansion in the airport by 2050, including a third runway, all to be done in “a sustainable way”, take dissembling to new levels. Heathrow is already the largest single source of carbon emissions in the UK.  The outline plans reveal the scale of what’s proposed: building a tunnel for the M25, rerouting rivers, building enormous carparks outside the perimeter of the current airport, destroying local villages. The government itself says nearly a million households will be affected by the third runway, which will allow another 700 flights a day. Heathrow’s owners maintain that the airport’s expansion will not significantly alter the UK’s emissions, but only reach this conclusion by excluding international aviation emissions. That suggests they missed another memo, this time from the committee on climate change which has said emissions from international aviation should be formally included in the UK’s climate targets. Carbon pollution from flying in Europe has risen 26% in the past five years – far outpacing any other transport mode. And, while the UK economy has reduced its carbon emissions by 37% since 1990, CO2 from international aviation has increased by around 130%. The government’s own draft aviation strategy is a perfect example of its have-your-cake-and-eat-it approach. The condition attached to this strategy – “provided that growth takes place in a sustainable way, with actions to mitigate the environmental impacts” – is simply unachievable. The IPCC has already warned us that we have only 11 years left to slash global emissions in half, if we are to achieve the Paris agreement goal of limiting global warming to 1.5C. There is no technological magic wand which is going to transform aviation’s dependence on fossil fuels in this time. We are unlikely to see a single electric aircraft big enough to carry passengers any further than the distances easily reached by train until after 2050. And while new aircraft engines are certainly more efficient than the old ones they replace, the environmental benefit is more than wiped out by the expansion in the number of flights. An official strategy which not only wants to build a third runway at Heathrow but also expand regional airports is not going to rein in airline emissions – which raises the question of whether the government is serious about reducing the UK’s carbon emissions, let alone reaching net zero. And the plan to rely on international carbon offsets to balance the carbon books (as the legislation allows) is simply deceitful. Carbon offsetting will not deliver the net zero future that the science tells us we need to achieve, since all sectors in all countries will need to get as close as possible to zero emissions, and there’s a limit to how much remaining CO2 we can hope to soak up with new forests. The truth is that aviation growth and our expectation of cheap flights cannot continue. The draft aviation strategy is an opportunity to address this, starting with a commitment to ensuring aviation makes a fair contribution to actual reductions in UK carbon emissions. That means capping aviation emissions at current levels as a first step, cancelling plans for airport expansion, and investing in alternatives so that short- to medium-distance travel by train become attractive and affordable for all. This is not only a carbon emissions issue. The unsustainable growth in demand for flights is being driven to a significant extent by a minority of wealthy individuals, raising the issue of inequality and fairness too. About 70% of flights are taken by just 15% of the population, and most people don’t fly at all in any given year. It’s not families taking an occasional holiday or business travellers who are fuelling the growth in demand for flying – it’s a small minority of wealthy individuals taking multiple flights a year. Yet the harms caused by aviation growth, from noise and air pollution to habitat destruction as airports expand, is felt disproportionately by the less well-off. That’s why policies like the frequent flyer levy must be front and centre of the new aviation strategy, so that social justice and environmental protection go hand in hand. The EU’s transport commissioner Violeta Bulc told airline CEOs this month that the aviation industry’s licence for growth would in future be linked directly to perceptions of sustainability. Heathrow’s owners – and the government – need to read that memo too. • Caroline Lucas is the Green party MP for Brighton Pavilion"

So says German Prof. Fritz Vahrenholt, who is one of the founders of Germany’s modern environmental movement, and agreed to an interview with NoTricksZone. He is one of the co-authors of the German skeptic book “Die kalte Sonne”, which took Germany by storm last year and is now available at bookstores worldwide in English under the title: The Neglected Sun.
In Germany Prof. Vahrenholt has had to endure a lot heat from the media, activists, and climate scientists for having expressed a different view. But as global temperatures remain stagnant and CO2 climate sensitivity is being scaled back, he feels vindicated. Here’s the interview:
=======================
IPCC Science Finds Itself In A Serious Jam, There Is Not Going To be A Climate Catastrophe
NTZ: You were once a believer in the man-made CO2 climate disaster. What changed your mind? 
FV: I was Environmental Senator of Hamburg until 1998 and had had absolutely no doubts about the AGW hypothesis because global temperatures indeed had been running parallel with CO2 emissions. My first doubts over the IPCC’s science arose after the dramatic errors of the 2007 4th Assessment Report came to light. On German public television PIK Director Hans-Joachim Schellnhuber said the Himalayan glaciers would melt away by the year 2035. Then as a CEO of Shell Repower Systems, and later RWE Innogy, where I was responsible for the development of renewable energies and discovered that natural factors were impacting our climate. We saw that the wind strength in Northwest Europe had been in decline year after year. Yet, climate scientists had told us just the opposite was supposed to occur, i.e. that wind strength would increase. So I looked at the literature in detail and was able to find there was a relationship with the North Atlantic Oscillation, whose 60-year cycle had entered a weak phase. I wrote articles about this in leading German dailies, and I was immediately branded as a “climate denier” by Stefan Rahmstorf. His reaction led me to look even deeper into the literature. In the end it was Schellnhuber and Rahmstorf who turned me into a skeptic.
NTZ: Your climate science critical book Die kalte Sonne (The Cold Sun) was released early last year in Germany. It remained on the Spiegel bestseller list for 3 weeks. Has it changed the discussion in Germany? Were you surprised by the public’s reaction?
FV: The leftist, liberal media labeled me an “eco-reactionary” who represented obsolete positions. That was to be expected. What truly surprised me the most was the harsh reaction from German climate scientists who were not even willing to discuss the topics addressed in the book. And the longer our book remained on the bestseller list, and the longer the warming stop became, the more our adversaries’ tactics ran aground. First they ignored us and then they tried to isolate us through personal defamation. Die kalte Sonne became the symbol of resistance against a politically indoctrinated science which denied natural processes and spread fear in order to promote a particular energy policy – one that threatened the prosperity and growth of the German industrial base. So to me it was a sort of an accolade when former Chancellor Helmut Schmidt invited me to a personal audience to find out more about Die kalte Sonne. Now I’m permitted to quote him: “Lüning’s and Vahrenholt’s assertions are plausible“. The UK Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson invited me to London and encouraged me to publish the book in English. Now it is appearing this week as “The Neglected Sun“. It’s the Die kalte Sonne in English, and it’s been updated. 

NTZ: CO2 is supposed to be trapping heat in the atmosphere, yet global atmospheric temperatures haven’t risen in 200 months (over 16 years). Where has all the “trapped heat” gone? Some leading scientists are frustrated that they cannot find it. What do you think is happening?
FV: It’s now obvious that the IPCC models are not correctly reflecting the development of atmospheric temperatures. What‘s false? Reality or the models? The hackneyed explanation of a deep sea warming below 700 meters hasn’t been substantiated up to now. How does atmospheric warming from a climate gas jump 700 meters deep into the ocean? If you consider the uncertainties in the Earth’s radiation budget measurements at the top of the atmosphere, and those of the temperature changes at water depths below 700 meters, where we are talking about changes of a few hundredths of a degree Celsius over many years, such a “missing heat” cannot be ascertained today. The likelihood is that there is no “missing heat”. Slight changes in cloud cover could easily account for a similar effect. That would mean the end of the alarmist CO2 theory. Perhaps this is why we’ve been hearing speculation about the deep ocean.  On the other hand, perhaps this discussion tells us that the alarmist faction needs to deal more with oceanic cycles. It is possible that this is a step in recognizing the central impacts of the PDO and AMO on our climate.
NTZ: Hans von Storch confirms that 98% of the climate models have been wrong so far. Do you think the directors of world’s leading climate research institutes risk damaging the once sterling reputations of their institutes if they do not soon admit there’s a problem with climate science?
FV: They certainly find themselves in a serious jam. That‘s why they are now trying to gain time by claiming that the models first become falsified if there has been no warming over a period of 30 years – never mind that the warming of 1977 to 1998 was only 22 years and deemed to be long enough to “prove“ the CO2 theory. A few years ago climate scientist Ben Santer said only 17 years were necessary before we could talk about a real climate trend. Now that reality is pulling the rug from under models, some scientists are having misgivings. Some are praying for an El Nino year, which would allow them to beat the drums of fear again. They’ll hype up every single weather effect to get attention.
NTZ: Some prominent climate experts have been expressing second thoughts about the seriousness of man-made climate change, e.g. Hans von Storch, Lennart Bengtsson. Do you expect more scientists to follow as more data come in?

FV: Certainly. That’s what’s so fascinating about science. It proposes theories. And when they don’t fit reality, they get changed. The chaff gets separated from the wheat.
NTZ: Spiegel for example has been publishing some articles critical of alarmist climate science. Do you expect the rest of Germany’s media to soon follow and to start taking a more critical look?
FV: This process is fully under way. But it’s going to take a long time because an entire generation has been convinced that CO2 is a climate killer. But the shrill tones have been quieting down.
NTZ: What danger does Germany face should it continue down its current path of climate alarmism and rush into renewable energies? 
FV: Twenty billion euros are being paid out by consumers for renewable energies in Germany each and every year. Currently that amounts to 250 euros per household each year and it will increase to 300 euros next year.
Worse, it’s a gigantic redistribution from the bottom to top, from the poor who cannot afford a solar system to rich property owners who own buildings with large roof areas. The German Minister of Environment fears a burden of 1000 billion euros by 2040.
It is truly outrageous that 1) 40% of the world’s photovoltaic capacity is installed in Germany, a country that sees as much sunshine as Alaska, 2) we are converting wheat into biofuel instead of feeding it to the hungry, and 3) we are covering 20% of our agricultural land with corn for biogas plants and thus adversely impacting wildlife. We are even destroying forests and nature in order to make way for industrial wind parks.
On windy days we have so much power that wind parks are asked to shut down, yet they get paid for the power they don’t even deliver. And when the wind really blows, we “sell” surplus power to neighboring countries at negative prices. And when the wind stops blowing and when there is no sun, we have to get our power from foreign countries. In the end we pay with the loss of high-paying industrial jobs because the high price of power is making us uncompetitive.
The agitators in climate science here in Germany have done us no favors. Renewable energies do have a big future, but not like this. It’s been a run-away train and it’s too expensive. We are putting Germany’s industry in jeopardy. In reality there really isn’t any urgency because the solar cycles and nature are giving us time to make the transition over to renewable energies in a sensible way.
NTZ: Has the weather become more extreme? Why are we getting bombarded by scary reports from the media – even after a normal thunderstorm with hail?
FV: Extreme weather is the only card they have left to play. We see that Arctic sea ice extent is the highest since 2007. At the South Pole sea ice is at the highest extent in a very long time, hurricanes have not become more frequent, the same is true with tornadoes, sea level is rising at 2-3 mm per year and there’s been no change in the rate, and global temperature has been stagnant for 15 years. Indeed we are exposed to bad weather. And when one is presented with a simplistic explanation, i.e. it’s man’s fault, it gladly gets accepted. CO2 does have a warming effect on the planet. However, this effect has been greatly exaggerated. The climate impact of CO2 is less than the half of what the climate alarmists claim. That’s why in our book, The Neglected Sun, we are saying there is not going to be any climate catastrophe.
NTZ: What do you expect from the soon-to-be-released IPCC 5th Assessment Report?
FV: It is truly remarkable that some countries are urging IPCC 5AR authors to address the reasons for the temperature hiatus in the summary for policymakers. Dissatisfaction with the IPCC’s tunnel vision is growing. But let’s not kid ourselves: In the coming days and weeks the media are not going to be able to refrain from the IPCC catastrophe-hype. However, what will be different from the previous four reports is that the hype will die off much more quickly. Those who ignore nature and its fluctuations will end up on the sidelines soon enough. I think this is going to be the last report of this kind.

Share this...FacebookTwitterI had to shake my head when I came across Peter Gleick’s Twitter comment about a Toys R Us spot. Incredibly he writes: “My wife and I saw this ad and looked at each other speechless. And angry. Perhaps the most offensive we’ve ever seen.”

Warning: If you hate happy kids, then you aren’t going to like the above clip!
At first I thought Gleick was joking, but then I was horrified to discover he and his wife really mean it. Gleick and his ilk are freaking out because a teacher has 8-year olds playing with toys instead of collectively learning the names of tree leaves.
Damn it! Those little brats have got to learn and love tree leaves!
To me this confirms that Gleick is a…well, never mind – I’m not going to accomplish anything with insults, as deserved as they may be.
Gleick’s remark reminds me when I was in science class the in 5th grade. Three or four weeks long the teacher tried to pound the names of ferns into us – I’m not kidding. And she even expected us to love the subject as much as she did. And if you didn’t, she punished you with a failing grade. And that’s what I got.  And to this day I have no regrets about it. Those 4 weeks were a period in my life when I completely tuned out science, and I remember thinking how utterly boring it was. I recall demonstratively refusing to participate in the nonsense.
On the other hand, my oldest brother had a telescope and I remember using it often, even buying a book about astronomy and learning all the names of the planets and knowing their distance from the sun. That was fun. But ferns?
The Toy R Us teacher deserves a medal for outstanding education
If anything the teacher on the Toys R Us bus deserves a medal because he refuses to destroy the scientific curiosity of his school kids with the senseless, trivial and excruciatingly boring activity of collective and regimented memorization of tree leaves.

Believe me, with a toy they love, kids can learn magnitudes more about physics, science, mathematics, sociology and engineering than they ever will with communist-style, repeat-after-me collective programming and thought control.
Nothing stimulates a child’s mind more than a toy
Just look at the kids’ faces in that Toys R Us store. Imagine what’s going through their minds and what they will do with the toys of their choice.
How many hours will they spend playing in the dirt or sand with that truck? What is that child going to discover under that microscope, and about optics in general? What dreams and fantasies is that little girl going to experience with the doll house? What physics is the little girl going to learn from the spinning doll? How much is that bicycle going to expand the child’s world and improve his motor-coordination? Can’t the Gleicks see this?
The Toys R Us spot is wonderful just watching all joy in the kids’ faces. But I guess all that happiness is a bit too much to take for the Gleicks and the wackos at Grist and Sierra Club. Horrors! Kids experiencing their own dreams and not being collectively tortured and turned off by instituted boredom. In the narrow mind of the zealot environmentalist, small children have to be terrified of climate and nature, they have to learn to love trees – and to not be happy discovering through toys.
Gleick and his ilk display an astonishing level of blind-mindedness in that they are unable to see the obvious benefits of children freely selecting their own toys and pursing their own interests. One little girl in the spot says something that even Professor Gleick could learn from:
A princess is always loyal and never gives up, and always follows her dreams.”
Right you are, and never forget it. Never give up, and always follow your dreams.
Kids don’t need green thought control.
PS: Write to Toys R Us and tell them that the spot is the best they’ve ever had.

Share this...FacebookTwitterJudging by the German government’s own press release (from the Ministry of Environment) regarding the release of the new IPCC report, one could easily argue that it is in a state of complete confusion.
Federal Environment Minister Barbara Hendricks and Federal Research Minister Johanna Wanka see the latest IPCC report “as further proof that urgent action on climate change” and are therefore “advocating ambitious, rapid climate action in order to slow down the global increase in temperatures.”
Federal Environment Minister Hendricks commented:
Climate change is happening every day. This is why we have to do two things: firstly to combat climate change and make sure that global warming does not exceed 2 degrees Celsius, and secondly to prepare for the consequences of unavoidable climate change.”
The press release states that the government is “taking the risks very seriously” and has “already developed an adaptation strategy and an action plan“.
The press releases outlines a range of actions, “from developing early warning systems for extreme weather events to adaptation concepts for urban planning and specific changes to building legislation“. Then the press release boasts about all the money it is going to spend in “honoring international commitments like funding climate and biodiversity projects in newly industrialising and developing countries with a total of 1.4 billion euros” and allocating “more than 250 million euros for adaptation-related projects.”
If that were not enough of a waste of money, the press release also writes that German Research Minister Johanna Wanka will be using climate models to prepare regionally for the future:
In recent years we have considerably advanced the development of climate models. We will now focus on using and implementing our findings at regional level, for example to back up local investment decisions or develop targeted regional adaptation strategies. Climate and adaptation measures are particularly effective when planned regionally and implemented with scientific support.”
Unfortunately, news of the performance of the climate models have yet to reach the German government:
 
Germany’s Research Minister Johanna Wanka is impressed by the climate models’ performance.

The Federal Research Ministry is so impressed by the climate models that it boasts having “spent a total of 750 million euros on projects and research institutions in the areas of climate and energy in 2013 alone“.
Moreover, the press release keeps talking about adaptation measures, and makes no mention of curbing greenhouse gases.
Adapting to climate protects climate?
Federal Research Minister Wanka then states that its “KLIMZUG funding programme facilitates the testing of strategies for adaptation to climate change and related weather extremes in various regions“.
Minister of Research Johanna Wanka adds:
Education and research can make a difference in changing climate awareness worldwide. If people are successfully adapting to climate change at home, in their communities, this will make an important contribution to protecting our climate in general.”
So adaptation is climate protection? I’ve always understood it as our protection from the climate. Germany’s Ministry of Environment didn’t do itself any favors making the press release public. One would be hard pressed to find a press release that is more confused. She seems to be mixing up adaptation with mitigation.
Also the German government is pledging more money for climate research in order to close the “knowledge gaps” and for “understanding how climate change works” in a field where it is claimed everything is already understood and the science is settled. Federal Research Minister Wanka:
The report shows that there is a further need for research on climate change. Closing knowledge gaps and understanding how climate change works will help us develop more effective adaptation strategies and protect ourselves better against the effects of climate change.
On the surface the press release tells us that the German government’s plan is all about adaptation and shows no plans to knock down CO2 emissions 80% by 2050. There’s no mention of rapidly expanding renewable energies nor of scaling back fossil fuels.

Share this...FacebookTwitterHere’s something really cool and likely something you’re going to look at regularly.
Axel Bojanowski reports here at Spiegel on an outstanding interactive global weather real-time animation tool. The animation is the creation of US programmer Cameron Beccario.

Image cropped from: earth.nullschool.net.
You can use the mouse to rotate the globe and to activate the animation of what is happening on the planet, real time. By clicking on a certain location, the exact longitude and latitude coordinates are appear along with wind speed data in a box. It’s really fascinating.
Bojanowski says to open it with Firefox or Crome browser!
For example in the above cropped image, the tiny circle all the way in the upper left corner appears and the box contains information for that location such as wind velocity and coordinates
This probably is known to others already. For me it’s the first time I see it.
Enjoy. It’ll be handy to use as storms approach.

"Al Gore has said the global economy requires a fundamental upgrade to become more sustainable in order for the world to survive an environmental crisis and widening social divides. The environmentalist and former US vice-president said the world was in the early stages of a “sustainability revolution” that had “the magnitude of the Industrial Revolution and the speed of the digital revolution”. “The scale of our global challenges has never been clearer,” Gore said. The urgent need to address the world’s sustainability crisis is laid bare in the latest annual report from Generation Investment Management, which was co-founded by Gore and David Blood, a veteran Goldman Sachs investor, in 2004. The fund has more than $22bn worth of assets under its management, which it invests in technologies that can improve food production, healthcare and energy provision. “We have entered an age of environmental crises and of widening social divides. Incremental improvements to address these challenges are no longer enough; our economic system requires a fundamental upgrade to sustainability,” Gore said. The report concludes that an environmental breakdown is taking place alongside a fraying of the “social and economic fabric”. This threatens to create a “disruptive”, economy-wide sustainability crisis. It says the world’s rising use of fossil fuels and unsustainable food and meat production is accelerating the climate crisis while driving a global healthcare breakdown. Colin le Duc, a partner in Generation, said the world was continuing to grow its use of coal and combustion engine vehicles even though the negative effects of fossil fuels on the climate and human health were well known. Although many countries have set dates to permanently end sales of petrol and diesel cars, 90% of children now breathe toxic air, according to the report. Meanwhile, global obesity levels are rising in line with a growing global appetite for meat and packaged foods despite warnings that healthcare is an unsustainable cost for most governments. 1. Extreme weather events 2. Natural disasters 3. Failure to halt climate change 4. Water crises 5. Cyber attacks 6. Biodiversity loss 7. Mass involuntary migration 8. Manmade environmental disasters The report says there are now more overweight people in the world than underweight people for the first time in history. This is in part due to rising meat consumption. On a per capita basis, meat consumption in China has more than doubled in the last 30 years but still lags behind that of the US by about 50%. The dual impact of a health and climate breakdown could be made worse by a growing divide between rich and poor, which risks encouraging populist politics and global geopolitical instability. This political upheaval could spell bad news for global markets and economic systems while investors and policymakers try to adapt to the crisis. “It is clear that the way we are organising ourselves is not working,” Le Duc said. The report says the scale of the transformation needed is unprecedented and will mean “transitioning away from an incumbent energy system we have relied upon for more than 150 years, a revolution in global food systems – and much more.” Le Duc urged investors to embrace the “nuanced complexity of the transition to a sustainable economy” when assessing which companies offer sound investments in the coming decades. Gore said advances in technology, business model innovation and policy changes were “all aligning with society’s increasing demand for zero-carbon, equitable and inclusive economic growth”. The cost of renewable energy and electric cars is falling, while meat substitutes and alternative proteins have broken through into the mainstream. Meanwhile, investors have divested more than $7tn from fossil fuels. A sustainable economy would require even greater shifts from the global investment community, according to Le Duc. “There are plenty of investors that need to wake up to sustainability. Around $17tn is being invested with environment and social governance considerations – that’s a lot of money but it’s a very small proportion of global capital,” he said. He said a deeper understanding of the systemic shifts under way across all sectors was required by business leaders. “This represents the biggest investor opportunity ever writ in history. The economy has never been as big as it is today, and has never needed as much change.”"

Share this...FacebookTwitterIf Russia doesn’t behave responsibly soon, then there’s going to be a price to pay, Greenpeace is warning. Greenpeace thinks it can put the political pressure on Russia. We suspect that Russia as a result is getting really nervous by now and that she will soon cave in to Greenpeace’s mighty demands…maybe even within a few days. (Some sarcasm here).
In its recent blog piece Greenpeace is sending a message that it lining up a formidable political army against Russia, writing:
Let me take you on a small world tour, which illustrates the depth and breadth of the support we have received. Especially when you remember, that this is just a small selection, a snapshot.”
Greenpeace writes that even Iran and 13 Nobel prize winners have joined. Gee, Russia better back down real soon.
Hope at COP 19 already fading
Ingemar Nordin’s Swedish climate blog Stockholms Initiativet here today is already warning COP 19 is already looking like a failure, citing Reuters, which writes:
World governments are likely to recoil from plans for an ambitious 2015 climate change deal at talks next week, concern over economic growth at least partially eclipsing scientists’ warnings of rising temperatures and water levels. […]
Since 2009, scientists’ warnings have become more strident and new factors have emerged, sometimes dampening the impact of their message that human activity is driving warming. […]. Emerging economies such as China and India, heavily reliant on cheap, high-polluting coal to end poverty, are reluctant to take the lead despite rising emissions and pollution that are choking cities. […]

…many governments, especially in Europe, are concerned that climate policies, such as generous support schemes for solar energy, push up consumer energy bills.”
Nordin concludes: “The old hope that these mega-summits will lead to a binding international agreement is small.”
Renewables Cheerleader Germany Spews More CO2
Lastly, Germany’s flagship daily the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung here writes that despite the hundreds of billions of euros Germany has spent or committed on curbing its CO2 emissions, its emissions of the “climate gas” increased in 2013. Not only are Germany’s efforts very costly, but they are also proving to be completely ineffective. And even if they were effective, Germany’s CO2 reduction would result only in less than a tenth of a degree of reduced warming by 2100. Either way it all represents economic imbecility.
The FAZ writes that Germany’s emissions are expected to be 20 million tonnes more in 2013, a sharp rise of 2%.
The reason for Germany’s failure to combat the supposed climate-warming gas? The FAZ writes: “Foremost the cold winter has driven the consumption of gas upwards. Emissions from greater coal and petroleum consumption have also increased considerably.”
In a nutshell: Cold weather is foiling Germany’s attempts to fight warming! The tremendous nonsense never ends.

"After six years of the Coalition promising to cut red tape, Scott Morrison has used his first major speech since winning the election to promise to continue cutting red tape. In a speech to the Chamber of Commerce and Industry of Western Australia, which acknowledged the “challenges and headwinds” facing the economy, Morrison said the government’s previous red tape-cutting initiatives had created savings of $5.8bn.  But now he wants to go further, shifting the onus to business and industry to identify the delays, using Donald Trump’s economic plan as the inspiration. “This will be a renewed focus on regulatory reform but from a different angle,” Morrison said. “Rather than setting targets for departments or government agencies, we’ll be asking the wider question from the perspective of a business looking, say, to open a mine, commercialise a new biomedical innovation, or even start a home-based family business. “By focusing on regulation from the viewpoint of business, we will identify the regulations and bureaucratic processes that impose the largest costs on key sectors of the economy and the biggest hurdles to letting those investments flow,” he said. “While reducing taxes has had a major impact in the United States, it was actually the Trump administration’s commitment to cutting red tape and transforming the regulatory mindset of the bureaucracy that delivered their first wave of improvement in their economy.” Morrison said agencies such as the WA Environment Protection Authority had created uncertainty over emissions targets for the resources sector and were a barrier to investment. That comes after reports WA is considering going alone with its own carbon price, in the face of the federal government’s insistence it will meet its Paris targets, despite the government’s own data showing emissions continuing to increase. Asked about states going forward with individual plans, Morrison reiterated the Coalition’s insistence on “responsible targets”. “Well, all I know is that when any target is set that is not responsible and there are not clear policies and mechanisms that achieves it, all it tends to do is crush business and investment confidence and cost jobs,” he said. “So I think we should all be working together to create jobs, not cost them. “And the government sets our overall emissions reduction targets. Ours have been consistent for many years now. What’s more important is we’re meeting them. Our 2020 targets, we will exceed by 369m tonnes of abatement and similarly we’ll meet our 2030 targets. “So I think, you know, we all agree you need to take action on climate change and we’re taking responsible and effective action.” Australia’s emissions have risen every year for the past four years."
"It is hard to believe it needs stating, but it does. The oil industry is not your friend. Whatever it might say about its ethical credentials, while it continues to invest in fossil fuels, it accelerates climate breakdown and the death of the habitable planet. You would think this point was obvious to everyone. But over the past few weeks, I have spoken to dozens of environmentalists who appear to believe that Shell is on their side. I’ve come to the bizarre conclusion that there is more awareness of the oil industry’s agenda within the arts than there is among conservation groups.  Last week, the actor Mark Rylance brilliantly articulated his reasons for resigning from the Royal Shakespeare Company over its sponsorship by BP. The oil company had been subsidising cheap tickets for young people. It might be trashing the world these young people will inherit, but they can watch some great shows. This is bread and circuses – without the bread. “Surely,” Rylance asked, “the RSC wants to be on the side of the world-changing kids, not the world-killing companies?” To judge by its responses to his complaints across the years, apparently not. But, thanks to campaigning groups such as Platform, Art Not Oil, BP or not BP? and Culture Unstained, theatre companies, museums and art galleries are at least aware that there’s a conflict. Two months ago, Shell announced a $300m fund for “investing in natural ecosystems” over the next three years. This, it claims, will help to “support the transition towards a low-carbon future”. By paying for reforestation, it intends to offset some of the greenhouse gases produced by its oil and gas extraction. In conversations with environmental campaigners from several parts of the world, I keep hearing the same theme: Shell is changing, Shell is sincere – so shouldn’t we support it? The fund sounds big, and it is – until you compare it with Shell’s annual income of $24bn. Shell’s transition towards a low-carbon future is almost invisible in its annual report. Renewable energy doesn’t figure in its summary of financial results. When I checked with the company, it told me it had no discrete figure for its income from low-carbon technologies. Nor could it tell me how much it invested in them last year. But it did pour $25bn of investment into oil and gas in 2018, including exploration for new fossil fuel reserves in the deep waters of the Gulf of Mexico and off the coasts of Brazil and Mauritania. Among its assets are 1,400 mineral leases in Canada, where it makes synthetic crude oil from tar sands. Some transition. Shell’s “cash engines”, according to its annual report, are oil and gas. There is no sign that it plans to turn the engines off. Its “growth priorities” are chemical production and deep water oil extraction. It does list low-carbon energy among its “emerging opportunities” in future decades, but says it will develop them alongside fracking and liquefied fossil gas technologies. In the future, the company says, it will “sell more natural gas”. But as an analysis by Oil Change International explains, “there is no room for new fossil fuel development – gas included – within the Paris agreement goals”. Even existing gas and oil extraction is enough to push us past 1.5C of global heating. Shell is a company committed for the long term to fossil fuel production – which is another way of saying ecocide. It is also explicit about the purpose of schemes such as its natural ecosystems fund. The company’s success, its chairman says, “will depend largely on whether society trusts us. Investors invest in companies they trust, governments allow trusted companies to operate and consumers buy things from people they trust.” Among the company’s strategic ambitions is “to sustain a strong societal licence to operate”. Restoring natural ecosystems is crucial to preventing climate breakdown. As the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) points out, drawing down large amounts of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere is essential if we are to stand any chance of preventing more than 1.5C or even 2C of global heating. By far the best way of doing this is through natural climate solutions: protecting and restoring living systems such as forests, mangroves, salt marshes and peat bogs. As they develop, they absorb carbon dioxide and turn it into solid carbon, in the form of wood, mud and soil. In April, with a small team, I launched a campaign to prioritise these solutions. But the IPCC also makes it clear that natural climate solutions do not compensate for the continued release of greenhouse gases. We also need immediate and drastic cuts in fossil fuel production. To sustain a habitable planet, we must leave fossil fuels in the ground and protect and rewild living systems. The age of offsets is over. Shell, however, intends to keep finding and developing new reserves. Only last week, it withheld its support for a legally binding target to reduce the EU’s emissions to net zero by 2050. Trumpeting its investment in natural ecosystems looks to me like a means of sustaining its social licence to extract the gas and oil that will destroy our lives. As if to highlight the distracting nature of Shell’s public relations, earlier this month its chief executive, Ben van Beurden, gave a lecture in which he instructed people to “eat seasonally and recycle more”. He lambasted “consumers who choose to eat strawberries in winter”, explaining that his driver had revealed that he “had bought a punnet of strawberries in January that were grown in Chile”. What are the chances that the jet fuel used to fly them here was supplied by Shell? They who have put out the people’s eyes reproach them of their blindness. To me, Shell’s strategy is so transparent that it is hardly worth debating. It wants to stay in the fossil fuel business, but it needs to fend off the regulation that might threaten this business. If the company is not prepared to abandon its cash engines, it must change people’s perceptions of its activities. Shell’s natural ecosystems fund, in my view, is blatant greenwash. But the company’s strategy is working. A remarkable number of people who should be fighting Shell instead see it as a green alternative to Exxon, persuaded by what is, in comparison with the company’s filthy investments, a tiny sop. Shell has longstanding relationships with four “environmental partners”: the International Union for the Conservation of Nature, the Nature Conservancy, Wetlands International, and Earthwatch. I believe it is just as wrong for these groups to take its money as it is for the RSC to take money from BP. It surprises me that there is not as much pressure on them to break their links as there has been, for example, on the British Museum, whose relationship with BP is becoming a national embarrassment. But naivety about Shell is not confined to its partners. Plenty of well-intentioned organisations and people, who share my enthusiasm for natural climate solutions, appear so desperate to clutch at any straws of hope that they are prepared to see this company as part of the solution. Shell is not our friend. It is an engine of planetary destruction. • George Monbiot is a Guardian columnist"

Share this...FacebookTwitterOff the subject today: a short report on Obama’s popularity in Germany, which likely won’t get much attention from the US mainstream media.
The NSA spying scandal and Edward Snowden have taken a massive toll on Barack Obama’s and the USA’s approval rating among Germans, new surveys reveal.
According to Germany’s online Die Zeit weekly, “Only 43 percent are satisfied with his political work, 52 percent are dissatisfied. That’s a profound popularity loss: In April 2010 Obama’s approval reached 88 percent.”
The spying affair not only has had a catastrophic impact on Obama’s popularity in Germany and the rest of Europe, but it has also badly tarnished the USA’s image overall. Only 35 percent of Germans rank the USA as a trustworthy partner and 61 percent say that the USA is not a partner that can be trusted.
The survey results were released by ARD-Deutschlandtrend. The numbers are shocking as Germany has long been considered as one of the USA’s most steadfast and trusted allies.

When it comes to whistleblower Edward Snowden, 60% of Germans view him as a hero and only 14% regard him as criminal.
These are devastating numbers and overall represent an almost unprecedented foreign policy debacle, to say the least.
72% think Obama is lying
Germany’s no. 1 daily by circulation, BILD here, also conducted a survey of Germans on whether or not they believed Obama was telling the truth about eavesdropping on Chancellor Merkel’s mobile phone calls. BILD writes:
According to a survey by BILD, 72% of the Germans DON’T believe the US president when he claims he was not aware the NSA was eavesdropping on the mobile phone of Angela Merkel (59, CDU).”

"Last week, the government rejected recommendations from the Commons environmental audit committee report on the impact of fast fashion – including a 1p per garment levy. Ministers also rejected a ban on burying or incinerating clothes that could be recycled. According to the Waste and Resources Action Programme (Wrap) UK households sent 300,000 tonnes of clothing to landfill in 2016.  According to a 2019 EU report fashion companies produced two collections a year in 2000, but this had increased to five by 2011, with some chains such as Zara offering 24 collections per annum. The report stated that this had led to clothes being regarded as “nearly disposable” goods. One washload of polyester clothes can release 700,000 microplastic fibres into the environment. It is estimated that half a million tonnes of these microfibres end up in the sea each year. Polyester, made from fossil fuels, is non-biodegradable. Microfibres from synthetics are a major contributor to microplastic pollution – a 2019 Bangor University survey of UK rivers, reservoirs and lakes found micro-plastic pollution at all locations tested. According to the Pulse of Fashion report in 2015 the industry was responsible for 1,715 million tonnes of CO2 emissions. The UN states that the fashion industry consumes more energy than the aviation and shipping industry combined. The Pulse report forecast fashion emissions to grow by 63% by 2030. The production of clothing is very water-intensive. According to the 2017 Wrap report the average water footprint for a kilo of cotton (equivalent to pair of jeans and a shirt) is 10,000-20,000 litres. India and Pakistan are major suppliers of cotton to the UK, but both countries suffer from high levels of water scarcity."
"Scotland should consider new nuclear power stations, investing in hydrogen and installing many more windfarms to meet its climate goals, an expert inquiry has concluded. The inquiry by the Royal Society of Edinburgh, Scotland’s national academy, said a massive increase in low-carbon electricity production would be needed in order to reach the country’s new goal of net zero emissions by 2045.  Prof Becky Lunn, a civil engineer who is deputy chair of the inquiry, said electricity production may need to increase fourfold to decarbonise the transport system and heating, with major implications for ministers and the public. “We have got difficult decisions to make and if we delay we will end up importing by default, which is not a place where in future I think we would wish to be,” she said. “We need to change. At the moment we have a totally unsustainable system.” Alongside a substantial increase in electricity production, Scotland would need: • A statutory commission to provide independent expert direction on energy policy and governance. • Much tougher energy efficiency regulations for homes and buildings. • Substantial investment in carbon capture and storage, so CO2 created during the production of hydrogen could be buried offshore. • Subsidies to ensure higher energy prices and upgrading costs did not increase fuel poverty. Lunn said this was increasingly urgent. Scotland’s two nuclear power stations at Hunterston and Torness, which provided 37% of the country’s electricity in 2017, are due to close by 2030, just as electricity demand is forecast to soar. The RSE report, Scotland’s Energy Future, was published as climate activists with the Extinction Rebellion protest group marched on the Scottish parliament to set up a week-long camp to put pressure on Holyrood to agree more ambitious CO2 reduction targets. Meanwhile Greenpeace continued its campaign against BP’s increased oil drilling by pursuing an oil rig its activists had occupied in the Cromarty Firth last week into the North Sea, using its protest ship, Arctic Sunrise. Greenpeace said its continued pursuit of the rig, the Paul B Loyd Jr, had prevented it from arriving in the Vorlich oilfield, where BP hopes to extract 30m barrels of oil. Extinction Rebellion is planning to block roads in Edinburgh this week, mirroring similar protests in London and other cities. The Scottish government has accepted a challenging target of achieving net zero emissions by 2045, five years earlier than the 2050 UK target agreed last week by Theresa May, the prime minister. In 2017, Scotland emitted 40.5 megatonnes of CO2 equivalent. Greenpeace and Extinction Rebellion argue that continued drilling undermine those goals – a stance rejected by the UK and Scottish governments and the RSE. The net zero concept means continued use of oil, gas and potentially coal. But extra forests, carbon storage and other measures would be needed to soak up the CO2 that those released. The RSE inquiry was funded by four major energy firms, the oil company BP, the French nuclear and renewables firm EDF, the gas company Centrica and the renewables firm SSE. The RSE said they had no bearing or influence over the report’s conclusions but the report mirrored those companies’ arguments that nuclear energy, oil and gas would still be needed – conclusions many climate and environment activists reject. Lunn said ministers should eventually consider small modular nuclear reactors, an experimental technology which, its supporters argue, is safer and much easier to build than large-scale nuclear power stations. Methane would still be needed in large amounts to produce hydrogen: large-scale hydrogen plants would be connected to carbon storage sites in the bedrock offshore. Oil would still be needed to provide fuel for aviation and shipping, for medicines and materials such as plastics. It would be impossible, the RSE said, to equally meet the four key tests of tackling climate change, guaranteeing energy security, making it affordable and at the same time maximising the social acceptability and economic wellbeing of those energy choices. Lunn said the RSE’s conclusions were that meeting the country’s low-carbon energy challenges would require compromises."

Share this...FacebookTwitterHigh profile, Swiss meteorologist Jörg Kachelmann has released his latest weather video:

In the video (German) at the 1:10 mark he says Central Europe will be cooling down considerably at the end of the coming week and that winter weather with snow may be making its way down below 1500 m in the Alps.
Of course in the past such weather was nothing that unusual for the Alps this time of year. But in our age of global warming, snow was supposed to become rare even in the wintertime, let alone early the fall or spring.
Winters are here to stay
One thing can be said with high certainty: snow in September pretty much tells us that winters are going to be around for a very long time, and they aren’t going to disappear like some fortune-telling climate scientists told us. Here are some of their notorious failed winter climate predictions:
“Winters with strong frost and lots of snow like we had 20 years ago will cease to exist at our latitudes.” Mojib Latif, Max Planck Institute for Meteorology, Hamburg, 1 April 2000.
and
“Good bye winter. Never again snow?” Spiegel, 1 April 2000.

“Spring will begin in January starting in 2030.” Die Welt, 30 Sept 2010.
and
“Ice, snow, and frost will disappear, i.e. milder winters.” Die Welt, 30 Sept 2010
(See many more here)
Having been thoroughly embarrassed by all these false predictions, many of the hysterical global warming scientists are now claiming that the recent spate of cold European winters are actually a sign of global warming.
Over the last couple weeks, there has been a flurry of forecasts of a bitter cold 2013/2014 winter to hit Central, Eastern and South Eastern Europe. But Kachelmann dismisses these forecasts, pretty much calling them wild-ass guesses and claiming no one can make useful seasonal forecasts.
Other meteorologists, however, like Joe Bastardi and Dominik Jung, believe that tendencies one way or the other can be determined, based on historical data and repeating climate cycles that have emerged from the 130 years of data.
I think it’s high time to talk to a few old farmers and see what they think.
Overall, this all reminds me of the story of NASA predicting a cold winter because they had observed Indians stocking up more firewood than usual.

The online Der Spiegel writes how global CO2 emissions are projected to keep rising strongly, 1.1% annually, at least until 2035 – thanks to strong economic growth in emerging countries like India and China.
Obama’s newly announced actions to curb CO2 emissions by America’s coal fired power plants will do almost nothing to prevent global energy trends from progressing in the opposite direction, the DPA writes.
Moreover, not even drastic global action would prevent CO2 emissions from rising. The DPA writes that “energy generation would need to be revamped worldwide  – up to going totally without coal, or catching the CO2 from the power plants. That is hardly realistic.”
Decrease in global poverty adding to energy demands. Number of automobiles worldwide to more than double by 2035!
As emerging countries continue to develop, so will their need for energy. Spiegel cites studies from the World Energy Outlook of the IEA, the BP Energy Outlook 2035 and the World Oil Outlook 2013 from Opec. One sector that is expanding massively is automobile production. Spiegel writes:

Just the number of cars alone will more than double by the year 2015, from 1.1 billion 2.3 billion.”
India’s car ownership will jump from 20 cars per 1000 Indians today, to 130 by 2035. In China that measure will go from 80 today to 360.
Clearly the measures implemented by Obama will have no noticeable impact on the climate of the future, but threaten burdening Americans will trillions in added costs.
Global population will also increase strongly over the next 20 years. As a result, the even most sober studies see no chance of curbing CO2 emissions. The IEA writes that also in the year 2035 worldwide energy demand will be predominantly covered by fossil fuels. Today that figure is currently 86%. The DPA writes:
Here neither the new plans from Obama to reduce greenhouse gases will change anything – nor the German plans.”
So CO2 will continue its unstoppable rise along with human prosperity and population. And should the temperature fail to rise much by 2035, as many scientists are predicting, then we will know that all the climate hysteria was for nothing. That, we suspect, is what the warmists are fearing the most. The truth is coming – like it or not.

"The first person to face trial over the Extinction Rebellion protests in April has been found guilty of a minor public order offence for blocking a road in central London. Angie Zelter, 68, was given a conditional discharge at Hendon magistrates court on Tuesday after being arrested for lying in the road near Parliament Square on 17 April. She had been taking part in protests in which thousands of people  blocked key sites across the capital over 10 days to highlight the escalating climate emergency.  Defending herself, Zelter outlined the “clear and unequivocal” scientific evidence of climate chaos and the threat ecological breakdown posed to the future of humanity, citing a swath of scientific studies, UN-backed reports and academic papers. She told the court that although this was only a “dry summary” and a “minute fraction” of the available evidence, it proved that her peaceful civil disobedience was both necessary and proportionate. Zelter told magistrates that humans faced mass extinction unless governments implemented wide-ranging changes. Extinction Rebellion is a protest group that uses non-violent civil disobedience to campaign on environmental issues. Launched in October 2018, with an assembly at Parliament Square to announce a 'declaration of rebellion' against the UK Government, the group has staged regular demonstrations against current environmental policies. More than 1,000 activists were arrested in April 2019 after protesters occupied four sites across London, as well as blocking roads, disrupting a railway line and conducting a protest at Heathrow. Other demonstrations have included a semi-naked protest inside the House of Commons and blockading streets in London, Cardiff, Leeds, Bristol and Glasgow. The group says climate breakdown threatens all life on Earth, and so it is rebelling against politicians who “have failed us”, to provoke radical change that will stave off a climate emergency. The movement has become global with groups set up in countries include the US, Spain, Australia, South Africa and India. Martin Belam The judge, Margot Coleman, said that although she was mindful of the evidence from Zelter, the case “was a matter of law not morality”. “Your argument does not provide you with a defence to these charges,” she said. Zelter, who has been involved in various campaigns concerning the arms trade, environmentalism and nuclear weapons since the early 1980s, was convicted of breaching a section 14 order, which the court heard had been imposed because the Extinction Rebellion protests were causing widespread disruption to businesses and the wider community. The order gives police the power to clear static protests from a specified area. The court heard she had been lying in the road near Parliament Square and refused to move when asked to do so by the police. Zelter disputed the implementation of the section 14 order, arguing the disruption was minimal compared with the “chaos that will ensue from climate breakdown”. “I am fearful for the future for myself, for my family and for all living creatures on this fragile planet,” she said. “I believe there is a real and substantial threat to all our lives, and that, in accordance with the science, urgent and systemic changes to our society must be taken now to mitigate the danger. That is why I took action.” Zelter said her history of campaigning and protests – she has established various protest groups and been arrested and imprisoned several times – proved she had not made the decision to take part in the Extinction Rebellion action lightly. “I hope it shows that my actions … were not taken spontaneously or lightly but came out of [a] lifetime [of] concerns and that I have tried everything I could think of to create the changes necessary to combat climate change and prevent catastrophic collapse.” She said the overwhelming evidence of climate breakdown had left her feeling “frustrated, depressed and, at times, hopeless”. “I cannot really understand why those ‘in power’ have refused to act. After all, it is their world too … ” she said. “When our society and ecosystem collapses around us, none of us will be able to eat, drink, or breathe money.” Coleman ordered her to pay £640 costs, but Zelter said she would not. Speaking outside the court she said she was considering an appeal. “I am sad that the judge did not take the broader view of finding me not guilty because of the severity and urgency of the climate emergency,” she said."

Share this...FacebookTwitterScottish Skeptic here has tabulated a ranking of climate science blog sites. To no one’s surprise Anthony Watts’s Watts Up With That? took the no. 1 spot, followed by Marc Morano’s Climate Depot. The ranking was done using internet site rating service Alexa.
First I’m really thrilled to see that NoTricksZone made it all the way to the number 13 14 spot, even bumping out RealClimate. I’m really surprised by this result. Not bad for something I’m doing on the side with the help of reader contributions such as those from Ed Caryl. Thanks to both loyal and occasional readers!
65% are skeptic or luke-warmer
Having done a quick count of the warmist sites, I came up with 48 from a total of 137. That’s crunches to be only 35%. That’s a far cry from the 97% the warmists like to try to have the rest of the world believe.
That means that almost two thirds of all climate science blogs are very skeptical or somewhat skeptical of the IPCC science (skeptic or luke-warmer). That’s hardly a consensus! Many of the skeptic sites are run by scientists and meteorologists…also showing that that “consensus among experts” is a complete myth.
Moreover, the top 20 sites are clearly dominated by skeptics.

Share this...FacebookTwitterBelow Rainer Hoffmann presents Part 3 of his “10 Inconvenient Truths About Professor Hans-Joachim Schellnhuber“. I wrote about Part 1 here, and Part 2 focused on Schellnhuber’s claiming that climate models provide projections, forecasts, scenarios, prognoses, depending on the situation being served at hand.
Part 3 below shows a whopper: Schellnhuber claiming that the complex, chaotic climate system can all be reduced down to a “simple linear relationship” with CO2 emissions.

The video starts by explaining how climate is a highly complex, chaotic non-linear system that cannot be defined by any single variable. At the 2:14 mark IPCC scientist Mojib Latif explains that calculating the future outcome of a system as complex as the climate is an impossible task. This is confirmed by Prof Andreas Bott at the 6:33 mark, “The systems of equations are non-linear, and thus not predictable.” The first 14 minutes of the film explain this in detail.
Even the 2001 IPCC reports tells us:
In climate research and modeling, we should recognize that we are dealing with a coupled non-linear chaotic system, and therefore that the long-term prediction of future climate states is not possible.”
But not everyone agrees with this.

For one, in 2009 Prof. Hans Joachim Schellnhuber of the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research told us that climate is actually a simple system where global temperature behaves linearly with CO2 concentration. At the 15:00 mark Schellnhuber said on Phoenix public television on November 23, 2009:
We have been able to show at our institute, also our friends at Oxford, and at the University of Victoria in Vancouver Island, that there is an extremely simple, quasi linear relationship between the global mean temperature, that is the increase and the total amount of CO2 that will be blown into the atmosphere over the next four or five decades. The entire complexity of our climate system can be reduced to this simple linear relationship. Nature has done this favor as an exception.”
What a con-job. Schellnhuber then goes on to claim that scientists know exactly how much CO2 is allowed to be blown into the atmosphere before the climate systems tips: “750 billion tonnes of CO2 over the next 4 decades“.
So when it appeared the planet was warming, Schellnhuber told us that climate was a simple linear equation involving 2 variables. So what does Schellnhuber say today now that the data show there hasn’t been any warming in 15 years despite rising CO2?
Look at what Schellnhuber says on April 17, 2013. At the 17:34 mark Schellnhuber is shown blaming non-linearity for the absence of warming over 15 years.
So quickly can a con-artist turn on a dime.

Share this...FacebookTwitterPolar scientist Dr. Peter Lemke of Germany’s renowned Alfred Wegener Institute was interviewed here about climate change, its affect on the Earth’s polar regions and about his recent winter expedition to Antarctica.
In the Arctic part of the interview, Lemke repeats the usual man-is-melting-the-Arctic narrative that you often hear from many state-funded alarmist climate scientists. No surprise here.
But as always, when it comes to sea ice, eventually warmist polar scientists get tripped up by Antarctica. And sure enough, Lemke trips and stumbles when Antarctic sea ice gets brought up. Before too long he is forced to concede he is stumped and has to admit that sea ice at the South Pole has grown and that he has no real explanation.
Peter Lemke has been on several expeditions to Antarctica: in 1989, 1992, 2006, and now 2013. And each time they collected data. Today, after comparing the preliminary results of the 2013 to those of 1992, here’s what Lemke says:
“…from our early results, it looks like that the sea ice mass around Antarctica has increased slightly. Our measurements showed that the sea ice was more extensive, thicker and more densely packed as compared to our 1992 expedition, which was on the same track during the same season.”
Increased slightly? In the following chart I’ve highlighted the winter of the years 1992 and 2013 to show what Lemke means by “increased slightly“:

It’s obvious that Lemke is attempting to seriously downplay the Antarctic sea ice growth that has occurred since 1992. Indeed the above chart shows that sea ice has grown by more than 1.5 million square kilometers. That’s not increasing “slightly”.  We suppose that if the trend had been the other way around, we’d be hearing terms like considerable reduction or even possibly dramatic reduction.
What’s more, Lemke also confirms that this extra 1.5 million square kilometers is “thicker” and “more compact”, meaning there’s much more ice mass.
So why is the ice growing? This goes against all the claims of global warming. Here, typical of warmist scientists who are confronted with inconvenient data, Lemke acts like he has the answer…before admitting he really has no clue (my emphasis):
One explanation is that in the Southern Hemisphere the westerly winds are increasing, and through friction this drives the ice towards lower latitudes and the extent is getting a bit bigger.  When the ice expands there is open water between ice floes, and it’s still cold enough in winter that ice freezes in the open patches.
There are other physical processes that may be involved, such as the heavy snow cover that blankets the Antarctic sea ice. Sometimes the heavy snow load submerges the ice floe underwater so that the interface of ice and snow is actually below sea level, and seawater drains into the snow and freezes. That may be one process, but there are others that are not really resolved yet.
We don’t yet have the answers to these questions, because there are very few measurements and you cannot deduce snow from satellite remote sensing data, yet. To find out, you have to go there and make measurements yourself. But winter expeditions are very rare. There are very few icebreakers that can actually go into the Antarctic winter into the sea ice.”
The science is settled, except for the majority that isn’t.
Never trust a climate scientist who acts like he’s sure. It’s a dead give away that he hasn’t got a clue about what’s really going on.

"Britain increased support for fossil fuel projects overseas to almost £2bn last year, marking an elevenfold increase over the previous 12 months. Backing for oil and gas operations in Oman, Kuwait, Brazil and other countries, amounted to more than a quarter of the total commitment by UK Export Finance (UKEF), the government agency responsible for promoting British exports with credit, guarantees, loans and insurance.  The amount was more than double that committed to the high-emitting sector in any of the past four years, according to an analysis by the investigative environmental journalism outlet DeSmog UK. Britain claims to be a climate leader even as it promotes companies that contribute to greenhouse gases overseas. Last month MPs declared a climate emergency but faced criticism over climate plans deemed inadequate by environmentalists. The Committee on Climate Change says cutting greenhouse gas emissions to zero by 2050 is necessary, affordable and desirable. Here are some of the actions needed to make that happen: • Petrol and diesel cars banned from sale ideally by 2030 and 2035 at the latest. • Quadrupling clean electricity production from wind, solar and perhaps nuclear, plus batteries to store it and connections to Europe to share the load. • Connection of new homes to the gas grid ending in 2025, with boilers using clean hydrogen or replaced by electric powered heat pumps. Plus, all homes and appliances being highly efficient.   • Beef, lamb and dairy consumption falling by 20%, though this is far lower than other studies recommend and a bigger shift to plant-based diets would make meeting the zero target easier. • A fifth of all farmland – 15% of the UK – being converted to tree planting and growing biofuel crops and restoration of peat bogs. This is vital to take CO2 out of the air to balance unavoidable emissions from cattle and planes. • 1.5bn new trees will be needed, meaning more than 150 football pitches a day of new forests from now to 2050. • Flying would not be banned, but the number of flights will depend on how much airlines can cut emissions with electric planes or biofuels.  This month parliament’s environmental audit committee said the UK was sabotaging its climate credentials by providing “unacceptably high” subsidies that locked poorer nations into a fossil fuel future. A separate study this year found the UK led the European Union in giving subsidies to fossil fuels. UKEF said its support for oil and gas helped ensure the competitiveness of an industry in Britain employing 300,000 people. A spokesperson said the agency “fully recognises the importance of tackling climate change and the need for a mix of energy sources and technologies as the world transitions to a low carbon economy”. In a press release UKEF headlined the latest figures as the “best results for 28 years” even though its annual report acknowledged high potential environmental and social risks for several of the projects. The agency’s biggest single energy deal last year involved £734m in support of the Duqm oil refinery project in Oman. Other large sums were the £248m for oil exploration in Brazil, £171m for an oil refinery in Kuwait, and several hundred million for power projects in Iraq. The total £2bn support for fossil fuels last year compared with £175m in 2017, £857m in 2016, and £432m in 2015, according to DeSmog. The figures did not include the aviation and the motor industry, though Airbus, Boeing and Norton Motorcycles also figured prominently on the latest list of supported projects. Companies selling pipeline surveillance equipment to Kuwait, Qatar, India and China, also featured. By comparison, support for renewables last year slumped to £700,000, and covered mostly wind turbines in the Netherlands and Germany. The Guardian has updated its style guide to introduce terms that more accurately describe the environmental crises facing the world.
Instead of “climate change”, the preferred terms are “climate emergency, crisis or breakdown” and “global heating” is favoured over “global warming”. The scale of the climate and wildlife crises has been laid bare by two landmark reports from the world’s scientists. In October 2018, they said carbon emissions must halve by 2030 to avoid even greater risks of drought, floods, extreme heat and poverty for hundreds of millions of people. In May 2019, global scientists said human society was in jeopardy from the accelerating annihilation of wildlife and destruction of the ecosystems that support all life on Earth. The editor-in-chief, Katharine Viner, says: “We want to ensure that we are being scientifically precise, while also communicating clearly with readers on this very important issue. The phrase ‘climate change’, for example, sounds rather passive and gentle when what scientists are talking about is a catastrophe for humanity.” Other terms that have been updated include the use of “wildlife” rather than “biodiversity”, “fish populations” instead of “fish stocks” and “climate science denier” rather than “climate sceptic”. Damian Carrington Environment editor Kerry McCarthy, a Labour MP and member of the environmental audit committee, said the agency needed to clean up its act.  She said: “These shocking figures show UKEF is increasingly undermining attempts to tackle our climate emergency. Instead of making renewable energy a priority, as UKEF assured us they were doing when they appeared before our inquiry in March, their own accounts show that support for fossil fuels has increased more than tenfold over the past year. Not only that, support for renewables has declined by a third.” Outstripping all of them were arms deals, which topped the list with more than £3bn support for weapons systems and Typhoon aircraft sold to Qatar, and with several million pounds for explosive ordnance purchased by Saudi Arabia."

Share this...FacebookTwitterScience journalist Axel Bojanowski, a trained geologist, at Spiegel writes how scientists think they may have solved the riddle of growing Antarctic sea ice in a warming world.

Mysteries surround Antarctica…scientists realizing oceans play huge role on climate. Photo: NASA-JPL.
No question the planet has warmed some since 1900 as it crawls out of a little ice age and back to a new Holocene optimum. Bojanowski writes:
For a long time scientists thought the problem would simply pass. They expected it was only a fleeting oddity.”
It turns out that the high level of Antarctic sea ice hasn’t been an oddity at all and continues to set new record highs. Now red-faced scientists are desperately searching for an explanation, even a temporary one, that will at least allow them to buy some time. Bojanowski writes:
Never before since measurements began in the late 1970s has there been so much ice at the southern continent at this time of the year.”
Bojanowski cites climate scientist Hugues Goosse of the Université Catholique of Louvain in Belgium, who says that Antarctica is behaving differently due to the fact that it is surrounded by oceans, and not continents as is the case in the Arctic. Goosse tells of ocean dynamics acting as a likely driver in polar ice behavior.
News for Goosse: Ocean cycles are a climate factor that climate scientists always had a habit of denying in the past. Skeptics argued again and again that oceans indeed acted as one of the earth’s primary thermostats, but were always dismissed. This is one reason why climate models have been so wrong.
Yet, Goosse insists the phenomenon is “temporary”. Spiegel writes:
Goosse believes in “temporary fluctuations in weather patterns”, for example changes in the prevailing wind directions. In the meantime winds are blowing over the southern continent more outwards towards the sea and thus are blowing ice outwards in all directions.”
Why this is happening is unclear. But Bojanowski cites a theory proposed by the National Snow and Ice Data Center, who think the ozone hole over the South Pole may be playing a role.

The mystery of Antarctic sea ice seems bigger than ever. Bojanowski writes of yet another explanation: Finnish researcher Petteri Uotila thinks the answer is that the Atlantic and the conditions in the Antarctic are linked:
‘I think this explanation solves the Antarctic sea ice paradox,’ believes Petteri Uotila of the Finnish Meteorological Institute in Helsinki, who was not involved in the theory.”
The theory is proposed by scientists at the New York University (NYU) who claim they see an “amazing relationship” between the Atlantic and Antarctica via the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation (AMO).
The Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation is the water temperature in the Atlantic fluctuating over decades, depending on how strongly the currents flow. And the fluctuations have an impact on years-long climate data all the way to Antarctica.”
Bojanowski cites Xichen Li of NYU, who says it’s no coincidence and is even confirmed by computer simulations. Bojanowski summarizes:
Obviously the Atlantic climate see-saw has the sea level around Antarctica fluctuating. As a result sea ice extent is changing. How this precisely functions remains unclear, however. ‘It appears we have discovered a surprising remote effect,’ Li says.”
So it’s obvious that the science of sea ice is still massively fraught with overwhelming uncertainty and will remain so for a very long time. The proposed Atlantic-Antarctic link does confirm what many skeptics have been claiming for years: the oceans play a massive role.
Veteran meteorologist Joe Bastardi has been telling us for years that the Arctic sea ice extent is driven in large part by the AMO and that today’s low Arctic sea ice levels are directly linked to the currently positive (warm) AMO. If the warm AMO has an impact on Antarctic sea ice, why wouldn’t it have an impact on the Arctic, which is directly next door? Once again the scientists are only realizing (admitting) what has been obvious to skeptics for a decade now.
Finally scientists like Goosse are waking up. Bojanowski quotes:
Here we are dealing with natural fluctuations that are only masking the warming.”
I.e. Goosse is finally admitting that we haven’t been seeing any warming for years. We suspect that in about 10 years from now, when the mask is off, scientists like Goosse will also see that there never was much warming behind the mask to begin with.

Share this...FacebookTwitterMeteorology professor emeritus Dr. Horst Malberg writes at the European Institute for Climate and Energy (EIKE):
As is evident from the last 15 years, the CO2-driven climate models (and the people pushing them) have a fundamental problem: They did not, or falsely predicted, the current climate development.”
Malberg writes in the conclusion:
The anthropogenic CO2 impact on climate is greatly over-estimated by the climate models and uncritical media, as the recent climate development clearly shows.”
To support this he presents charts that clearly tell us the warming has stopped:

 It’s not only global atmospheric temperatures that have been cooling, but so have sea surface temperatures:
 Annual sea surface temperature anomalies in the Pacific ENSO region. Chart source: Horst Malberg
Malberg also cites a paper appearing in Nature (August 2013) by Yu Kosaka and Shang-Ping Xie, who conclude that the missing warming since 1998 can be explained in large part by the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO), i.e. a natural climate process. Their model of global warming showed that about 60% (0.4°C) of the 0.68°C warming occurring between 1975-1998 can be explained by the PDO.
The decline in PDO intensity that then began in the late 1990s corresponds to the end of global warming:
 Annual mean temperature anomalies 1975 – 2013. Chart Source: Horst Malberg
In his report at EIKE, Malberg goes into further detail on the PDO’s impact on global climate. He writes that the ocean alone is an internal, secondary climate factor, and that it is not the primary climate driver. And because global temperatures are not responding to rising CO2, the trace gas can no longer be regarded as being a main driver behind climate.
Solar activity today comparable to Dalton Minimum

As the primary factor driving climate, Malberg believes it is the sun. The following charts shows the mean value for sunspot activity since 1679 along with mean Central European temperature anomaly:


Chart source: Horst Marlberg
The above two charts show a striking similarity. Malberg writes at EIKE:
Because of empirical analyses on climate change since the Little Ice Age and analyses of the behavior of the ENSO (BWK SO 18/10 and SO 05/12), we can assume that the integral (direct and indirect) solar impact on decadal climate scales is the primary and original factor.”
And adds:
With solar cycle 23 came a drastic decrease in solar activity, with a mean sunspot count of 40 in the current solar cycle 24. Such a collapse in solar activity was last seen 200 years ago during the solar Dalton-Minimum.”
The German meteorologist also says that the sun’s current activity is “without a doubt comparable to that of the Dalton-Minimum and corresponds to the approximately 200-year solar activity oscillation of the de Vries cycle“.
No warming until the middle of the 21st century
Malberg writes near the end of the essay that according to the 200-year cycle, no warming can be expected until the solar activity starts picking up again in the middle of 21st century:
The observed data of the last 300 years speak a clear language: The ‘fickle sun’ as the primary driver is what decides the fundamental extent of the cooling and the warming. The climate hypothesis of the dominance of the anthropogenic climate influence belongs immediately under scrutiny. The anthropogenic CO2 influence on climate behavior is greatly exaggerated by climate models and the uncritical media – as the recent climate developments clearly show.”
Professor Dr. Horst Malberg is the former director of the Meteorological Institute at the Free University of Berlin and a member of the EIKE Committee.

"Oregon is poised to become the second US state after California to impose a cap and trade program aimed at reducing industrial carbon emissions. But ahead of a vote on the legislation Thursday, all 11 Republican state senators fled the capitol in a bid to delay the process. Several claimed to have left the state, beyond the reach of state troopers dispatched by the governor in order to get the legislative session back on track. Senate Republican leader Herman Baertschiger Jr wrote in a statement that the walk-out was “exactly how we should be doing our job”. In a speech on the Senate floor, a visibly frustrated Senate president Peter Courtney begged his colleagues to return. “This is the saddest day of my legislative life,” he said. If passed into law, the clean energy jobs bill would place a cap on emissions from power, transportation and other industries in the state, and establish a system to auction and trade them. The program would begin in 2021, with the goal of reducing greenhouse gas emissions to 45% of 1990 carbon levels by 2035, and 20% of 1990 levels by 2050. Not unlike the principles of the Green New Deal, Oregon’s “cap and invest” program would earmark funds generated by the program for clean energy, climate-related upgrades to infrastructure in order to better retrofit the state for increasing extreme weather events and green jobs training. Supporters say Oregon’s program would be the most progressive of its kind in the country, as funds would be guaranteed for low-income people and communities of color, Native tribes and places hit “first and worst” by the impacts of climate change. “We’ve been fighting like crazy to make sure this is the strongest and most equitable environmental bill,” said Brad Reed of the environmental advocacy coalition Renew Oregon. “The provisions in the bill for equity are some of the strongest in the country.” “Oregon can be the log that breaks the jam nationally” on progressive carbon emissions regulation and green investment, said Governor Kate Brown in a statement. California in 2013 became the first US state to establish its cap and trade program. The biggest share of those revenues so far has gone to high speed rail construction. Oregon’s carbon market would join California’s in the Western Climate Initiative, which also includes Quebec – carbon credits could be auctioned across borders. Carbon pricing essentially redirects the costs of climate change back to industry, by putting a price on carbon emissions and placing climate costs on company balance sheets. The logic behind creating a carbon market assumes that if it costs companies to pollute, companies will not pollute as much. A cap and trade policy is one approach to the scheme, as opposed to creating an actual tax on emissions by the ton. The Union of Concerned Scientists says robust carbon pricing schemes are an integral economic policy tool in reducing emissions in order “to limit some of the worst impacts of climate change”. While cap and trade schemes enjoy broad and in many cases passionate support among Democrats, carbon pricing has critics on the left and the right. Oregon Republicans claim the program is still essentially a tax, and thus would need to pass by a three-fifths majority in both the state house and senate, according to law. Some environmental activists say carbon pricing isn’t just an inadequate tool for addressing climate change, but a potentially destructive one. Cap and trade critics argue a market-based strategy to influence corporate behavior shirks regulatory responsibility and disproportionately impacts low-income communities, by creating pollution hot spots exacerbated by companies buying the right to emit, raising fuel prices that poor rural drivers will struggle to pay. “It’s our position that cap and trade systems don’t work and that they actually harm frontline communities,” said Shawn Fleek of Opal Environmental Justice Oregon. “We’re really witnessing a stark divide in the environmental and environmental justice communities with this process.” If the bill is passed, the entire west coast could soon be capping and trading carbon emissions together. While three attempts at implementing carbon pricing in Washington state have so far failed since 2016, legislators introduced another bill this March to implement a cap and trade program in that state. That bill is currently in committee. • This article was amended on 21 June 2019 to correct the number of Republican senators who fled the building. An earlier version said 12; this has been corrected to 11. "

"“Democracy is the theory that the common people know what they want, and deserve to get it good and hard,” said the American journalist HL Mencken, who died 60 years before the EU referendum but nonetheless seems to have known how things might play out. The British people have spoken and said … what, exactly? Last week’s BritainThinks survey of today’s attitudes found rampant pessimism, anxiety and gloom. “I cannot recall a time when the national mood was more despairing,” said the research firm’s boss Deborah Mattinson. Now we learn that the government is going to give this participatory democracy idea another go, launching a citizens’ assembly on the climate emergency later in the year.  The catch is that, while a group of informed and motivated people will meet several times this autumn, its recommendations will be merely advisory and not binding. A spokeswoman for Greenpeace worried that the assembly might simply be a “glorified public consultation”. We have lived through a succession of outsourcing scandals and disasters in recent times. Carillion, Interserve, G4S, Capita, Kier Group and Serco have all made headlines for the wrong reasons. But what we are experiencing today may the biggest scandal of the lot – the outsourcing of the destiny of the nation to a confused, disgruntled and disillusioned population. Asking citizens to settle the complicated matter of our continued membership of the EU with a simple yes/no question was not one of David Cameron’s better ideas. It bought him an extra year in office after the 2015 election, but has left his political reputation in tatters. He outsourced the government’s responsibility for governing to the rest of us. Most sensible people probably aren’t all that interested in politics much of the time. In the past Jim Messina, the US elections strategist, has argued that the average person may spend only four minutes a week really engaging with political issues. That was then. Since the referendum it has been impossible to hide from endless, noisy talk about hard and soft Brexits, the customs union, the single market, Norway plus, super-Canada, and all the rest of the joyous vocabulary of despair. And normal people’s reaction to all this? I refer you to the findings of the BritainThinks survey. We’ve had enough of it. We’ve been forced to try to engage with obscure technocratic chat and the result is the gloom, anxiety and confusion which has shocked seasoned researchers. I was out buying a copy of Private Eye recently – the one with a blank cover underneath the headline “Theresa May memorial issue: the prime minister’s legacy in full”. The shop assistant saw it, laughed, and then corrected herself. “Well, they [Private Eye] have a go at everyone, don’t they?” she said rather hastily. This was how we used to discuss politics (if we did at all): tentatively, and with some care. Not knowing my personal views the shop assistant had rowed back a bit from her initial response. For all she knew I could have been a Theresa May supporter. It wouldn’t do to get into a row about it. This great Brexit outsourcing calamity has turned us all into semi-informed pundits, required to have a clear view on issues that are complicated, mysterious and unknowable. It’s like being trapped at a three-year-long dinner party with guests you don’t know or particularly like. We’re all thoroughly fed up with it and want to go home. Except that our former home seems impossibly out of reach. When I read in this paper that “governments are going to have to embrace such innovations as citizens’ assemblies and participatory budgeting”, a voice inside my head asks: really? A citizens’ jury sounds like a fine thing. But when called for actual jury service how do a lot of people react? They look for any reason to postpone it or get out of it altogether. There is, sadly, a lot more unpleasantness to get through before the Brexit disaster will be in any sense behind us. Paradoxically, we may need one more democratic moment – an election or a further referendum – to move on. But then perhaps, one day, we could go back to having politicians who do not shirk the duty of leadership, and a political system that has the confidence to operate more normally, without outsourcing its work to the rest of us. Of course, we still want “government of the people, by the people, for the people”. We just need to find some better people to do it. Don’t hold your breath. • Stefan Stern is co-author of Myths of Management"

Share this...FacebookTwitterIt’s long been known that Greenpeace environmentalists are condescending, know-it-all activists, who believe to hold the moral high ground, to be the keepers of the truth.
That sort of mindset has led Greenpeace activists to a false belief they are above the law, that their perceived law is supreme to everyone else’s. Time and again Greenpeace activists have been arrested for illegal activity only to be let go the next day. Unfortunately that ritual of always being set free almost immediately and knowing you have the full power of Greenpeace’s formidable legal team working tirelessly on your behalf have only emboldened Greenpeace activists. Now comes Russia.
Slowly realizing that the situation this time is different, that his activists aren’t going to be walking out of their jail cells like heroes anytime soon, Greenpeace International director Kumi Naidoo is softening the tone. Compare earlier comments to those of today:
Earlier comments from Naidoo before he realized the seriousness:
– “…we believe that intensifying peaceful civil disobedience is not only ethically justifiable but morally necessary.”
– …the world needs people who are “prepared to go to prison, put their lives on the line if necessary, in the struggle for climate justice and addressing the reality of runaway catastrophic climate change“.

– “I make no apologies, by the way, the fact that we are morally and ethically having to break the law, because history teaches us,...”
– Russian authorities are making “absurd accusations“.
Now today, realizing that the situation has become very serious…
– “They, we, Greenpeace, do not believe ourselves to be above the law. We are willing to face the consequences of what we did, as long as those consequences are within a nation’s criminal code as any reasonable person understands that code to be.”
“- My own personal history as a young activist in the anti-apartheid movement has taught me that dialogue is paramount, that in the interests of finding a common understanding we must be willing to talk.”
Suddenly he has stopped viewing Greenpeace as being above the law. Now he wants to engage in dialogue. Imagine that!

"Scotland’s first minister, Nicola Sturgeon, has acknowledged that our planet faces a climate emergency. Inextricably linked to this is the growing ecological crisis. We must not let Brexit derail us from tackling these global challenges head-on. Whatever the outcome of the political uncertainties, we need robust, binding targets for the recovery of Scotland’s natural environment to safeguard both nature and people. This is why we have come together from across Scottish society to ask the first minister to bring forward a new Scottish environment act. Ensuring our world is rich in nature is the best insurance we have against dangerous climate heating. Protecting, restoring and enhancing Scotland’s natural environment would help limit temperature rises and help us adapt to changes that we cannot avoid. It would also give us so much more.  Everyone has the right to a clean and healthy environment. Nature enriches people’s lives.

It ought to be compulsory reading for everyone, especially climate-change deniers. I would love to believe that those who can plant trees will redouble their efforts, and those who cannot will applaud and encourage this lifesaving measure. The feature includes the fact that about 15bn trees are felled every year, dwarfing replacement efforts. Another cause for lament is the possibility of the building of a third runway at Heathrow. Aeroplanes emit carbon dioxide and ozone faster and in greater quantities than road traffic.

Share this...FacebookTwitterMy  last post on sea level rise here led to Swedish blog site Stockholms Initiativet to post on the subject as well.
That post in turn sparked a reader comment from top Swedish climate scientist Lennart Bengtsson, translated in English (my emphasis):
Hi
We now have satellite measurements for 20 years which indicate a steady rise of about 3 mm per year, and during that time no acceleration, See: http://sealevel.colorado.edu/.
However, it is important to be clear that this is an average and that there were considerable local variations related to tectonic changes, among others, after the last ice age. The isostatic adjustment that needs to be done in order to obtain useful data are being evaluated by the experts now. As you can see from the graph, it is clear that we need a relatively long time to obtain a realistic trend, but 20 years is certainly enough. On Monday I was involved in a public panel discussion with Pachauri who insisted that this is an acceleration. I found that I think I know more about this than Mr. Pachauri. The reference above appears to me quite compelling.“
You just gotta love it. So even though the observations show there is no real detectable acceleration in sea level rise, Pachauri “insists that this is an acceleration“. It’s all in their fantasies and crystal ball models. None of it is real. This is what the panic is based on.
Also note that Bengtsson calls the comprehensive compilation of by K.E. Puls “quite compelling”. No surprise here as real observations tend to be so.

"The melting of Himalayan glaciers has doubled since the turn of the century, with more than a quarter of all ice lost over the last four decades, scientists have revealed. The accelerating losses indicate a “devastating” future for the region, upon which a billion people depend for regular water. The scientists combined declassified US spy satellite images from the mid-1970s with modern satellite data to create the first detailed, four-decade record of ice along the 2,000km (1,200-mile) mountain chain. The analysis shows that 8bn tonnes of ice are being lost every year and not replaced by snow, with the lower level glaciers shrinking in height by 5 meters annually. The study shows that only global heating caused by human activities can explain the heavy melting. In previous work, local weather and the impact of air pollution had complicated the picture. Joshua Maurer, from Columbia University’s Lamont-Doherty Earth observatory, who led the new research, said: “This is the clearest picture yet of how fast Himalayan glaciers are melting since 1975, and why.” The research is published in the journal Science Advances. Prof Joerg Schaefer, also at Columbia and part of the team, said: “It is really the doubling of the speed of glacier melt that is most concerning.” The new understanding of past melting means forecasts can now be made with far more confidence but the outlook is dire, he said. “It looks devastating and there is no doubt in my mind, not a single grain of doubt, that [the impact of the climate crisis] is what we are seeing.” A landmark report published in February found that at least a third of the ice in the Hindu Kush-Himalaya ranges was already doomed to melt by the end of the century, even if drastic action to cut emissions was taken immediately. Without action, two-thirds would go. Either way, serious consequences will be felt by those who rely on the great rivers that flow from the peaks into India, Pakistan, China and other nations. “It’s the climate crisis you haven’t heard of,” said Philippus Wester, at the International Centre for Integrated Mountain Development, who led the February study and said the new work was very convincing. “Increasingly uncertain and irregular water supplies will impact the 1 billion people living downstream from the Himalaya mountains in south Asia.” The spy satellite photographs used in the research had lain unused in archives for some years. But a computer tool developed by Maurer and colleagues enabled these 1970s photos to be turned into 3D maps. The scientists used this data to track the changes in 650 Himalayan glaciers. On average, the glacier surfaces sank by 22cm (8.6 inches) a year from 1975 to 2000. But the melting has accelerated, with an average loss of 43cm a year from 2000 to 2016.  The evidence points to human-caused climate change being the dominant cause of the melting. The glaciers are shrinking at similar rates all along the mountain chain, indicating a common cause. Weather changes and the settling of black air pollution, which absorbs heat from the sun and speeds up melting, have only local effects. Temperature data from the region also shows an average rise of 1C from 2000-16 compared with 1975-2000. Calculations show this rise is consistent with the amount of ice being lost. “Even glaciers in the highest mountains of the world are responding to global air temperature increases driven by the combustion of fossil fuels,” said Joseph Shea, at the University of Northern British Columbia in Canada, who was not involved in the study. Schaefer said: “For the wellbeing of the people there, our results are of course the worst possible. But it is what it is, and now we have to prepare for that scenario. We have to worry a lot, because so many people are affected. “To stop the temperature rises, we have to cool the planet,” he said. “We have to not only slow down greenhouse gas emissions, we have to reverse them. That is the challenge for the next 20 years.”"

Share this...FacebookTwitterIt started with the Farmer’s Almanac. We’ve been hearing lots of talk about another brutal winter being in store.
Photo right: weatherbell.com/
Although seasonal forecasts are speculative at best, meteorology indeed has advanced to a point where it is possible to get an idea of what direction the upcoming season is tending towards. Farmers have been doing this successfully for centuries.
Meteorologist Joe Bastardi in his Saturday Summary at the 7-minute mark looks at the latest NCEP NCAR global winter forecast for 2013/14. The charts point to another “brutal winter for Europe“. The forecast sees blocking and a negative NAO. Joe also tweeted that “SST analog package combined with low solar, and climate cycle (similar to early 50s)  argue for nasty Euro Winter“.
Joe is not alone in pointing out that weather services are looking at a brutal European winter. German meteorologist Dominik Jung tweeted the following chart from the French CFS meteorological services which shows really nasty cold in store for January.

German meteorologist Dominik Jung tweets that a bitter cold one could be in store for Europe. Chart: CFS
Moreover, the online web.de/magazine here carries the title: “Winter 2013/2014 is going to be really cold”, citing “one of the most well-known long-term models of the American Weather Service“.
Web.de writes:

It looks like the 2013/2014 winter is going to be extremely frosty. Jung has evaluated the data: ‘Looking at these charts, it’s going to be really cold.'”
Web.de adds that signs show the winter could be a long, protracted affair:
The cold air flow from Eastern Europe to Central Europe could strengthen considerably. […] Also the cold winter weather should continue through February and the Southwest could be hit by the Russian beast from the east. This scenario could extend into deep into March. ‘After the last five much-too-cold winters, this development would be no real surprise and well within the realms of the possible,’ says meteorologist Jung.”
If this forecast (fraught with uncertainty) should pan out out to be true, then it would be a record six colder-than-normal winters in a row for Europe. You just couldn’t drift further away from global warming. Six in a row would be nothing short of spectacular. Such a long, protracted winter as described above would make it one of the worst in 100 years.
But not every meteorologist is convinced that long-term seasonal forecasts are of any value. Swiss meteorologist Jörg Kachelmann at Twitter, for example, scoffs at such prognoses, writing that it’s mainly stuff “from the charlatan department“.
Again we have reiterate that these forecasts are truly speculative, and all the meteorologist point this out. So there really is no need to get pissy about it.
I’m a bit skeptical of the long-term winter forecasts as well, though not as much as Mr. Kachelmann. Large global scale weather patterns can change quickly. For example there’s still lots of uncertainty as to what will happen with the ENSO in the months ahead, and if you can’t predict the ENSO for the next few months, then how can you predict the other global seasonal patterns? Another example is the hurricane season. How often have hurricane season predictions been wrong?
On the other hand, we now have more than 100 years of detailed weather data that now allow us to recognize certain repeating patterns, and so seasonal tendency forecasts are becoming a reality. You can’t just dismiss them offhand.

Share this...FacebookTwitterIf the oceans have eaten the heat, then it certainly isn’t to be found in the Arctic Ocean – that’s for sure!
The Beeb has surprised today in reporting that Arctic sea ice VOLUME grew a stunning 50%, from 6000 cubic kilometers to approx. 9000 cubic kilometers, from 2012 to 2013, this according to measurements made by the Cryosat probe of the European Space Agency.
Yet another argument of the warmists is melting away.
Data from Europe’s Cryosat spacecraft suggests there were almost 9,000 cu km of ice at the end of this year’s melt season. This is close to 50% more than in the corresponding period in 2012.
Are sea ice models next in line to be embarrassed?
Whenever sea ice area did not cooperate, the warmists always insisted that we needed to look at volume – that, they told us, was the real barometer. But now we are seeing that Arctic sea ice volume is also no longer cooperating. According to Rachel Tilling from the UK’s Nerc Centre for Polar Observation and Modelling (CPOM).
One of the things we’d noticed in our data was that the volume of ice year-to-year was not varying anything like as much as the ice extent – at least for the years 2010, 2011 and 2012.

This is why we’re really quite surprised by what we’ve seen in 2013. We didn’t expect the greater ice extent left at the end of the summer melt to be reflected in the volume. But it has been. And the reason is related to the amount of multi-year ice in the Arctic.”
Of course scientists and the BBC are scrambling to play down the new development, saying that the Arctic ice volume is still very low.
They blame “wind patterns” for not spreading the ice out more, and thus preventing it from melting more during the 2013 summer. Yet, we recall that in 2007 and 2012 the same scientists immediately blamed global warming for the rapid melt, and not winds, which had been clearly at play. Little wonder the public is losing confidence.
More old ice
The Beeb adds: “Part of this stronger performance can be put down to the greater retention of older ice.”
Interestingly scientists say thickness/volume is the best metric with which to judge the health of the ice pack. Perhaps then we should see more plots of this metric in the future instead of the at-times meaningless sea ice area extents.

Share this...FacebookTwitterThe online German daily Die Welt here  has an interview with ARD public television chief meteorologist Karsten Schwanke on why it’s so cold in North America. He attributes the severe cold to an “unusually stable pattern by the Jet Stream“.
As I read the interview I waited for the “is global warming the cause?” question. It didn’t come until the very end. Overall the interview was quite factual throughout, much to my relief.
Schwanke tells Die Welt that the cold air mass was brought down to the states by a “polar vortex” and that “North America is geographically predestinated for cold air to come south very quickly because there are no mountain ranges to block the way.”
So we see from Schwanke’s explanation that such a phenomenon is not unknown and is natural; it happened in the past. Time magazine for example blamed global cooling for the development of “circumpolar vortices” back in 1974: Read here. And Princeton physicist William Happer says: “Polar vortices have been around forever. They have almost nothing to do with more CO2 in the atmosphere.” Read here.
Schwanke tells Die Welt that currently there is a very clear pattern in the northern hemisphere, one that is made up of four main blocks of weather: “There are two cold regions, namely North America and Central Siberia, and two warm regions: Europe and Eastern Siberia.” Schwanke describes the current Jet Stream as having very few dips and rises, thus causing large regions to remain stuck in a certain weather pattern for weeks.
Forecasts beyond 8 days are “rather uncertain”
On how long the cold pattern will continue keeping North America in its grip, Schwanke says this is very difficult to say: “There are various weather models that are still currently contradicting each other. Forecasts more than eight days into the future are in any case rather uncertain.”
On how the cold weather in North America impacts the weather in Europe, Schwanke says:

Very cold air masses that flow from North America into the Atlantic end up mixing with warmer air from the south. This is how gigantic low pressure systems are formed over the Atlantic and produce south west currents – this is why it’s so warm where we are.”
There we have it: mid and north Atlantic storms are triggered by cold air masses.
On the question as to when winter will finally arrive in Germany, Schwanke thinks there may be a fundamental change in the works over the next two weeks, but the models are still too uncertain on this.
When asked if man can have an impact on the weather, Schwanke replies that “today there is not really any serious scientific evidence to show that really works – getting clouds to rain for example. The energy movements in the atmosphere are so great that a few human measures would be smaller than pin pricks.”
At the very end: He is asked if there a connection between extreme weather and climate change? Here Schwanke replies saying that cold snaps “will not change global warming, which we are experiencing: Eastern Siberia is warmer than it has been in a long time. Europe will have one of the warmest winters in a long time.”
Unfortunately Schwanke obviously has not looked at the global temperatures for the last 15 years. NO WARMING!
He then tells Die Welt there were some papers out that showing that Arctic sea ice extent could have an impact on the Jet Stream waves. But he didn’t come across as being too convinced. Why should he be? The great US cold snaps of the 1960s and 1970s were delivered by polar vortices at a time when Arctic sea ice extent was high.
Also there are papers showing a strong correlation between solar activity and European winters.

"A growing number of teachers want their pupils to learn more about the climate crisis and are calling for environmental training so they can prepare children for a rapidly changing world, according to a poll. The findings from YouGov research commissioned by Oxfam come before the latest round of school climate strikes on Friday, in which it is expected that hundreds of thousands of young people will walk out of classrooms around the world. Noga Levy-Rapoport, from the UK Student Climate Network, said the results showed teachers and students agreed there needed to be a radical overhaul of the education system in response to the climate crisis. “It’s clear that our education system isn’t fit for purpose to equip us for the future we’re inheriting,” she said. “As things stand our generation is being led down a dark tunnel toward increasingly severe climate breakdown and uncertainty. That’s why we’re calling for radical change to centre the climate crisis as an educational priority.” More than two-thirds of teachers polled said there should be more teaching in UK schools about climate change, while three-quarters did not feel they had received adequate training to educate students on the subject. Around 70% agreed radical change was needed to make the education system “fit for the times we live in”. School strikes are due to take place in 80 towns and cities in the UK, with tens of thousands of students expected to take part. Meanwhile, up to 10,000 climate strike leaders from across Europe will gather in Aachen, Germany, for a pan-European rally. The school strike movement started in August 2018 when Greta Thunberg, then 15, held a solo protest outside the Swedish parliament. Now hundreds of thousands of schoolchildren walk out of class each week to voice their concern about the ecological crisis. In the UK, one of the campaign’s key demands has been to transform education to inform young people of the facts of the climate emergency. Last month Labour pledged to make the climate emergency a core element of the school curriculum from primary school onwards. The shadow education secretary, Angela Rayner, said a future Labour government would ensure the climate crisis was an educational priority, with all young people taught about its ecological and social impact. Issues around the climate crisis are currently covered in both science and geography at key stage 3 (KS3) for ages 11 to 14 and at key stage 4 (KS4) for ages 14 to 16. Both subjects are compulsory at KS3, while only science is compulsory at KS4. But many activists, teachers and experts say this is not enough. The Department for Education said pupils were already taught about climate change as part of the national curriculum in science and geography in both primary and secondary school. "

Share this...FacebookTwitterEurope and especially Germany have been enjoying an unusual, weeks-long spell of mild weather with temperatures in the double-digit Celsius range. Southerly winds have kept the continent mild for weeks. Warmists have been coming out and saying: Aha! Just as we predicted! And they are even claiming the same about the deadly cold weather gripping North America. 
Meteorologist: extremes are natural and nothing new
However, yet another veteran German meteorologist has come out and dumped cold water on the claims that the supposed weather extremes are signs of a warming planet. Meteorologist Udo Baum at wetter.net here tells readers that the extreme cold wave gripping the US and the mild weather in Europe are nothing unusual and are all part of natural weather.
Far greater fluctuations were common in history 
Baum writes:
Indeed a look back at the last 2000 years shows that there have been already even far greater fluctuations. Individual winters were so cold that rivers and lakes froze over. But also some winters were so mild that it never snowed in the flatlands and that flowers and fruit trees blossomed  two months earlier than normal.
The fluctuations between individual years are much too great to allow us to attribute them directly to long-term climate trends. And this winter is still not over and surprises are completely possible. […]
There are still too many inconsistencies and too many unknowns within the complex and chaotic climate system. Here it’s warmer; there it’s colder. The role of the oceans is still not sufficiently researched, carbon dioxide is not the only problem-gas in the atmosphere, says the team at wetter.net.
Methane plays a considerably more aggressive role. The interactions of water vapor content in the atmosphere play a large role.
Thus we maintain that the USA is not facing an ice age and that winter is not going to disappear in Central Europe in the future. In two or three weeks the weather may be entirely different, never mind next winter.”
Natural factors under-stated – can reverse man-made impacts

On natural climate factors, Baum writes:
The warming trend that is enhanced by man over the last four decades can suddenly switch back because of natural cycles or natural catastrophes and their one-time effects.”
Winter returning to Europe
On another topic, people have been asking me if we’re going to see any winter this year. Unfortunately the spring-like weather is about to end across much of Europe in a couple of days. The weather models are now pretty much unanimous and show a fundamental change in weather patterns in the works.
Donnerwetter here writes:
For the coming weeks almost all computers are showing a weather change to winter. Many centimeters of new snow are expected at temperatures at around -2 Grad C in the central mountains and 0 Grad C in the lowlands. Next week the eastern winds are back. At times frost of up to -10 Grad C are expected at night.”
The cold pole over the high north now has the chance to move closer to Europe and Asia. In addition in the days ahead continental, permanent sub-freezing air is gathering in Siberia and deep into Russia.
Thus the huge cold snap in the USA indirectly could level the way for winter to reach Europe, but likely in a less dramatic manner. Currently signs are mounting that  the downward temperature trend will get a boost next week. More and more models are pointing to the possibility a cold air mass extending out to Central Europe from the northeast.”
Here’s the 10-15 day outlook, thanks to Joe Bastardi at Twitter:

"Fast fashion – the rapid system of trend-driven, low-cost clothing manufacture beloved by UK consumers – is on the rampage. We crossed a worrying line in 2014, scaling up garment production to 100bn pieces of new clothing a year. These are clothes, made from virgin resources, increasingly plastic, pushed out into the world with little thought as to where they will end up. Without rapid reform, the fashion industry – of which fast fashion is the dominant player – could be responsible for a quarter of the Earth’s carbon budget by 2050. This threat to the planet has, not surprisingly, attracted the attention of climate protesters. Extinction Rebellion picketed London fashion week for the first time in February. The UK’s contribution is enormous. Not only did we invent fast fashion, but our fashion consumers are among the most voracious in the world. One in three young women, the biggest segment of consumers, consider garments worn once or twice to be old. UK consumers sent 300,000 tonnes of textiles to be burned or dumped in landfill in 2018. The drive to fast fashion began from the moment Hargreaves of Oswaldtwistle built the first spinning jenny to spin cotton faster. By the 1770s the mill owner Richard Arkwright’s version could spin 20 to 30 warp threads at once. With faster material production came more ready to wear clothes. By the early 1800s the well-heeled were writing to newspapers complaining that their housemaids were asking for higher wages to fund dress purchases. The poor maids were likely to have been trying to fill the same void in their lives that we do today, but we have fallen hook, line and sinker. To take the heat out of dressing we’re often told to think of our grandparents and the make-do-and-mend spirit of the 1940s. In reality though this period, when the purchase of civilian clothing was restricted to free up materials and shipping space for the war effort, is an anomaly. These forebears were perhaps the only ones who had a truly sustainable approach to fashion. Ultimately fashion sped up not just the fibre production but also garment making. By the 1990s the UK’s industry had been almost entirely exported to some of the lowest wage economies on earth.  If there is one point where we should have stopped the madness it was the aftermath of the morning of 23 April 2013, when the Rana Plaza complex in Bangladesh collapsed. More than 1,300 people, mostly young female garment workers making for western brands, died in the disaster, which exposed the true cost of our fast fashion habit. The industry, however, was allowed to mark its own homework, taking control of a limited programme of reform that would retrofit factories to bring them up to minimum safety requirements. Not one brand moved to change the system. Instead, fast fashion pushed onwards and upwards. Brands sought cheaper more compliant manufacturers in new territories, exporting the same system for production that had led to Rana Plaza to Ethiopia, the lowest-wage economy on Earth. A recent study by NYU Stern into fast fashion production at the Hawassa industrial park found workers barely covering the cost of food and transport. This week the Manchester-based Missguided.com launched a £1 plastic polymer bikini. It serves as a reminder that the new crop of online retailers make high street fast fashion look as slow as a diplodocus. These brands are social media and Snapchat tacticians with a direct line to very young people. Digital natives “swipe up” and instantly purchase an outfit worn by someone they follow. Consuming at this speed removes any possible moment for pause and reflection. The online fashion retailers have stripped out every barrier to purchase, even the one of not actually having the money. At Missguided.com even your £1 bikini can be purchased in instalments over four weeks using Klarna, a Swedish version of an increasing number of buy-now-pay-later platforms that do not require credit checks. This business model might seem one that cares little for the planet, but Boohoo.com launched a sustainable collection this week. They might want to be careful overselling their commitment. H&M, one of the biggest producers of fast fashion and generator of an extraordinary number of sustainability initiatives, has run slap bang into the Norwegian Consumer Authority. Set up to police Norway’s Marketing Control Act, the NCA has concluded that H&M’s conscious collection gives consumers the impression that their clothes are more sustainable than they actually are.  This is a welcome intervention but it does not compensate for the government’s failure to help fix fashion here. The point is that we are in a fashion industry emergency, at risk of having to explain to future generations that we missed the climate change targets because we couldn’t resist a £1 bikini advertised during Love Island.

"France is falling behind on tackling the climate emergency despite ambitious promises to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, a new report has found, saying Paris is worryingly far from delivering its goals. The stark warning from France’s independent advisory council on climate comes at a key moment, as the eurozone’s second-biggest economy attempts to present itself as a world leader on the climate emergency. The centrist president, Emmanuel Macron, who sought to counter Donald Trump by promising to “make our planet great again”, has tried to encourage other European nations to aim for neutral carbon dioxide emissions across the EU by 2050.  Opinion polls have showed the climate emergency is a growing priority for French voters, who increased the Green party’s score in European elections last month.  But the report handed to the prime minister, Édouard Philippe, on Tuesday night suggests that everyday life in France does not match the political promises. France needs to seriously strengthen its climate policies – particularly on transport, car use and building renovation – if it is to meet its commitments under the Paris climate agreement, the experts said. Crucially the report comes just as its authors described “a new era in the long-running rivalry between France and Britain: who will decarbonise the fastest”. The UK government announced this month that it had committed to a net zero emissions target for 2050, making Britain the first major economy to do so – with one of the most ambitious goals set by a leading polluting nation. In parallel, the French government is working on a draft energy and climate bill with the same target for 2050. France and the UK are the largest countries so far to set such an ambitious objective in legislation. France gets about 75% of its electricity from nuclear energy, which past governments argued meant lower carbon dioxide emissions than neighbours using coal. The government has pledged to reduce the nuclear energy share to 50% in 2035. But the report points to the ways in which the French government must work far harder to prepare the country for change. Carbon dioxide emission reduction has not been happening fast enough in France, the report found. France’s first official objective, the 2015-18 carbon budget, was not met. During this period, annual emissions decreased by only 1.1%, much less than planned. The rate of decrease needs to triple by 2025 to catch up on the objectives, the authors said. The key culprit in this “gap between ambition and reality” was transport: emissions have not seen a real decrease in the last 10 years, including from cars and lorries. “There is not enough modernisation of transport, or if there is, it’s going towards private cars and not public transport,” said Corinne Le Quéré, chair of the advisory body that drew up the report. Another problem is emissions from buildings, which have decreased three times more slowly than anticipated. Building renovation had not been effective enough. “France’s commitments are ambitious, but at the current rate, they are unlikely to be met,” Le Quéré said. “As long as actions to cut carbon emissions remain at the margins of public policies, France does not stand a chance of achieving carbon neutrality by 2050.” She said it wasn’t enough to leave the climate crisis to an environment ministry. “It must be a national priority, central policy in all of government,” she said. Macron faced a crisis in climate policy late last year when the anti-government gilets jaunes (yellow vests) protesters took to the streets against a new carbon tax intended to urge motorists to change their behaviour. People in the countryside said it was deeply unfair to hike taxes on fuel use where there was no alternative transport to private cars. The tax was later abandoned. Le Quéré said lessons must be learned from the crisis and policies aimed at shrinking emissions should be fair and seen as fair, without increasing inequalities in different geographic areas. The report said that carbon budgets should be more ambitious and set in law. The carbon neutrality objective should include international transport, from aviation to shipping, and a strategy to reduce the country’s global carbon footprint, which includes emissions from goods manufactured in other countries for consumption in France. Last year, Macron’s high-profile environment minister, Nicolas Hulot, quit saying the government was taking only “mini steps” that were insufficient to deal with climate change."
"The Morrison government has been challenged by the European Union and by China about whether it can meet its Paris commitments given rising emissions, and about growing pollution from vehicles, ahead of a progress meeting about climate commitments in Bonn next week. Nineteen countries, including Australia, will gather in Bonn on 24 and 25 June for a multilateral assessment of progress made under international climate commitments, and ahead of that session countries have submitted a range of questions about the performance of signatories in meeting their climate targets. As well as questions about rising emissions, the EU and Canada have also queried the Morrison government’s decision to use carry-over credits from the Kyoto protocol in its latest carbon budget. The Coalition is counting a 367 megatonne abatement from carry-over credits (an accounting system that allows countries to count carbon credits from exceeding their targets under the soon-to-be-obsolete Kyoto protocol periods against their Paris commitment for 2030) to help meet Australia’s 2030 target. The EU in its questions to Australia points out that net emissions will grow during the period 2013 to 2020 and notes “Australia is also increasing coalmining, in particular for export”. It has asked whether Australia considers its emissions profile, which has seen pollution rise since the repeal of the carbon price, to be “on a structural path of decrease in line with its commitments”. It has also flagged fossil fuel exports and asked whether they are sustainable “in the context of Paris agreement”. Sign up to receive the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Morrison government officials have addressed the implicit criticism by arguing in a submitted answer that “Australia’s national emissions peaked in 2007” and pointing to a fall in emissions per capita. It says even without its climate policies, unveiled just before the recent federal election, including the reboot of the Abbott-era emissions reduction fund (ERF), “the decoupling of economic growth from greenhouse gas emissions has been progressing steadily since 1990”. The government says the mix in electricity generation has changed between 2013 and 2020, and the Renewable Energy Target (RET) will see renewable energy grow to about 23.5% of Australia’s energy mix by 2020. Australian officials do not, in the answer to the EU, mention the RET winds down from 2020, or that a sectoral target to drive emissions reduction in the electricity sector, proposed by Malcolm Turnbull in the national energy guarantee, was scrapped after he was replaced as prime minister by Scott Morrison. The EU has also challenged Australia on its 2030 Paris target, pointing out “on the basis of reported projections with existing policies and measures it is not on track to meet this commitment”. The EU asked Australia whether it would need further policies to meet the Paris commitment, given the current trends. Australian government officials point to the policies outlined before the recent election, including the funding boost for the ERF. But in defending the status quo, the government has also restated a commitment to “review and refine” domestic policies aligned with the five-yearly review process under the Paris agreement. “This approach will provide for integrated consideration of domestic policy and international targets, and provide guidance for industry about future policy review processes,” officials said. China, in a question to Australia, notes there will be a significant increase in transportation greenhouse gas emissions, and asks what measures Australia plans to take to reduce transport pollution in the future. While the Morrison government pilloried Labor in the recent election campaign for proposing a vehicle emissions standard and targets for the uptake of electric vehicles, characterising Labor’s plans as a “war on the weekend”, government officials have told China the Coalition “is supporting low and zero emissions transport options in a number of ways”. It says it is “developing” a national electric vehicle strategy – a strategy the government has not yet unveiled – which it says will build on support being rolled out through the Australian Renewable Energy Agency and the Clean Energy Finance Corporation. It also points to the government’s Green Vehicle Guide website, and mandatory fuel consumption and carbon dioxide emission labels, that “help consumers identify and choose more fuel efficient vehicles” as well as “action to bring our fuel quality in line with international standards”. The government says the safeguard mechanism “puts regulated limits on the emissions of large transport facilities that emit more than 100,000 tonnes C02-equivalent each year (mostly rail freight, domestic aviation and shipping)” and says the ERF “incentivises businesses, households and landowners to proactively reduce their emissions [and] provides incentives to reduce the emissions intensity of land and sea transport activity”. It also points to the national hydrogen strategy, which is being led by Australia’s chief scientist, Alan Finkel, which is due to be delivered by the end of 2019."

Share this...FacebookTwitterIf you’re in Berlin next month, here’s an event you’ll want to put in your calendar.
Dr. Peter Heller of Science Skeptical writes here that Germany’s Helmholtz Association is holding a podium discussion in Berlin on March 17, 2014. The title:
“What can we believe? The climate debate and its impacts”
So even some prestigious German science research institutes are starting to second guess claims that climate science is settled and the debate is over. Moreover, skeptic views (the very backbone of scientific progress) are being given a serious platform for open discussion once again.
The podium discussion invitation reads (my emphasis):
The next segment in our Fokus@Helmholtz discussion series is titled: ‘What can we believe? The climate debate and its impacts’. At the end of March the second part of the IPCC Report will presented to the public  in Yokohama, Japan. It will once again cast questions about climate change, its impacts on man and environment. International scientists are already discussing amid controversy and are jockeying for a mutual answers in the climate question. When scientists are struggling, how can citizens understand what is going on with our climate and act responsibly? Why is the dispute among the scientists so fierce? What’s driving the climate skeptics? And: Which questions can climate models answer at all? Many people are asking what should be believed: Is climate change not really as bad as first thought? What impact does man have on it and to what extent? What roles do political interests play when it comes to forecasts?
We warmly invite you to the fourth of the Fokus@Helmholtz series taking place Monday, 17 March 2014, at 7 p.m. (entrance starting at 6:30 p.m.) in the DKB Atrium (Taubenstraße 7, 10117 Berlin). Under the title: “What can we believe? The climate debate and its impacts“ we would like to mutually discuss with you and with representatives from business, advanced education and non-university research.
Please register.
The event series Fokus@Helmholtz brings research, politics and society together on a regular basis in order to discuss the controversial questions of the future. The Helmholtz Association and its invited guests would like to look beyond the horizon, to question options for action, and to provide food for thought.”
Wow! Hard to believe but the Helmholtz here is testing a return back to science. Gone, at least for the moment, are the claims the discussion is over and the crude attempts to marginalize alternative viewpoints. Are we seeing a climate science renaissance?
The Helmholtz provides the program itenary:

Welcome:

Prof. Dr. Jürgen Mlynek, President of the Helmholtz Association

Podium discussion:

Frank Drieschner, Die Zeit
Dr. Oliver Geden, Foundation for Science and Policy
Dr. Peter Heller, “Science Skeptical Blog”
Prof. Andreas Hense, University of Bonn
Prof. Hans von Storch, Helmholtz Centre Geestacht Ventre for Material and Coastal Research

Moderation: Jan-Martin Wiarda, Helmholtz Association
“Four or five years ago this hardly would have been possible”
Peter Heller, a named participant in the above podium discussion, writes at Science Skeptical:
Also even if I am just the “quota skeptic ” it is indeed courageous of the Helmholtz Association to invite someone like me. Four or five years this hardly would have been possible or even considered. By the way, my participation is not because of the profile and impact of Science Skeptical, but solely because of the recommendation by Hans von Storch, whom I wish to thank.
The event description, however, still shows a deficit in partiality. ‘What is driving the skeptics, I don’t know and it is also not relevant. Indeed the question is foremost what is it that the alarmists find so neat about their horror scenarios and transformation fantasies. In the end, reason needs no further justifications. However insisting there’s a need to believe in something, does. Believe what you wish, but keep in mind there is a difference to knowledge.
I’m really curious to see how things will go. And at the and of the evening should people go home with the knowledge that skeptics are not people who practice occult rituals and worship Satan, but rather are the ones with a clear and calm heads in the climate debate, then that will certainly suffice.”
Any readers who happen to be in the Berlin area and who command the German language, this is one event you may not want to pass up. German skeptics can look forward to a good discussion – should Heller not get disinvited, that is.
For now let’s just say that Helmholtz Association is on “Disinvitation Watch” for the next few weeks.

No one knows if it’s really going to be such a winter, but one thing is sure: it sure is starting out like one! At least in parts of Central Europe.
Wetteronline.de has put up a video (Schneefall auch in München) of snow falling in Munich this morning, October 11, 2013. Normally the first snow arrives in the Bavarian capital weeks later.

‘It began to snow in the Bavarian capital of Munich yesterday evening at about 6 p.m. Many of my meteorologist colleagues had believed this to be improbable,’ said meteorologist Dominik Jung: ‘This year winter has struck early and unusually severely. South of Munich up to 20 centimeters of snow was able to pile up.'”
Die Welt adds that schools have been closed in some localities, 22,000 households in Austria have lost power, trains have come to a standstill, and traffic has been in chaos.
Frost is expected to spread across southern and middle Germany this weekend, reports www.wetter.net, “Temperatures down to -4°C are expected under clear skies in some local areas.
Global warming alarmists claim that such incidences have nothing to do with a climate trend. Yet, climate warmists are now scrambling to explain the increasing frequency of cold weather events now taking hold globally. Whether it’s a killer winter in South America, increased snow cover globally, record Arctic sea ice recovery, recovering glaciers in the Alps, record high sea ice extent in Antarctica, extreme cold in southeast Europe, or 5 consecutive colder than normal European winters, just to name a few, the ominous signs of global cooling are compounding rapidly.

According to online Spiegel here, a general counsel to the European High Court has ruled that consumers in one country also have to pay green energy feed-in subsidies to producers in foreign countries as well.
That means that heavily industrialized Germany may soon have to pay energy feed-in subsidies to foreign renewable energy producers as well. Spiegel writes that as a result:
The renewable energy subsidy on electric builds may soon increase further.”
The ruling arises from a recent case where a Finnish wind park had supplied energy to Sweden but was never paid the feed-in subsidy. The Finnish wind park took the case to the EU, who then ruled in favor of the Finns – claiming that the Swede’s refusal to pay represented “a discriminatory limitation of the free flow of goods“. A country must not only pay the green-energy subsidy to domestic producers, but also to those delivering from another country.
Spiegel writes, should the ruling be upheld by the EU High Court:
…it would have considerable consequences also for Germany because neighboring states like Austria, France or the Netherlands would be able to feed-in their low cost hydro-electric, solar or wind energy into the local power grid. For this they would receive the German feed-in rate. The German consumer – once again  – would have to pay.”
Already 600,000 German families are having their power cut off annually because they are no longer able to keep up with sky-rocketing electricity bills. Not only is the energy feed-in act turning out to be a huge wealth-redistribution scheme from the poor to rich property owners domestically, but one that redistributes to the rich in foreign countries as well.

Austrian flagship daily Der Standard here has an interview with Prof. Hans-Joachim Schellhnhuber, Director of the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research in Germany – the Vatican of climate alarmism.
Photo right: Schellnhuber (see credit below)!
In the interview Schellnhuber says that he thinks (not surprisingly) the latest IPCC report is too conservative. He also explains that global temperatures have not risen very much over the last 15 years because “93% of the global warming goes into the ocean, only 2% goes into the atmosphere“.
And in yet another classic example of PIK dramatization and alarmism at its best, he tells readers what this means:
In 2012 a paper by Levitus et al. was published. In it the warming of the ocean from 0 to 2000 meters deep from 1955 to 2010 was estimated. From the increased greenhouse gas effect a warming of 0.09 degrees Celsius was given – evenly distributed over the ocean. Now we only need to calculate the energy contained by this 0.09°C. Just imagine if the ocean released this heat into the atmosphere with a belch. That would shock-heat the first 10 kilometers of our atmosphere – the layer that we live in and where weather occurs – by 36 degrees C …36 degrees Celsius!”
To be fair, Schellnhuber then states that this of course would never happen at once and that this is just a heat conversion calculation. But he adds, “When just a fraction of that is released, such as during the next El Niño, then the air temperature will again jump significantly. Then people will say : ‘Aha, now they are there, the new temperature records.'”

"UK companies must brace for the government to deliberately disrupt or phase out business areas that are unfit for a net zero-carbon economy, according to a report. The UK Energy Research Centre (UKERC) has said many companies will face fundamental change, including the phasing out of the UK’s most polluting business activities.  The government is to begin “purposefully disrupting” industries to spur the move to a zero-carbon economy, after voting through the 2050 target  this month. Jim Watson, a director at the UKERC, said many companies were not ready for deliberate government-led disruption. “Some sectors are more ready than others,” he said. “The electricity sector has already gone through a major change, for example, but other sectors are at the starting point and the government is going to have to be the disruptor here.” He said companies involved in running the UK’s gas networks, or working in the North Sea, may need to consider “an exit, or managed decline”. The sectors facing the biggest shake-up include heating, transport and construction, according to the report. It says they face “starkly divergent futures – including futures where their core assets will need to be phased out”. Prof Jillian Anable, a co-director at the UKERC, said it would prove “politically challenging” for ministers to deliberately disrupt companies, global trade networks, governance and lifestyles. The report identified gaping policy gaps in the government’s plan to move to a zero-carbon economy. Researchers said ministers’ own models provided only limited insights about the potential impact of a major shake-up to the economy. Anable said whole-scale changes were needed in the transport system, the largest carbon emitter in the UK economy. “The UK transport sector is nearly 100% fuelled by fossil fuels, with only tiny niches of electrified and bio-fuelled vehicles,” she said. The government has already set a deadline for the sale of new traditional combustion engine cars to end by 2040. But hybrid vehicles, which are exempt from the ban, will need to be included in it for transport to be “effectively zero carbon” by 2040. The transport sector made up 33% of the UK’s greenhouse gas emissions last year. The UK’s energy supply contributed 28%, while homes and business added 18% each. The report said the construction industry would also need to “undergo disruptive change” to deliver energy efficient building stock compatible with climate targets. But there was “little sign at present” that the policies or skills were in place to retrofit the UK’s draughty homes and businesses, the report said. “Related to this, it remains unclear what changes incumbent firms in heating will need to implement to deliver decarbonisation, and whether they will have the capacity to do so,” the report added."
"France registered its highest temperature on record on Friday, and records for this time of year have already been broken or look likely to be broken imminently across much of the rest of Europe, including Germany, Spain, Switzerland and Austria. The weather in June is usually slightly cooler in Europe, building up to highs later in the summer. However, there was also a June heatwave last year, with prolonged high temperatures across much of the northern hemisphere, accompanied by a drought in many areas.  In the UK, temperatures have reached the high 20s in Scotland, Wales and south-west England, and may top 30C in some parts, according to the Met Office. On Saturday, temperatures will rise further in parts of central and eastern England, with 30C to 34C possible. But a cold front will reach the country on Sunday, lowering temperatures again. Greenhouse gas emissions from burning fossil fuels, forest destruction and other human activities are trapping heat and putting more energy into the climate system.  Hotter air means heatwaves are much more likely. For example, scientists now say the unprecedented heat and wildfires across the northern hemisphere in 2018 “could not have occurred without human-induced climate change”. In Australia, the scorching summer of 2016-17 in New South Wales was made at least 50 times more likely by global heating, linking it directly to climate change. Hotter air can also carry more water vapour, meaning more intense rain and more flooding.  Another important factor in the northern hemisphere is the impact of changes in the Arctic. The polar region is heating more rapidly, reducing the temperature difference with lower latitudes. There is strong evidence that this is weakening the planetary waves (including the jet stream) that normally meander over Europe, Asia and North America. When these waves stall, weather gets fixed over regions and becomes extreme. This has been linked to past floods in Pakistan, heatwaves in Russia and drought in California.  Most of the planet’s trapped heat goes into the oceans and rising sea temperatures mean more energy for hurricanes and typhoons. Record-breaking cyclones hit Mozambique last year. The deluge delivered in the US by Hurricane Harvey in 2017 was made three times more likely by climate change. Rising sea level also means storms cause more coastal damage. Natural variability would cause some extreme weather, even without global heating, but our impacts on the climate make such extremes more likely. Carbon Brief analysed more than 230 studies and found 95% of heatwaves were made more likely or worse by climate change. For droughts, 65% were definitely affected by our hotter world, while the figure for floods was 57%. With the ‘rapidly accelerating’ likelihood of 40C temperatures in UK, it is now undeniable that global heating is causing more extreme weather. Warm air is rising across Europe from north Africa, bringing high temperatures right across the continent. The UK has remained cooler, partly as a result of being further from the source of the warm air and partly because of the cooling effects of the North Sea, Met Office experts said. It is not possible to pin the current heatwave definitively on climate change, because the weather varies so much naturally. Moreover, the likely effects of climate change are not simple. For example, heavy rain and cloudy weather across swathes of northern Europe, including the UK, are likely to become more common as a result of the buildup of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere causing the jet stream weather system to become fixed in position. However, this year’s weather is certainly in line with the predictions scientists have made of rising temperatures, more heatwaves and prolonged droughts interspersed with periods of heavy flooding in some areas. Heatwaves can have pleasant effects, with long sunny days encouraging people into parks and on to beaches, and they certainly bring a smile to the faces of ice-cream sellers. However, the body’s ability to regulate its own temperature is crucial; babies are less well able to regulate their temperature and must be kept in well-ventilated conditions. Older people also lose their regulating abilities as they age and can quickly overheat. In the European heatwave of 2003, there were about 70,000 excess deaths attributed to the long hot spell. People with underlying illnesses can also have problems, and even those who are fit and healthy can experience difficulty sleeping and discomfort, so people are advised to stay hydrated and wear loose clothing at night. There is the impact on farmers. While warm weather at the right time is crucial for many crops during their growing periods, excessively high temperatures can inhibit growth, particularly if they are prolonged. Livestock can also suffer in the heat and need extra care. The problems do not stop there: as Germany’s melting roads have shown, Europe’s infrastructure is not built to cope with such extremes, and adapting it is likely to be expensive and take decades. Finally, one of the ironies of the climate emergency is that hot weather encourages greater use of air conditioning, which was cited recently by BP as a key factor in raising greenhouse gas emissions last year. But as Greenpeace has pointed out, the deaths in Europe are of a relatively small number compared with the “far bigger disasters already occurring in hotter, poorer countries in the global South”. In poorer countries with less advanced infrastructure, global heating is likely to bring drought and water stress, making agriculture more difficult if not impossible across large areas of land, leading to food shortages and potentially conflict and mass migration."
"A trio of central European countries have blocked the EU from inching closer to a net-zero carbon emissions target for 2050. European leaders meeting in Brussels sparred over the EU’s role in tackling the unfolding climate emergency, which threatens to significantly worsen the risks of drought, floods, extreme heat, poverty and destruction of wildlife around the world.  Dashing earlier hopes of a compromise, Poland and the Czech Republic refused to sign up to a text that referred to a climate-neutral EU by 2050 – a target that was already seen as too vague by green activists. In a further blow, the Hungarian prime minister, Viktor Orbán, joined his neighbours in opposing the EU text, despite earlier signs the country was ready to compromise. Supporters of the 2050 plan hoped the EU could show it was moving in that direction ahead of a major UN climate summit in September. Instead the 2050 date was dropped into a footnote that stated: “For a large majority of member states, climate neutrality must be achieved by 2050.” The German chancellor, Angela Merkel, told her fellow leaders that the EU needed to signal ambition ahead of that meeting. The French president, Emmanuel Macron, called for the EU to agree an unambiguous target for net-zero carbon emissions by 2050. But the Central European trio stood their ground against any mention of 2050 in the main EU summit communiqué. The Czech prime minister, Andrej Babiš, had quipped on his arrival at the summit: “Why should we decide 31 years ahead of time what will happen in 2050?” Inside the meeting, Babiš questioned why Europe should act when emissions in China were rising, prompting a retort from the German chancellor. She countered that the Chinese were taking action that would mean a reduction in Chinese emissions after 2030. While supporters of the 2050 plan were disappointed, they are not giving up. “It’s not a matter of if the EU commits to climate neutrality, it’s when,” one diplomat said. A large majority of EU member states support the aim of net zero carbon emissions by 2050. Hopes had grown in recent days, after Slovakia, Bulgaria and some Baltic states announced their support for the 2050 target, seeing economic gains from the transition to a green economy. “We have come to the conclusion that this is a hell of an opportunity,” the Latvian prime minister, Krišjānis Kariņš, told his fellow leaders. Earlier a senior EU diplomat said the debate among member states had moved on significantly since earlier discussions in March, when countries were “very divided”. They said: “We still do not have unanimity, but an overwhelming majority of member states, including member states you would never expect of being ready to accept such an objective are going in that direction.” The UN secretary general, António Guterres, wants the climate summit in September to put the world on a path to limiting global warming to 1.5C – a non-binding aspiration of the 2015 Paris accord. Guterres wrote to European council president, Donald Tusk, last month and called on him to demonstrate the leadership of the EU. “I write to you today both as a G20 member and as a leader who I believe can bring the ingenuity needed to transform our economic systems and avert the negative impacts of a world with high levels of carbon emissions – from rising levels of pollution to costly natural disasters,” he stated. The letter calls for a change of course to “achieve net zero carbon emissions by 2050” and specifies that leaders should curtail current coal-burning power stations and discontinue new ones beyond 2020. Responding to the EU’s failure to agree a 2050 target, green campaigners called on the EU to hold an emergency climate summit ahead of the UN meeting in September. “Hollow words can’t rebuild a house flattened in a mudslide or repay a farmer who’s lost their harvest to drought, said Greenpeace EU climate policy advisor Sebastian Mang. “Merkel and Macron failed to convince Poland and bring others on board. With people on the streets demanding action and warnings from scientists that the window to respond is closing fast, our governments had a chance to lead from the front and put Europe on a rapid path to full decarbonisation. They blew it.”"

Share this...FacebookTwitterFormer IPCC Author Kevin Trenberth admits in a new paper: PDO ocean oscillation contributed to the 1976-1998 warming phase
By Dr. Sebastian Lüning and Prof. Fritz Vahrenholt
(Translation, editing by P Gosselin)
It took a while, but ocean cycles have finally been adopted by the IPCC as an important climate factor. With John Fasullo, Kevin Trenberth has written in a new paper appearing in the journal Earth’s Future that the warming pause taking place since 1998 indeed may have something to do with the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO). Also even Trenberth’s pal Stefan Rahmstorf suddenly thinks it’s a good possibility, writing in his Klimalounge blog on December 16, 2013:
Leading US climatologist Kevin Trenberth has been conducting research in this field for 20 years and has just published a comprehensive enlightening article on the subject. Trenberth emphasizes the role of the ENSO’s long-term fluctuations, the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO). Said in simpler terms: It’s about phases in the tropical Pacific that have more frequent El Niños and phases that have more frequent La Niña conditions (like right now), which can last up to decades. The latter brings with it an ongoing somewhat slower warming of the earth’s surface temperature because more heat gets stored deeper in the oceans. One important point here: even if the surface temperature is stagnating, our planet continues to absorb a net amount of heat.”
The other “important point” that Rahmstorf fails to mention is of even greater importance. Trenberth explicitly admits in his new paper that the 1976-1998 warming phase is attributed in part to the positive phase of the PDO (original text):
The picture emerging is one where the positive phase of the PDO from 1976 to 1998 enhanced the surface warming somewhat by reducing the amount of heat sequestered by the deep ocean, while the negative phase of the PDO is one where more heat gets deposited at greater depths, contributing to the overall warming of the oceans but cooling the surface somewhat. The Pacific Ocean appears to account for the majority of the decadal variability… Nevertheless, the events in the Pacific undoubtedly also affect the Atlantic, Indian, and Southern Oceans as the system acts collectively to equilibrate to these changes in the flow of energy.
In 2012 when we brought up the PDO as one of the triggers for the 1976-1998 warming in our “Die kalte Sonne” book and proposed ocean cycles as a sort of pulse generator for temperature cycles on a decadal scale, we were met with fierce resistance from the German climate science establishment. Now less than 2 years later, “Die kalte Sonne” finds itself as mainstream science.

At a Royal Society meeting in 2013, Julia Slingo of the Met office played devil’s advocate and posed the following question to Prof Jochen Marotzke of the German Max Planck Institute of Meteorology, see the 42:46 mark royalsociety.org/marotzke.mp3:
“…it’s a great presentation about 15 years being irrelevant,  but I think, some of us might say if you look at the Pacific Decadal Oscillation and it’s timescale that it appears to work, it could be 30 years, and therefore I think, you know, we are still not out of the woods yet on this one. … If you do think it’s internal variability, and you say we do think the Pacific Decadal Oscillation is a key component of this, and it’s now in it’s particular phase, but was previously in the opposite phase, could you not therefore explain the accelerated warming of the 80s and 90s as being driven by the other phase of natural variability?”
Simplifying Slingo’s  incoherence: “If the current cooling is due to the negative PDO phase, then wouldn’t the warming of the 80s and 90s be a result of the positive PDO phase back then?”
Marotzke answers after much incoherence of his own:
Um…I guess I’m not sure.”
These people make no sense at all. They are sure it’s the oceans’ cold phase gobbling up heat when temperatures fail to rise. But when temperatures increase, they just can’t be sure that the oceans are involved at all, and insist they would not bet much money on it. Of course it just can’t work only one way. Marotzke is delivering only what would call unadulterated absurd science.

Share this...FacebookTwitterUpdate:  Reader Kåre Kristiansen comments below that electric vehicle owners also get “free electricity for electric cars at some public charging places and no payment for an electric car on ferries.”
=====================================
Germany’s online daily TAZ has an article on how an electric car has reached the No. 1 position when it comes to new car registrations in Norway. This will certainly cause tree-huggers globally to run out and praise the Scandinavian country as a model of green, responsible living and demand that the rest of the world adopt its way.

The TAZ writes that the Nissan Leaf took the number one spot in new-car registration in the Nordic country in both September and in October, reaching a market share of 5.1% and 5.6% respectively. And because almost 100% of Norway’s electricity comes from hydro-electric power plants, transportation with an electric car is practically carbon-neutral (so long you do not look at the car’s manufacture).
Norway is the first country in the world to be able to boast having an electric car as the no.1 seller. The TAZ reports that the electric car market in Norway has doubled in one year alone and that 50,000 electric vehicles will be registered in the sparsely populated country by 2016. That would be about 2% of the country’s entire fleet.
Made attractive with $90,000 in subsidies
So why all the success in Norway? Has there been some kind of technological breakthrough that has made electric cars attractive to consumers? The answer is no.
All the good news ends as soon as you take a look at the price tag that’s been attached to entice consumers to buy the electric vehicles. It’s a whopper.

The TAZ writes that each vehicle gets subsidized to the tune of up to €70,000 per car (more than $90,000). So do not expect to see too many environmentalists running around preaching the virtues of the Norwegian electric car model. Very few countries, even among the rich ones, are able to afford that kind of money.
So what do all the subsidies include? First the TAZ writes that buyers are exempt from paying Norway’s notoriously formidable 25% value added tax on the purchase of the vehicle. Moreover they are also exempt from paying the registration fees, import duties (Norway doesn’t have a domestic auto manufacturer), and buyers are allowed to deduct more expenses with e-cars when filing their income taxes. Furthermore, electric vehicle owners are exempted from paying tolls on highways and bridges.
Another perk is that electric car drivers also are free to use bus lanes in bigger cities. Everything together tallies up to big money. The TAZ writes:
Calculations showing that state coffers subsidize buyers of luxury electric cars like the Tesla S to the tune of 60,000 to 70,000 have sparked a debate on whether or not the state subsidies are exaggerated.”
Norway’s prosperity stems largely from oil and gas
Ironically Norway’s high standard of living is in large part due to its huge North Sea reserves of fossil fuels, mainly gas and oil, which have been exploited over the last decades. What made Norway rich is today being villianized. Gas and oil are what has helped to make the country prosperous and made it possible for the country to afford its current foray in costly electric cars.
How much would it cost the USA to adopt and implement Norway’s model, ignoring the cost of expanding the electric power generation needed to charge the cars?  According to Wikipedia there are approx. 250 million cars on the road in the USA. Subsidizing every electric car with say $50,000 per car in order to replace the fossil fuel cars would produce a price tag of $12.5 trillion – an astronomical sum of money. Never mind the monumental technical problems involved.
The sheer size of the subsidy needed to get people to buy the electric vehicles alone tells you that they have a very long way to go before they make any economic sense. In fact, technological progress in the improved design and efficiency of internal combustion engines have resulted in far greater fuel savings than any green energy subsidy program has ever yielded thus far.

Share this...FacebookTwitterThe latest Sunday print edition of Switzerland’s flagship Neue Zürcher Zeitung (NZZ) has a story blasting Europe’s failure in curbing CO2 emissions through the implementation of its CO2 emissions trading scheme (ETS). See right image.
Hat-tip Hajo Smit
The NZZ story bears the title:
Why the dreck doesn’t cost anything.
With its emissions trading, the EU wanted to be a leader in global climate protection. However it has contributed nothing to lowering greenhouse gases. A European debacle.”
Soviet-scale debacle
The NZZ reports that the emissions trading scheme started out “as a good idea” but never got anywhere. From the NZZ’s portrayal, one easily concludes that the ETS debacle is on a scale of a major Soviet central planning implosion.
The program was supposed to involve 11,000 companies, among them the worst emitters, and to get them to pay real money for each tonne of emitted greenhouse gas. But the trading scheme failed to function as hoped and the price ended up falling to the paltry 5 euros per tonne level that it is at today. Companies have no incentive to invest in energy saving technology when carbon certificates are so cheap.
The NZZ writes:
The targets for reducing greenhouse gases that the EU set to achieve by 2020 will be reached mainly because the economy in many European countries crumbled.”

With certificate prices so low, the EU is a long way from the 40 euros per tonne price level it needs to get power companies to move away from burning coal, says BP chief economist Christof Rühl.
Not only have many citizens in EU countries been burdened by the hardships of economic collapse, which has have led them to reach their emission targets, the subsidies spent on supporting completely ineffective green technologies are costing consumers an arm and a leg as well. The NZZ writes the Germany alone is paying 20 billion euros annually in feed-in charges: “Under the bottom line, this money has done very little for the climate.”
The NZZ blames the failure of the emissions trading scheme on the EU’s “fear of damaging it’s own economy with climate protection“.
In 2008, the global economic crisis led to reduced industrial production in Europe, and thus acted to dampen CO2 certificate prices further. The market was flooded with emission certificates which could be had at dirt-cheap prices and thus having no impact in getting industry off coal.
Experts blame the design of the emissions trading scheme for its downfall, saying that it never had anything to do with climate protection to begin with. What made matters even worse, the NZZ writes, was that as more and more green energy came on line, the demand (and the prices) for CO2 emission certificates dropped further, thus allowing Europe’s industry to easily skirt costly CO2 reduction measures.
The NZZ writes that Germany alone has a surplus of 2.2 billion certificates and experts say it’ll take 15 years to work them off. According to WWF Germany climate expert Regine Gunther:
Thus the flagship of the European climate protection is as good as sunk and the EU as a protector of the climate will be AWOL for the entire time.”
The NZZ writes that before anything changes, Europe has to somehow get over its fear of damaging its economy.
Imagine that. The NZZ and green climate rescuers seem to view economic damage as a sort of irrational fear. For them a rational fear is the world coming to an end in 2099.

Share this...FacebookTwitterHere’s one of the best speeches I’ve heard in a long time.
On October 31 in the Lower Saxony capital of Hanover there was a parliamentary plenum. Dr. Gero Hocker, speaker for Energy, Environment and Climate Protection of the Free Democrat Party, made a speech calling on his parliamentary colleagues to acknowledge the facts on climate.

Hat-tip European Institute for Climate and Energy here.
Slowly, but surely, leading politicians are mustering the courage to express their doubts on climate science and to speak up. What follows are substantial excerpts of Hocker’s speech in English.
He starts by telling his colleagues that the environment is swamped in political correctness, that there’s intolerance to other views, and that spending 9 million euros on “climate protection” is a waste:
I have doubts in that we are not allowed to ask certain questions in this House. And I also have doubts about that it is perceived as correct that certain views should not be expressed. And I have doubts if what you are doing is correct, that is that climate policy is absolutely being placed above all else. I believe you are drawing the wrong conclusions from the flood of 2013. We have to improve our dikes, and not spend 9 million euros on “climate protection”.
At the 1:23 Hocker says that “the IPCC is really not a good source for advice“.
The people out there are really uncertain about the topic of climate protection, and here the IPCC has made a fundamental contribution to that. Six years ago the ‘experts’ from the IPCC projected that every year the global temperature would rise 0.2°C . And in 2013, that’s only 6 years later, ladies and gentlemen, they are forced to backpedal and recognize that over the last 10 years the temperature has risen only zero point zero-five degrees Celsius. They erred by a huge 75%! And those who want to advise us what do for decades and prophesize what’s ahead and that we’re supposed to act based on that, such an uncertain factual basis is surely not the fundamental basis on which to act politically, ladies and gentlemen!”
Of course with the temperature rise, Hocker slipped and should have said “every decade the global temperature would rise 0.2°C“. But the underlying message remains unchanged: The IPCC is nothing on which decisions can be based on.
At the 2:40 mark, Hocker says that it’s not only the experts who question the science, but also prominent publications such as Spiegel and the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung (FAZ). In front of his politically correct greenie Parliamentarians, Hocker quotes some of the most provocative headlines made on climate change:
In March 2007, the FAZ carried the headline: ‘Climate Change is Nothing But a Swindle’. In May 2013, Spiegel added: ‘There’s enough fodder for continuing an ideological climate discussion, forget the sworn consensus’, and just six weeks ago: ‘Scientists take away the foundation from climate regulators and request a retreat from global alarmism’. […] This shows one thing: The discussion is taking place everywhere all over society: in the press, among the people, with the experts – and you want to keep this discussion out of the Parliament and prevent the right questions from being asked. You are not the thought police of Lower Saxony! You are not the Inquisition to hunt down others who think differently. You have to come to terms with the fact that there are others who have a different opinion in Parliament and you have to accept this discussion, ladies and gentlemen!”

Loud applause at 3:42, and shouts protest from green parliamentarians.
At the 4:20 mark Hocker brings up Antarctica, where “there’s more ice than ever measured.”
In 2013 China emitted more CO2 than ever before, yet over the last 15 years there’s been no significant rise in global temperature. You have to get used to these facts in this discussion, ladies and gentlemen!”
At this point nervousness erupts among parliamentarians and many are clearly agitated by Hocker’s open act of rebellion. Hocker continues, reminding that science thrives on skepticism and that it needs to be welcome and not scorned. Hocker adds that the 9 million euros proposed for climate protection in Lower Saxony would be far more wisely spent on a slew of other needs, which are lacking in money.
But if you truly believe in a climate change, …then the money would be better invested in flood protection, invest the 9 million in our dikes – then you would provide a far greater service to the people of Lower Saxony than if you invested it in a climate protection agencies.”
Citizens should not be bullied into guilt by green thought
Moreover, the restrictions in personal freedom you have with your climate protection measures will not, in my opinion, achieve the success you think they will. You want to prescribe to the people how they are to take their holidays, not with their cars and not with a plane. You want to tell the people what they are to eat, you want to tell people how they are to dress, you want to tell them how they are to live. I’d like to tell you that I’d like people to go on holidays using a plane without having a guilty conscience. I’d like a future where people don’t have to feel guilty whenever they eat schnitzel. And for those who can’t afford, or those who don’t wish to afford it, they should be able to build a home the way they want to build without having to be pressured into a moral corner of some sort.
When you make one political field absolute and subordinate all other political fields, that to me is an expression of a modern absolutism which in Germany we have been wanting to cast off for centuries. And I, ladies and gentlemen, will not accept that such times transform into green and becomes socially acceptable.”
Hocker has let the cat out of the bag in Lower Saxony politics. He really gets to the heart of what this is all about – fundamental human rights, and people getting tired of being regulated to death and deceived.
Now he has to expect immediate retaliation of the most vicious sort. Expect an orchestrated campaign labeling him a denier, a dangerous populist, or heretic. I hope he’s prepared for it.
I really do hope he keeps it up and that others find the courage to follow. Three cheers for Gero.
There’s never anything wrong with demanding an open discussion – especially science.

Share this...FacebookTwitterIt’s not a secret that scientists and politicians have been deeply disappointed by the spectacular failure of climate models. 98% of the long-term climate models failed to project the 16-year warming stop, all having overstated the warming.
So maybe it should not come as surprise that recently the German government quietly put out a bulletin describing a midterm climate forecasting system that is raising some eyebrows.

(Caption translation at end of post).
The first 4 pages of the bulletin discuss and extol the then-upcoming IPCC AR5. Pages 5 – 7 then describe three projects that aim to answer some open climate questions.
Project MiKlip first result shows cooling North Atlantic 
The most interesting project among them is the Midterm Climate Prognoses project (MiKlip) described on Page 6 of the Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF) bulletin. Page 6 shows the above chart and poses the question: “How warm is it going to be in 10 years? Business and policy need reliable climate forecasts.”
The bulletin adds that “in business and politics there is an increasing need for reliable forecasts for climate developments in the range of years up to a decade.”
And to fulfill that midterm need the German government is funding the MiKlip 10-year forecasting system, which comprises 60 individual research projects. Excerpts from page 6:

It is mainly about computer simulations that use recorded measurement data. … The MiKlip projects have been taking place since spring 2012. The first tangible results are expected to be available in September 2014. … Compared to the long-term scenarios, the results should be more exact. … The model will not deliver a forecast such as the weather at a specific location in a few years. Instead it looks more at the probable mean temperature in Europe in a certain month.”

The above chart on page 6 is a plot of North Atlantic temperature anomaly with respect to the 1971-2000. The chart comes from the Max Planck Institute for Meteorology. The caption reads:

Test forecast with the first MiKlip forecast system. The figure shows the anomaly of the sea surface temperature from the mean in the North Atlantic with the observed data shown in black from 1990 to 2011. White and orange show the test forecast beginning in 2012. Multiple decadal simulations are conducted for forecast in order to take the uncertainty of the initial conditions into account. The mean of the simulations is depicted by the white curve. The confidence intervals of the forecast (%) are shown in orange.”

Again we have to stress that this is only a “test forecast” with the first MiKlip system. But even so, the preliminary result is interesting in that it points to a serious drop in North Atlantic sea surface temperatures, which of course would have major global climate repercussions, especially in combination with a negative PDO and low solar activity.
So why are we being told that warming is continuing unabated when clearly it is not, and is not expected to for another 10 years at least?
And why is the German government funding the MiKlip models to start with? Is it because the 100-year climate models have been such a huge failure? Obviously they have been. And if the 100-year climate models failed spectacularly for even the first 10 or 20 years, then how can they be regarded as reliable for longer terms?
MiKlip is an important step back towards responsible and serious climate modeling and a sign that governments are finally abandoning the failed long-term models, having recognized that over the mid-term they are grotesquely flawed and have been terribly misleading, e.g. see here.
MiKlip is a nice step away from the dubious 100-year climate fortune-telling (which is naively, simplistically and solely based on the concentration of a single trace gas) and a real step back towards sound science. We are very much looking ahead to the first results.

"Bruised and still shaken, Janet Barker is incredulous at the violent reaction of the Foreign Office minister Mark Field to her peaceful protest with fellow Greenpeace activists at the chancellor’s Mansion House speech. However, she has no plans to press criminal charges over the physical assault. “I think it is something best dealt with in the court of opinion,” she said, while welcoming his suspension as a minister. Barker said she had been trying to deliver leaflets to guests on Thursday evening when she was grabbed by the neck and arm and forcibly ejected by Field, despite her pleas for him to release his grip and allow her to walk from the dining hall. It makes me wonder what else might trigger him off, and who else might be at the receiving end “I remember a chair being pushed out. Then being shoved. I was saying, over and over: ‘This is a peaceful protest, a peaceful protest.’ I was saying it quite audibly, certainly loud enough.” She could not see the man’s face, and had no idea who he was: “I just knew it was a guy. And that he was very, very angry. You could hear that in the tone of his voice. “I knew he wanted me out,” said Barker, 40, who was carrying a phone and a small handbag. “ I thought if I just keep saying ‘peaceful protest, peaceful protest’ you hope to defuse the situation. But there was no defusing in his anger. “He continued to grip me by the neck and the arm all the way to the door of the building. Then, when we got to the door, he shoved me outside on to the street, and said: ‘This is what happens when people like you disturb our dinner.’” Here is Janet Barker saying Mark Field MP needs to to an anger management course pic.twitter.com/Bjm7L0SAh6 Barker, from Builth Wells, Powys, has been a Greenpeace volunteer for many years and had entered the dinner with 20-30 activists who were hoping to deliver a speech about the climate crisis. Predominantly women, they wore red dresses with sashes stating: “Climate emergency”. “We wanted to enter in a very dignified way,” Barker said. “We were respectful. We even ensured that our dresses were the correct length, because women who attend the Mansion House have to have a specific length.”  They entered as “a block of red”, said Barker, who works in environmental education and homelessness prevention, and runs a small holding and ethical angora business. “The doors were open as we were going in, and when security staff clocked what was happening they did start to close the doors.” Each had their roles, and hers was to deliver copies of the climate emergency speech to guests in the form of sealed letters. The only thing I was armed with was peer-reviewed science Barker, whose Greenpeace activism has included joining a protest against dams on the Tapajós River in the Brazilian Amazon in support of the Munduruku people, said she believed she was one of the last to get in. She was to walk to the right of the room with several others, but they had been locked out. Other protesters, walking to the left of the room, were being detained by security staff, so she found herself alone. She thought if she walked around the back of the diners, she could hand a copy of the speech to Philip Hammond. “Nobody bothered me. It was fine.” She estimates she was about 10 metres from Hammond, just approaching the right-hand corner of the top table. “Then a gentleman in front pushed his seat out and just grabbed me.” Asked if she was carrying or doing anything that could possibly have indicated she might be armed and threatening, she said: “I had a phone, and a tiny handbag, which was open and full of leaflets. The only thing I was armed with was peer-reviewed science.” She made no sudden movements, she said. “I was walking past him just like a waitress or waiter would.” Field refused to relinquish his grip, she said. “I kept saying: “Look, just let go. I will walk on my own. I am not about to start a wrestling match with you. I will walk.’ He said: ‘I’m not letting go until you are out of this building.’” She said no one came to her defence. “I think people were taken aback, like ‘What?’” Protest is a legitimate part of our democracy. It helps us evolve She said Field’s anger shocked her; it was palpable in his voice and grip. “The pressure on my neck never eased all the way down the stairs and until we were outside.” The inside of the top of her right arm was still red on Friday morning. Once at the door, he shoved her with such force, she said, she struggled not to fall over. A woman, also at the door, told her: “You’re not welcome here.” Once outside, Barker realised she was trembling. “I think he needs to seriously look at why he reacted like that, why his anger went from 0-60 in 0.2 seconds. He needs anger management. Because I worry maybe he’s on a bit of a simmer all the time, that just one or two things might tip him over, especially for him to be like that towards a woman. It makes me wonder what else might trigger him off, and who else might be at the receiving end,” she said. “I want him to think about what he did, and why he did it. And address his behaviour.” Barker said she had anticipated verbal resistance. “We thought we might be ushered out, politely.” Looking back on the incident, she said it was the authoritarianism that angered her. “That’s what I felt. He was very domineering. He seemed to think he was in the right. “Those in power are very privileged. They are very disconnected with the everyday struggles of everybody else. And I really felt that was apparent in his behaviour. They are in power. They believe they are right, and I was a silly little girl. “I still find is unbelievable. We are in a climate emergency. Fossil fuels, the Greenland ice sheet is melting, the Himalayan ice caps are melting, there’s going to be massive water shortages in the future and they are worried about their dinner being disturbed. “I think we should remember that protest is a legitimate part of our democracy. It helps us evolve. Good things come from it. Look at the suffragettes, India democracy and Gandhi, the Black Power movement. “And behaviour like this is trying to crush it, and we will keep rising up, because we have got to.”"
"Ever since the G20 of leading global economies was founded, its summits have mostly been convergent occasions, marked by attempts to find common ground and remembered for nothing more unseemly than a bit of jostling among the heads of government to be on the front row of the group photograph. Japan’s prime minister Shinzō Abe clearly takes this traditional view about the G20 summit which he will host in Osaka on Friday and Saturday. “We want to make it a meeting that focuses on where we can agree and cooperate rather than highlighting differences,” he said recently. But there is a balloon-puncturing problem with Mr Abe’s approach, and it answers to the name of Donald Trump. If there is one issue on which this year’s summit clearly ought to be showing global leadership, it is the climate crisis. The subject is indeed on the Osaka agenda but, in spite of efforts by countries including France, there is no prospect of serious or effective action. That is no surprise from a group of nations which almost tripled the subsidies they gave to coal-fired power plants between 2013 and 2017, with China, India and Japan itself leading the way. But it is Mr Trump’s decision to walk away from climate accords and to back fossil fuels that creates the wider permission for these other terrible derelictions.  Mr Trump’s disruptions do not end there. The US president uses these gatherings not to build alliances to solve common problems but to knock his adversaries – and sometimes his supposed allies – off their stride. He is not looking for general agreement, which he thinks is for wimps. He is looking for American advantage over friend and foe. That’s the reason why the summit is already overshadowed by the increasingly serious trade war between the United States and China (Mr Trump will have an all-smiles bilateral with Xi Jinping on Saturday). And it is certainly the reason why Mr Trump has used the run-up to Osaka to have a pop at his hosts, whom he claimed would respond to an attack on the US by watching it “on a Sony television”, attacking India for raising tariffs and then, inventing false figures, berating Germany as a “security freeloader”. Since Mr Trump’s Friday schedule involves one-on-ones with Mr Abe, India’s Narendra Modi and Germany’s Angela Merkel, it seems these mind games are part of a deliberate strategy of disruption. This is not a novel conclusion. Mr Trump used the same approach before his recent visit to Britain, when he praised Boris Johnson and attacked Sadiq Khan and the Duchess of Sussex. If Mr Johnson becomes prime minister and Britain were to back off from supporting European opposition to the White House’s Iran strategy, Mr Trump would count this a job well done. Mr Trump’s bullying is also selective. Among the world leaders whom Mr Trump has not attacked in advance – but with whom he will also be meeting in Osaka bilaterals – are Vladimir Putin of Russia, whose country systematically interfered in the 2016 US election, and Mohammed bin Salman of Saudi Arabia, who has just been accused by the United Nations of orchestrating the murder and dismemberment of the opposition journalist Jamal Khashoggi. Some would argue that Mr Trump’s bullying approach gets results in cases such as Latin America, where the administration slapped unilateral tariffs on all Mexican imports to the US in an attempt to curb migration. Mexico’s subsequent agreement to send more troops to guard its own southern border was portrayed by the White House as a vindication of Mr Trump’s tactics. But it was not a long-term solution to a deep-seated issue of regional inequality, and the tragic photograph of the drowned bodies of the Salvadorans Óscar Ramirez and his daughter Valeria underscores that it has in fact solved nothing. Like the UN, the G20 is a deeply frustrating forum. The limits of an organisation that cannot lead the way on the climate crisis, which struggles to contain the globally damaging US-China trade war, and which is happy to hold its 2020 summit in Riyadh are stark. But we inhabit a global society and economy, as Japanese warnings about a no-deal Brexit this week underline. Forms of global governance are needed more than ever, and it remains the case that an imperfect G20 is still better than none at all. • This article was amended on 28 June 2019 because an earlier version misspelled the prime minister of India’s first name.

Share this...FacebookTwitterWhat would George Clooney have against brutally throttling the plentiful supply of affordable fossil fuel energy that billions of people living on the planet rely on? Nothing, he recently said.

George Clooney puts on an Oscar-winning green act. And an act is all it is. Hollywood actor has a mammoth carbon foot print. Photo: Nicolas Genin, licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 2.0 Generic license.
“All you’d be doing is cleaning up the planet a bit,” the actor said in a recent interview. Who cares if the poor have to go without it – so long he has more than enough to taxi between his two multi-million dollar mansions in California and Italy.
How green is Clooney really?
Expensive mansions in Italy and California
According to celebritynetworth.com, Clooney owns an 18th century mansion in Laglio, northern Italy. The “house” overlooks Italy’s famed Lake Como and “boasts 25 grand rooms” and has “magnificent decorated ceilings”. The house contains an outdoor theater, a large swimming pool and a garage for Clooney’s assortment of motorcycles and scooters.
According to Bornrich, Clooney’s net worth is estimated at $160 million
The Hollywood actor also owns a 7354 square-foot home in Los Angeles which he bought in 1995 from “Stevie Nicks” for $2.2 million. Today the home is surely valued much higher. The LA home features “comfy and well cleaned spacious rooms with brilliant light systems” and includes “a well equipped bar and a modern kitchen fully equipped with up to date appliances including custom cabinetry, oven and stainless steel fridge with George’s favorite salads and juices”. Outside the home has a basketball court and tennis court.
“Almost always flies via private jet…despite his claimed environmentalism”

Do you think Clooney commutes between his LA and Italian villas on a regular commercial jet, maybe even in economy class from time to time? No way, not for him. And what is not good enough for Clooney in air travel is much too much for the regular folks. Regular folks are supposed to forgo flying in order to save the planet. According to this site here: “George almost always flies via private jet…most of the time nowadays Clooney flies by private jet despite his claimed environmentalism as anyone who follows him knows.”
Clooney has the “ultimate solution to the world’s energy problems”
Clooney owns a variety of vehicles, such as a 1958 Chevrolet Corvette V8 C1 convertible. He even lined the seats with high end leather. And in addition to expensive Italian scooters and classic motorcycles, Clooney also sports around in a Tango 600, which features “a unique battery-powered car design with dimensions measuring 39 inches wide and 102 inches long and offers an ultimate solution to the world’s environmental and energy problems”. Gee, now why hasn’t the “ultimate solution” been mass-produced in the hundreds of millions for the rest of the world’s regular drivers? Clearly neither the clueless Clooney nor the Clooney-ass-kissing Bornrich writer have an idea what’s involved in manufacturing the”ultimate solution” for the world’s energy problem. They likely don’t even know where the power to charge the batteries comes from.
Clooney also owns a 2008 limited edition Signature 100 model Tesla Roadster – er, well, he used to. Apparently it was auctioned to support a Sudan Charity. What the heck, the car only had 1,700 miles on the odometer anyway. Driving green wasn’t much fun after all.
Jet-pit-stop in LA on the way to Europe – to dine with friends
So where does Clooney spend his vacations? Do you think he vacations locally, you know, to help save the planet? Well, that’s the little people, and not for Hollywood sex-gods like Clooney. Bornrich reports how he jets to places like the French Riviera with his green pals, like U2’s Bono or super model Cindy Crawford. There they spend much time “jet skiing and chilling out in sun on a yacht.”
While in Europe, Clooney and his girlfriend Stacy Keibler might be “spotted boarding a boat with some other close friends in Lake Como” or visiting George’s Italian mansion – before jetting off across the Atlantic to “relax in the Mexican sun”. And before jetting back to Europe together, “they stopped in LA and dined out with his best pals. Reportedly, Jennifer Aniston also managed to link up with pal George Clooney recently while off on her European vacation”.
Burning all that jet fuel.
Acting all concerned about the climate and saving the planet, you’d think Green George would cut back a bit. Not chance. Clooney’s green act truly deserves an Oscar. In reality he is just a jumbo-sized eco-hypocrite.

"It may prove to be incredibly difficult, but we must rethink our short-termist priorities if we intend to make good on our promises to those striking for the future (Our lives must be transformed to defeat this climate crisis, 15 June). Like your columnist, Susanna Rustin, I want us to break out of the short-term, four-year election inertia and reimagine our approach to policymaking via the prism of acting for tomorrow, today. This week, I led a parliamentary debate about how to protect and represent the interests of future generations, where I called on the government to look at how the Well-being of Future Generations (Wales) Act 2015 has shaken up “business as usual” by requiring public bodies in Wales to think about the long-term impact of their decisions and how best they can prevent persistent problems, including climate change, from happening.  Ideas on how to repair our democracy, and with it the climate, are out there. Why couldn’t we replicate the role of a future generations commissioner for Wales in England, or in other UK regions? Why couldn’t parliament establish its own Committee for the Future, like Finland, to scrutinise policy and challenge ministerial short-termism? Why couldn’t every policy have to pass a future generations benchmark? Why couldn’t public bodies be required to scan the horizon to pre-empt problems coming down the track? And isn’t it time to get serious about preventive spending and require HM Treasury to define, measure and increase it? What we do over the next decade will determine the future of humanity for the next 10,000 years. And if we don’t want to be remembered as the generation that fiddled while Rome burned, we need to be brave, bold and ambitious in future-proofing our decision-making processes. After all, the best way to predict the future is to create it.John BirdCrossbencher, House of Lords  • Join the debate – email guardian.letters@theguardian.com • Read more Guardian letters – click here to visit gu.com/letters • Do you have a photo you’d like to share with Guardian readers?

"Permafrost at outposts in the Canadian Arctic is thawing 70 years earlier than predicted, an expedition has discovered, in the latest sign that the global climate crisis is accelerating even faster than scientists had feared. A team from the University of Alaska Fairbanks said they were astounded by how quickly a succession of unusually hot summers had destabilised the upper layers of giant subterranean ice blocks that had been frozen solid for millennia. “What we saw was amazing,” Vladimir Romanovsky, a professor of geophysics at the university, told Reuters. “It’s an indication that the climate is now warmer than at any time in the last 5,000 or more years.“ With governments meeting in Bonn this week to try to ratchet up ambitions in United Nations climate negotiations, the team’s findings, published on 10 June in Geophysical Research Letters, offered a further sign of a growing climate emergency. The paper was based on data Romanovsky and his colleagues had been analysing since their last expedition to the area in 2016. The team used a modified propeller plane to visit exceptionally remote sites, including an abandoned cold war-era radar base more than 300km from the nearest human settlement. Diving through a lucky break in the clouds, Romanovsky and his colleagues said they were confronted with a landscape that was unrecognisable from the pristine Arctic terrain they had encountered during initial visits a decade or so earlier. The vista had dissolved into an undulating sea of hummocks – waist-high depressions and ponds known as thermokarst. Vegetation, once sparse, had begun to flourish in the shelter provided from the constant wind. Torn between professional excitement and foreboding, Romanovsky said the scene had reminded him of the aftermath of a bombardment. “It’s a canary in the coalmine,” said Louise Farquharson, a postdoctoral researcher and co-author of the study. “It’s very likely that this phenomenon is affecting a much more extensive region and that’s what we’re going to look at next.“ Scientists are concerned about the stability of permafrost because of the risk that rapid thawing could release vast quantities of heat-trapping gases, unleashing a feedback loop that would in turn fuel even faster temperature rises. Even if current commitments to cut emissions under the 2015 Paris agreement are implemented, the world is still far from averting the risk that these kinds of feedback loops will trigger runaway warming, according to models used by the UN-backed Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. With scientists warning that sharply higher temperatures would devastate the global south and threaten the viability of industrial civilisation in the northern hemisphere, campaigners said the new paper reinforced the imperative to cut emissions. “Thawing permafrost is one of the tipping points for climate breakdown and it’s happening before our very eyes,” said Jennifer Morgan, executive director of Greenpeace International. “This premature thawing is another clear signal that we must decarbonise our economies, and immediately.”"

Share this...FacebookTwitterA couple years ago, Europe was acting deadly serious about forcing the rest of the world’s airlines flying in out of Europe to purchase airline emissions certificates. The rescue of the planet was at stake.

European bureaucrats actually deluded themselves into thinking the USA, China, Russia and other global powers would dance to their tune. Background info: here, here and here.
That was the fantasy.
Now reality has hit European bureaucrats once again. Suddenly Connie Hedegaard and her EU bureacrats have decided they don’t need to charge foreign airlines to purchase CO2 emission certificates every time they fly over, into, or out of the kingdom of the EU after all. They’ve realized that 14% of the planet in favor of Kyoto can’t really boss around the other 86% who are not. It turns out that protecting multi-billion euro Airbus orders and avoiding trade sanctions are more important than climate protection after all. Thank God for the wonders of the self-correcting free market.
European media outlets are (barely) reporting that international flights may continue flying over, in, and out of Europe without having to buy pollution permits. The law applies only to flights between two European airports, so reports the Wall Street Journal here.
The climate bedwetting Klimaretter here reports that Germany’s Greens are outraged by the European compromise, saying the compromise is “clearly too little for the challenges stemming from the worldwide growth in air traffic.”
Klimaretter adds that the compromise may be only be stopped by the EU-Parliament, whose official vote is still pending.”
Boy, that’s a going to be a really tough vote: Do we commit economic suicide or not?

Share this...FacebookTwitterAs Antarctica sets new maximum sea ice records, sensationalist scientists at the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research (PIK) remain relentless in conjuring up cataclysmic meltdown scenarios for the frozen continent. This is the case with a new paper by Levermann and Mengel appearing at Nature Climate Change. 
Yet, when we read a little further, we realize that their drama-filled scenario of an “uncorking” of the East Antarctic Wilkes Basin, all accompanied by a 4-meter rise in global sea level, is not even supported by any observed data. Rather it is merely the product of a computer simulation, one that is no doubt likely fraught with lots of adventurous and dubious assumptions.
Spiegel journalist Axel Bojanowski writes about this spectacular horror scenario, and dumps plenty of cold water on it.
First Bojanowski starts by writing that the PIK scientists warn that “a collapse of the ice shelf threatens”. Levermann and Mengel write that “a sole ice cork blocking the glacier mass inland is preventing it from flowing into the ocean“. They are worried about the cork melting due to run-away global warming, and thus clearing the way for the massive Wilkes Basin ice sheet to cataclysmically collapse into the ocean.
While most media outlets took the sensationalist Potsdam study at face value and ran with it (see here for example), Bojanowski and Spiegel took the time to check the facts and consulted other polar experts on the matter before irresponsibly spreading fear among the public. Bojanowski cites other (warmist) polar scientists and discovers that they have strong doubts about the latest PIK scare scenario. The chances of an “uncorking” of the Wilkes Basin are purely speculative. Moreover Bojanowski writes that the scenario is not even new and that the IPCC has already looked into the matter and is reserved about it. He writes:
The UN climate report (IPCC), which summarizes climate science, is reserved: Up to now the region shows no trend; the East Antarctic ice appears stable.”
Bojanowski writes that a significant warm-up of the East Antarctic sea would be needed for the PIK drama to occur.
He also contacted Heinrich Miller of the Alfred Wegener Institute for Polar and Ocean Research (AWI) and asked him about the PIK scenario. Bojanowski quotes Miller in the Spiegel piece:
It would necessitate a change in ocean circulation so that considerably warmer water would be led to the coast.”

Bojanowski then points out:
Currently the opposite is occurring: sea ice is expanding.”
Bojanowski also writes of the uncorking: “the study leaves open on how this would happen”.
Of course Spiegel writes that the scenario can’t be ruled out entirely because a melting of the East Antaractic has occurred before in history, such as “during the Pliocene and Miocene“.
But even Miller adds here:
Unfortunately there’s a lack of data on the deposits that would allow us to draw conclusions on whether such melts have happened already before.”
Bojanowski concludes:
You can’t get such data by running computer simulations, rather only by boring on site in the icy cold of East Antarctica.”
Indeed. This is just a nice way of saying science begins with observations and real data, and not by putting your run-away fantasies in computer code.

Share this...FacebookTwitterLast week I wrote how an expert government committee recommended scrapping Germany’s once widely ballyhooed EEG renewable energy feed-in act.
Photo: Dr. Klaus-Peter Krause. Source: freiewelt.net
Today at the Freie Presse here economics expert and veteran journalist Dr. Klaus-Peter Krause slams the EEG act, saying “it belongs in the dustbin”: “Too expensive, and too unstable.”
Increasingly as energy poverty in Germany mounts, companies close their factories due to soaring electricity prices, power supply becomes too unstable, and one renewable energy company after another bite the dust, the pressure for the government to scrap renewable energies is growing. Yet the German government obstinately refuses to admit it the act is mortally flawed.
Krause writes that although the share of renewable energy in Germany’s energy-mix has increased, “it has done so at an enormous cost.” According to Krause the costs of the feed-in subsidies have risen form €883 million per year in 2000 to a whopping €23 billion in 2013. Meanwhile over the same period the share of renewable energy rose from 7% to 23%.
Worse, Krause writes that the EEG law has done nothing to reduce CO2 emissions across Europe. Germany’s coal consumption has actually risen over the last few years. “The EEG has not delivered more climate protection, rather only higher electricity costs.” Krause cites Prof. Helmut Alt of the University of Aachen, who calls the EEG act “the most gigantic subsidy law of the postwar period.”

Krause also believes that the EEG act is dividing the country:
The EEG act has created a two-class society of those exploiting the act, and the losers. Those exploiting it are going all out in securing their financial advantage.“
Krause ends by quoting a government official who wishes not to be named:
 The EEG must be regarded as an instrument of abuse by state power and especially contradicts the social-civic responsibility of the legislators.”

"Australia is at a crossroads. Drift towards a future of slow decline economically and socially or, if action is taken now to address our most important challenges, create a future of greater prosperity for all, globally competitive industries and a sustainable environment. That is the conclusion of a major report bringing together the thinking of more than 50 leaders in business, academia, NGOs and the community sector, working with the CSIRO to model alternative futures for Australia. The report is described as a “clarion call” for the nation. The Australian National Outlook 2019, two years in the making, aims to “help kickstart a national conversation about where Australia is heading”, says its co-chair, Dr Ken Henry, the chairman of the National Australia Bank and former secretary of the Treasury department. Participants met as a group with the nation’s leading science agency, the CSIRO, to identify the most critical long-term challenges facing Australia and what needed to change. They included senior leaders from Shell Australia, the Red Cross, McKinsey & Company, Australia Post, PwC, the Cochlear company, the Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics and Sciences, the Grattan Institute, major universities, the Wentworth Group of Concerned Scientists and UnitingCare Australia. Individuals included the former New South Wales premier Nick Greiner, former chairman of the Australian competition and consumer commission Allan Fels and co-chair of the report, the CSIRO’s chairman, David Thodey. The report concludes that while Australia has enjoyed almost three decades of economic growth, with enviable social cohesion and strong institutions, it risks “drifting into the future” if it fails to respond to challenges in a fast-changing world. Those identified are the rise of Asia, rapid technological change, climate change and the environment, changing demographics, declining trust in institutions and business and strains on social cohesion. To deal with them and reach its potential by 2060, Australia must make “key shifts” in five areas: an industrial shift, an urban shift, an energy shift, a land shift and a culture shift. The director of CSIRO Futures, James Deverell, led the project and said the sense of urgency came from the participants, who gathered for eight workshops, beginning with around 100 priorities for Australia before identifying the most crucial. “There was this strong sense that we need to take action now,” Deverell said. “The group sees this as a clarion call, a call to arms for action. “When you look at the shifts, there’s a couple of things in common. One is the need to focus on the long term, that these shifts are going to play out over a generation or more, but that doesn’t mean we can kick the can down the road and ignore them. The other one is the need for strong leadership, for bold action.” The report references the 1980s, when strong productivity growth was driven by a consensus on economic reform supported by both major parties, big business and unions. The report does not give specific policy recommendations but suggests the “levers” the country needs to pull to get the best outcomes. One of its strongest conclusions is that there is no tradeoff between strong economic growth and transitioning to zero-emission renewable energy, an argument that has crippled political debate in Australia for more than a decade. In both scenarios modelled by the CSIRO – slow decline or what the report calls outlook vision – almost all electricity is generated by renewables by 2060 due to drops in the cost of renewables and the decline in the demand for fossil fuels. The global disruption in the energy market is underway, so whether the Australian government encourages new coal-fired power stations or not, renewables will be cheaper and replace them. In Australia, most of the transition will happen between 2020 and 2040 as ageing coal-fired power plants are retired and replaced with renewables. “We’ve seen costs come down so much in solar and wind they are now the low-cost solution,” Deverell said. “Once you hit a certain level of renewables on the grid you need to add storage to the cost, but that’s factored into our modelling and we see the cost of storage coming down over time.” Deverell said even if Australia continued its policy uncertainty around energy and environment policy, we would still get to almost 100% renewable energy by 2060 purely because of the market. But the warning to politicians and policy makers is that “the transition happens more slowly and ultimately it makes electricity prices higher”. Thodey argues in the report that if Australia pulls the right levers, “it is possible to achieve higher GDP per capita (as much as 36%) while ensuring growth is inclusive and environmentally sustainable”. “In a global context, strong cooperation on climate change and trade can deliver a better outcome for Australia without significantly impacting our economic growth, where before it may have been thought impossible.” Domestically, the report says that whatever happens in the rest of the world, Australia can make big strides to reduce our emissions through improving energy productivity, which means using less energy for the same outcome. Australia was weak compared with best practice internationally because it was not using the best technology available. It had the potential to become one of the most productive users of energy in the world through energy efficiency and electrification. Electric vehicles, for instance, are expected to be the cheapest form of transport after 2025 and would dominate sales by 2040. Australia needs to prepare to adapt to global conditions whatever they are, but the biggest benefits will come if the world takes concerted action on climate change to limit global warming to a maximum 2C by 2100 rather than the catastrophic 4C rise if little action is taken. If there is cooperative global action on climate change, Australia stands to be a big winner, the report finds. The CSIRO modelling indicates that “lower emissions from energy and greater sequestration on the land could enable Australia to achieve ‘net zero’ emissions by 2050 under the outlook vision”. Australia could capitalise on low-carbon exports such as hydrogen produced by renewable energy, countering the decline in global demand for our fossil fuels exports. “Although other countries are also pursuing energy productivity and renewables, modelling suggests that Australia’s vast natural resources for renewable generation should lead to lower cost electricity in 2060,” the report says. With reliable, low-carbon electricity and investor confidence in long-term policy, along with rising wages and improved energy efficiency, “by 2060 Australians are spending between 58% and 64% less on electricity as a proportion of income than they are today”. Even if the world balks at strong action on climate change, Australia does better economically if it if embraces energy efficiency to reduce emissions. The report’s proposed land shift would see a “stretch goal” of increasing agricultural productivity to 3% per year, meaning intensifying agriculture on the best land, using emerging technologies and boosting research and development. For instance, increasing productivity could result in revenue for crops such as winter cereals doubling by 2060. Agriculture in Australia had not yet fully embraced the “digital revolution” and doing so would be a boon. Strong global action on global warming would present opportunities for land owners to sequester carbon through carbon and environmental planting, a “significant land use shift” that would protect prime agricultural land for food. As much as half of the least productive agricultural land could be profitably switched to carbon plantings, which would offset Australia’s own greenhouse gas emissions. Additional emissions abatement could be sold as carbon credits to other countries. “Australia has one of world’s best and largest solar resources and we can capture that and export low emissions energy to countries that don’t have that resource, to places like Japan, Korea and potentially even China,” Deverell said. Overall, the report says that “Australia is not well prepared and that action is required to avoid the slow decline scenario”. That scenario is not a disaster, but is far less positive than it could be. CSIRO modelling found GDP growth would be 2.1% annually, real wage growth would be 40% higher in 2060 than it is now and there would be only a modest increase in energy productivity. Major cities would continue to sprawl, adding to stressful commutes and long distances to education and services. It is possible to achieve higher GDP per capita (as much as 36%) while ensuring growth is inclusive and environmentally sustainable. With bold action, the modelling found a far more prosperous and dynamic Australia, with GDP growth of 2.76% to 2.8% annually, real wages 90% higher, average density of major cities increasing 60% to 88%, only a 6% to 28% increase in total energy use, a more than doubling of energy productivity, and net zero emissions by 2050 with global cooperation. “This decoupling of emissions from GDP demonstrate that stronger action on environmental measures need not come at the expense of economic outcomes.” Deverell said the report wasn’t intended as a list of policy recommendations or predictions for the future, but a chance to “get together a group of senior leaders, public sector, private sector, NGOs, (to) have an informed consensus on where we need to go”. While trust and social cohesion were difficult to model, they were crucial for Australia’s future, he said. Trust in governments and CEOs was low, which meant Australians had little faith that decisions were made in the long-term interest of all. Without that trust, bold decisions were more difficult. There was no “silver bullet” to restore trust, but efforts were needed to address policy over-promising, the perceived unrepresentative nature of politicians who came from narrow backgrounds and the perception that politicians favour vested interests over the public interest. The report also emphasised equity. “We didn’t just want this to come through as a ‘here’s what we need to do to grow our economy’, but ‘here’s what we need to do to grow our economy and increase living standards for all Australians’.” In the industry shift, the report says productivity can be boosted with increased adoption of technology, greater investment in education and skills to ensure a globally competitive workforce, and reversing the decline in education in key areas such as maths and science. In both the slow decline and outlook vision scenarios, the report accepts official estimates that Australia’s population will reach 41 million by 2060, with Sydney and Melbourne home to between 8 million and 9 million people, and Brisbane and Perth between 4 million and 5 million. The slow decline model shows millions more living in the outer suburbs, making it harder to travel to jobs, education and services. Housing affordability remains a major problem, and social cohesion is strained. The urban shift requires a big change in the way planning and policy supports our cities, with a growth in medium and high density living, and a focus on multiple “centres” of growth apart from the CBD, a policy that Sydney and Melbourne are already embracing. Well-designed apartments, semi-detached homes and townhouses make up just over half of the housing stock, with a mix of reasonably priced accommodation so that essential workers can afford homes. People live closer to jobs, to education and to services and recreation. Car use is down, mass transit is up and electric vehicles make up over 80% of new vehicle sales in 2060. An alternative model outlined is one in which satellites cities such as Geelong and Newcastle grow quickly, and 5 million more people choose to live outside the capital cities, easing the density in the capitals. It is the second Outlook report, following a 2015 release that focused more narrowly on water, energy and food. The 2019 report is more ambitious and brings in outside leaders to identify Australia’s key challenges and opportunities. Deverell said it was aimed first at senior decision makers in the public and private sector, as well as NGOs and community groups. But it was “a message to all Australians that we can take control of the kind of future we want for the country”. “By using those two scenarios we were trying to illustrate just how different the future is depending on the path that we take. We’re saying that Australians need to get together and these are the things we need to be focusing on. This is what’s really important.”"
"A citizens’ assembly on the climate emergency will take place this autumn to explore the fastest and fairest ways to end the UK’s carbon emissions. Six House of Commons select committees announced the assembly on Thursday. It is the second of the three demands made by the Extinction Rebellion protest group to be addressed.  However, the group have criticised the initiative as it wants the assembly’s decisions to be binding, not advisory. Parliament declared a climate emergency in May, but the third Extinction Rebellion demand – action to cut emissions to net zero by 2025 – has not been met. Theresa May followed official advice and set 2050 as the date for the end of greenhouse gas emissions earlier in June, making the UK the first major economy to do so. A citizens’ assembly is a representative group of members of the public who come together to learn about and debate issues, and come to conclusions on the best solutions. Parliament has had such assemblies before, for example to assess social care. The climate assembly will take place over a series of weekends in the autumn but the people and locations are yet to be determined. “This isn’t a challenge for just one parliament, one political party, or one generation; to achieve net zero by 2050 we need to build cross-party and cross-generational support for the actions needed to deliver it,” said Rachel Reeves MP, chair of the business, energy and industrial strategy (BEIS) committee. She said there needed to be both strong government action and buy-in from the public for the environmental, health and employment benefits that achieving zero emissions could bring to be realised. “I hope the citizens’ assembly will demonstrate that, when all is considered, there is strong public support – even demand – for the government to take the action necessary,” she said. Greg Clark MP, the secretary of state responsible for climate action, welcomed the citizens’ assembly. “Initiatives to engage the public will be vitally important to appreciating the challenges of getting to net zero and giving people a say in shaping the future policies to achieve the target,” he said. But Roger Hallam, from Extinction Rebellion, said: “We have a citizens’ assembly that will give recommendations. Everyone knows what that means, which is it will come out with some ideas and get ignored, like people have been ignored for the last 30 years.” “If you are going to do a citizens’ assembly it has to have teeth and be legally binding,” he said. “We are facing a dire existential emergency. It’s what the UN is saying, what scientists are saying – the only people who haven’t taken it on board are politicians around the world.” Cutting emissions to zero will require the further introduction of renewable energy and electric cars, the end of gas heating and cooking in homes, restrained flying and meat-eating and the planting of 1.5bn trees to absorb any remaining carbon dioxide. But measures such as a diesel tax in France have been seen as unfair. Extinction Rebellion mounted large-scale protests in April and young people inspired by the teenage Swedish activist Greta Thunberg have put further pressure on politicians to act rapidly. The government has already announced that young people will advise ministers on how the UK should meet the net zero target. Extinction Rebellion is also protesting in the Scottish parliament on Thursday to demand a citizens’ assembly. Areeba Hamid, at Greenpeace UK, said: “The citizens’ assembly shows our politicians are starting to take this major existential threat a bit more seriously, but for it to work, it needs to be more than just a glorified public consultation. Will ministers be forced to take its conclusions into account or will they be able to brush them aside as they have done with countless consultations before? The solutions to tackle the climate emergency have been around for decades – what’s been lacking is the political will to make it happen.” The House of Commons select committees organising the citizens assembly are BEIS, environmental audit, housing, communities and local government, science and technology, transport and treasury.

In essence, this expedition was trapped by a preconceived, but false, perception of global warming.
Let us make no mistake about this expedition. A major part of it was indeed to stoke up global warming publicity. It is not for nothing four journalists were on board, among them two from the Guardian and one from the BBC.
And again today Andrew Revkin of the New York Times at Twitter refers to Turney’s expedition as a “fiasco”.
Also NatGeo throws Turney under the bus: natgeo-antarctica-ship-ice-trapped-1.

Share this...FacebookTwitterVeteran German journalist Ulli Kulke of Die Welt writes a summary of 2013 in terms of the global warming debate at his blog donnerunddoria.welt.de. He concludes: “Once again evidence has mounted that we are slowly but surely departing from the view of a global apocalypse.”
On 2013 global temperature, Kulke writes:
We will hear that 2013 was one of the ten warmest years of recent history (probably one of the seven warmest). And with great certainty the following will be concluded from all this: This is proof that global warming is galloping unhindered, if not accelerating. But according to the statistics this is not the case at all, especially the latter. It cannot be emphasized enough: One of the ‘ten warmist’ or ‘seven warmest’ in fact shows that global warming has reached a relatively high level, but also that the dynamic for a further warming has halted, at least for the time being. […]
In the meantime there’s another observation that has been officially recognized. Even the IPCC confirmed in its fifth assessmernt report from last September: There has been no statistically significant warming in the last one and half decades. […]
Thus global warming has stopped – and has done so even while CO2 emissions have increased unhindered.”
2013 was a blow to the credibility of climate models and CO2 sensitivity. Kulke:
It was just last year – and regrettably this was kept away from the public’s attention – that many scientific peer reviewed papers appeared in scientific journals showing that CO2’s effect on the climate, its ‘climate sensitivity’, had previously been estimated to be much too high.”
2013 saw the death of the science that claimed CO2 is causing more storms. Kulke writes:
Here there are no indications that the number or intensity of hurricanes and typhoons have increased over the last decades. Quite to the contrary. The tendency is, for both strength and frequency, significantly less, as shown by this compilation umistakably shows. Also the last 2013 report from the IPCC: The authors downgraded the statements on the probability with respect to the previous report of 2007.”

And 2013 saw another grand climate conference failure in Warsaw:
No one expected there would be an agreement on a binding reduction of CO2 emissions. And of course there wasn’t. What a surprise…just like every year before. […]
Once again what became clear in Warsaw: In the end it’s not really about CO2 emissions – it’s mostly about money and a redistribution from North To South.”
Also Kulke writes it is very clear that in countries like Canada, Japan, Russia, Great Britain and Germany have been sending out loud signals that their enthusiasm about climate protection is waning.
The list of naysayer countries has gotten considerably longer.”
Kulke adds that even climate refugees seeking asylum from sea level rise were turned away:
All that remains to be mentioned for 2013 is the court case in New Zealand where a citizen of the Pacific island nation of Kiribati attempted to be recognized as a a climate refuges because his island nation is supposedly going under. The judge threw out the case – mainly due to formal reasons. That’s a pity because she could have provided the Polynesian with a real factual reason: namely that the islands of his nation are not going under. Quite to the contrary in the last 50 years the islands are growing, as you can read about it here.”
2013 was in fact so bad that even after almost everyone had closed the books on the year and unanimously called it a knockout for the skeptics, 2013 delivered two other massive bonus blows that left the warmists reeling at the very end of the year: the Chris Turney Antarctic expedition debacle and the record North American cold wave. These last-second blows are carrying well into the year 2014.
Never has a new year started off so well for the skeptics. The debate tipping point is steadily getting closer.

Share this...FacebookTwitterAlarmist Stefan Rahmstorf of the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research and contributor at RealClimate has not wasted any time in climate ambulance chasing at his Scilogs site here, trying to get as much mileage as possible out of tropical storm Haiyan.
His piece is predictably titled, “Tropical Storms Are Getting Worse“. What is remarkable in the piece is that he singles out the non-alarmist skeptics who resist climate protection measures and asks them how they are still able to sleep quietly at night.
It’s an emotional outburst.
First his introduction reads as follows:
Tropical storm Haiyan was probably the most powerful recorded that ever struck land since records began. For this reason there have again been many inquiries about the impact of climate change on tropical storms. Here I summarize briefly the following: (1) The most powerful storms have become more frequent in the last deacdes, (2) Models show a further strengthening is expected for the future, and (3) warmer water and sea level rise will worsen the consequences like downpours and storm surges.”
And in typical Rahmstorfian fashion, he proceeds to build his case by selecting only the studies that support his doomsday narrative, and ignores a huge body of science that contradict his claims…SOP.
What I found remarkable was his concluding paragraph at the very end, which is much harsher and provocative than normal, and I think it deserves to be translated in English:
Regrettably those who diminish and downplay climate change are already on the prowl. At the popular ‘climate-skeptic’ website Watts Up With That Haiyan is kind of dismissed as just ‘another over-hyped storm’. Even if the chances that our greenhouse gas emissions worsen such catastrophes are only 50:50, how quietly can those who with all their might resist climate protection measures, and in view of the pictures coming out of the Philippines, still sleep at night?”
Here Rahmstorf blames skeptics in part for the storm disaster in the Philippines. This guy is a scientist?

=====================================
The Sun in January 2014 and News of the Sun’s Polar Field
By Frank Bosse
(Translated, edited by P Gosselin)
Over the last month solar cycle 24 (SC24) has seen some rather brisk activity. The sunspot number (SSN) reached a value of 82.0, which however was only 77% of the normal value (106) for the 62nd month into a cycle. The southern hemisphere (SH) contributed to most of the overall result in January, outperforming the northern hemisphere (NH) 61:21. The following graphic depicts current activity (in red) and normal activity (in blue):

Figure 1: The course of SC24 in relation to the mean value of all observed cycles.
The figure also shows SC5 in light red. SC5 has some degree of similarity to the current cycle so far. The next figure shows a comparison of the acti9vity of each indiviual cycle after 62 months into the cycle with little changing over the past few months:

Figure 2: Accumulated SSN anomalies of the cycles.
The chart depicts the anomaly of the accumulated sunspots for each cycle 1-24, from the mean value for month 62 into the cycle. SC24 began in December 2008.
So what is the activity determined by and are there indicators for the strength of the upcoming cycle? There is a lot of thought going on over this question. The favorite indicator is the strength of the polar magnetic field during the minimum between 2 cycles.
One of the very good predictions was developed by Leif Svalgaard already at the end of 2004 when he pegged the current cycle would be the weakest in the last 100 years. His 3-month smoothed maximum SSN of 75, which was derived from observations of the sun’s polar field, matches up very well to the present counts.
Since this has been confirmed, polar magnetic fields of the sun are recognized early indicators. At Stanford University they are being measured with great meticulousness and have been on the decline since recording began in 1976.

Figure 3: Polar fields of the sun since 1976, source.
Here we see that the field always reverses at the cycles’ maxima, and that it reaches a maximum when during the minimum of a cycle. The theory on this: The remnants of sunspots drift to each of the poles of the NH and SH (they do not cross the solar equator) and they provide for the reversal of the polar field. It’s a sort of see-saw that has been in steady decline since the SC21/SC22 minimum. Thus, pole reversal is a result of the activity of the ongoing cycle. Data can be downloaded from the above mentioned source. Our main interest is aimed at the behavior at the maximum, i.e. pole reversal. Here we evaluate the smoothed data of the magnetic field and the following diagram is yielded:

Figure 4: Polar solar magnetic field (in centi-Gauss) at the maxima of cycles 21-24. 
The data for the period of 30 days before until 30 after crossing the zero-point were evaluated and they determine the slope of the quite linear behavior. Also here falling activity is very well depicted. If we set 1980 equal to 100%, then it drops in 1990 to 51%, to 43% in 2000, and to only 22% in 2013. Not only the maximum magnitude of the polar magnetic field at the cycle minimum for sunspots has always gotten less over the last 30 years, but so has the speed of the pole reversal during the periods of SSN maxima!
So what’s with the polar field? That we are witnessing an especially weak effect is also depicted by the following diagram, which shows the course of the first 320 days after pole reversal:

Figure 5: The course of the unsmoothed data of the polar field after pole reversal.
What we see is a record: After almost one year since pole reversal, we have once again reached a zero-point, which was measured on January 12, 2014. Never has such a behavior been recorded since the beginning of data recording.
Could this delayed build-up of the polar field be an indication of the strength of the SSN minimum in about 5 years? This magnitude is namely the first predictor for the upcoming SC25. Looking at the data shown here, should we expect a Maunder-like “grand minimum” beginning in 2020? To date all indications point to low numbers…surprises cannot be excluded!

"A starving polar bear has strayed hundreds of kilometres from its natural Arctic habitat and wandered, exhausted, into the major Russian industrial city of Norilsk in northern Siberia. The female bear, visibly weak and seemingly ill, lay despondently on the ground for hours on Tuesday in Norilsk’s suburbs, its feet caked in mud, occasionally rising to sniff around for food. It is the first polar bear seen in the city in more than 40 years, according to local environmentalists. “She is still moving around a factory, under observation by police and the emergency services, who are ensuring her safety and those of residents,” environmental services official Alexander Korobkin told AFP. The bear was first spotted on Sunday evening in an industrial area north-east of central Norilsk, Korobkin said. A team of specialists are set to arrive Wednesday to inspect the animal and decide its fate. Oleg Krashevsky, a local wildlife expert who filmed the polar bear close up, said it was unclear what had brought the animal to the city, although it was possible it had simply got lost. He said it had watery eyes and could clearly not see well. The climate crisis has been damaging polar bears’ sea-ice habitats and forced them to scavenge more for food on land, bringing them into contact with people and inhabited areas. A state of emergency was declared in a remote inhabited area of northern Russian earlier this year when dozens of hungry polar bears were seen scavenging for food and entering public buildings and homes. State wildlife experts are expected to arrive in Norilsk on Wednesday to assess the bear’s condition. Local residents in the city known for nickel production came out to photograph the bear and look at it as police prevented them from getting too close.

"I am now 68 years of age but when I was 21, in my final year at university, I became aware of major problems then facing the world – war, poverty, acid rain, ozone depletion, desertification, deforestation, species loss, civil and military uses and abuses of nuclear power, pollution, population growth, consumerism and the climate crisis. I was determined to devote my life to helping solve these problems. After spending three years in Cameroon, learning about deforestation for timber and cash crops such as palm oil, and the exploitation of the rich resources of Africa to the detriment of locals and enrichment of corporations and western societies, I returned home to the nuclear weapons crisis of the cold war. I joined the Greenham Common protests, founded the Snowball civil disobedience campaign and then later the anti-nuclear weapons group Trident Ploughshares. I also became involved in work on the climate crisis. I learned that everything is connected and that it all has an impact on the climate, on biodiversity and on the sustainability of life on Earth. I discovered more about how our reliance on fossil fuels was causing the greenhouse effect and soon joined with climate scientists and local environmentalists to start a group in Norwich that tried to educate the public.  We put up maps showing how much of East Anglia and London would be under water as temperatures soared and the sea levels rose. This was in the early 1980s. We concentrated on what individuals could do to lower their carbon footprints – by putting up solar panels, changing lightbulbs, practising recycling and re-use, eating less meat, using public transport, shopping carefully and locally, and consuming less. After discovering the impact that UK timber imports were having on the loss of old-growth forests and their biodiversity, I even got involved in carbon sinks and sustainable forest management. I worked with major UK timber importers to persuade them to stop importing timber stolen from indigenous reserves in South America and Asia. But of course individuals changing their personal lifestyles was not enough. Governments had to get involved and make systemic changes. However, very few people and governments listened to us. We were Cassandras, considered doom-mongers, nihilists, mad. But if governments had acted then, we would not be at crisis point now. I cannot really understand why those in power have refused to act. After all, it is their world, too. I know politicians are relentlessly lobbied by the extractive industries, that there is a revolving door from politics and the civil service to the oil and aviation industries. But when our society and ecosystem collapses around us, none of us will be able to eat, drink, or breathe money. We know what to do to tackle the climate crisis, but it is not being done. Yet to be depressed and to lose all hope only makes the problem worse. I am fearful for the future for myself, for my family and for all living creatures on this fragile planet. I believe there is a real and substantial threat to all our lives and that, in accordance with the science, urgent and systemic changes to our society must be taken now to mitigate the danger. Over the past 40 years I have tried everything I could think of to create the changes necessary to combat the climate emergency and prevent catastrophic collapse. That is why I took part in a peaceful road blockade in April with Extinction Rebellion, as a result of which I was convicted this week of a public order offence. I believed our action could persuade our government to implement three demands to help save our world for future generations. First, to tell the truth by declaring a climate and ecological emergency and to work with other institutions to communicate the urgency for change. Second, to act now to halt biodiversity loss and reduce greenhouse gas emissions to net-zero by 2025. Third, to go beyond politics and be led by the decisions of a citizens’ assembly on climate and ecological justice. Following the wave of actions in London that began on 15 April, I believe that the necessity of our work, and its success in raising the alarm, are now widely acknowledged.  Like most people, I do not like being arrested. I did not want to spend three days in police cells refusing what I considered to be unreasonable bail conditions preventing me from returning to the protests. I do not enjoy spending time in courts, nor do I wish to spend scarce resources travelling from Wales to London for the hearings. If the government had done its job of acting in the public interest by providing people with honest information about the scale and urgency of the threat, if it had addressed the threat instead of compounding it, I would not have needed to engage in nonviolent direct action. Even though I did refuse to move when asked to by a policeman, I believed I was justified in remaining at the protest and taking part in what I considered to be a reasonable and proportionate response to the climate emergency. I believed that my action, alongside many of the thousands gathered in London that week, would help avoid disaster and lead to change. And this has been proved to be true. It has opened up a space for real debate about the climate emergency and what practical actions can be taken. Wales became the first country to formally declare a climate emergency. A few days later, the UK government declared a climate and environmental emergency. I have been involved in persuading my own town council in Knighton, Powys, to declare a climate emergency and to hold public meetings to decide what practical actions can be taken. I believe that this would not have happened without the creative disruption we caused in central London. Given that our fragile planet is undergoing a climate crisis that will soon culminate in chaos and massive loss of life, I had to do all in my power to bring about the necessary changes to prevent this catastrophe. I hope you will agree that what I did was a reasonable, proportionate and necessary response to the emergency situation we are in. • This is an edited extract of Angie Zelter’s statement at Hendon magistrates court on 25 June. She was found guilty of a minor public order offence and given a conditional discharge"
"Defending against rising seas could cost US communities $416bn in the next 20 years, according to a new report. Spending on seawalls alone could total almost as much as the initial investment in the interstate highway system, the authors said. And the billions involved will represent just a fraction of adaptation efforts governments in coastal states will have to fund if they do not want to simply retreat. “I don’t think anybody’s thought about the magnitude of this one small portion of overall adaptation costs and it’s a huge number,” said Richard Wiles, executive director of the Center for Climate Integrity (CCI), which published the report. Estimates of how much sea-level rise will cost often focus on impacts by 2100, Wiles said, adding that people will be paying for the climate crisis much earlier. “You’re looking at close to half a trillion spent over the next 20 years and no one has thought about that. So the question is, who’s going to pay for that? Is it really going to be taxpayers? The current position of climate polluters is that they should pay nothing, and that’s just not tenable.” According to the report, Florida faces the highest costs, $76bn by 2040. Louisiana comes in second at $38bn and North Carolina third at $35bn. For cities, Jacksonville, Florida, New York and Virginia Beach could spend the most: $3.5bn, $2bn and $1.7bn, respectively. Many places are starting to pay such bills. Staten Island in New York, for example, is planning a $615m, five-mile seawall to withstand a 300-year storm. The federal government will pay $400m. As the planet heats up and land-based ice melts, the average global sea level has risen seven or eight inches since 1900, with about 3in of that rise occurring since 1993, according to a US government report. Seas could be up to 3ft higher by 2100 under the scenario examined by the CCI. The CCI published the report with analysis by lead scientist Paul Chinowksy, director of the environmental design program at the University of Colorado Boulder and chief executive of the firm Resilient Analytics. The cost figures in the CCI report are based on localized projections for sea-level rise under the UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) scenario for moderate levels of pollution. In that scenario, called RCP 4.5, emissions would peak around 2040 and then begin to decline. The projections in the report were calculated by the climate science and news organization Climate Central. The CCI report considered how much communities in the contiguous US would pay locally to build sea walls to protect against the storm surge expected in a given year, Wiles said, although many would spend more to build even stronger defenses. Other communities might vanish rather than pay for new infrastructure. If so their governments could then be vulnerable to lawsuits from residents, Wiles argued. Some communities examined would have to spend $1m a person on needed defenses, the assessment found. For example, Fire Island, a barrier island off the mainland of Long Island in New York, would face $1.5bn in investment to protect a few hundred ocean-front homes. The group studied thousands of miles of coastline to determine where roads might be submerged. Researchers estimated the cost of defending vulnerable infrastructure within portions of shoreline that could be at least 15% underwater by 2040."

Share this...FacebookTwitterGermany’s WirtschaftsWoche here (Business Week) reports on German steel and engineering giant ThyssenKrupp’s reaction to rising renewable energy costs, warning that “unless the correct decisions are made concerning renewable electricity, Germany as a location for steel production is in jeopardy.”
ThyssenKrupp is struggling to keep its steel-making operations alive in Germany in the face of skyrocketing energy costs owing to renewable energies, and joins the list of endangered German industries in the famous Ruhr Region, home to heavy industries such as steel and coal-fired power production. The statement by ThysssenKrupp aims “to increase the pressure on the German government,” WirtschaftsWoche writes.
According to Chief Financial Officer Guido Kerkhoff, the company is reeling from hefty losses of almost 8.3 billion euros incurred over the last 3 years, most coming from its US operations.
Although the company is still eking out profits in Germany, much of that is due to the company’s partial exemption from having to pay the feed-in tariffs for renewable energy. But the exemption is being seriously challenged in Brussels on the grounds that it represents an unfair competitive advantage, and thus may be revoked. WirtschaftsWoche quotes ThyssenKrupp’s CEO Heinrich Hiesinger, who in an interview with the Düsseldorf based Rheinische Post said:
Last year ThyssenKrupp paid out 85 million euros in renewable energy feed-in surcharges. If we had had to pay the full feed-in amount, it would have meant a burden of 350 million euros for us.“ That’s more than what the company earns in its European steel plants. As a comparison, in the fiscal year 2012/13, the company earned before interest and taxes (EBIT) 62 million euros.”
Industry is sending a loud and clear message to German lawmakers. Even North Rhine Westphalia’s socialist Minister president Hannelore Kraft is getting the message. Flashback: Read here.

"This past Saturday, I was among hundreds of activists with the group Extinction Rebellion NYC who protested outside the New York Times headquarters in midtown Manhattan to demand better coverage of the climate crisis. Protesters lay down on Eighth Avenue, staging a “die-in” to block traffic. We draped a banner the length of the Times building that declared, “Climate Emergency = Mass Murder”. Sixty-seven of us got arrested. Somewhat to our surprise, our protest received a good deal of news coverage. CBS, CNN, the Guardian, and the Associated Press ran stories. The Times even published one, a Reuters dispatch that quoted a Times spokesperson defending the newspaper’s coverage. “There is no national news organization that devotes more time, staff or resources to producing deeply reported coverage to help readers understand climate change than the New York Times,” the spokesperson said.  But is even the New York Times truly conveying the climate emergency now facing humanity? And what about the many other news outlets that don’t do a fraction of the climate reporting the Times does? The media as a whole lets us down every day by either treating the climate crisis as a non-story or, worse, by propagating misinformation designed to confuse people and thwart action. Recently I learned that ABC’s World News Tonight devoted more broadcast time to the new royal baby in a week than it spent on climate change during the entire year of 2018, according to data analyzed by the watchdog group Media Matters. ABC, CBS, and NBC did not mention the words “climate change” or “global warming” once during the combined 28 news stories they ran about catastrophic flooding in the midwestern United States in March. Which is why I and countless other young people around the world will be climate-striking against the news media this coming Friday – protesting outside TV, radio, newspaper and other news outlets to demand that they start covering climate crisis like the emergency that it is. With a few valuable exceptions, most of the media has a long way to go before they can claim to responsibly cover the climate story. Schoolchildren around the world have been skipping class on Fridays to stage climate strikes for nearly a year now, yet most news outlets continue to devote more attention to trivial topics than to the existential crisis that threatens to make this planet uninhabitable in the course of my lifetime. I agree with the Swedish teenager who started the climate strike movement, Greta Thunberg, who says that if the media were reporting responsibly on the climate crisis “we would rarely talk about anything else. As soon as you turn on the TV, almost everything would be about that: headlines, radio, newspapers.” I am 14 years old; Greta is 16. The climate crisis will most powerfully affect our generation and the generations after us, and scientists have repeatedly warned that humanity is running out of time to avoid the worst impacts. Last October, the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change declared that we had just 12 years to slash greenhouse gas emissions by half or else lock in a future of hellish temperatures, catastrophic droughts and storms, and millions of deaths. But how can we get the necessary political and economic response to this emergency when so few people know the full truth? During the many Fridays I have sat outside UN headquarters in New York City on climate strike, I have been bombarded by comments from people who don’t understand why I am striking. Many of them “adult-splain” falsehoods and misinformation to me, nonsense that I suspect they learned from media reports. We will never get the action we need to save our planet when most people still don’t know there is a crisis to begin with. This is why my fellow activists and I have decided that we must extend our climate strikes from our initial target – governments, with their power to implement different policies – to the news media, whose reporting shapes the public mood and therefore the potential public pressure against those governments. This Friday, I will be striking outside Fox News headquarters in New York City because Fox’s coverage of the climate crisis is especially terrible. Unlike the other broadcast networks, Fox doesn’t practice climate silence. It does something worse: it spreads climate misinformation – for example, by reporting as fact the lie that the well-established science linking greenhouse gas emissions with rising temperatures is unfounded. When the US Senate was about to vote on the Green New Deal last March, Fox aired more than twice as many prime-time segments discussing the Green New Deal as MSNBC and CNN combined. But Fox’s coverage was full of climate denial talking points, including absurd suggestions that the Green New Deal would get rid of cows and cost a stratospheric $93tn. So I’m calling on fellow youth climate strikers the world over to join me in targeting any irresponsible news outlets in their communities on 28 June. We must send a message that it is past time to make coverage of the climate emergency an urgent and continuing priority. If you are a reporter or other news outlet representative, I urge you to not only cover these strikes, but cover the climate crisis as well! Report on the science, the climate models, the economic and social impacts, the biodiversity loss and, above all, the Green New Deal and other solutions to the climate crisis that we’re not talking enough about. The world needs to wake up to the climate crisis, and the media needs to remember that it is supposed to function as society’s alarm clock. At the moment, too many news outlets are letting humanity sleep through our planet’s impending catastrophe. Isn’t it time they woke more of us up? Alexandria Villaseñor is the 14-year-old founder of Earth Uprising International and lives in New York City, where she strikes every Friday in front of the United Nations headquarters, demanding world leaders take action on the climate crisis. This article is being co-published by the Nation, the Columbia Journalism Review and the Guardian as part of Covering Climate Now, a project to catalyze improved media coverage of the climate crisis."

Share this...FacebookTwitterIf you think it just couldn’t be possible for any weather outfit to perform as poorly as the UK’s Met Office in long-term outlooks (13 out of 14 wrong), think again. It appears the US national weather services are right on their heels when it comes to who can make the all-time least accurate outlooks.
And we’re supposed to believe these people when it comes to their climate forecasting?
At this week’s Weatherbell Saturday Summary here, Joe Bastardi puts up the results of how well the NOAA winter outlook issued last fall ended up doing.
Here’s what their outlook called for:
Note how they said the chances for normal temperatures were about even for much of the country and warm down south. Averaging it out: a moderately warmer than normal winter. Today we see that the Midwest is having one of its harshest winters in decades and that the Great Lakes are almost completely frozen over.
Here’s how the winter has been so far:

One couldn’t be more wrong even if he tried like hell to be so.
Here’s what Joe Bastardi’s Weatherbell envisioned before winter started:

 Weatherbell’s outlook for winter 2013/14. Source: Weatherbell.
Weatherbell pretty much nailed it dead on.
Unfortunately, the outlook situation for this winter by the same US weather services is just as sorrowful for Europe. Last fall some German meteorologists, basing their outlooks on charts from the US weather services, were warning of strong chances that the winter would “be really cold“. But instead of a brutal cold winter, Europe is now ending up with one of its mildest ever. The opposite is what has actually happened.
I think taxpayers and citizens deserve much more than getting information that is constantly turning out to be consistently wrong – for both weather and climate outlooks. We’re getting sick of it. How about getting some competent people back into these organizations for once?
With private meteorologists, we at least have the option of firing them. But with the state weather offices, we have to put up with their screw ups and keep hearing that we’re just deniers whenever we lift a finger and that we ought to just keep quiet. And if that weren’t bad enough, at NASA GISS they are even altering and rewriting the temperature history in a twisted desperate effort to make their faulty forecasts appear correct!
To Joe’s credit, he says we ought to respect the people at the US weather services for their work.
But I don’t – not anymore. What for? I guy flipping a coin would do a far better job.

"Thursday’s Democratic debate demonstrated just how far the the US is from contemplating the climate crisis as a threat that will touch almost all areas of American life and policymaking. Once again, debate moderators waited until nearly 80 minutes into the debate to pose questions on the climate emergency.  The Democrats accurately conveyed the rapidly approaching deadlines scientists have said the world faces in limiting the most dangerous effects of the crisis. But despite the debate taking place in Miami, where the effects of climate change are already apparent, they missed multiple opportunities to press home how rising temperatures play into other political issues. Extreme heat and climate disasters threaten public health and the economy, and crop failures help to drive immigration from Central America. The California senator Kamala Harris called the crisis an “existential threat to us as a species”. Bernie Sanders said “the future of the planet rests on” the US fighting climate change. Pete Buttigieg, the mayor of South Bend, Indiana, said the US “can’t skip a beat” in limiting heat-trapping pollution. The former Colorado governor John Hickenlooper noted humans have about 10 years to stem irreversible damage to the planet. Harris and Buttigieg also talked about the people they have met who are already being harmed by climate change, including wildfire fighters in California and farmers facing flooding in the midwest. Still, the discussion largely pigeonholed the climate crisis as a single issue and an environmental problem. And the crisis was not what most candidates – including ones with better climate credentials – listed as their top priority. Asked what first issue they would pursue from the White House, only Hickenlooper and the Colorado senator Michael Bennet, neither of whom have been polling strongly, responded with climate change. Sanders, who is considered a heavyweight in the field, refused to pick one or two issues. “We need a political revolution,” he said. Hickenlooper also defended the fossil fuel industry in his state, saying it shouldn’t be demonized. He said the US is not the only country causing the problem. And he slammed the Green New Deal, a radical proposal to reform the economy with the aim of making the US carbon-neutral in 10 years, as a socialist policy aimed at “guaranteeing everybody a government job”. Joe Biden bristled at the idea that the administration he was part of might have launched efforts on climate change too late, pursuing a healthcare overhaul first and then hitting a brick wall with Congress when trying to cap emissions. “I think you so underestimate what Barack Obama did. He’s the first man to bring together the entire world, 196 nations, to commit to deal with climate change,” Biden said. He committed to building an electric-vehicle future, investing in science and technology and remaining in the Paris agreement, at voluntary global deal to limit emissions. Environment advocates continued to call on the Democratic National Committee to hold a climate-focused debate. The Sierra Club’s national political director, Ariel Hayes, said the Democratic candidates are “prepared and eager to have the deep, substantive discussion on tackling the climate crisis which we critically need”, but that “the DNC’s strategy of relying on TV networks to make that happen without a dedicated time and space is simply not going to work”. “You couldn’t make a plate of pasta in the amount of time these two debates just devoted to the gravest existential crisis we face,” Hayes said. Greenpeace USA’s climate campaign director, Janet Redman, said “talking points and soundbites do not cut it any more. “This is not how you behave in an emergency. Despite the candidates’ acknowledgment of the existential threat that climate change represents to humanity, we heard next to nothing over two days about how they would actually address this monumental challenge,” Redman said. “If we are all going to survive as a civilization, January 20, 2021 must be the first day of a new wave of resistance against the fossil fuel industry.”The American Petroleum Institute, the oil and gas trade group, in an emailed statement said “natural gas and oil will supply more than half of America’s energy needs for decades to come. “Promises of an imminent energy landscape powered entirely by alternative fuels might make for an applause line, but it’s less likely to make for plausible policy,” the group said. Experts say countries will have to eliminate carbon dioxide emissions from their electricity sources – coal, oil and gas – as well as pursuing deep cuts to pollution from transportation, agriculture and industry. The Trump administration is rolling back the incremental efforts the US government has made to lower emissions. And many other countries are failing to do enough to stave off the worst effects."
"European cities are taking exceptional steps to limit the impact of a historic early summer heatwave as temperatures across the continent approached monthly and, in some places, all-time records. Authorities have warned that temperatures could pass 40C and reach 45C in parts of the continent by Saturday as a plume of hot air moves north from the Sahara, sucked northwards by a stalled storm over the Atlantic and high pressure in central Europe.  In Germany, where the 38.6C recorded on Wednesday in Coschen, near the Polish border, exceeded the country’s previous June high, officials imposed a 120km/h speed limit on stretches of the Saxony-Anhalt autobahn as the road surface began to deteriorate, while rail tracks buckled near Rostock on the Baltic Sea. Weil wir #sprachlos sind 😅: Wie würden Sie dieses Bild betiteln?Als kleine Inspirationshilfe - ein #Zitat des Herren: „Et is halt warm, wa?“ Und jetzt Sie!#Hitze #safetyfirst #LebenAmLimit pic.twitter.com/BiM27ydDEy In Brandenburg, police said they were “speechless” as a man was stopped riding his moped naked, and after guards caused uproar in Munich by ordering a group of women to put their bikini tops back on, the city council was set to debate a by-law change to allow topless bathing. Schools in parts of France, meanwhile – where an all-time heat record of 44.1C could be beaten on Friday – were expected to remain closed until the end of the week, while authorities in Paris, Lyon, Strasbourg and Marseille banned older cars from entering their city centres to combat pollution. Is this a record-breaking heatwave? Temperature records for this time of year have already been broken across much of Europe. The highest ever June temperatures were recorded in the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Austria, Andorra, Luxembourg, Poland and Germany, while France registered an all-time record high of 45.9C. Why is it so hot? The latest heatwave, caused by an “omega block” – a high-pressure pattern that blocks and diverts the jet stream, allowing a mass of hot air to flow up from northern Africa and the Iberian peninsula – follows a similar extreme weather event last month that made it the hottest June on record. Is this heatwave a result of climate breakdown? It is not possible to pin the heatwave definitively on climate change because weather varies naturally. Moreover, the effects of climate change are not simple. For example, heavy rain and cloud across northern Europe is likely to become more common as the buildup of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere causes the jet stream weather system to become fixed in position. However, this year’s weather is certainly in line with the predictions scientists have made of rising temperatures, more heatwaves and prolonged droughts interspersed with periods of heavy flooding. What are the negative impacts of a heatwave? The body’s ability to regulate its own temperature is crucial; babies and older people are less well able to regulate their temperature and should stay in well-ventilated conditions. In the 2003 European heatwave there were about 70,000 excess deaths attributed to the long hot spell. People with underlying illnesses can also have problems, and even those who are healthy can experience difficulty sleeping and discomfort, so people are advised to stay hydrated and wear loose clothing at night. There is also an impact on farmers. While warmth at the right time is crucial for crop growth, excessively high temperatures can inhibit that growth, particularly if they are prolonged. Livestock can also suffer in the heat and need extra care. Fiona Harvey Environment correspondent Regional Île-de-France authorities estimated the measure would affect nearly 60% of vehicles circulating around the French capital, including delivery vans and trucks, and many cars older than 10 years, which have higher emissions than newer models. With temperatures in Milan forecast to hit 40C, charities were preparing to distribute 10,000 bottles of free water to the homeless and other people in need, while 33 of Spain’s 50 provinces will be facing record-breaking temperatures, which could reach 44C. Innsbruck’s famous “fiaker” carriage horses were taken off the streets as the city recorded 36.7C, breaking the 2012 record for Tyrol state of 36.6C. Three people, including two in their 70s, died in southern France after suffering heart attacks and other problems while swimming. French authorities have warned of the dangers of diving into cold water in very hot conditions, but there was no immediate confirmation the deaths were related to the heatwave. In Poland, the interior ministry said 90 people have drowned so far this month trying to cool off in lakes or rivers, and in Lithuania 27 people were reported to have died in similar circumstances as temperatures in the Baltic state soared above 35C. Strong winds and high temperatures helped fan a forest fire in Catalonia, in Spain, which destroyed some 2,500 hectares of land. Hundreds of firefighters and 14 water-dropping aircraft were battling the blaze on Wednesday night. Scientists have said Europe’s 2019 heatwave, like last year’s, was closely linked to the climate emergency and that such extreme weather events will be many times more likely over the coming decades."

Share this...FacebookTwitterIf you think things couldn’t get more absurd with Germany’s Energiewende, think again.
The German Bundesverbandes der Energie- und Wasserwirtschaft (Federal Association of Energy and Water Management) or BDEW, released its latest report on electricity production in Germany. The BDEW represents about 1800 companies of the energy and power sector.
Germany burns more coal, emits more CO2!
According to the German Press Agency (dpa), the BDEW reports coal power plants provided 45.5% of Germany’s electric power needs in 2013 compared to 44% in 2012. That’s an increase of more than 3%. Although Germany has invested hundreds of billions in green energy, CO2 emissions are rising. In 2013 renewable energy provided 23.4% of Germany’s electricity needs, up from 22.8% in 2012.
Natural gas, often considered a reliable alternative to coal and nuclear, fell in Germany from 12.1% to 10.5% German power companies say natural gas is too expensive. The dpa writes that “the share of electricity produced by burning lignite reached the highest level since 1990.”
German onshore wind power faces cuts

Solar energy’s share, despite billions in investments, only rose from 4.2% to 4.5%. Wind power production in Germany took a hit in 2013. Its share of German power was only 7.9% in 2013 compared to 8.0% in 2012 (a drop of 3.5%). The BDEW says this was due to the weather (less windy than 2012). Overall wind power in Germany is facing new hurdles. The dpa reports:
Energy Minister Sigmar Gabriel (SPD) wants to present a framework for a more affordable Energiewende by Easter – foremost subsidies for wind turbines onshore may be cut back.”
Cold weather foils Germany’s fight against global warming
For whatever reason the Süddeutsche zeitung left out the following from the dpa:
The increasing CO2 emissions that threaten Germany’s climate targets are traced back, according to Müller, foremost to the long heating season at the start of 2013 and the falling share of gas.
In other words: Cold weather foiled Germany’s fight against global warming in 2013.

Share this...FacebookTwitterAfter Monday’s April Fool’s release of the IPCC WGII SPM and the subsequent gasps of horror coming as a reaction from top government officials, you’d think little time would be wasted in taking clear, decisive actions to “protect the climate”. Recall how the situation is urgent and that decisive, immediate action needs to be taken quickly!
It turns out that the gasps of horror were mere show – designed to appease green activists. In reality, it turns out governments really aren’t that alarmed by the IPCC’s science and don’t take it that seriously after all. As you are about to read, actions speak much louder than words, no matter how quietly and discreetly the actions are carried out.
The German DPA press agency has just released a report: EU postpones climate fees on international flights until 2017.
“Climate protection”, no matter how urgent it is said to be, will just have to wait.
For a number of years the European Commission threatened to force all airlines flying into, out of, and over Europe to pay carbon emission charges, or else face being locked out of it’s busy airspace. Background info: here, here, here and here. But countries like the USA, Russia, China protested loudly and threatened to retaliate massively.
Brussels shoots kneecaps of European airlines
Today the DPA announces that Brussels has backed off and decided to postpone charging international airlines for emission permits until 2017. News of this loss of face is being buried in the back pages of the internet and media outlets. But Internet site CO2 Handel here writes:

In the view of the aviation industry, the postponement is only going to be a burden on the airlines in Europe. The president of the German Association of Aviation (BDL), Klaus-Peter Siegloch, spoke of a European-island-solution. ‘It distorts competition, does not help the climate, and weakens the aviation companies in Europe.'”
What better present could foreign, non-European airlines possibly dream of. Now they have a nice competitive advantage – served to them on a silver platter, courtesy of Brussels.
The Greens are fuming – not because of the unfair competition, but because Europe has decided once again that the climate isn’t really that much in trouble. It can wait, after all.
European green Parliamentarian Rebecca Harms of Germany called the move “irresponsible”:
Originally the law was supposed to cover one third of the global aviation emissions. It’s lunacy to considerably weaken this effective climate protection instrument now.”
The move to postpone this “effective climate protection instrument” just goes to show you what Europe really thinks of the IPCC’s latest warnings. Not much!

"Twenty candidates – ten candidates per night – will take the stage during this week’s two-part Democratic primary debates. Each debate will last two hours, and, excluding introductions and interruptions, each candidate will have roughly 12 minutes of total speaking time. How much of that can we reasonably expect to be devoted to the climate crisis? If past debates are any indication, not much. There were no direct questions about climate change posed in either the 2012 or 2016 debates. In refusing grassroots calls for a debate focused on climate change, Democratic National Committee chairman Tom Perez has promised this time would be different. In a Medium post composed after backlash to his decision, Perez wrote that he considers climate a top issue, and “made clear to our media partners that the issue of climate change must be featured prominently in our debates”. Given that network news spent more time covering the Royal Baby in one week than they’d spent in a year on climate change, that’s not exactly a convincing sell. If the DNC really did care about climate as much as Perez claims, it’d see the debate stage as a chance to offer a valuable counter-weight to the relative silence across television news about the climate crisis.  Why, moreover, would the DNC let such an opportunity go to waste? As the Trump administration continues to deny the basic reality of climate change – with some even cheering it on – fully owning the climate challenge as their own could be a boon for Democrats. Recent European parliament elections saw a flood of voters to the European Greens, as the climate crisis emerged as a top concern for many on the heels of massive Fridays for Future demonstrations and Extinction Rebellion in the UK. Climate fears are beginning to take hold of voters in the United States as well, and the DNC would be stupid to not capitalize on the fact that their party is the only one with any nominal claim to be taking the potential end of the world seriously. If the DNC isn’t going to take advantage of that fact, then Democratic presidential hopefuls should. When candidate Jay Inslee inquired about doing a special climate-themed debate, the DNC threatened to bar him and any other candidate who participated from the official primary debates. Why not dare them to try? Given the anti-establishment mood of many voters, it could play well for independents to stick it to the stingy party apparatus. Virtually every front-runner except for Joe Biden has backed the idea of a Green New Deal, and even he has called it a “crucial framework”. Fifteen have also supported the idea of a climate debate. If climate change really does matter to them, then the coherent move would be to rebel against the DNC and give voters a chance to hear their thoughts on the greatest existential threat facing humanity. With Republican leaders like Mitch McConnell and Matt Gaetz already starting to come around on climate, Democrats’ homefield advantage on the issue may not last long. A climate debate shouldn’t be about haggling over targets and degrees and parts per million, but about the full scope of what the challenge actually entails. From housing to immigration to healthcare, there’s no policy field which won’t be touched by rising temperatures in the coming decades. Contra Perez, the climate crisis isn’t an “issue” so much as the foundations on which all politics is going to play out. Making that a core concern for the party is an opportunity for Democrats to do something they haven’t in a very long time: present a plan for how to make people’s lives better. What candidates can bring forward – or fail to – is a vision for what a fairer and more democratic low-carbon world could look like, most thoroughly articulated so far by advocates for a Green New Deal. Promising to be better than Trump on climate is no recipe for the kind of rapid decarbonization required to save our collective skins. A climate debate, as such, should try to accomplish a relatively simple goal: to make candidates explain as succinctly as possible their plans to keep warming below 2C or less, and deal with the effects of whatever level of warming we do get. Leading climate scientists and energy experts can pore over the candidates’ answers in the days and weeks afterward, and evaluate how far each candidate’s plan will actually get us toward that goal. Then voters can decide whether those plans sound like they would build a world worth living in – DNC be damned. Kate Aronoff is a writing fellow at In These Times.

"The UK’s biggest carbon capture project will soon block thousands of tonnes of factory emissions from contributing to the climate crisis, by using them to help make the chemicals found in antacid, eyedrops and Pot Noodle. Within two years a chemical plant in Cheshire could keep 40,000 tonnes of carbon from the air every year, or the equivalent of removing 22,000 cars from the UK’s roads. The plant’s owners, a division of the Indian-owned Tata conglomerate, will then use the captured carbon to make the chemicals found in glass, baking soda or even medicine. The project is a step-change in the UK’s battle to cut carbon emissions from heavy industry and will capture more than 100 times the carbon dioxide trapped by an existing trial at the Drax power plant in North Yorkshire. The plans are backed by the government, which has agreed to give Tata Chemicals Europe a £4.2m grant towards the £16.7m cost of the project. Drax will receive a £5m government grant for a pilot, which could keep up to 16m tonnes of carbon from the air by the mid-2020s. In total the government plans to spend £26m to spur nine carbon capture projects which are “essential” if the UK hopes to reach its goal of cutting carbon emissions to net-zero by 2050. It is also spending £170m to create a net zero carbon “industrial cluster” in the UK by 2040. Carbon capture effectively traps the emissions from power plants or factory flues before they enter the atmosphere and contribute to global heating. The trapped carbon dioxide could be piped into permanent underground storage facilities, but it can also be purified to make products. Tata plans to refine the carbon emissions to make a high-grade liquid version of carbon dioxide which will help make sodium bicarbonate, or baking soda. The company is the only UK-based maker of baking soda which is in high demand by the pharmaceutical sector to help treat conditions from heartburn to kidney disease. It is also found in ear and eye drops. Tata is also the only company in the UK which produces soda ash, or sodium carbonate, which is used to make detergents, lemon sherbet power and glass. Martin Ashcroft, head of Tata Chemicals Europe, said the “hugely exciting” project would help to “reduce our carbon emissions, whilst securing supplies of a critical raw material”. Tata also owns one of India’s biggest energy companies and has promised to end investment in coal plants to focus of wind and solar power. Chris Skidmore, the minister for energy and clean growth, said: “Cutting edge technology to capture carbon will cut emissions as we work towards a net zero economy, while creating new jobs – a key part of our modern industrial strategy.”"

"Plastics are among the most ubiquitous materials in our economy, our lives, and our environment. They are also among the most pervasive and persistent pollutants on Earth. In recent years, stark images of beaches, waterways and wildlife filled with plastic have spurred demands for action to address plastic pollution. These calls are coupled with growing concern that plastic and its toxic additives pose serious risks to human health at every stage of the plastic lifecycle. Far less attention has been paid to the impacts of this same lifecycle on the Earth’s climate. This is a dangerous oversight. From catastrophic wildfires in California to searing heatwaves and record drought in India, the scale and growing severity of the climate crisis are undeniable. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change warns that humanity must limit warming below 1.5C or face far greater and potentially irreversible climate chaos. To achieve this, we must cut global emissions 45% by 2030 and reach zero net emissions by 2050. A recent report by the Center for International Environmental Law and partners shows that plastic’s rapidly rising emissions put these critical goals at risk. In 2019, plastic production and incineration will add over 850m metric tons of greenhouse gases to the atmosphere – equivalent to the emissions from 189 coal-fired power plants. By 2050, these emissions could rise to 2.8bn metric tons, equivalent to 615 new coal plants. Why are these emissions growing so rapidly? Because plastics are made almost entirely from fossil fuels. Natural gas, oil and coal account for 99% of what goes into plastic. Thus, plastic’s climate impacts begin not in the oceans, but at the wellheads and drillpads where plastic is born. Moreover, refining those raw materials into plastic is among the most energy- and carbon-intensive of all industrial processes. In 2015, just 24 ethylene facilities in the United States emitted as much carbon dioxide as 3.8m passenger vehicles. Globally fracking to produce ethylene produced as many emissions as 45m passenger vehicles. If growth continues on its present trajectory, plastics could creat 56bn metric tons in greenhouse emissions by 2050 The North American fracking boom is poised to make this situation much worse. Fueled by cheap fracked gas, Exxon, Shell and other petrochemical producers are massively expanding the infrastructure for making plastic. The American Chemistry Council projects that the industry will invest over $200bn in more than 330 new or expanded facilities by 2025. Just one of these facilities, a massive ethane cracker being built by Shell in Pennsylvania, could emit up to 2.25m tons of CO2 yearly. Nor do emissions end once plastic’s useful life is over. While the carbon emissions associated with recycling are minimal, less than 9% of plastic is recycled annually. Effective recycling rates are lower still. As indicated by China’s recent ban on plastic waste imports, much of the plastic waste that has been sent to Asia for recycling has no economic value. It was and always has been just trash. In the face of China’s import ban, communities are increasingly turning to incineration as the way to deal with that trash. This incineration alone could add 4bn metric tons of carbon to the atmosphere by 2050. If growth continues on its present trajectory, plastic production, use and disposal could create 56bn metric tons in cumulative greenhouse emissions by 2050 – consuming a staggering 13% of the Earth’s entire remaining carbon budget. The climate impact of plastic that escapes into the environment is harder to quantify, but may be even more significant. Research demonstrates that the 57tn microplastic particles at the ocean’s surface continually release small amounts of greenhouse gases – and will continue doing so indefinitely. The climate impacts of this are difficult to quantify because those surface particles represent only a fraction of 1% of plastic in the ocean. Nor do they include the massive amounts of plastic on beaches, riverbanks and farmlands worldwide that are releasing greenhouse gases even faster. More troublingly, scientists have found that microplastics are interacting with and often negatively affecting plankton in ocean basins worldwide. These microscopic plants and animals form the foundation of ocean ecosystems and also create the biological carbon pump that makes the oceanic carbon sink function. This raises the currently unquantifiable but deeply troubling prospect that rising plastic pollution could disrupt the Earth’s largest natural carbon sink, further accelerating the climate crisis. Whether measured by its impacts on the climate, environment, or human health, the rising flood of disposable plastic creates risks humanity can no longer accept. Just as the roots of the climate and plastic crises are interlinked, so too are their solutions. Simply put, it’s time to break free from plastic. We must end the production of single-use, disposable plastic, stop the development of new oil, gas and petrochemical infrastructure, and accelerate the transition to sustainable, circular economies and zero-waste communities. Carroll Muffett is the president of the Center for International Environmental Law (CIEL)"

"The UK and other EU governments are in breach of international obligations by failing to be open about their policies to tackle emissions from aviation, a coalition of NGOs has said. The group is lodging a formal complaint over the secrecy surrounding regulation of emissions from international flights, which they say allows the aviation industry to be a “climate laggard”. Last year, aviation emitted 895m tonnes of carbon dioxide – 2.4% of global energy-related CO2 emissions, according to Carbon Brief. If aviation were a country it would be the sixth biggest emitter in the world.  But the UK and other EU governments are in breach of international obligations relating to the release of environmental information because they are failing to disclose details on cutting emissions, say the NGOs which are part of the International Coalition for Sustainable Aviation. The Aarhus convention, which was agreed in 1998, enshrines the right for everyone to receive environmental information held by public authorities. The parties to the convention are required to make the necessary provisions so that public authorities contribute to these rights to make them effective. The coalition of NGOs will raise its complaints on Thursday at a meeting of the working group of members of the convention in Geneva. The UK, EU and European governments are all members of the International Civil Aviation Organization, a UN body incharge of reducing the carbon footprint of international aviation. But the ICAO has been criticised for its secrecy. Its agenda and discussion documents are not released to the public or the media, and the meetings are held behind closed doors. Documents do emerge through leaks, but the ICAO rules warn participants that they face “unlimited liability for confidentiality breaches”. Andrew Murphy of the NGO Transport and Environment said the UK and others were using these rules to avoid releasing their policies, and were therefore in breach of the Aarhus convention. He said governments had failed to release their submissions to the ICAO environment committee, which meets every three and has drawn up the first scheme for international airlines to declare their emissions, known as Corsia. Murphy said: “Governments have been using this UN agency’s arcane rules to dodge their obligations under international law. They are required to be transparent in how they regulate aviation emissions. Their secrecy is one of the reasons why the airline sector remains such a climate laggard.” Under Corsia, international aircraft will this year have to start monitoring their emissions as part of ICAO measures. Central to these measures is a market-based system of purchasing emissions offsets rather than a requirement to directly reduce aircraft emissions. Air transport companies can reduce the amount of carbon emissions they have to offset by using biofuels. A final decision on the rules around what kinds of biofuels can be used was made last week at an ICAO meeting, but the policy has not been published. The Guardian asked the ICAO to release details of the policy, but the agency was not able to provide the information in time for publication. Corsia was agreed in 2016 by the 36 ICAO member countries and has taken until this year to implement. But some believe it will not have the required impact on reducing emissions produced by an aviation industry which predicts passenger numbers doubling to 8.2 billion by 2037. A spokesperson for the Department for Transport – which sends officials to ICAO meetings – said the UK did not publish official correspondence with the UN body because it is was “not an environmental organisation” and that its work involved confidential information which was commercially sensitive. “We strive for maximum transparency and recognise the importance of public access to information, which is why we are seeking to improve ICAO practices in this area,” the DfT said. “We are engaging with the ICAO and all its other member states, and will continue working to ensure our international environmental responsibilities are upheld.”  • This article was amended on 28 June 2019 to clarify that the ICAO responded to the Guardian’s request for details of the policy, but was not able to provide the information in time for publication."

Share this...FacebookTwitterMore an eight years ago Al Gore, according to Laurie David, prophesized that unless we acted immediately we had only “ten years left to save the planet from a scorching.” The ever skeptical Rush Limbaugh put up his countdown clock (see below) on January 27, 2006.

Rush Limbaugh’s countdown to a scorching clock. Cropped from: www.rushlimbaugh.com/earth_cooks
With less than 2 years away to go to the prophesized “scorching”, now is a good time to check to see how much closer we have gotten to it temperaturewise – to see if we should be making plans to move up into the Arctic.
What have global temperatures been doing since then? The chart shows: nothing!

If anything, the trend is showing a slight cooling and there are no signs of any “scorching” in sight.
Conclusion: Al Gore’s prophesy has been nothing but a hoax. And because Al Gore continues to claim to the contrary, despite what the data show, and continues to profit by perpetuating the scare, he stands accused of defrauding the public.

Share this...FacebookTwitterLately we’ve been seeing and hearing lots media reports of cooling and cold weather extremes. Global temperature data, such as HadCrut 4, show warming has disappeared altogether.

Global temperatures have fallen over the last 8 years. Source: www.woodfortrees.org/.
Looking at the data for the last decade or so, one thing stands clear: Global temperatures have been showing many more signs of cooling than warming. Already we are sensing that global temperature has lost the battle to stay up. The HadCrut data series above shows that cooling has gained the upper hand. Indeed warming is now in the history books, having died some 15 years ago.
Forget the missing heat – the real story is the present cooling.
And a number of media outlets have kept up with this inconvenient development. Numerous reports have appeared lately, and they ought to serve as a wake-up call to policymakers who have long been heavily intoxicated with the fantasy of a run-away warming planet.
There is a growing number of undeniable signs showing the planet is cooling:
– The Arctic has seen a 60% gain in sea ice, the highest late summertime level since 2006. In fact, there hasn’t been any warming in the Arctic in 8 years. The North Pole region has long been touted as the canary in the coal mine. Nowhere were temperatures supposed to rise faster than in the Artic. The fact that the Arctic is now cooling should be telling us something.
– At the other end of the earth, Antarctic sea ice has been above normal for more than 700 consecutive days and this year it has been setting dozens of record highs for sea ice extent. With about another week left before the season peaks, the South Pole is poised to set an all time record high since satellite measurements began.

– Central Europe has seen 5 consecutive colder-than-normal winters – a record. Worse, early forecasts for the 2013/14 winter show we may be looking at a spectacular 6 colder-than-normal winters in a row.
– The online UK Express reports here that the globe is cooling, and so does the UK flagship newspaper Daily Mail in a detailed piece well worth reading.
– The UK Telegraph also recently reported on a cooling planet, quoting climate scientist Professor Anastasios Tsonis of the University of Wisconsin: “We are already in a cooling trend, which I think will continue for the next 15 years at least. There is no doubt the warming of the 1980s and 1990s has stopped.”
– Finally, reader Ed Hoskins has been charting CET temperature data from the UK Met Office: “The overall annual temperature shows a diminution of pretty much a full degree Celsius over the last 13 years.” Here’s the chart:

CET temperatures have been plummeting over the last 13 years (fall 2013 data not included). Chart by Ed Hoskins, data source: UK Met Office.
It turns out the alarmists are correct: Global warming can no longer be denied. That’s because there is none left to deny!

At the same time, we consider 2000 years a short enough time to be of relevance for the cultural heritage we cherish.'”

This cat is out of the bag, and it’s not about to be put back in and forgotten. The German media, once coddlers of the environmentalist Greens, are no longer holding back. The news of Germany’s Green Party earlier involvement in supporting rights of adults to have sex with kids is threatening to be the party’s worst ever scandal.
Germany’s Green Party leader regrets campaign to ‘legalise paedophilia’
The head of Germany’s Green Party has expressed regret about a two-decade-old political pamphlet containing calls to legalise some forms of pedophilia.

Jürgen Trittin was listed as “legally responsible” for a 1981 election pamphlet, which called for the decriminalisation of sex acts between adults and children “that occur without the use or threat of force.” […]

The party’s support for making paedophilia legal only ended in 1990 but the past has haunted them throughout this election campaign. […]

But that pattern was interrupted by a blast of cold air from the East about 10 days ago. The results have been deadly.
13 die of cold in Romania
First, Spiegel here reports that 13 people have died of cold in Romania over the last week as temperatures there have dipped to -18°C. In Austria 2 people were killed in an avalanche after heavy snowfalls.
Poland hard hit
www.wetter.com site here reports that 26 people have recently been killed by the bitter cold in Poland. Since November 1, at least 52 people have died of cold in Poland. In Germany the bitter cold claimed the life of a 57-year old Saxony Anhalt man who died of hypothermia as temperatures dipped to -16°C.
Almost 60 dead in the Baltic countries

The bitter cold has also taken a severe toll in the Baltic countries. The online German language Das Baltikum-Blatt here reports that at least 58 people have died due to cold so far this winter with temperatures recently dropping to -20°C.
In Bulgaria at least 4 people have died of the cold over the last few days, so reports the online SOTT site here.

Share this...FacebookTwitterSwedish climatologist and meteorologist Lennart Bengtsson, former director of the Max Planck Institute for Meteorology in Hamburg, one of the most eminent climate scientists, has joined the London-based Global Warming Policy Foundation (GWPF) and an impressive roster of skeptic scientists and experts.
The move has sent shock waves across the climate science community, blogosphere, and into parts of the major media, for example Spiegel.
Science journalist Axel Bojanowski at Spiegel conducted an interview with Bengtsson to find out more about the motives behind the move. What follow are some excerpts.
A need to open the debate
On why Bengsston joined the skeptical GWPF, he says that he saw a need for more debate in climate science:
I think it is important to enable a broad debate on energy and climate.”
He also felt compelled to join the GWPF because he wants to contribute his meteorological knowledge “to open the debate“.
Debate in climate science is something that has been horribly lacking and it has been the target of massive suppression and censorship efforts.
Climate science consensus is senseless
Bengsston is also harshly critical of the efforts to enforce consensus:



<!--

google_ad_height = 200;

I see no necessity on the part of the IPCC to make efforts to usher a consensus. I think it is essential that society has areas where a consensus cannot be enforced. Especially in an area like the climate system, which is incompletely understood, a consensus is senseless.
Climate models in need of review
Another aspect swaying Bengsston to speak up has been the abject failure of climate models. In the interview Bengsston maintains that he’s a friend of climate prognoses, but that they are now due for major review in order “to secure their credibility“. He says the IPCC has not been critical enough over the models:
It is frustrating that climate science is not able to validate their simulations correctly. The warming of the Earth has been much weaker since the end of the 20th century compared to what climate models show.”
Solving problems of future generations “pointless”
Many policymakers claim that it is our generation’s responsibility to solve the problems of future generations. Bengsston characterizes this notion as senseless and pointless. To illustrate why, he asks readers to look back to 1914 and asks if it is reasonable for the people back then to solve the problems of 2014. “It would be pointless!”
On the future Bengsston says civilization…
…will require twice as much primary energy as today. We need to promote new science and technology. We need a more open approach, especially here in Europe, which includes the issues of nuclear energy and genetic engineering so that the growing world population can be supplied with energy and food.”
Policymakers instead are creating problems for future generations
Right now as Bengsston sees it, global policymakers are totally on the wrong path and they risk leaving behind a planet that will not be able to cope with the needs of future generations. In trying to solve the future problems, they are only going to succeed at causing great big ones.

Share this...FacebookTwitterGermany’s energy feed-in act is skidding out of control – and risks causing a social uprising. The power grid is becoming ever more precarious and electricity prices for consumers are at record levels. The German government, on the other hand, is reacting like a petrified deer caught in the headlights. It doesn’t know what to do.
Yesterday, Germany’s number 1 daily by circulation, BILD here, launched a campaign to get the government to take real action – to do something, and quickly!
Hat/tip: Benny Peiser
Germany’s feed-in act forces power companies to buy all energy produced by green sources (wind, solar, bio, etc), whether it’s needed or not, and to force-feed it into the power grid. Power companies are also forced to pay exorbitant prices to the green energy producers. This gross market interference is wreaking havoc on the European power markets. On windy and sunny days, huge amounts of excess energy end up getting dumped on the market and power producers incur huge losses, which of course just get passed on to the consumers.
Sometimes prices on electricity exchanges even go negative. Despite these negative or ultra low prices on the electricity exchanges, consumers are paying record prices. So distorted has the market become.
So Bild newspaper is taking action and is openly demanding the government take action. Bild presents the facts:
What’s absurd: Even when prices on the power exchanges fall (last year it fell from 4.2 to 3.6 ct/kWh), the green energy producers get their money. Effect: The cheaper electricity becomes, the more the consumers have to pay.”

This is what happens when mastermind green bureaucrats, obsessed with the fantasy of rescuing the climate, start interfering with markets with completely nutjob ideas. Bild adds:
The feed-in surcharge is the main driver behind electricity costs. Currently it represents 14 percent of the price. At the beginning of this year the surcharge jumped again by 1 cent to 6.2  cents per kilowatt-hour. A sad record!
To blame for this is a design fault in the EEG Feed-In Act. Here prices are guaranteed for the wind and solar park operators.”
No risk! Bild writes:
This guaranteed price is financed by the feed-in surcharges – paid by the consumers!
Never before have rich, large property owners seen such a risk-free bonanza. Who pays? The poor consumers who cannot afford property on which to install a windpark or solar system! Indeed every year 600,000 Germans get their power cut off because they no longer can afford the exorbitant electricity prices. This is how Germany is reducing its CO2 emissions: The poor are having to go without!

By the European Institute for Climate and Energy
Copenhagen/Hamburg: A Danish study that cost the taxpayer more than €2.6 million and supported by the freeloaders of the wind power, led by world’s largest wind turbine manufacturers Vestas, Siemens, and Vattenfall in Denmark, is to provide for a smooth and unobstructed process for wind turbine projects – without any protests.

Thanks to the Ministry of Research and public financing, an interdisciplinary study was written by scientists from three universities from Denmark, Ireland and England and supported by representatives of those with an interest in the wind industry. The study investigated the exchange between the organizations of the wind energy opponents, covering topics such as windpark fraud, species protection, sleep disturbance and Nina Pierpont, doctors from the state of New York who researched wind turbine syndrome which causes illness owing to low frequency noise, which 30% of Swedish residents living near windparks suffer from.
The connections between 323 websites of national and international wind opposition organizations and associations were monitored and analyzed.
Just in tiny Denmark alone there are currently 200 citizens’ initiatives and associations. Worldwide there thousands of groups and associations with hundreds of affiliated initiatives.
In response the websites of wind power opponents worldwide published a graphic of the study 2050 in order to confirm their strong network structure and to make it clear that they are a force to be reckoned with. The citizens have a democratic right to transparency and participation – worldwide. Preserving nature and its biodiversity, the landscape and human health is the mutual target of this global movement.
Vestas is providing a scandal in that it continues to spread the myth there are no adverse impacts on human health from infra and low frequréncy noise, despite a recently uncovered Vestas-PPP from 2004, which indicates to the contrary: windwahn.de/skandal-in-der-sauberen-windkraftbranche.

"This is the first piece in ‘Next left: where to now for Australian progressives?’, a new series on what the election result means for the progressive side of politics and the path forward Political commentators reflexively overinterpret election results. The story we’ve been told is that the Coalition’s win means that “Australian voters” have rejected Labor’s radical plan for reform of the tax-and-spend system, confirming that Australians prefer stability and incremental change.  Yet if one in 50 (2%) had voted the other way the pundits would have junked this narrative and told us, with great authority, that by endorsing Labor’s vision “Australian voters” showed they’re ready to embrace change. One in 50 could have switched to Labor if Clive Palmer had decided to spend his $60m on a new house instead of an election. Or if Labor had chosen a more credible leader. Or if, a week before election day, a minister had been outed cheating on his expenses. Yet such a random event would then have caused the pundits to offer a sharply different analysis of the state of Australian society. Poring over the seats won and lost, analysts have observed that many people voted against their economic interests, both at the lower end and the upper end. Some electorates dominated by low- and middle-income households, especially in the regions, voted conservative even though they would have gained from Labor’s plan to rebalance the tax system to benefit low-income households. Many in the wealthiest electorates shifted to Labor even though their taxes would be higher. It’s a phenomenon noted a few years ago in the US. Donald Trump promised huge tax cuts for the rich and no change to a desperately unfair health system, yet millions of Americans on the margins voted for him. Trump duly delivered on his promises and they still support him. Labor’s inability to attract enough votes has been blamed on its unduly complicated message. Some say its marketing misfired. People were confused and so voted against their own interests. The answer is a simpler message marketed more effectively, and by a leader who is more relatable. And Labor must cut back on the promises of improving the tax-and-welfare system because voters could not understand it, or because they are prey to scare campaigns. In other words, they blame confusion for voters’ irrational behaviour. But it’s more plausible that those who vote against their economic interests are as rational as other voters; it’s just that they don’t behave according to the pundit’s mental model – in which economic interests guide rational voting behaviour. For these citizens voting is less about economics than about culture. They are voting to protect a culture, that is, a social environment and way of life made up of values, behaviours and symbols that accord with their sense of who they are and where they fit. Those in wealthy suburbs who vote against their economic interests by supporting Labor or the Greens are also voting for culture; in their case, they want to change it. The argument that “money doesn’t buy happiness” is typically attributed to the comfortable middle classes, but it can apply at the other end too. At the lower end, those who vote against their economic interests might be worse off under a conservative government, but they will feel better because of the psychic wages they receive from knowing their anxieties are being recognised and addressed. These psychic wages compensate for any decline in material living standards. Progressives often have trouble understanding that culture can trump economics and around the world they are losing elections because the power of culture is growing while they continue to speak the old language. Culture now matters more than class, which is a dilemma for progressives in the cities who support the class interests of low-income people in the regions but represent a culture that many in the regions resent. The message of Donald Trump’s slogan “Make America Great Again” was: “You’re losing the world you know, the one that gives you a firm identity, and I will bring it back.” In Australia, it’s the same sentiment that the Coalition, with the help of shock jocks and conservative commentators, has been exploiting, not least with its attacks on political correctness and defence of “religious freedom”. In regional Queensland, Western Australia and Tasmania, where Labor performed very badly, the culture many identify with is a nostalgic, inward-looking one resentful towards the cities. One Nation attracted the votes of this cohort and channelled them to the Liberal and National parties. It should be remembered that low-income electorates in the big cities still voted solidly for Labor. But over the last decades a new kind of voter has emerged, one driven by cultural anxiety, who no longer feels that Australia is the country he or she grew up in. And it’s not. It’s partly due to immigration, a situation created by John Howard as much as anyone else when he allowed a huge increase in the rate of migration, making parts of Australia’s cities feel alien. Feeling like “a stranger in my own country” is perhaps stronger among those who look on from elsewhere rather than those living in it. When the New South Wales Labor leader Michael Daley was forced out of office for saying that “our kids” are fleeing Sydney and being replaced by Asian immigrants with PhDs, in many parts of Australia people felt he spoke to their anxieties – even those who can’t stomach the race-baiting of Pauline Hanson. The most articulate spokesman for the alienated “white working class” is Mark Latham, who arguably foreshadowed the Trump model. Speaking after the election, on Sky After Dark, he bitterly denounced the inner-city lefty elites in defence of those who “hate the idea of a Plibersek, a Wong, a Keneally patronising and condescending and constantly inferring there’s something wrong with working people and only these elites know how working people should run their lives”. (Like One Nation, Latham has a woman problem.) Les Murray is their poet. Success heaped accolades and money on Murray but it could never wipe away the seething resentment he felt at being looked down upon by the elites. “It’s my mission,” he said, “to irritate the hell out of the eloquent who would oppress my people.” “His people” are the everyday people, the real people who they set themselves against the intellectual, the pompous, the fake. And so they vote for regional candidates who, from the cities, appear to be comical buffoons because they are buffoons who speak their language. The rise of the culture of resentment filled a gap left by the decline of traditional working-class culture, one that the working class could identify with and be proud of. The demise of Australia’s working-class culture was due mainly to the decline of manufacturing, with global shifts in the division of labour. It was hastened by the Hawke-Keating government’s industrial accords, which marginalised trade unions as activist organisations and eroded the political emotion on which the ALP was founded, solidarity. When Bob Hawke sang Solidarity Forever at the 2012 Australian Council of Trade Unions conference it was mere nostalgia, a wistful dirge for a time when the workers could be inspired by the sentiment. Without an effective trade union movement, the Labor party has lost its ballast. Yet the past clings on in the form of Anthony Albanese and the power of union bosses in the factions. When unionists “betray” the party by supporting the conservatives, as mining and forestry workers have, aren’t they only reflecting the society of self-interest that Labor governments as much as conservative ones created with their free market reforms? If Labor is to build a constituency based on socially and environmentally progressive ideas then it has to aim to win government not by splitting the difference between culturally backward-looking voters in regional Queensland and forward-looking voters in the cities, but by winning progressive voters in traditional Liberal party seats. That means no longer buying into the demonisation of the Greens, who are its natural allies in building a progressive future. After all, the Greens’ platform shows stronger commitment to social justice than Labor’s does, and Labor’s climate change policy is now (at last) based on the science and therefore close to the Greens’ one. Of course, the politics of the election were more complicated than I have presented them. But the argument I am making points to a profound underlying trend in Australian society. Identity politics among the young has been excoriated by commentators on the right; but identity politics is thriving in the bush. Just ask Barnaby Joyce. It’s no accident that the hi-vis jackets our political leaders donned at every campaign photo op are also the uniform of the gilets jaunes protesters in France. The gilets jaunes are raging against the wealthy cities and the smug elites that live in them. The yellow vest symbolises the common man; putting it on is a protest against his invisibility. It was a movement sparked by rising fuel taxes among those who depend on their vehicles. They were not opposed to action on climate change as such but objected to having to be the ones to pay the price for it. And they’d been anxiously watching boats carrying Syrians and Africans arrive on Europe’s shores. The gilets jaunes complain: “We no longer count in our own country.” A movement with no platform and no leaders, it’s a manifestation driven by resentment at the apparent complacency of those prosperous cities, and the rage is concentrated, as if by a magnifying glass, on Emmanuel Macron. In Australia too, the electoral power of culture is most intense in the struggle over how to respond to climate change. It reached its sharpest point in the election campaign when Bob Brown’s convoy of Adani protesters arrived to a hostile reception in Clermont in north Queensland. This was the climate change election. The climate question had moved from the margins to the mainstream for the first time. It wasn’t enough to push Labor over the line but, for a growing proportion of the electorate, perhaps now a third, and much higher among young people, it is the compelling issue that will not go away because the heatwaves are not going to stop and the scientists are not going to change their minds. The historical forces are moving, and it would be foolish for the Labor party to pull back now. In Britain, the House of Commons declared a climate emergency. In the US, Democratic party presidential contenders have transcended Barack Obama’s cautious strategy and are lining up to announce strong climate policies. After all, in a land of climate science denial, which half of science do you ditch to find the middle ground? The conservatives turned climate change into a cultural battle. When the Tea Party emerged in 2009, it did not take long, backed by Fox News and the Koch brothers, before climate change was added to the toxic brew of sins attributed to “the liberal elite”. Global warming was no longer a scientific and environmental issue but a cultural one. Prominent conservatives including Sarah Palin shifted from supporting action to cut emissions to denouncing global warming as a liberal plot. From a situation in which there was little difference between Republican and Democratic voters on the need to take action, within a few years of 2009 a wide gulf had opened up, to the point where in 2016 a man who dismissed climate science as a Chinese hoax was elected president. When Trump ridiculed climate change his people understood who the targets were – Al Gore, Hillary Clinton and the know-it-alls in the east coast cites. The conservatives who imported climate science denial to Australia saw their actions explicitly as part of their culture war.  When climate change was sucked into the culture wars two worldviews faced each other uncomprehendingly. Those of an inward-looking and nativist disposition could argue that Australia shouldn’t cut its emissions because it will make no difference to the world; those with an outward-looking temperament insist that we are global citizens as well as Australians and must accept our responsibilities. Conservative politicians in regional Australia have been stoking a kind of metrophobia, playing up resentments against “city elites” and enlarging myths about latte-sipping sophisticates sneering at their backwardness. Environmentalists occupy the central place in this demonology. They refer not to “the Greens” but to “the inner-city Greens”. The demonisation of the Greens reached scandalous proportions in March when rightwing politicians and Murdoch commentators responded to the massacre of innocents by a neo-Nazi in Christchurch by denouncing “extremists from the right and the left”. There are no extremists of the left. To equate trespassing by animal rights activists to mass murder is grotesque and deeply offensive to the victims. Besides, animal rights activists are not environmentalists, as the conflicts over culling prove. The deniers who have taken over the Liberal and National parties are a radical fringe but they now dominate conservative politics. The moderates are afraid of them. Among the public, explicit denial of the science is the preoccupation of a small minority, perhaps 10%. But a larger portion shares the deniers’ antipathy towards environmentalism, and nowhere more so than in regional Queensland and Tasmania, where Labor lost the election. On the surface, the Adani mine is about jobs, but beneath it the mine has become the foremost symbol of the cultural rift between the regions and the cities. The anti-Adani convoy brought this cultural conflict starkly into view. If it’s not irrational to vote for culture over economics, it makes no sense to vote to protect a culture that is being overwhelmed by unstoppable natural forces. Climate activists of all kinds see the issue not so much as one of science (that’s settled), nor of economics (we should make the transition whatever the cost) but of moral obligation. They identify themselves as standing for the survival of humankind and the natural world. They cannot allow the Adani mine to go ahead because it is the symbol of the end of the world. The deniers have been returned to office, led by a man who gleefully rubbed a lump of coal in the faces of the opposition. The prime minister has handed responsibility for cutting Australia’s emissions to Angus Taylor, a man who appears to reject climate science and the facts about Australia’s problems in meeting its Paris targets. The appointment is a brazen two-finger salute to all those who take global warming science seriously. Then there is Matt Canavan. The minister for resources sees it as his duty to promote coal as vigorously as he can, including allocating public subsidies for the construction of new coal-fired power plants. Building new coal plants isn’t about economics or good energy policy; all of the experts and all of the energy industry executives agree it’s reckless. The banks won’t go near it. Canavan has castigated industry for supporting a transition out of coal. For Canavan, Taylor and Morrison, building a new coal-fired power plant would be a decisive win in their war against environmentalism. Winning the culture war is much more important than their commitment to the free market. But they can only hold back the tide for so long. The school kids who staged this year’s strikes sense they live under an ever-darkening shadow. Their fate is to be born into a time when there are no more dreams of utopia; the only hope is to avoid a worse dystopia. They will constitute a growing share of the electorate. Today’s self-funded retirees will be dead. The party that will govern Australia in the future will be the party of the young. It would be political folly, as well as morally indefensible, for Labor to step away now. The most powerful image from the school strike on 3 May was of a distressed girl speaking to the camera. “What’s going to happen to humankind?” she wept. “What’s going to happen to the whole world, if no one does anything?” The terror she is carrying around haunts more and more young people, who at school and at home have absorbed the implications for themselves of the unfolding climate crisis. Their feelings of dread are based on solid scientific facts, reinforced by experience each time a heatwave scorches the streets, autumn will not come, fire razes a forest that’s not supposed to burn, and the Great Barrier Reef limps on to its final death. It’s the future of politics in Australia. • Clive Hamilton is professor of public ethics at Charles Sturt University in Canberra"

Share this...FacebookTwitterRenewable energy in Europe has just taken another nail in its coffin.
Thanks to Germany’s infamous EEG energy feed-in act, electricity prices for consumers and industry have long been rising sharply, and now there’s a looming threat of a revolt.
Today the online business magazine Unternehmen Heute quotes former German Chancellor Gerhard Schroder’s soon-to-be-published book, which warns of a revolt by consumers and industry. The timing of Schröder’s words could not come at a worse time for renewable energy proponents, and will no doubt act to take a lot of the momentum out of the already ailing renewable energy movement in Europe. A number of countries have announced major scale-backs on green energy subsidies. Unternehmen Heute writes:
Electricity must remain affordable, Bild newspaper (Saturday edition) quotes Schröder’s book ‘Clear Words’, which will appear in mid February.
The support for renewable energy through the electricity price will lead consumers, especially the ones near the bottom of the income scale, to eventually revolt and say: We can’t afford this any more.”
Schröder adds that eventually renewable energies will soon “have to compete on the market by themselves. They should not be permanently subsidized.”
The former Chancellor also thinks that Germany will not shut down its remaining nuclear power plants by the year 2022, as planned, and believes Angela Merkel acted hastily in passing legislation requiring their shutdown in the wake of the Fukushima accident in Japan. Schroder writes in his book:
My impression is that a complete shutdown will not happen that quickly: consumer and industry will revolt and put policymakers under pressure to postpone the shutdown date because of cost reasons.”

Moreover, Schroder writes in his book that German companies are already reconsidering plans to build plants in Germany, and are considering setting up in low-price-energy locations instead.
Schroder’s views are a major blow to renewable energies
Schroder’s views take a lot of wind out of the renewable energy sails and will only add to the mounting pressure that is having policymakers putting the brakes on renewable energies. Nuclear energy in Germany may not be dead after all.
Even chancellor Merkel is adding conditions to the target of achieving 80% renewable energy by 2050. At the 1:15 mark in the video at the end of the Unternehmen Heute story, she says:
With this expansion corridor, we can quite harmoniously reach the expansion target of 80%. However, only if our industry is able to stay competitive globally and electricity remains affordable for all.”
In other words, kiss the 80%-renewable-energy-by-2050 pipedream goodbye. Right now Germany has not even began to scratch the surface when it comes to powering the nation’s transportation system with green energy. Here too biofuels are being roundly rejected and its subsidies cancelled.
In summary, even as Brussels likes to beat its chest over its ambitious plans for green energies, policymakers everywhere in Europe are in reality abandoning their once lofty targets in droves.

Share this...FacebookTwitterAt his blog, Die Welt veteran journalist Ulli Kulke writes about the British Met Office’s seemingly obstinate refusal to cast off its ideological addiction to planetary warming and the Office’s consequently resulting overblown annual global temperature forecasts year after year.
Systematic false alarms
As the data roll in, it’s now clear that 2013 was “among the top 10 warmest years” and is thus good enough for the media to proclaim that global warming is happening unhindered and that everyone has to remain in a state of alarm.
And climate institutes just keep on sounding alarms of hotter years ahead. Kulke writes:
Example: The climate scientists at the British Met Office. They have always issued false alarms, and today we can even say systematic false alarms. Of all the annual forecasts on global temperature made this century, 14 in total, the scientists have wound up landing above the actual value 13 times. Paul Hudson, climate and weather expert of the BBC, points this out.”
Flipping a coin would already represent a vast methodological improvement for the Met Office. Kulke writes that it is obvious that the Met Office has “learned nothing from their experience“, and adds:
Apparently they just refuse to accept the reality that the trend is no longer going up in any significant statistical way (as even the IPCC has admitted this in the meantime). It is stunning, but some never learn.”

For 2014 the Met Office predicts that global temperature again will be 0.57°C above the long-term average.
It sounds as if the Met Office scientists are just playing a broken record.
===========================
Minus 73°F in Siberia
Aside from the story of failed forecasts from the Met Office, extreme cold is now gripping large parts of Siberia, with some locations showing temperatures at 60°F below zero and colder. One location taken from early this morning shows -73°F. So much for melting permafrost!

Share this...FacebookTwitterA Short History of the Human Race
 Part 1, The Late Pleistocene, A Story of Survival
By Ed Caryl
The story of the human race, Homo Sapiens, is really a story driven by climate, particularly temperatures, rainfall, and sea level. Most of that history has taken place in the last 20,000 years, since the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM). But there was also some pre-history. Before we could advance to civilization, we needed to survive the the last glacial period. This was not easily done. 100,000 years ago, there were several species of Homo. By 10,000 years ago there was just us, and that was just by the skin of our teeth. There is genetic evidence that in the period around 70,000 years ago, there may have been as few as 10,000 Homo Sapiens in the world.

Figure 1 is a plot of Deuterium in a Greenland ice core, GISP2, a proxy for temperature.
Several points are indicated in figure 1. Reading from oldest at the right to the present day at the left, the Toba super-volcano in Indonesia caused an abrupt severe cooling that dropped the global temperature by about four degrees in a very short time. Prior to that, the climate had already cycled by similar amounts several times, but this cooling was much more severe. At that time, our ancestors were mostly confined to tropical Africa, but the cooling was accompanied by severe drying, putting pressure on the savannas in Africa that were our preferred habitat. Fortunately for us, after about a thousand years of starving out, the temperature and rainfall swung the other way, the Sahara Desert became green for a time, and we were able to migrate out of Africa through the Middle East, filling the vacuum left by Homo Erectus and putting pressure on the Neanderthals. Before the Eemian interglacial, Homo Erectus had gone extinct in Asia, except for locally adapted populations like Homo floresiensis in Indonesia and the Denisovans in central Asia. The last non-Modern Human population to die out was the Red Deer Cave people in China. They disappeared about the time Jericho was first settled in the Jordan Valley, 11,500 years ago.

Figure 2 is a detail from figure 1 of the period from 60,000 to 75,000 years ago.

This period is a perfect example of what happens in a cold period (we die) versus what happens in a warm period (we thrive). In a span of 4000 years, mankind went from a severe population bottle-neck, to spreading across three continents.
15,000 years later, about 50,000 years ago, another warm spell triggered a further migration to what is now New Guinea and Australia. All through this period, and for much of the last glaciated phase, sea levels were much lower than today, as much as 120 meters lower, joining islands and continents with dry land. Except for the migration to Australia, this meant that ships and rafts were not necessary for these migrations. Walking sufficed.
About 40,000 years ago, another super volcano erupted, Archiflegreo on the Italian coast. This triggered another 1000-year cold spell, putting more pressure on our neighbors in Europe and Western Asia, Homo Neanderthalensis. After many cycles of warm and cold, even though they were cold-adapted, their population finally collapsed 30,000 years ago.
15,000 years ago, the last great migration, that of the ancestors of the Amerindians to the New World, took place during a period nearly as warm as at present, but before the great ice sheets had melted sufficiently for Beringia to be flooded. Beringia is the continental shelf in the Bering Sea joining Asia and North America, now under 50 to 100 meters of cold sea water.

Figure 3 is a map of Beringia 21,000 years ago. Source here.
The great migrations, out of Africa, the crossing into New Guinea/Australia, the migration into the New World, were all made possible by warm, wet, periods during an ice age. When it is cold and arid, we huddle in our caves, starve and freeze. When it is warm, we multiply, innovate, and go on the move. When possible, we move to warmer and more hospitable climes, or at least empty areas. From Beringia, we populated North America and expanded to South America in about a thousand years. Just like today, when we move to Arizona or Florida, southern France or Spain.
