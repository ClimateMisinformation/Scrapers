"Australia has experienced its hottest two years on record and high temperatures are set to continue through winter in a clear sign of climate change, a report warns. May 2012 to April 2014 was the hottest 24-month period ever recorded in Australia, but that is likely to be eclipsed by the two years between June 2012 and May 2014, according to the Climate Commission's latest report, Abnormal Autumn.  ""We have just had an abnormally warm autumn, off the back of another very hot 'angry summer',"" Professor Will Steffen of the Climate Council said. ""The past two-year period has delivered the hottest average temperature we have ever recorded in Australia. ""Climate change is here, it's happening, and Australians are already feeling its impact."" The average temperature across Australia in April was 1.11C above the long-term average, the report says, citing Bureau of Meteorology figures. The average minimum temperature was 1.31C above normal. Unseasonable temperatures in the autumn ""warm wave"" set records, with Sydney, Adelaide and Melbourne setting benchmarks for the consecutive number of May days when the mercury reached 20C or higher. In its report, the Climate Council says the abnormally warm weather in April and May ""are part of a longer-term trend towards hotter conditions in the summer months and more warm spells in autumn and winter"". It says each of the 12-month periods ending in January, February, March and April 2014 have been record warm periods for Australia, with May figures on track to also be a new high. ""Such records are consistent with the ongoing global and Australia-wide, multi-decadal trends towards a hotter climate,"" the report says. Meteorologists predict a high likelihood that Australia will experience an El Nino event – characterised by below-average rainfall in the east and south – in coming months. The Climate Council says an El Nino could worsen the impact of climate change, leading to hotter, drier weather. The Climate Council is a crowd-funded, independent organisation created by the members of the former Climate Commission, which was axed by the Coalition government when it came to power in 2013."
"The prime minister has signalled support for an international move to crack down on large companies shifting their profits around to minimise paying tax. Tony Abbott, speaking at the New York stock exchange, said, “You cannot love jobs and hate the entities that create them”, and chose his words carefully when talking about corporate tax minimisation, saying he thought most countries could agree they did not want to see international tax minimisation.  “I am not saying that it is easy to resolve it but I think the broad principle should be that, generally speaking, people should pay tax in the countries where they make the money,” he said. “People should pay tax where they raise their revenue and I think that is the kind of principle that all of us can agree on. We have now got to try to build a system of rules that fairly puts that into practice.” Asked if his comments were aimed at companies such as Apple and Google, Abbott replied he did not want to “pick fights”.  International tax minimisation is expected to be on the agenda of the G20 in Brisbane in November; the issue remains a hot topic among the countries. Earlier this year, at the meeting of the G20 finance ministers in Sydney, a global standard for the worldwide automatic exchange of tax information was agreed to. Abbott sidestepped another question about whether he had concerns about the way markets were regulated and “ordinary” investors were protected. He said there was always a balance between freedom and protections that was never at one time perfectly achieved. “If we over-protect people and limit freedom, we will damage our economic future. If we under-protect people we will damage our economic future. So, this is the kind of judgment that sensible people make from time to time,” he said. In his opening remarks Abbott showed strong support for the private sector. “I want to make this very strong point: you cannot love jobs and hate the entities that create jobs. You cannot have a strong economy without strong and profitable private businesses because private businesses are the engine of job creation,” he said. When asked who he was saying hated Australian business, Abbott responded: “The point I made was that it is impossible to love jobs and to hate the people who create jobs. That is the point I made. I’m not saying that any particular individuals are guilty but it is a very important point to make. If you want to see job creation, you have got to support the people who create jobs and the people who create jobs are strong and productive and profitable private business.” Abbott is visiting New York during an overseas tour which has taken him to France and Canada before North America. He attended a dinner at Rupert Murdoch’s private residence on Tuesday night local time. Abbott also addressed comments made by Hillary Clinton in her memoir, Hard Choices, that the former prime minister Julia Gillard experienced “outrageous sexism” while in office. “Prime minister Gillard faced all sorts of difficulties in her time as prime minister. Every prime minister faces all sorts of difficulties in his or her time as prime minister. I am not going to buy into what Hillary Clinton says in her book. I am sure she is more than capable of speaking for herself,” he said. Clinton is in New York promoting her book and Abbott said he hoped for a face-to-face meeting. He also reiterated his comments on climate action made in Canada, that an emissions trading scheme was not the way to address the issue, citing the economy as more important. “I don’t believe that the best way to improve the environment is to clobber the economy and I am not going to take climate-change action which does clobber the economy. We are not going to have any rearguard action in favour of a carbon tax or an emissions trading scheme in Australia. We’re going to take direct action to get our emissions down,” he said. “Climate change is a significant global issue; it is a very significant global issue. Is it the most important issue the world faces right now? I don’t believe so.”"

"In many areas of life there are clear early warnings if you are about to do something stupid or self-destructive. One of my favourites is the unambiguous sign that reads ‘Danger of death’.   You’ll find it on fences surrounding electricity substations, attached to the feet of pylons and slightly mysterious doors on the London Underground. Successful signage changes behaviour. Today we’re left in no doubt that if you smoke you will rot from within and be cursed by your children. Drink drive and you will be compulsorily transported back in time to the 1970s. Some warnings can however seem redundant. Such as when you buy a hot tea or coffee and the cup alerts you to the fact that the liquid it contains may be hot. But where, for example in the midst of Britain’s much hyped oil shale and gas boom, is the sign hung on the economy that reads: ""Continued belief in the possibility of indefinite fossil-fuel-powered economic growth will wreck civilisation?"" Its conspicuous absence means vital decisions get debated in a vacuum. It was bad enough that Heathrow airport announced its climate busting expansion plans on the day the world learned of the likely inevitable break-up of the West Antarctic ice sheet. Debating aviation growth without addressing climate change is a bit like jumping out of a plane and forgetting about gravity.  As a result, over time, the map of the world will be rewritten and vast coastal populations be forced to relocate (many of the world’s mega-cities from New York to Mumbai are by the sea). Worse was that we were warned of that likelihood back in 1978 by J Mercer and chose to ignore it. Now it seems that without some extraordinary turnaround, the ice will groan for years in lamentation like nature’s Greek chorus at our folly and hubris. But even when the writing on the wall does get read, there’s no guarantee that someone won’t bang our heads against it. Shell produced a briefing in a tortuous attempt to convince its shareholders that the company faced no threat from having a huge chunk of its fossil fuel reserves branded unusable – or as ""stranded assets"". The very real challenge comes because climate science tells us that about 80% of known reserves must remain in the ground. Cleverly Shell manages to acknowledge the generally accepted (if too conservative) 2C target as a danger threshold for warming in the same sentence that it dismisses it, positioning itself as one of many who see no chance of it being met. In which case, of course, their reasoning flows with perfect self-fulfilling prophecy, what would be the point of acting to ensure that it could be met? As further justification to read but dismiss the writing on the wall, it cites the International Energy Agency’s projections for a massive increase in fossil fuel use. It conveniently omits that these scenarios all put the world on course for climate catastrophe. Their argument is that the global economy will need oil because it fuels development. They don’t mention the endemic corruption and environmental destruction that mark the sector and which leaves countries more cursed than developed.  The former mayor of Bogota, Enrique Peñalosa, captured perhaps a better vision of development when he said that progress was not when the poor had cars, but when the rich used public transport. Another case in which warnings were so unwelcome that the wall practically fell on the writer was the historic $19bn (£11bn) ruling against Chevron over liability for decades of damage in Ecuador. Speaking recently at the Hay Festival a key lawyer involved in bringing the case, Steven Donziger, described how, not only had the oil company fought with countless lawyers and PR firms, to avoid paying (successfully so far), but also aggressively pursued many of the people who helped the case come to court. That’s an extreme counter-signal: dare to do the right thing and you will be punished. But there are plenty of others creating a confusion of signs worthy of Times Square or Piccadilly Circus. The flip side is: do the wrong thing and you will be rewarded. In May, the man once in charge of BP, Tony Hayward, who implied that the Deepwater Horizon disaster was just a drop in the ocean of the Gulf of Mexico, saw his career advance by being made chairman of the mining and commodities corporate giant Glencore Xstrata. There’s a more difficult category in which signs are seen, yet considered not to matter, or other fantastical ones come into view which eclipse reality altogether. Interviewed about renewed interest in rising inequality since the publication of Thomas Piketty’s book, Capital, the neo-liberal economist Andrew Lilico responded on the BBC Today Programme that inequality simply ""didn’t matter"". In a subsequent social media exchange he went on to make the exotic claim that material resources were effectively ""infinite"", before promptly vanishing from Twitter. Perhaps the most trusted gambit relied on when all the signs point toward the overwhelming need for change in your sector is the economic equivalent of flipping the bird: threaten to leave the country. Bankers do it constantly, still. And the lack of financial re-regulation in the UK suggests that, however hollow, it works.  Rent seeking is the best term in economics to describe the economy of recent years and the rise of the ‘1%.’ It is obtaining gain without reciprocal benefits to broader society. Private landlords gave us the phrase and, with new controls proposed over literal and metaphorical rent seeking, they have also started to threaten an exodus. Most recently this threat-of-choice has been used by Cuadrilla, the company pushing development of shale gas in Britain. As The Times neatly put it, Cuadrilla has, ""threatened to pull out unless the law is changed to allow it to drill under people’s homes without their permission."" Recent estimates suggest that as little as 1% of some stated shale oil reserves and only 10% of gas may be recoverable. But, unintentionally, Cuadrilla may just have sent the best and clearest sign yet for a rather different change of energy policy that every householder in Britain can understand and cannot ignore."
"President Barack Obama will unveil a plan on Monday that will cut carbon pollution from power plants and promote cap-and-trade, undertaking the most significant action on climate change in American history. The proposed regulations Obama will launch at the White House on Monday could cut carbon pollution by as much as 25% from about 1,600 power plants in operation today, according to those claiming familiarity with the plan. Power plants are the country's single biggest source of carbon pollution – responsible for up to 40% of the country's emissions. The rules, which were drafted by the Environmental Protection Agency and are under review by the White House, are expected to do more than Obama, or any other president, has done so far to reduce the carbon dioxide emissions responsible for climate change. They will put America on course to meet its international climate goal, and put US diplomats in a better position to leverage climate commitments from big polluters such as China and India, Obama said in a speech to West Point graduates this week. “I intend to make sure America is out front in a global framework to preserve our planet,” he said. “American influence is always stronger when we lead by example. We can not exempt ourselves from the rules that apply to everyone else.” It won't be without a fight. Obama went on in his remarks at West Point to take a shot at Republicans who deny climate change is occurring, and the White House press secretary, Jay Carney, on Thursday accused critics of making “doomsday claims” about the costs of cutting carbon. But the White House still showed some signs of nervousness about a political backlash, releasing a report about expanded oil and gas production on Obama's watch and adding to the furious spinning by environmental and industry groups about the potential costs and benefits of the EPA regulations.  “We actually see this … as the Super Bowl of climate politics,” said Peter Altman, director of the climate and clean air campaign for the Natural Resources Defense Council, which produced a model carbon-cutting plan that has helped guide the EPA regulations. But if all unfolds according to plan, Obama will have succeeded in overcoming blanket opposition – and outright climate denial in many cases – from Republicans and some Democrats in Congress, an industry-funded misinformation campaign, and a slew of anticipated lawsuits. Obama had originally hoped to cut carbon pollution by moving a bill through Congress. Four years after that effort fell apart, campaigners say the EPA rules could deliver significant emissions cuts – near the 17% Obama proposed at the Copenhagen climate summit – and the cap-and-trade programmes that were so reviled by Republicans. The EPA, using its authority under the Clean Air Act, proposed the first rule phase, covering future power plants, last September. In this the more politically contentious phase of the plan, it is widely believed the EPA will depart from the “inside the fence-line” convention of earlier environmental regulations for mercury and other pollutants, which focused on emissions-scrubbing on specific power plants. The EPA administrator, Gina McCarthy, is seeking steep reductions – as much as 25% – but she has hinted repeatedly that she will allow states latitude in how they reach those targets. The plan would allow electricity companies to reduce pollution by shutting down the oldest and most polluting coal plants. They can install carbon-sucking retrofits. They can expand wind and solar energy, upgrade the electrical grid, encourage customers to update to more efficient heating and cooling systems, or more efficient appliances and lightbulbs. “They have recognised huge emissions reductions opportunities are often cheaper than trying to do it all inside the plant,” said David Doniger, who heads the climate programme at the NRDC. “If you want to get substantial reductions and you want to get it economically, you have to take into account a system-wide approach.” The EPA to expected to try to soften the impact of the regulations by coming out with a range of targets, taking account of the energy mix in different states, and by allowing a two-step phase-in of the targets, with steeper cuts delayed until 2030. But campaigners and industry are bracing for a fight. The Chamber of Commerce, one of the major opponents of the environmental regulations, said in a report on Wednesday the EPA regulations would cost $51bn a year in higher electricity prices and lost jobs and investment – but those figures were disputed. Coal mining companies, power plant operators that are heavily dependent on coal, attorney generals in about a dozen Republican-controlled states, and conservative think tanks also argue the system-wide approach oversteps the EPA's authority, and are lining up for legal challenges. “I suspect we will see more environmental litigation as it relates to CO2 emissions going forward from a variety of sources,” said Karen Harbert, who heads the Chamber's energy institute. America's carbon dioxide emissions have been falling over the last few years to the lowest levels since the 1990s, because of a switch from coal to cheaper natural gas, and on a smaller scale increased investment in renewables. The economic downturn also reduced demand for electricity. The White House said those changes – which were mainly market-driven – showed the EPA regulations would not hurt the economy as critics claim. “We can transform our energy system to be less carbon intensive while still growing the economy,” Obama's counsellor, John Podesta, told a conference call. The EPA rules would fix those reductions in place and – as several campaigners and energy analysts noted – be a relatively easy reach for a large number of states which have already moved to cut emissions and expand wind and solar power. More than 30 states already have regulations promoting renewable energy. Minnesota and Colorado are pledged to get 30% of their power from renewables by 2020. Meanwhile, nine north-eastern states and California are already rewarding power companies which cut carbon through operating cap-and-trade systems. Those changes in the energy landscape – and an intense outreach campaign by McCarthy and other officials – could defuse of the opposition, said Paul Bledsoe, an energy consultant who served on Bill Clinton's climate change task force. “I think there is a divide between the companies,” he said. “Coal heavy companies are going to fight it tooth and nail, especially behind the scenes, legally. The more gas, nuclear and renewable-heavy companies are going to be more sanguine about it.” The EPA rules could also end up vastly expanding regional cap-and-trade programmes. Kelly Speakes-Backman, who heads the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative in the north-east, said she had already had quiet approaches from a number of state officials. She said the nine states in RGGI had already cut carbon dioxide emissions 40% from 2005 levels, and were aiming to halve carbon pollution by 2020. The new EPA rules would be a “game-changer” for cap-and-trade. Once Obama makes his announcement on Monday, the clock starts ticking. The EPA will have one year to take public comment from anyone from Greenpeace to Peabody Coal before finalising the new standards in June 2015. Once those rules are final, the states will have one year, or until June 2016, to submit their plans for meeting the new EPA targets. With Obama's term ending in January 2017, those are tight deadlines – especially with the legal and political battles ahead. But it does put Obama in position to fulfill the promises he made on climate change when he was first elected in 2008. “This whole suite of policies is getting us within shooting range of where we could have been with a cap-and-trade bill,” said Vicki Arroyo, who heads the climate centre at Georgetown University law school. “If the EPA is really restructuring programmes to take advantage of systems wide benefits … then that is just huge.”"

"The US House of Representatives Congressional Committee on Science, Space, and Technology held a hearing on the IPCC process last Thursday. The Republicans on the committee invited three witnesses to speak (Richard Tol, Daniel Botkin, and Roger Pielke Sr.), while the Democrats were allowed one witness (Michael Oppenheimer). The focus during the hearing shifted several times to the 97% expert consensus on human caused global warming; committee chairman Lamar Smith (R-TX) even included some inaccurate statements denying the consensus in his opening remarks. The witnesses generally focused on the subject at hand – the IPCC process – during their prepared testimonies, but Rep. Rohrabacher (R-CA) asked them in the question and answer session about the 97% expert consensus that humans are the main cause of global warming.  Richard Tol answered first, but his answer probably didn't satisfy Rohrabacher. Tol admitted, ""I mean it's pretty clear that most of the science agrees that climate change is real and most likely human-made"" Tol has also previously acknowledged, ""The consensus is of course in the high nineties"" However, while he admits it's real, Tol quibbles whether the consensus is precisely 97%. Ever since my colleagues and I published our consensus study a year ago, Tol has seemed determined to find fault with it. He submitted a critique to the journal that published our paper, Environmental Research Letters. However, the journal rejected Tol's comment twice, finding it unsuitable for publication. The peer-review referee comments are available on Tol's blog, saying for example,  ""Rather than contribute to the discussion, the paper instead seems oriented at casting doubt on the Cook paper, which is not appropriate to a peer-reviewed venue, and has a number of important flaws ... Many of the claims in the abstract and conclusion are not supported by the author’s analyses."" These comments are consistent with Tol's own admission that he took a ""destructive"" approach toward our paper rather than try and replicate our results. We even went as far as to create a public webpage where anybody can review and rate the same abstracts as we did to make replication as easy as possible. In fact, the Environmental Research Letters reviews included 24 critiques and suggestions regarding how Tol could improve his paper. Tol reports that after two additional rejections, he finally found a journal to publish his paper. It will be interesting to see if he addressed the 24 Environmental Research Letters reviewer critiques, or if he simply shopped a flawed paper around until finding a publisher willing to overlook its shortcomings. Nevertheless, Tol accepts that the expert consensus on human-caused global warming is real. It was thus a bit of an own-goal for the Republican committee members to invite him and inquire about the consensus, given that they seem determined to deny that it exists.  Based on their post-hearing press release, the Republicans on the committee seem satisfied believing that our study ""has been debunked,"" and Tol made several unfounded claims disparaging our study during the question and answer session. He did however make one accurate statement, ""The 97% estimate is bandied about by basically everybody."" Due to the fact that the general public is largely unaware of the expert consensus on human-caused global warming, and people are more likely to accept the science and support action to address the problem if they're aware of the consensus, it's a very important fact. Our study is the most comprehensive quantification of this expert consensus to date, so not surprisingly it's been ""bandied about"" widely: Retweet if you agree it's time to #ActOnClimate. pic.twitter.com/xZxi6KdInY In reality, 97% of scientists agree that we face serious human generated climate change http://t.co/soQCnJB61B It remains to be seen whether Tol can substantiate his accusations about our research. The expert referees who reviewed previous versions of his paper found that he had failed to do so. In any case, whether the number is 97% or 96% or 98%, Tol acknowledges that the overwhelming scientific consensus is a reality, probably to the chagrin of the Republican committee members who invited him to testify. Now we just need those policymakers to accept the reality of human-caused global warming and join the debate regarding what we should do about it."

"The Obama administration will propose sweeping new environmental rules on Monday, cutting carbon pollution from existing power plants by 30% over 2005 levels by 2030, according to people briefed on the plan. The new power plant rules – which will be formally announced by the Environmental Protection Agency on Monday morning – represent the most ambitious effort by Barack Obama or any other president to deal with climate change.  The regulations could lead to a sweeping transformation of America's energy economy, if they survive an onslaught from business and conservative groups, and Republicans in Congress. The rules could also break open negotiations for a global climate change deal, the United Nations climate chief, Christiana Figueres, said. The 30% target, first reported by the Wall Street Journal, represents the first attempt by any president to regulate carbon pollution from power plants. Obama had initially sought to deal with climate change through Congress. But after that effort collapse, and with Republicans in Congress uniformly opposed to cutting carbon emissions – or even denying climate change was occuring – Obama decided last year to use his executive authority to cut carbon pollution. The White House and the EPA would not comment on the report. Power plants are the largest single source of carbon pollution, accounting for nearly 40% of the emissions that cause climate change. Obama, in his weekly radio address on Saturday, said it was past time to set national limits on carbon dioxide emissions – just as the EPA has done for years with arsenic, mercury and other toxins. “Right now there are no national limits to the amount of carbon pollution that existing plants can pump into the air we breathe. None,” he said. “They can dump unlimited amounts of carbon pollution into the air. It's not smart, it's not safe, and it doesn't make sense.” Carbon dioxide emissions from power plants had been falling since 2005, because of the economic downturn and because of the switch from coal to cheaper natural gas. Ethan Zindler of Bloomberg New Energy Finance said the power industry was already about a third of the way towards the 30% goal. But emissions crept up last year and again in the first months of 2014, and the regulations would put America on course for long term and lasting cuts to carbon pollution. Andrew Steer, the chief executive of the World Resources Institute, said it was a “momentous development” for America's efforts to deal with climate change. “It's the most important action available to cut US emissions – and the Obama administration has seized the opportunity,” he said. “These new standards send a powerful message around the world that it's time to face the global threat of climate change.” The rules could affect some 1,600 power plants. About 600 of these operate on coal, including many that are nearly 50 years old and will have the most difficulty meeting the new standards. Under the rule, states and power companies will have a range of options to meet the new standards: switching from coal to cleaner-burning natural gas; forming cap-and-trade markets; expanding renewables such as wind and solar power; or encouraging customers to use less energy by moving to more efficient heating and cooling systems and appliances.  That's a departure for the EPA, which generally has focused on curbing emissions from specific smoke stacks. But the Natural Resources Defense Council, which produced models that helped guide the EPA, said a system-wide approach would make it easier and cheaper for power companies to reach the new standard. The 30% national target will not be applied uniformly across the country. The EPA will set individual reductions targets for each state, taking into account their energy mix, according to those briefed on the plan.  States have until 2016 to come up with a strategy for meeting the targets. However, the EPA rules will not come into force in all states until 2020, according to one individual briefed on the plan. “They are not going to spread it out smoothly all over the place like creamy peanut butter,” said Vicky Arroyo, who heads the climate centre at the George University law school. “It's going to be more lumpy than that. Some states will have less ambitious targets, and some states will have more.” The idea is to take account of the available energy sources in each state, as well as the measures some states have already undertaken to cut carbon pollution. North-eastern states have already cut their power plant emissions by 40% compared with 2005. Arroyo said it was possible the rule could bring about the same level of reductions in carbon pollution as a climate change bill that was defeated by Congress five years ago. The new EPA rule bypasses Congress, relying on Obama's executive authority and Supreme Court decisions, to propose new rules under the Clean Air Act. The Chamber of Commerce, the country's biggest business lobby, said last week the new rules would cost the economy $51bn and put 224,000 people out of work. Coal-mining companies, some power companies and Republican state officials have accused the EPA of overstepping its authority, and will be studying the bill closely for possible legal challenges. In their rebuttal to Obama's radio address, the Republicans said the new standards would ""kill coal"" and lead to power outages.  ""We'll all be paying a lot more money for electricity – if we can get it,"" said Wyoming senator Mike Enzi. But Obama has been marshalling his own supporters. Environmental and public health groups have been pushing hard for the new rules. Researchers from Harvard and Syracuse universities put out a study last week saying that curbs on carbon pollution would also reduce smog and soot, avoiding premature deaths from heart attacks and lung disease. That campaign effort is due to pick up again on Monday. Obama is scheduled to hold a conference call with the American Lung Association and other public health groups on Monday afternoon. White House officials spent Sunday briefing governors and business leaders about the new rule."

"Let us imagine that in 3030BC the total possessions of the people of Egypt filled one cubic metre. Let us propose that these possessions grew by 4.5% a year. How big would that stash have been by the Battle of Actium in 30BC? This is the calculation performed by the investment banker Jeremy Grantham. Go on, take a guess. Ten times the size of the pyramids? All the sand in the Sahara? The Atlantic ocean? The volume of the planet? A little more? It's 2.5 billion billion solar systems. It does not take you long, pondering this outcome, to reach the paradoxical position that salvation lies in collapse.  To succeed is to destroy ourselves. To fail is to destroy ourselves. That is the bind we have created. Ignore if you must climate change, biodiversity collapse, the depletion of water, soil, minerals, oil; even if all these issues miraculously vanished, the mathematics of compound growth make continuity impossible. Economic growth is an artefact of the use of fossil fuels. Before large amounts of coal were extracted, every upswing in industrial production would be met with a downswing in agricultural production, as the charcoal or horse power required by industry reduced the land available for growing food. Every prior industrial revolution collapsed, as growth could not be sustained. But coal broke this cycle and enabled – for a few hundred years – the phenomenon we now call sustained growth. It was neither capitalism nor communism that made possible the progress and pathologies (total war, the unprecedented concentration of global wealth, planetary destruction) of the modern age. It was coal, followed by oil and gas. The meta-trend, the mother narrative, is carbon-fuelled expansion. Our ideologies are mere subplots. Now, with the accessible reserves exhausted, we must ransack the hidden corners of the planet to sustain our impossible proposition. On Friday, a few days after scientists announced that the collapse of the west Antarctic ice sheet is now inevitable, the Ecuadorean government decided to allow oil drilling in the heart of the Yasuni national park. It had made an offer to other governments: if they gave it half the value of the oil in that part of the park, it would leave the stuff in the ground. You could see this as either blackmail or fair trade. Ecuador is poor, its oil deposits are rich. Why, the government argued, should it leave them untouched without compensation when everyone else is drilling down to the inner circle of hell? It asked for $3.6bn and received $13m. The result is that Petroamazonas, a company with a colourful record of destruction and spills, will now enter one of the most biodiverse places on the planet, in which a hectare of rainforest is said to contain more species than exist in the entire continent of North America. The UK oil firm Soco is now hoping to penetrate Africa's oldest national park, Virunga, in the Democratic Republic of Congo; one of the last strongholds of the mountain gorilla and the okapi, of chimpanzees and forest elephants. In Britain, where a possible 4.4 billion barrels of shale oil has just been identified in the south-east, the government fantasises about turning the leafy suburbs into a new Niger delta. To this end it's changing the trespass laws to enable drilling without consent and offering lavish bribes to local people. These new reserves solve nothing. They do not end our hunger for resources; they exacerbate it. The trajectory of compound growth shows that the scouring of the planet has only just begun. As the volume of the global economy expands, everywhere that contains something concentrated, unusual, precious, will be sought out and exploited, its resources extracted and dispersed, the world's diverse and differentiated marvels reduced to the same grey stubble. Some people try to solve the impossible equation with the myth of dematerialisation: the claim that as processes become more efficient and gadgets are miniaturised, we use, in aggregate, fewer materials. There is no sign that this is happening. Iron ore production has risen 180% in 10 years. The trade body Forest Industries tells us that ""global paper consumption is at a record high level and it will continue to grow"". If, in the digital age, we won't reduce even our consumption of paper, what hope is there for other commodities? Look at the lives of the super-rich, who set the pace for global consumption. Are their yachts getting smaller? Their houses? Their artworks? Their purchase of rare woods, rare fish, rare stone? Those with the means buy ever bigger houses to store the growing stash of stuff they will not live long enough to use. By unremarked accretions, ever more of the surface of the planet is used to extract, manufacture and store things we don't need. Perhaps it's unsurprising that fantasies about colonising space – which tell us we can export our problems instead of solving them – have resurfaced. As the philosopher Michael Rowan points out, the inevitabilities of compound growth mean that if last year's predicted global growth rate for 2014 (3.1%) is sustained, even if we miraculously reduced the consumption of raw materials by 90%, we delay the inevitable by just 75 years. Efficiency solves nothing while growth continues. The inescapable failure of a society built upon growth and its destruction of the Earth's living systems are the overwhelming facts of our existence. As a result, they are mentioned almost nowhere. They are the 21st century's great taboo, the subjects guaranteed to alienate your friends and neighbours. We live as if trapped inside a Sunday supplement: obsessed with fame, fashion and the three dreary staples of middle-class conversation: recipes, renovations and resorts. Anything but the topic that demands our attention. Statements of the bleeding obvious, the outcomes of basic arithmetic, are treated as exotic and unpardonable distractions, while the impossible proposition by which we live is regarded as so sane and normal and unremarkable that it isn't worthy of mention. That's how you measure the depth of this problem: by our inability even to discuss it. Twitter: @georgemonbiot. A fully referenced version of this article can be found at Monbiot.com"
"Barack Obama took personal charge of the campaign for historic new climate change regulations on Monday, defending a 30% cut in carbon pollution from power plants from a backlash by business lobbies, conservative groups and Democrats in oil and coal states. The new rules, unveiled by the Environmental Protection Agency, would cut carbon pollution from power plants 30% from 2005 levels by 2030.  They represent the first time Obama, or any other US president, has moved to regulate carbon pollution from power plants – the largest single source of carbon dioxide emissions – and supporters said they could help put America on a path to a clean energy economy and unlock a global deal to end climate change. But they also set in motion an epic battle for the mid-term elections. A Washington Post-ABC news opinion poll on Monday found 70% of Americans supporting regulation of power plants. But the Republican leadership still came out en masse against the rule, with the minority leader, Mitch McConnell – who comes from coal state Kentucky – slamming the new rules as “a dagger in the heart of the American middle class”. Obama, in his first public comments on the new rules, urged supporters to ignore the “naysayers” and “misinformation” and help build support for the EPA's power plant rules. “This is something that is important for all of us. As parents, as grandparents, as citizens, as folks who care about the health of our families and also want to make sure that future generations are able to enjoy this beautiful blue ball in the middle of space that we’re a part of,” he told a conference call hosted by the American Lung Association.” The EPA said the new rules would help deliver on Obama's promise to act on climate change – while assuring reliable and affordable power. European and United Nations diplomats said the rules would take America within striking distance of Obama's commitment to the international community to cut the country's overall emissions 17% by 2020 – and could shake out additional commitments from big emitters like China and India. ""This represents real leadership,” said Lord Stern, the climate economist. America's 1,600 power plants are responsible for nearly 40% of the country's carbon dioxide emissions – with a disproportionate share of carbon pollution generated by a relatively small number of ageing coal plants. The rules – which now undergo 120 days of public comment before they are finalised a year from now – were designed for a 30% cut in the national average of carbon pollution from power plants. The 30% national target will not be applied uniformly across the country. The EPA administrator, Gina McCarthy, said the the targets would be “customised” to reflect the energy mix of each state. The EPA is also granting states more time – which means the plans will not come into effect in some states until long after Obama has left office. “There’s no one-size-fits-all solution. States can pick from a portfolio of options,” she said in a speech at EPA headquarters. “”It’s up to states to mix and match to get to their goal.” States and power companies can retrofit existing power plants to make coal less polluting, switch from coal to cleaner-burning natural gas, expand renewables such as wind and solar power, or encourage customers to use less electricity. They can also join regional cap-and-trade systems, McCarthy said. “They can hang out with other states, and join up with a multi-state market based program.” The new rules were not as ambitious as some environmental groups had hoped, largely because of the EPA's decision to compare the cuts with carbon pollution levels in 2030. America's carbon pollution has fallen since 2005 – largely because of a flood of cheap natural gas produced by fracking – and the country is already a third of the way towards meeting the national average of a 30% cut in emissions. Some states, especially those in the north-east, have already exceeded the standard. EPA officials in a conference call with reporters admitted that even by 2030 coal and natural gas will still be the country's leading energy sources, with renewables accounting for just 9%. That's only a sliver higher than renewables' share of the energy mix now, at about 6%. Even so, reaction from mainstream environmental groups to the new power plant rules ranged from “momentous” to “historic”. Al Gore said the new rules were “the most important step taken to combat the climate crisis in our country's history”. Michael Brune, the director of the Sierra Club, told The Guardian the new rules would probably spur a far greater expansion of renewable power sources than the EPA envisaged. Erich Pica, the president of Friends of the Earth, said the new EPA standard – while historic – still did not go far enough. “This is the most any president has done to regulate climate change in US history,” he told The Guardian. “The problem is that previous ambition has been really low. We should be judging what the president is doing based on what the science said needs to be done and unfortunately this isn't nearly strong enough or aggressive enough.” But even with the full-on promotion campaign led by Obama, McCarthy, Democratic leadership in Congress, sustainable business networks, environmental and public health groups, the rules ran into an immediate tide of opposition on Monday from business lobbies, Republicans in Congress and even Democrats facing tough election battles. The coal industry – which will be hit hardest by the new rules – said the regulations would hurt the economy and lead to power outages. “If these rules are allowed to go into effect, the administration, for all intents and purposes, is creating America's next energy crisis,” the American Coalition for Clean Coal Electricity said. Democrats in conservative states who are facing tough races in these mid-terms also moved to distance themselves from the EPA rules. Alison Lundergan Grimes who is fighting to unseat McConnell in Kentucky said the rules were “more proof” Washington did not have the state's interest in mind. “When I’m in the US Senate, I will fiercely oppose the president’s attack on Kentucky’s coal industry because protecting our jobs will be my number one priority,” she said. Louisiana's Democratic Senator, Mary Landrieu, also opposed the regulations saying that it was not up to EPA to regulate carbon pollution. “This should not be achieved by EPA regulations,” she said in a statement. “Congress should set the terms, goals and timeframe.” Congress was Obama's first choice for climate action as well. But after attempts to move a climate bill collapsed in 2010 and Republicans in Congress as a bloc opposed cutting carbon pollution – with a strong contingent even acknowledging climate change was occurring – Congress was no longer an option. Obama decided last year to use his executive authority to cut carbon pollution. The EPA put out new rules for future power plants late last year, delivering the second installment of its plan to regulate the electricity sector on Monday."
"A new landmark scientific report drawing on the work of the world's leading mineral experts forecasts that industrial civilisation's extraction of critical minerals and fossil fuel resources is reaching the limits of economic feasibility, and could lead to a collapse of key infrastructures unless new ways to manage resources are implemented.  The peer-reviewed study – the 33rd Report to the Club of Rome – is authored by Prof Ugo Bardi of the Department of Earth Sciences at the University of Florence, where he teaches physical chemistry. It includes specialist contributions from fifteen senior scientists and experts across the fields of geology, agriculture, energy, physics, economics, geography, transport, ecology, industrial ecology, and biology, among others.  The Club of Rome is a Swiss-based global think tank founded in 1968 consisting of current and former heads of state, UN bureaucrats, government officials, diplomats, scientists, economists and business leaders.  Its latest report, to be released on 12th June, conducts a comprehensive overview of the history and evolution of mining, and argues that the increasing costs of mineral extraction due to pollution, waste, and depletion of low-cost sources will eventually make the present structure of industrial civilisation unsustainable.  Much of the report's focus is on the concept of Energy Return on Energy Invested (EROEI), which measures the amount of energy needed to extract resources. While making clear that ""we are not running out of any mineral,"" the report finds that ""extraction is becoming more and more difficult as the easy ores are depleted. More energy is needed to maintain past production rates, and even more is needed to increase them."" As a consequence, despite large quantities of remaining mineral reserves:  ""The production of many mineral commodities appears to be on the verge of decline… we may be going through a century-long cycle that will lead to the disappearance of mining as we know it."" The last decade has seen the world shift to more expensive and difficult to extract fossil fuel resources, in the form of unconventional forms of oil and gas, which have much lower levels of EROEI than conventional oil. Even with technological breakthroughs in fracking and associated drilling techniques, this trend is unlikely to reverse significantly. A former senior executive in Australia's oil, gas and coal industry, Ian Dunlop, describes in the report how fracking can rise production ""rapidly to a peak, but it then declines rapidly, too, often by 80 to 95 percent over the first three years."" This means that often ""several thousand wells"" are needed for a single shale play to provide ""a return on investment."" The average EROEI to run ""industrial society as we know it"" is about 8 to 10. Shale oil and gas, tar sands, and coal seam gas are all ""at, or below, that level if their full costs are accounted for… Thus fracking, in energy terms, will not provide a source on which to develop sustainable global society."" The Club of Rome report also applies the EROEI analysis to extraction of coal and uranium. World coal production will peak by 2050 latest, and could peak as early as 2020. US coal production has already peaked, and future production will be determined largely by China. But rising domestic demand from the latter, and from India, could generate higher prices and shortages in the near future: ""Therefore, there is definitely no scope for substituting for oil and gas with coal."" As for global uranium supplies, the report says that current uranium production from mines is already insufficient to fuel existing nuclear reactors, a gap being filled by recovery of uranium military stockpiles and old nuclear warheads. While the production gap could be closed at current levels of demand, a worldwide expansion of nuclear power would be unsustainable due to ""gigantic investments"" needed. Report contributor Michael Dittmar, a nuclear physicist at CERN, the European Organisation for Nuclear Research, argues that despite large quantities of uranium in the Earth's crust, only a ""limited numbers of deposits"" are ""concentrated enough to be profitably mined."" Mining less concentrated deposits would require ""far more energy than the mined uranium could ultimately produce."" The rising costs of uranium mining, among other costs, has meant that nuclear power investment is tapering off. Proposals to extract uranium from seawater are currently ""useless"" because ""the energy needed to extract and process uranium from seawater would be about the same as the energy that could be obtained by the same uranium using the current nuclear technology."" Therefore within this decade, the report forecasts an ""unavoidable"" production decline from existing uranium mines. US Geological Survey data analysed by the report shows that chromium, molybdenum, tungsten, nickel, platinum-palladium, copper, zinc, cadmium, titanium, and tin will face peak production followed by declines within this century. This is because declared reserves are often ""more hypothetical than measured"", meaning the ""assumption of mineral bonanzas… are far removed from reality."" In particular, the report highlights the fate of copper, lithium, nickel and zinc. Physicist Prof Rui Namorado Rosa projects an ""imminent slowdown of copper availability"" in the report. Although production has grown exponentially, the grade of the minerals mined is steadily declining, lifting mining costs. 'Peak copper' is likely to hit by 2040, but could even occur within the next decade. Production of lithium production, presently used for batteries electric cars, would also be strained under a large-scale electrification of transport infrastructure and vehicles, according to contributor Emilia Suomalainen, an industrial ecologist of the University of Lausanne, Switzerland. Sustainable lithium production requires 80-100% recycling – currently this stands at less than 1%. Nickel and zinc, which are used to combat iron and steel corrosion and for electricity storage in batteries, also could face production peaks in just ""a few decades"" – though nickel might be extended some 80 years – according to engineer and metals specialist Philippe Bihoux:  ""The easily exploited part of the reserves has been already removed, and so it will be increasingly difficult and expensive to invest in and exploit nickel and zinc mines."" While substitution could help in many cases, it would also be costly and uncertain, requiring considerable investment. Perhaps the most alarming trend in mineral depletion concerns phosphorous, which is critical to fertilise soil and sustain agriculture. While phosphorous reserves are not running out, physical, energy and economic factors mean only a small percentage of it can be mined. Crop yield on 40 percent of the world's arable land is already limited by economical phosphorus availability.  In the Club of Rome study, physicist Patrick Dery says that several major regions of rock phosphate production – such as the island of Nauru and the US, which is the world's second largest producer – are post-peak and now declining, with global phosphorous supplies potentially becoming insufficient to meet agricultural demand within 30-40 years. The problem can potentially be solved as phosphorous can be recycled. A parallel trend documented in the report by Food and Agricultural Organisation (FAO) agronomist Toufic El Asmar is an accelerating decline in land productivity due to industrial agricultural methods, which are degrading the soil by as much as 50% in some areas. Prof Rajendra K. Pachauri, chairman of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), said that the report is ""an effective piece of work"" to assess the planet's mineral wealth ""within the framework of sustainability."" Its findings offer a ""valuable basis for discussions on mineral policy.""  But the window for meaningful policy action is closing rapidly. ""The main alarm bell is the trend in the prices of mineral commodities,"" Prof Bardi told me.  ""Prices have gone up by a factor 3-5 and have remained at these level for the past 5-6 years. They are not going to go down again, because they are caused by irreversible increases in production costs. These prices are already causing the decline of the less efficient economies (say, Italy, Greece, Spain, etc.). We are not at the inversion point yet, but close - less than a decade?""

"What term works better to communicate about our warming planet, ""climate change"" or ""global warming""? With the release of a new Yale study, the question has been rekindled, with blogs as diverse as FiveThirtyEight and Thinkprogress looking at the study and its implications.  The study, and the various commentary about it,  is interesting, not just because it finds that ""the terms global warming and climate change often mean different things to Americans—and activate different sets of beliefs, feelings, and behaviors, as well as different degrees of urgency about the need to respond"", but because it highlights why climate communication is so difficult. Just why is it so hard to talk about the climate? Harry Enten's FiveThirtyEight article is a good place to start, because it underscores the problem. The article explores the use by Democratic and Republican members of congress. Enten shows that despite the Yale study showing that Democratic voters responding better to the ""global warming"" terminology, Democrats in congress prefer to say ""climate change"". In fact, Republicans were more likely to say ""global warming"" than Democrats, which is the opposite of what the Yale study recommends. Enten also notes that the same phenomenon is found in US television, with Democratic-leaning shows like Hardball preferring ""climate change"" and Republican leaning shows like Hannity preferring ""global warming"". The Yale study showed that not only did Americans use the term global warming themselves, but they heard it more in public discourse, suggesting that despite Democrats politicians and media figures saying ""climate change"" more, it engages them less. Of course, there have been many studies, and the frustrating thing for climate communicators and campaigners is that they are often contradictory. For example, a study from 2011 showed that Republicans preferred ""climate change"" to ""global warming"" when endorsing the reality of the threat. Another study by EcoAmerica from 2009 suggested ""global warming"" be ditched and the phrase ""our deteriorating atmosphere"" be deployed to better engage ""soccer moms"" and ""environmental agnostics"". The awkward term never caught on, and neither has Joe Romm's preferred term ""hell or highwater"" or ""global weirding"" (coined by Friedman). Even the Australian Parliamentary Library has weighed in with a briefing paper on the topic, unhelpfully adding the UNFCCC's use of ""climate variability"" to the mix. The debate about terminology would be an interesting side note were not the issue so important. Global warming, or climate change if you prefer, is the greatest threat facing humankind this century. These seemingly innocuous phrases profoundly affect how people perceive the issues, assess the seriousness and support efforts to mitigate global warming. The complication is that although terminology is important, the manner and scale of influence is difficult to measure or understand. Yet, commentators and communicators often firmly come down on one side or the other, with staunch views about what works and what doesn't. (I use the terms interchangeably in this article and more generally in my articles for The Guardian.) A significant contributor to this is the illusion of asymmetric insight, a fascinating cognitive bias that helps explain, in my view, why climate communication is so diabolically difficult. Asymmetric insight is a phenomenon where someone believes they understand the reasons why other people do or believe things, while at the same time being skeptical that others could ever understand them. Research by academics Pronin, Ross, Kruger and Savitsky from 2001 into this phenomenon found that not only do you believe you understand hidden states in others far better than they know in you, but when this is expanded to groups, it's even more pronounced: The results showed liberals believed they knew more about conservatives than conservatives knew about liberals. The conservatives believed they knew more about liberals than liberals knew about conservatives. Both groups thought they knew more about their opponents than their opponents knew about themselves. This bias is commonplace and widespread, and definitely not confined to climate communication. During elections, we see this cognitive bias on display nightly by pundits and commentators who confidently explain that movements in polls can be explained because voters think one thing or another, or are responding to a recent event. When you hear statements like ""people support Obama's climate change policies because..."" or ""Democrats prefer the term 'global warming' because..."", you are seeing this bias. People, especially commentators, believe that they see the world how it really is, whereas most other people (especially those people who disagree with them) are deluded, ignorant or self-interested. The bias of asymmetric insight means that people are less likely to see others who disagree with them in nuanced or complex ways; simple things can explain complex and multifaceted changes in opinion or actions. Tying into the difficulty of climate communications is the fact that typically the people doing research into this field – and again, the same applies to other areas – are heavily invested in the area. Climate communicators mostly care deeply about the dangers of run-away climate change. The result is that they often underestimate the extent to which most people are ambivalent or uninterested in the issue. Because asking questions about peoples' attitudes on an issue will generally prompt a response, the disinterest and ambivalence is hidden, and so it is easy to assume that most people have a latent interest or concern about global warming, when in fact they probably don't. The ups and downs of climate polling in Australia for example appears to show an increase in the polarisation over the issue, but it is easy to over emphasise that when you're asking the question compared to large swathes of the community where the issue may rarely or never come up. The Yale study found that as many people ""use neither"" (35 percent) as use the term ""global warming"" (35 percent) and more than double that use ""climate change"" (15 percent). This suggests to me that as a communications challenge, regardless of the term used, the biggest barrier is disinterest, not the specific language being used. A lot of communications is done by heuristics, but even when hard numbers, in the form of polling, is brought to the equation, there is an enormous risk that judgemental shortcuts are used to interpret those numbers. Because we believe we can understand why people believe the things they do (while at the same time not believing that others could possibly understand us), it is easy to skew or ignore the results of research like the Yale study. As far back as 2003, Republican pollster Frank Luntz advocated Republicans use the term ""climate change"", ostensibly to give the Republicans cover against the far more effective term ""global warming"". The memo is worth reading even eleven years later, and the Yale study and many other studies over the last few years simply confirms much of what Luntz wrote then. And although Luntz highlights his ""words that work"", really what he does is build a context through which he can influence peoples' attitudes. Creating this context goes beyond the ""silver bullet"" of a single phrase by creating shared meaning. The Yale paper again underscores this, as I noted earlier: the terms ""global warming"" and ""climate change"" mean different things to different people. Just changing from one phrase to another without also shifting the context is unlikely to change attitudes. This would be as ineffective as the long-standing and fruitless focus on the ""deficit model"" of environmental communication. The diabolical challenge for climate communications is that we often think we are gaining valuable insights from research like the Yale study, but more likely we are succumbing to the illusion of asymmetric insight."

"There's something that kills 3,000 Australians a year. You probably won't have read about this significant danger. It's not cancer. It's not sharks, or drop bears, or funnel web spiders. And it's not car accidents or heroin overdoses.  It causes serious health problems for even more Australians each year, and for many people there is no ""safe"" level of exposure. It also targets disadvantaged (socially and economically) people the most. What is it? Air pollution. A new report from Environment Justice Australia, released on Wednesday, shows that 3000 people die prematurely from air pollution each year. According to EJA: Australia lacks an effective system of regulation for air pollution. The current system is based on a completely unsatisfactory arrangement that leaves important standards to protect health to be set by complex intergovernmental arrangements involving commonwealth, state and territory governments. This system is failing to adequately protect public health. It may be convenient for some to dismiss this as simply concerns from environmental do-gooders. But anti-carbon price crusader and federal environment minister Greg Hunt has acknowledged the problem, saying at a speech in March this year: At the very highest level, I would like to complete a National Clean Air Agreement by 1 July 2016. The Australian Institute of Health and Welfare estimated that urban air pollution was responsible for more than 3000 early deaths in 2003. This is a critical national issue and I would like it to be a signature objective of my watch. Particle (as particulate matter) and ozone pollution levels are of particular concern, with peak particulate matter levels frequently exceeding the current national air quality standard in most of Australia's metropolitan areas. Urbanisation and population growth, and the associated increases in transport demand and energy consumption, will likely result in increased emissions and poorer air quality despite the current air quality management frameworks in place. This is a remarkable statement, showing that the federal government is not only aware of this problem, but sees the solution as national regulation. Air pollution in Australia is woefully regulated and the current measures are utterly inadequate. The road toll in Australia in 2013 was 1193 people. Each state in Australia takes road safety so seriously that they have insurance schemes, who run massive, multimillion-dollar safety-awareness campaigns. Since 1788, according to Australian Geographic, just 194 people have died from shark attacks. Yet the Western Australian government introduced a shameful and mishandled shark cull, spending $5,700 a day on a ineffective policy. The 3,000 preventable deaths caused by air pollution should be a national scandal. Unfortunately, despite the fine words from Greg Hunt, the ""Commonwealth Government recently shut down the inter-governmental committee tasked with driving the national reform process to improve Australian air quality. It also announced that the National Plan for Clean Air that Commonwealth, State and Territory governments agreed in 2011 to establish would be delayed until July 2016."" The impacts of air pollution currently falls predominantly on the poor and disadvantaged. People living in close proximity to major roads, or large industrial facilities are particularly affected, as are many people in rural areas. Air pollution hotspots kill over 3000 Australians per year http://t.co/y0A0lOhK8Gpic.twitter.com/dF8zN3uZZS — Alexander White (@alexanderwhite) May 28, 2014 And it's not just Australia. Pollution in China is infamous, responsible for 172 deaths for every 100,000, and The Guardian reported that one in five deaths in the UK is linked to air pollution. The World Health Organization released a report in March this year that stated that ""air pollution caused more deaths worldwide than AIDS, diabetes and road injuries combined"" and is responsible for ""one in eight of total global deaths"". That's more than 7 million people a year in 2012 alone, making it the single largest environmental health risk on earth. The solution to this problem is clear. We need national air pollution laws with teeth that have real protection for everyday Australians, especially the most vulnerable and disadvantaged communities. Read the entire Environmental Justice Australia report here."
"Climate change may be the most significant long-term challenge facing the planet, Barack Obama has said in a newly aired TV interview, emphasising the growing differences with Tony Abbott who insists it is certainly not the most important issue facing the world. As Obama and Abbott prepare for their first formal meeting in Washington on Thursday, the differences between their positions on global warming are clearer than ever, and according to diplomatic sources the president will not seek to downplay them.  Obama’s remarks in an interview broadcast on US television on Tuesday night come as his administration increases its diplomatic push to achieve a successful new international agreement on greenhouse reduction efforts next year and unveils the detail of tough new rules to force reductions in emissions from US power stations. In an interview with New York Times columnist Thomas Friedman – conducted several weeks ago but broadcast in the finale of the Years of Living Dangerously series – Obama said “the science is compelling … if you profess leadership in this country at this moment in our history then you have to recognise that this is going to be one of the most significant long-term challenges, if not the most significant long-term challenge, that this country faces and the planet faces.” But in New York on Tuesday, Abbott had a different view. “Climate change is a significant global issue – it is a very significant global issue. Is it the most important issue the world faces right now? I don’t believe so. It is one of a number of significant issues that the world faces and we will do our bit. We will be a good international citizen. What we are not going to do is clobber our economy and cost jobs with things like a job-killing carbon tax.” Asked whether he ever felt like “going off like a roman candle” at climate deniers in Congress, Obama laughed and said: “Er...yeah”, but he added “the good news is that the public may get out ahead of some of these politicians, and I think that as the public starts seeing greater frequency of extreme weather events, as they start seeing what used to be 100-year storms happening every year or two and you start seeing the economics of inaction, then the public start thinking: ‘you know what, we are going to start rewarding politicians who start talking to us honestly about this problem’.” Abbott has downplayed the link between climate change and extreme weather events. For example during severe bushfires last year he said: ""Climate change is real, as I've often said, and we should take strong action against it … but these fires are certainly not a function of climate change – they're just a function of life in Australia."" When the executive secretary of the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change, Christiana Figueres, said the fires showed the world is ""already paying the price of carbon"", Abbott said “the official in question is talking through her hat"". US officials have been pushing for climate change to be included on the agenda for the G20 leaders meeting in Brisbane in November – as a way of building momentum towards a new global agreement – but Abbott has said that meeting is primarily about economics, although discussion of climate change may come up in discussions about energy efficiency. Long-serving Democrat Henry Waxman has also told ABC’s 7.30 that Australia was becoming a laggard on climate policy. Waxman, who was a co-sponsor of the 2009 bill to establish an emissions trading scheme in the US which failed to pass the Senate, told the program “as I understand it, Australia will go from being one of the great leaders in the world in tackling this problem, to one of the great laggers in addressing efforts to reducing the pollution that is threatening the planet that we're living on"". Abbott has said Obama’s policies were like Direct Action in that they don’t impose a carbon price, but according to Waxman the proposed Australian policy ""doesn't sound anything like what President Obama is proposing"" and such voluntary programs “never worked anywhere”. ""What President Obama is proposing ... is much closer to the existing Australian law and that's why I hope that Australian law is not reversed,"" he said. ""It would be a serious mistake for Australia to leave that policy and go to one that's voluntary,"" he added. Obama is also proposing all new coal and gas plants be required to fit carbon capture and storage, new emissions standards for heavy trucks, stronger energy efficiency standards for buildings and a renewable energy target for federal agencies. Some commentators have said the prime minister’s alliance with the Canadian prime minister, Stephen Harper, would help “dismantle” a push for a global agreement on carbon pricing, or that he is not at odds with Obama because the US is using “direct action” rather than a carbon price to force American power generators to reduce greenhouse emissions. In fact the UN meeting on the Framework Convention on Climate Change, scheduled for Paris late next year, is not tasked with forging an agreement on the mechanism to achieve emission reductions but rather with securing more ambitious pledges from countries about how far they will reduce their emissions after 2020. The Coalition’s Direct Action policy is designed to meet only the minimum target of a 5% reduction by 2020 – despite advice from the independent Climate Change Authority that preconditions for a higher target, which previously had bipartisan agreement, have been met. The Coalition has said it will participate in the Paris meeting but has not given any indication of what Australia’s post-2020 target will be, or how it will be determined. Australia’s policy is entirely voluntary. Companies can choose to bid into a series of “reverse auctions” for government funding. The new US policy requires power generation to reduce emissions by 30%, with states determining the mechanism by which they achieve this. States such as California which have emissions trading schemes will use them to achieve the goal. However, Obama praised Australia's gun laws as he lamented the lack of action by Congress on restricting the sale of firearms in the wake of another school shooting in the US.  During a question and answer session on Tumblr, the president said: ""Australia had a mass shooting, similar to Columbine or Newtown, and Australia said 'That's it, we're not seeing that again', and basically imposed very severe, tough gun laws,"" he said, referring to the 1996 Port Arthur massacre in Tasmania where 28-year-old Martin Bryant killed 35 people. ""They haven't had a mass shooting since,"" the president said. Abbott and Obama are likely to find more common ground on issues of defence, security and trade. The US vice-president, Joe Biden, will join Abbott and Obama at their meeting. Abbott has met possible a Republican presidential candidate, Jeb Bush, in New York and was due to have a private dinner with News Corp’s chairman, Rupert Murdoch, and senior executives."

"Tony Abbott, the prime minister, has cancelled his US meetings with the head of the International Monetary Fund, Christine Lagarde, and the president of the World Bank, Jim Yong Kim. Could it be he’s reluctant to have two more meetings with senior figures in the finance world who know climate change is a major economic issue? The prime minister’s refusal to put climate change on the G20 agenda is yet another sign that he doesn't understand the forces that will shape the next 30 years of global economic dialogue.  Lagarde and Kim have both declared climate change to be amongst the most serious threats to modern prosperity. As Lagarde said, ""we are subsidising the very behaviour that is destroying our planet, and on an enormous scale"". Kim has gone even further, calling for nations and individuals to divest from fossil fuels. He recently said, ""we can divest and tax that which we don’t want, the carbon that threatens development gains over the last 20 years … It’s simple self-interest. Every company, investor, and bank that screens new and existing investments for climate risk is simply being pragmatic.” Abbott’s fear of even discussing the impact of climate change on the Australian economy shows his ignorance of the issue. Massive changes are occurring in investment markets in Australia and around the world, missed by a prime minister with his head in the sand. Medium term economic growth forecasts - the very numbers that underpin the last few years of the federal budget - rely on international demand for Australian coal holding up. But when voters next go to the polls in 2016, we could be on the precipice of peak Chinese demand for Australian coal. This is a result of China’s policy responses to a combination of environmental, economic, and energy market factors. China is bringing on domestic supplies of coal, while at the same time investing billions in renewable energy and, as confirmed last week, working toward a limit on carbon pollution and a wide-reaching emissions trading scheme. The mining industry calls this a ""China-centric"" view that ignores the possibility that India’s rising demand for energy will put the Australian coal sector in good shape. In India, the price of solar has reduced by 65% over the last three years and Narendra Modi, the recently-elected prime minister, is a solar champion. During his time as the chief minister of Gujarat, Modi introduced India's first incentive program for commercial, large-scale solar, leading to an additional 900MW of solar capacity. Just as countries in Africa are leapfrogging fixed line telephones in favour of mobile phones, India looks set to leapfrog coal in its attempts to combat energy poverty. Modi's party, the BJP, have recently announced their commitment to bring solar power to every home in India over the next five years. Last week Abbott said Australia’s ""destiny"" is to bring cheap energy to the world. How is that possible, when the cheapest sources of Australian coal have already been found, dug up and exported? New coal projects in the Galilee Basin, for example, require a coal price of more than $100/tonne to be economically viable. With the current Australian coal price sitting closer to $72/tonne the prospects for the industry are not looking good. Abbott’s ignorance of the economics of coal and climate change means he isn’t adequately working on the important challenge of diversifying the Australian economy. Instead, his recent budget cut funding for science, research and innovation programs, while further propping up the mining industry via his failure to combat diesel fuel subsidies and his scrapping of the former Labor government’s mining tax. In doing so he is not only risking the future of our nation’s finances, but the retirement savings of superannuants as well. As the head of the OECD, José Ángel Gurría, recently said, “the looming choice may be either stranding those [fossil fuel] assets or stranding the planet.” He's right. The global movement toward renewable energy and regulating carbon pollution puts at risk the ability of major Australian companies to continue to dig up and export their fossil fuel reserves. This in turn risks their future cash flows and stock prices. Titans of the Australian Stock Exchange like BHP and Rio Tinto, and the federal treasury, have the most to lose from a significant decline in the prospects of Australian miners. Almost all Australians who have superannuation hold shares, through their super funds, in these companies. Abbott would do well to stop avoiding meetings with the head of the IMF and the World Bank. If he won't, he may find himself being schooled in climate change economics by Barack Obama, the US president, in their upcoming discussion. Perhaps Obama will tell our prime minister what he told Georgetown University students in July last year: “Invest. Divest. Remind folks there’s no contradiction between a sound environment and strong economic growth.”"
"Tony “conservationist” Abbott has been telling the Americans his government supports “strong action” on climate change. Sadly, every piece of available evidence says the opposite. First, his policy is a competitive government grants scheme in which participation by polluters is voluntary. As veteran US lawmaker Henry Waxman told the ABC this week: “That never worked anywhere.” Actually, we didn’t really need a US politician to tell us that. It was the advice of the 2007 Shergold report to the Howard government, which said carbon pricing was better because regulatory approaches would “impose a far heavier burden on economic activity"" and in 2010, when the auditor general was scathing about a similar competitive grants scheme run by the Howard and Rudd governments. Second, Abbott’s contention that his $2.5bn “Direct Action” plan is equivalent to a $40bn program if it were scaled up to US economy proportions is actually not proof that Australia is doing a lot (we are still aiming only for the bare minimum target of a 5% reduction in emissions by 2020) but instead clear evidence that Direct Action is an extremely expensive way to (maybe) achieve this modest emissions reduction. After Obama’s cap and trade scheme failed to make it through the Congress he is also using non-market ways to reduce emissions, mainly new rules and regulations, but not direct government handouts. The Coalition has also been warned about the costs of voluntary grants schemes. For example the “blue book” prepared by the Treasury for a possible incoming Coalition government in 2010 said “a market mechanism can achieve the necessary abatement at a cost per tonne of emissions that is far lower than alternative direct-action policies”. And Malcolm Turnbull made the same point in his speech to parliament after he was deposed as leader because of his support for an emissions trading scheme, when he said direct-action style schemes were “a recipe for fiscal recklessness on a grand scale” and “schemes where bureaucrats and politicians pick technologies and winners, doling out billions of taxpayers’ dollars, neither are economically efficient nor will be environmentally effective”. Third, the actual measure of “strong action” on climate change is how deeply countries are willing to cut their emissions, not how they get there. Before the election, Abbott and the environment minister, Greg Hunt, regularly restated a Coalition commitment to increase Australia's 2020 emissions reduction target to up to 25% under a specific set of conditions for global action set down in 2009 and accepted by both major parties. After the election the independent Climate Change Authority advised the conditions for a target higher than 5% had already been met, and when compared with the actions of other countries, 5% no longer represented a ""credible option"". But Abbott insisted; “Australia will meet our 5% emissions reduction target, but this government has made no commitments to go further than that. We certainly are in no way looking to make further binding commitments in the absence of very serious like binding commitments from other countries, and there is no evidence of that.” The Coalition now intends to abolish the Climate Change Authority. It has not said how it will decide on a post-2020 emissions reduction target ahead of the next big international meeting in Paris next year. Fourth, available modeling says $2.5bn is not enough to meet even the minimum 5% target and doing anything beyond that, which Australia obviously eventually must, would be prohibitively expensive. This is not government modelling, because the government hasn’t done any.  Modelling by Reputex climate analytics, commissioned by the environment group WWF-Australia, found that the money set aside by the Coalition to buy abatement was likely to fall short by $5.9bn a year between 2015 and 2020, or between $20bn and $35bn in total. Modeling by Sinclair Knight Merz/MMA and Monash University's Centre of Policy Studies, commissioned by the Climate Institute, which used assumptions more generous to the Coalition, found it would need at least another $4bn. Abbott has said if Direct Action falls short he will not allocate any more money. Fifth, the government is not only repealing the carbon price but also almost every other related government policy or program, including the Clean Energy Finance Corporation, the Australian Renewable Energy Agency and the Climate Commision, and has appointed a self-professed climate sceptic, businessman Dick Warburton, to review the renewable energy target, with a strong expectation the target will be wound back. Sixth, Abbott rejects the link between climate change and extreme weather events, rejects the idea that climate change may mean that all the coal in Australia cannot be sold and burned, and the government does not reference climate change in policies which climate science suggests would be impacted by it, for example the drought white paper. In 2009, Turnbull, still smarting at his demise, wrote: “The fact is that Tony and the people who put him in his job do not want to do anything about climate change. They do not believe in human-caused global warming. As Tony observed on one occasion 'climate change is crap' or if you consider his mentor, (then) senator (Nick) Minchin, the world is not warming, it’s cooling and the climate change issue is part of a vast leftwing conspiracy to de-industrialise the world.” Turnbull may have been wrong. Abbott may have revised his views since then. But on the basis of the available evidence, not by much. It may indeed be possible to meet credible greenhouse emission reduction targets in an affordable way using policies other than a carbon price. But on the basis of the available evidence, not by using this policy."

"In Banke district along the West Rapti river basin in Nepal, farmers have noticed that floods are coming more often, and with greater intensity. Flooding has always been part of the annual cycle of life, but the past 40 years have seen 12 abnormally large floods that have eroded land and wiped out crops and buildings. Each major flood costs the average household the equivalent of $9,000 (£5,200). In Nepal, where the average household annual income in 2011 was $2,700, these floods are a huge financial burden.  This story is replicated across Nepal. Between 1983 and 2010, every year floods have, on average, resulted in 283 deaths, 8,000 homes destroyed and 29,000 families affected, and dented Nepal's economy as a whole. A recent study  by the Nepali government and the Climate Development Knowledge Network (CDKN) has quantified the economic impact of these floods and other risk areas for today, and in the future. The study found that when both direct costs to infrastructure, as well as health and welfare impacts are considered, the total annual costs of these floods is, on average, $232m per year. And the situation is expected to worsen. The climate in Nepal is already changing, with higher temperatures and more erratic rainfall patterns. The study, which used downscaled climate model simulation projections for Nepal, anticipates temperature increases of 3-5C by the end of the century. The government's ambitious targets for economic growth, including graduating from least-developed to developed country status by 2022, is at serious risk, according to the study's findings. The agriculture and hydroelectricity sector are two of the major drivers of economic growth in Nepal, both of which will be significantly affected by climate change in the future. Around three-quarters of Nepal's population relies on agriculture for income, and it contributes a third of the country's GDP. By the 2070s, climate change is projected to lead to a net decrease in crop productivity with resulting high economic costs that are estimated at $140m a year. Hydroelectric plants provide roughly 90% of total electricity in the country and are expected to be a key driver for achieving Nepal's economic growth targets. The government's 2030 Development Vision anticipates a structural shift in the economy away from agriculture towards electricity, gas and water, with hydropower exports being a critical sector. However, ""run-of-river"" plants, which are the most common type in Nepal, rely on predictable rainfall and river flows. The study has calculated that the additional stress of climate change on hydroelectricity production is already costing the equivalent of 0.1% of GDP per year on average, and 0.3% in very dry years. Together with floods and the impact on agriculture, these three risk areas could cost Nepal the equivalent of 2-3% of current GDP a year by mid-century. However, it is possible to adapt to the impacts of climate change, and prevent this loss of economic growth. Banke district residents have tried to adapt to the increased flooding. Those who can afford it have reinforced the foundations of their homes or raised them on plinths. Some have changed their farming patterns to grow crops that better withstand the water. But for many, if the situation continues to worsen, they will lose the ability to cope with the impacts of the floods. Some residents are already considering migrating from the area. These adaptation actions also come with associated costs. A significant increase in investment beyond that forecast by the government is needed in these sectors to reduce the impacts of climate change. The study projected additional investment required between now and 2030 to mainstream adaptation into planned development activities. This came to an additional $500m in the hydroelectricity sector, $1.7bn in the agriculture sector and $209m for tackling water-induced disasters. So then comes the crux of one of the key international debates – who should pay for the impact of climate change? Certainly the private sector will play a role, particularly for agriculture and electricity production. For example, there is a business case for a commercial farmer to invest in irrigation to ensure higher yields when rainfall becomes more erratic. But a significant burden will still fall on the Nepal government, which will also need to draw on international support. Fortunately, in making the case for increased levels of international climate finance, the government now has the economic data to make a strong argument. Significant investment will be needed for adaptation and to prevent the stalling of economic growth in the country. For those in Banke district who are uncertain of what the near future holds, questions about who is responsible and who should pay seem far away. It is learning how to survive and adapt that is the immediate concern. Elizabeth Gogoi is the project manager, Asia at the Climate and Development Knowledge Network. Follow @cdknetwork on Twitter.

"Conservatives like to project themselves as lovers of the free market. They believe that everyone should go out and fend for themselves, that the government shouldn't be getting in the way of those with talent and ambition – and that it shouldn't be wasting ""their"" tax dollars on people who are too lazy to get off their rears and earn their keep. That story has a certain simplistic appeal and apparent logical consistency. Unfortunately it also has almost nothing to do with the reality of where conservatives actually stand on major political issues.   We got a rare chance to see the ugly truth behind the ""rugged individualist"" story earlier this year when the rancher Cliven Bundy briefly became a hero to the libertarian-leaning right. The government was harassing a hard-working rancher, went the story – a man who simply wanted to feed and water his cattle. A little investigative work revealed a very different picture. As Paul Krugman pointed out in his aptly titled column ""High Plains Moocher"", Bundy was fighting for the right to use government land without paying for it. That has more to do with outright theft than the free market. The right's reaction to President Obama's new plan to curb carbon emissions from power plants follows a similar storyline of entitlement. Obama proposed a 30% reduction in emissions over the next 15 years, which will substantially reduce the use of coal and likely to lead to a modest increase in electricity prices. (The Environmental Protection Agency estimates the additional cost per household will be less than $50 a year.) Emissions of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases are having a measurable impact on the global climate, and this is causing damage to people's property and in many cases jeopardizing their lives. But Republicans quickly raced to be first in line to condemn this massive government intervention in the economy.  Wyoming Senator Mike Enzi was quick to say, ""Families shouldn't have to pay $1,200 more per year for electricity so President Obama and environmental activists can have political peace of mind."" Joseph Bast, the president of the conservative Heartland Institute trashed the proposal by saying, ""This is Obamacare for the environment: guaranteed to raise costs, reduce choices, and destroy an existing industry. By the time EPA is finished, millions of Americans will be freezing in the dark."" The argument against taking steps to reduce carbon emissions is an argument that we have the right to impose the costs and risks on others without taking responsibility. It is essentially like arguing that I have the right to throw sewage on my neighbor's lawn because I would find it inconvenient to build a proper sewage disposal system.  Rising ocean levels and the increasing frequency of severe weather events mean that hundreds of millions of people in low-lying areas face increased risks from storms and flooding. While people in wealthy countries will largely be able to protect themselves from the worst of this damage, poor people living in densely populated countries like Bangladesh will not be as lucky.  There is a similar story about desertification in many areas, especially Sub-Saharan Africa. There are tens of millions of people living in regions where limited rainfall provided enough water for subsistence agriculture. As the planet gets warmer, these regions will turn into desert. Their inhabitants will face starvation or risk becoming refugees in the hope that someone will care for them.  In addition to these relatively well defined threats, climate change will cause damage in many ways that are much less predictable. For example, changing climate conditions are likely to introduce new bacteria to areas for which the existing ecosystem might be ill-prepared. This can devastate livestock and crops and possibly even have serious health consequences for the human population.  So, as with Bundy, conservatives can argue that this is simply a case of the government trying to tell people what to do and, as with Bundy, they'd be wrong. For Enzi, Bast and other conservatives, ""freedom"" – at least in the context of the debate over global warming – is apparently the right to actively harm others with the government's permission and even its participation. They seemingly believe that you have a god-given right to, in effect, throw your sewage on your neighbor's lawn even though, if applied universally, this would mean that any given neighbor has the right to dump their sewage on your lawn, too.  But freedom has a somewhat different meaning for those who feel the obligation to be responsible for the damage they cause and to be consistent in our proclamations about the world. Any real conception of ""freedom"" has to apply universally – and not a single one of the anti-EPA conservatives believes that their lawn should be open season for other people's sewage. That's how you tell the difference between a principled political argument and someone who just wants to be a jerk."

"Coal has reached its highest market share of global energy consumption for more than 40 years, figures reveal, despite fears that its high carbon emissions make it a prime cause of climate change. The use of coal for power generation and other purposes grew by 3% in 2013 – faster than any other fossil fuel – while its share of the market breached 30% for the first time since 1970, the BP Statistical Review reports.  The figures were published as Prof Nick Stern, author of the influential climate change report the Stern Review, said his latest research indicated the economic risks of unchecked climate change were bigger than previously estimated. Europe is among the regions using more coal, increasing imports from the US, where coal has been displaced in power stations by even cheaper shale gas. But developing countries such as China and India are also huge coal users, although BP pointed out that energy growth overall in China dropped to 4.7% last year from 8.4% in 2012. Christof Ruhl, BP's chief economist and author of its statistical review, said this ""dramatic slowdown"" put a question mark over China's official economic growth figure for 2013 of 7.7%. The accuracy of Chinese economic statistics have long been a subject for debate but few are willing to directly challenge them for fear of upsetting such an important emerging powerhouse. ""It is not easy to reconcile the slowdown in energy growth numbers and official [gross domestic product] numbers ... you can draw your own conclusions from that,""Ruhl said. The BP statistics show that the use of windfarms for generating electricity rose by 21% last year while solar power grew even more rapidly, by 33%, but from a lower base point. Oil, a major carbon polluter which has an important role in transport and in the manufacture of chemicals and plastics, remained the world's leading fuel, with 33% of global energy consumption. But it lost market share for the 14th consecutive year and 33% is the lowest share since BP started to compile its data in 1965. The paper from Stern, chair of the Grantham Research Institute on Climate Change and president of the Royal Academy for humanities and social sciences, and Simon Dietzan, an associate professor in environmental policy at London School of Economics and Political Science, warns that living standards could start to decline later this century unless the growth in annual emissions of greenhouse gases is checked. In a peer-reviewed paper to be published in the Economic Journal, Stern has updated previous models for assessing the economic impact of global warming which have been used by the United Nations' key Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). Stern said: ""It is extremely important to understand the severe limitations of standard economic models, such as those cited in the IPCC report, which have made assumptions that simply do not reflect current knowledge about climate change and its potential impacts on the economy. ""I hope our paper will prompt other economists to strive for much better models which will help policymakers and the public to recognise the immensity the potential risks of unmanaged climate change. ""Models that assume that catastrophic damages are not possible fail to take account of the magnitude of the issues and the implications of the science."""
" 10.39pm BST  We're going to wrap up our live blog coverage for the day. You can read our most recent news story here.  Here's a summary of where things stand:  • President Barack Obama unveiled a proposal for new limits on carbon pollution at existing power plants. It was the first regulation of its kind ever proposed by the White House.  • Under the plan, the Environmental Protection Agency announced a goal of 30% reductions in carbon emissions from 2005 levels by 2030. Reductions would vary by state. • The proposal was generally welcomed by environmental groups, but decried by business and the coal industry for potentially costing jobs and money while having limited environmental benefits. • The EPA has tailored its emissions goals state-by-state, taking into account each state’s fuel mix, its electricity market and numerous other factors. A text of the plan is on the EPA web site here. • Global leaders on environmental issues welcomed the move, saying it could jump-start a stalled international conversation.  • Obama touted the health benefits of decreased carbon pollution. “In America we don't have to choose between health of our economy and the health of our kids,"" he said in a conference call. ""We can do both."" Updated at 10.46pm BST  10.01pm BST  Ratings agency Standard and Poor's are releasing a report tomorrow morning on the credit impact of the EPA announcement, reports Karl Mathiesen (@karlmathiesen) for the Guardian.  ""I would caution against thinking this will have an immediate impact on prices,"" says an S&P officer: Michael Ferguson, an associate director at the agency and author of the report, said today that much of the speculation about the impact on jobs and electricity prices was ""partisan"" and the real effect would likely fall somewhere between the two extremes. ""I would caution against thinking this will have an immediate impact on prices,"" he said. Rather, he said, as the rules come into effect during 2016, states would likely implement a carbon price which would allow emissions trading. This could put pressure on the fossil fuel sector, especially coal. Some coal plants would be forced into retirement around 2020, meaning electricity prices would rise, although by how much he was unable to say.  The price impacts would not be uniform, he said, ""varying greatly from state to state"". California, which already has an advanced emissions reduction programme, would find the transition easier than some midwestern states that still rely heavily on coal for electricity.  9.52pm BST  The Washington Post's Jason Samenow has emailed climate scientists to gauge their reactions to today's proposal. ""Most (not all) of the scientists I reached out to support the measure, with some qualifiers,"" Samenow writes.  Read those reactions here. And don't miss this EPA video pitching its proposal today for 30% carbon pollution cuts from 2005-2030: Before we wrote the proposal, we heard from thousands of people on the best way to move forward. We learned that providing enough time and flexibility, in 15 years, we can cut carbon pollution from the power sector by at least 15% – with significant cuts starting in the early years of the plan. Updated at 9.57pm BST  9.46pm BST  Karl Mathiesen (@karlmathiesen) takes another look at the implications for consumer energy costs of the proposed new EPA rules: A report by the Chamber of Commerce last week predicted the EPA regulations would take and annual average of $200 every year away from household budgets through costs passed on by power companies. The report sparked a flurry of commentary warning of ""shuttered businesses, fractured family budgets, widespread job losses and dire threats to electric reliability"".  But the EPA estimated today that in 2020 the electricity price would have increased by a maximum of 3.2%. This would represent an average annual increase of $42.29 (this price is based on the EIA's electricity price figures for today, not the projected price for 2020, so should be considered a guide). By 2025, bills would decrease significantly, somewhere in the range of 3.2% to 8.7%. Obama today told reporters on a conference call that warnings of personal financial disaster were over-egged and the industry would adapt swiftly. “What we’ve seen every time is that these claims are debunked when you actually give workers and businesses the tools and the incentives they need to innovate,” Obama said.  9.12pm BST  The EPA has produced an interactive map with a state-by-state breakdown of climate change impacts, state action, and EPA proposals. The three states that would have to trim their carbon emissions most as a percentage under the new rules are Washington (71.8%), Arizona (51.7%) and South Carolina (51.4%). The state that would have to trim its emissions rate most in absolute terms is South Carolina, which is tasked with trimming carbon pollution by 815 lb/MWh. The state that will have to trim its emissions least as a percentage is Maine, which would move from 437 lb/MWh in 2012 to 378 lb/Mwh in 2030 (13.5% decrease). The state that would have to trim its emissions rate least in absolute terms is Idaho, which is tasked with trimming carbon pollution by 111 lb/MWh, from 339 to 228. Vox does more playing with the state numbers here.  8.43pm BST  Here's a Democrat who is not on board with the president's new EPA rules: Alison Lundergan Grimes, the candidate running to oust Mitch McConnell from his Kentucky senate seat.  Kentucky is coal country. Coal accounted for 92% of electricity production in the state for 2012, according to the Georgetown Climate Center.  The average price of electricity in Kentucky is low – 7 cents a kilowatt hour compared with a national average of 10 cents a kilowatt hour – but the ratio of electricity spending to economic output is higher in Kentucky at 3.8% than for the nation as a whole (2.5%). The Georgetown Climate Center has a great state-by-state breakdown of the coal economy.  .@AlisonForKY says her campaign is running this ad in EKY & WKY hitting Obama/EPA/CoalCoalCoal: #kysen pic.twitter.com/uATQekWSJM  8.24pm BST  Higher electricity bills and more blackouts: that's what the average American can expect from the proposed new EPA rules, according to one very interested party, the American Coalition for Clean Coal Electricity (ACCCE).  Karl Mathiesen (@karlmathiesen) digs into a press release quoting president ACCCE president Mike Duncan: “Sadly, EPA’s proposed regulations put America’s low- and middle-income families most at risk of paying disproportionately more for energy,"" Duncan said. ""More so, the rule threatens the energy reliability and economic promise we enjoy today. Only by recognizing the importance of an energy portfolio rich in fuel source diversity will we preserve America’s access to stable and affordable power. For a countervailing view, Karl flags a report from May by Sue Tierney, managing principal at The Analysis Group and board member of World Resources Institute. Tierney sees ""no reasonable basis to anticipate that EPA’s guidance"" will create power reliability problems, because ""flexibility built into the EPA rules would allow states to manage their reductions using emissions trading.""  Speaking today, Tierney said the ""bountiful supply of natural gas will make all the difference in the world"" to reliability, Karl reports. And with regard to the price of electricity,  Tierney said she agreed with reports that predicted the new regulations would lead to an increase in the price of power over the short term, but eventually the price would come down as the centre of power generation moved away from coal. Tierney added that despite being less stringent than she expected, the EPA's rules were ""ambitious and reasonable"". Theoretically, she said, the cuts could have gone deeper and still not caused supply issues. But the Clean Air Act requires the rules to stand up to legal action. A key part of the Act is the requirement for the expectations to be reasonable.  7.36pm BST  Guardian US environment correspondent Suzanne Goldenberg (@suzyji) has been listening in on a conference call with president Barack Obama. The call was hosted by public health groups who support the EPA proposal. ""Barack Obama has been hitting the phones rallying public support for the new EPA rules,"" Suzanne writes: He told a conference call with public health groups hosted by the American Lung Association that the new standards would deliver real benefits for those with asthma and other respiratory illness – and at an affordable price tag for consumers.   The EPA plan was a “sensible” way of cutting carbon pollution, he said. “Up until now there has been no national limits on the amount of carbon pollution existing power plants can pump into the air.” Obama went on to frame the new rules as a public health win – especially for those at greater risk of lung diseases, such as children and the elderly. Suzanne continues: Obama noted African-Americans and Latinos had higher rates for hospital visits due to asthma. “Putting guidelines in place will help protect the health of vulnerable Americans including children and the elderly,"" he said. Obama said that by 2030 “your electricity bills will shrink.” He warned there would be opponents claiming that the guideliness would destroy jobs and the economy – but said those claims were misguided and public relations spin. “In America we don't have to choose between health of our economy and the health of our kids. We can do both,” he said. “This is something that is important for all of us as parents, as grandparents, and as citizens. As a parent who cares about the health of our families and who also want to make sure future generations can enjoy this beautiful blue ball in the middle of space we are part of....I'm asking people to build momentum for these plans.” Updated at 7.43pm BST  7.15pm BST  More positive reviews from environmental groups: Ceres, the green investor network of 128 companies and 49 investors managing $800 billion in assets, organized an initiative to send letters to the White House and leaders of both parties in Congress supporting the new rules as ""a critical step"" to dealing with climate change. That praise was echoed by the nonprofit American Council on Renewable Energy (ACORE), which said the EPA announcement signalled ""strong intent to maintain the United States’ global leadership in cutting carbon."" “This is the dawn of the era of climate solutions,"" said Dan Adler, co-chair of ACORE board of directors and a director of the California Clean Energy Fund. ""By allowing states to stimulate investment in local, renewable energy projects to meet carbon reduction requirements, EPA can help sustain the surge in capital commitments to these technologies and boost growth at a critical time for our economy.”   7.02pm BST  Green groups have been mostly positive about today's announcement, writes Karl Mathiesen (@karlmathiesen) for the Guardian.  Greenpeace UK executive director John Sauven said Obama's move on climate change should bring shame to British prime minister David Cameron: “Obama’s bold leadership on climate action, standing up to the fossil fuel industry and their political backers, makes the foot-dragging from ‘the greenest government ever’ look even more embarrassing,"" Sauven said. “David Cameron hasn’t made one stand-alone speech on climate change since becoming Prime Minister. Instead he has taken every opportunity to undermine Britain’s wind and solar industries, as well as giving a new lease of life to our ageing coal plants and botching the government flagship scheme for energy efficiency. Obama previously said he doesn’t have time to meet with the Flat Earth Society – Cameron has appointed avowed flat-earthers to top cabinet jobs. “Unless Cameron shifts his commitment to climate action up a gear, the UK will be left playing catch-up in the age of clean energy, losing out on jobs and business opportunities.” But Friends of the Earth president, Erich Pica, said the cut to emissions were just the start of an effective response to climate change: ""President Obama has taken the most significant step by any American president to combat climate disruption. While a step forward, this rule simply doesn't go far enough to put us on the right path. The science on climate change has become clearer and more dire, requiring more aggressive action from the president.""  6.46pm BST  Writing in the New York Times last week, Jody Freeman explained the legal underpinnings for the EPA's never-before-tried move to regulate carbon emissions at existing power plants. The EPA claims the authority under a section of the Clean Air Act known as 111(d): This section requires states to adopt performance standards for existing sources of pollution. The E.P.A. sets benchmarks that the states must meet and can improve upon. Some critics argue that the E.P.A. lacks the authority to regulate power plant pollution under this provision, but that argument is weak.[...] The more serious legal battle will be over how stringent the performance standards can be. Some opponents from states and the utility industry insist that the standards must be based solely on what individual facilities can achieve on-site with existing technologies. All sides expect plenty of opportunity in the form of a hailstorm of lawsuits to answer the legal questions at stake. Read the full piece here. Updated at 6.49pm BST  6.22pm BST  Could climate change as a political issue be a plus for Democrats in the midterm elections – videos like this notwithstanding?  ""The last time Congress made a serious effort on climate change,"" writes Guardian US environment correspondent Suzanne Goldenberg (@suzyji), ""Joe Manchin campaigned for a Senate seat in West Virginia by shooting a rifle at a cap-and-trade bill. And Manchin, who won, is a Democrat"": Four years on, Republican candidates who deny the existence of climate change may be shooting themselves in the foot – and Democrats might even be able to say the words ""global warming"" out loud on the campaign trail between now and November. The rules being announced by the Environmental Protection Agency on Monday represent a workaround – President Obama had to circumvent Congress and use his executive authority to enact the EPA's new regulations on power plants. But they also mark a sea change on sea-level rise: in a year when big money and big policy changes have made climate change a legitimate mid-term election issue, it's no longer political poison to talk about the threat to the planet. In 2014, it may even be a plus for some candidates trying to save it. ""As it turns out, the political climate is changing, Suzanne writes. Read the full piece here.  Updated at 7.32pm BST  6.09pm BST  The president had declared a war on coal, and a war on jobs, according to a video produced by the Republican National Committee and published online today: The US chamber of commerce, meanwhile, has published a report that forecasts 224,000 lost jobs every year for the next 15 years. Writing for the Guardian, Karl Mathiesen (@karlmathiesen) notes that the report in question bases its projections on a Natural Resources Defense Council (NRDC) plan that is more severe than the EPA's. Chamber President and CEO Thomas J. Donohue said Monday that the regulations would ""add immense cost and regulatory burdens on America’s job creators. They will have a profound effect on the economy, on businesses, and on families"". But the Natural Resources Defense Council (NRDC) said last week that the EPA laws could create 274,000 new jobs in the energy efficiency sector by 2020, Karl writes:  Sheryl Carter, co-director of NRDC’s Energy Program said: “Energy efficiency is the cheapest, fastest and cleanest way to cut carbon emissions, and it benefits local communities enormously by putting people to work and lowering bills. We are already seeing clear examples of efficiency in action, with huge job and money-savings benefits based on real-world experience by states.""

The regulations weigh in at 645 pages with an additional 376 pages of impact analysis. Suzanne writes up a few key points: EPA officials – anonymous under the terms of the call – are skittish about describing 2005 as a “baseline” year, even though it's the point of comparison for achieving the 30% cut in power plant emissions by 2030.  That's because emissions have already fallen significantly because of fracking and cheap natural gas, and the EPA is running into pushback from environmental groups who say the 30% target is not ambitious enough.  The EPA officials told the call the regulations also take into account emissions in the states in 2012, which were lower. Even though 2005 is the comparison point.  The other key point officials were anxious to drive home, Suzanne writes, was that the rules allow for a menu of options, and states are free to order up a la carte, choosing to reduce emissions at the source, invest in renewables, or encourage customers to save on electricity: The rules are also tailored to each state – in some cases down to a single power plant. Officials told the call the target emissions reduction for Washington state took into account the scheduled retirement of an ageing coal-fired power plant in the next few years.   Another key takeaway – come 2030, America is still going to be using coal to some extent. EPA officials told the call they expect coal and natural gas to make up just under a third of the electricity supply, with renewables generating some 9%. Updated at 7.32pm BST  5.47pm BST  Guardian environment correspondent Fiona Harvey is gathering reaction to the EPA proposal. ""It's essential to get the US and China aligned [on climate change] as that is what will make the real difference,"" Yvo de Boer, former United Nations climate chief, told the Guardian. Fiona writes: He was hopeful that President Obama's stance would make that a reality. Beijing has not yet officially responded to President Obama's announcement, but has its own plans for cutting emissions, partly in response to the air pollution crisis. Ed Davey, the UK energy and climate secretary, adds this:  ""These US proposals have come at a crucial time, and could shift the global debate.” Updated at 6.13pm BST  5.28pm BST  As our live blog coverage continues, here's a summary of where things stand: • The Environmental Protection Agency rolled out a proposal to confront climate change by cutting carbon pollution at existing US power plants. If adopted, it would be the first regulation of its kind. • President Barack Obama proposed the new rules under his executive authority after years of frustration with congressional inaction. The president had previously set new emissions rules for cars and future plant construction. • The plan would set state-by-state pollution reduction goals with the overall goal of cutting carbon emissions by 30% from 2005 levels by the year 2030. Climate change economist Nicholas Stern said the cuts would be insufficient to avoid the 2°C warming that scientists believe will be dangerous. • Opponents of the new rules including the coal industry, business interests and some political leaders who warned that the plan would cost jobs and make electricity more expensive. In a speech (full text) announcing the rules, EPA administrator Gina McCarthy said the opposite would happen. • Many environmental advocates embraced the EPA proposal, including the Sierra Club and former vice president Al Gore, who called them ""the most important step taken to combat the climate crisis in our country’s history"". • The president was scheduled to talk about the proposal on a conference call this afternoon hosted by public health groups, which link pollution to asthma rates and other ailments.

Mostly the poor ones, says S&P: http://t.co/gkyhpgNn3z pic.twitter.com/qns4ywT5LR  5.08pm BST   4.55pm BST  The Evangelical Environmental Network (EEN), a group of evangelical Christians dedicated to environmental issues – and no natural political ally of the president – has come out strongly in favor of the new EPA rules, calling them an ""historic step"". ""Today's release of the EPA's draft regulation of existing power plants is an historic step in our nation's journey to overcome climate change,"" said Rev. Mitch Hescox, the group's president. ""We look forward to studying the draft carefully as we offer our support and suggestions for possible improvements."" A statement by the network groups environmental protection with other ""pro-life"" concerns: A chief concern of pro-life Christians is the health impacts of the pollution from fossil fuels that is driving climate change. ""The health and well-being of our children is already being affected,"" said Rev. Emilio Marreo of Esperanza, an Hispanic evangelical organization. ""The impact of air pollution is a significant concern for the Latino community because Latino Americans are more likely to live in areas with high levels of air toxicity due to poverty. We can't afford not to act."" (h/t @suzyji)  4.49pm BST  The EPA proposal has drawn sharp opposition from the coal industry and lobby, business interests led by the US Chamber of Commerce, anti-regulation groups and political leaders whose constituents rely on economically thriving power plants and fear the new rules could hurt or close them. The Republican rank-and-file opposes the new EPA rules, nodding to a study promoted by the US Chamber of Commerce saying the regulations would be costly and destroy jobs (the EPA offers precisely the opposite prediction on both counts).  House speaker John Boehner has tweeted a link to an argument on his web site saying that electricity prices will spike as a result of the regulations: Obama admin’s new EPA rule will cost Americans more of their paychecks & put people out of work. http://t.co/nRucmfYlMu #energy #jobs The libertarian-rooted Cato Institute also has issued a rebuttal accusing the EPA of junk science. the Cato reply challenges one data point, the EPA's tracking of heat-related deaths. And there's this vivid language from the Republican senatorial candidate from Kentucky, a coal-producing state: McConnell: EPA Overreach ‘a dagger in the heart of the American middle class’ (h/t @lilahrap) Updated at 4.57pm BST  4.35pm BST  Here is the text of EPA administrator Gina McCarthy's statement this morning. She began with a story about an asthmatic child who has to tailor his outdoor playtime to air pollution levels: About a month ago, I took a trip to the Cleveland Clinic. I met a lot of great people, but one stood out—even if he needed to stand on a chair to do it. Parker Frey is 10 years old. He’s struggled with severe asthma all his life. His mom said despite his challenges, Parker’s a tough, active kid—and a stellar hockey player.  But sometimes, she says, the air is too dangerous for him to play outside. In the United States of America, no parent should ever have that worry. That’s why EPA exists. Our job, directed by our laws, reaffirmed by our courts, is to protect public health and the environment. Climate change, fueled by carbon pollution, supercharges risks not just to our health, but to our communities, our economy, and our way of life. That’s why EPA is delivering on a vital piece of President Obama's Climate Action Plan. Read McCarthy's full address as prepared for delivery here.  Updated at 4.37pm BST  4.32pm BST  Lilah Raptopoulos (@lilahrap) of the Guardian US Open team has pulled together a Twitter list of climate change resources. Follow it here for commentary and analysis from climate experts, journalists, Obama administration officials and politicians invested in the issue. If you're interested in opposing voices, you can always follow the House Republicans Twitter list, which currently is on a roll. We'll round up some of those voices momentarily.  4.25pm BST  Signed, sealed, delivered.  4.18pm BST  Guardian US environment correspondent Suzanne Goldenberg (@suzyji) has a snap take on this morning's rollout speech by EPA administrator Gina McCarthy. McCarthy ""ended her speech on an optimistic note – praising American innovation, and saying she was confident business would find ways to meet the new standard,"" Suzanne writes: She also had a special call-out to mothers, part of a strategy to rally maximum public support for the new power plant rules and blunt the anticipated onslaught from conservative groups and industry ahead of the mid-terms. “We have a moral obligation to ensure that the world we leave behind is safe healthy and vibrant,” McCarthy said. McCarthy throughout her speech reached out to families, playing up the public health benefits of the rules and playing down the risks of electricity price rises and industry, emphasising that companies could set their plans for cutting emissions. But McCarthy made no effort at all to be conciliatory with the hard core of those who deny global warming is occurring, Suzanne writes: “I am little tired of people pointing to the polar vortex as a reason not to act on climate change,” she said. “It's exactly the opposite. It's a wake-up call.” The hardline against climate deniers is a relatively new strategy for the Obama Administration, which would have once let such claims pass unremarked. But both Obama and McCarthy have hit out against climate deniers in their speeches on the power plant rules. Expect a more robust defence of the science in the months ahead. Updated at 7.32pm BST  4.14pm BST  Are the pollution reductions deep enough? Previous suggestions for a new global climate protocol suggest the EPA plan may not be as ambitious as billed. Karl Mathiesen (@karlmathiesen) writes: The National Resources Defense Council has previously made the case for a 26% reduction on 2012 levels by 2020, a tighter timeline and lower baseline than the one proposed today by the EPA. Its report showed that this could be achieved with a net gain of between $21-$56 billion to the US economy when the health and environmental benefits were accounted for. But the NDRC's president Frances Beinecke today welcomed the changes calling them ""fair"" and a ""giant leap forward in protecting the health of all Americans and future generations"". EU Climate Action Commissioner Connie Hedegaard said that for the 2015 Paris climate conference ""to deliver what is needed to stay below a 2°C increase in global temperature, all countries, including the United States, must do even more than what this reduction trajectory indicates"". And top climate change economist Nicholas Stern commented today that while this level of reductions would help the US meet the target agreed to at the Cancun climate summit in 2010, this level of ambition would still be insufficient to avoid the 2°C warming that scientists believe will be dangerous: ""The United States, China and European Union all need to increase the ambition of their emissions cuts to be consistent with the overall goal of delivering a reasonable chance of avoiding dangerous global warming of more than 2 centigrade degrees above pre-industrial levels,"" Stern said. Updated at 4.15pm BST  4.10pm BST  Are the pollution reductions deep enough? The United States already has been cutting its carbon emissions, notes Karl Mathiesen (@karlmathiesen) for the Guardian: Since 2005, the baseline year for the EPA's new pollution plan, there have been major changes in the way the US produces electricity. The financial crisis impacted energy consumption dramatically. According to the US Energy Information Administration, carbon emissions in the energy sector dropped 15% between 2005 and 2012. Almost half of this was accounted for by a drop in electricity generation, the rest was due to a decrease in the carbon intensity of the sector (ie. more gas and renewables). This means the drop in emissions required by the new EPA rules over the next 16 years is less than the drop which occurred without regulation in the seven years between 2005 and 2012.  4.00pm BST  Is the president's big climate announcement making a splash on the airwaves? On C-SPAN it is. On the other channels – well, the president himself has yet to speak: Currently, CNN is the only cable network of the big 3 covering the EPA announcement. (Fox News is covering…Benghazi!) (h/t: @kaylaepstein)  3.57pm BST  McCarthy says American innovation is up to the challenge of meeting new pollution and climate goals. ""We can lead this fight,"" she says. ""We can innovate our way to a better future. That's what America does best"": Yes our climate crisis is a global problem and it demands a global solution... but we can act the day to advance the ball, and we can limit the dangers of punting the problems to our own children.  3.54pm BST  Guardian US environment correspondent Suzanne Goldenberg (@suzyji) is watching McCarthy's speech. The remarks ""keep closely to the script set out by Barack Obama over the weekend: climate change is personal, and dealing with climate change will not hurt the economy,"" Suzanne writes: “This is not just about disappearing polar bears and melting ice caps,” McCarthy said in a speech at EPA headquarters. “This is about protecting our health and protecting our homes. This is about protecting local economies and this is about protecting jobs.” McCarthy focused on two main points as she went over the broad outlines of the plan. One: the power plant rules will make a real difference to dealing with climate change – and air pollution, which is responsible for heart attacks and asthma. Two: the plan is deliberately “customised” for each state. “There is no one size fits all solution,” McCarthy said. “It's up to states to mix and match to get their goals.” McCarthy also hit back at criticism from industry and conservative groups that the rules will lead to power outages or higher electricity prices. “Critics say that their energy bills will skyrocket. Well, they're wrong,” she said. Updated at 7.31pm BST  3.49pm BST  McCarthy says for every dollar invested in the plan, families will see $7 in direct health benefits. ""And if states are smart"", in 2030, average electricity bills will be 8% cheaper. That's an applause line. Appraising the economic projection work behind the pleasing sounding stats, of course, is a longer process.  3.45pm BST  ""States have to design plans now... so that they can be on a trajectory to meet their final goals by 2030,"" McCarthy, the EPA administrator, says. McCarthy touts the plan as win-win for business and the environment: What's special about the flexibility of our plan? It doesn't just give our states more options. It gives investors and entrepreneurs more options to play to. It will deliver the certainty that private investment is looking for. She says it will spur technology innovation and ""spur private investment"" in every direction, ""not just the one or two we know about today.  3.41pm BST  McCarthy says the plan is tailored state-by-state: The glue that holds this plan together ... is that each state's goal is tailored to their own circumstances... each state's different, so each goal, and each path, can be different.""  3.40pm BST  McCarthy says the new rules would result in pollution savings that amoung to ""double what every power plant in America generated in the way of pollution in 2012."" The result, she says: lower medical bills and fewer trips to the emergency rooms, especially for kids with asthma, the elderly and infirm. McCarthy says the plan ""is also about environmental justice"" because ""lower-income families and communities of color are hardest-hit.""  3.37pm BST  McCarthy is describing symptoms of climate change and their costs. She names rising seas, rising insurance premiums, rising property taxes, rising temperatures. ""This is not just about disappearing polar bears and melting ice caps, although I like polar bears and I've heard about the ice caps – this is about protecting our health and protecting our homes,"" McCarthy says. The time to act is now.  3.33pm BST  Gina McCarthy, the EPA administrator, has begun speaking. Watch her live here. She says the EPA is ""extremely proud"" of the plan, a centerpiece of the president's global climate action plan. Updated at 3.33pm BST  3.31pm BST  The Sierra Club has released a statement in support of the plan. Michael Brune, Executive Director of the Sierra Club, said ""today, the president made good on his promise to American families that his administration would tackle the climate crisis, and clean up and modernize the way we power our country"": Climate disruption is the greatest challenge facing our generation. Until now, power plants have been allowed to dump unlimited amounts of carbon pollution into our air, driving dangerous climate disruption, and fueling severe drought, wildfires, heat waves and superstorms. Extreme weather, and the costs to Americans’ health and wallets, will only worsen unless we act. The Sierra Club and our 2.4 million members and supporters stand with President Obama and EPA Administrator Gina McCarthy. In the month ahead, we will work to ensure a strong and just standard for cutting carbon pollution. In doing so, we will protect the health of our children, boost our clean energy economy, and help American communities thrive.  3.28pm BST  Expected to begin in a few minutes is a news conference with EPA Administrator Gina McCarthy (no relation), who will present the plan. You can watch it on C-SPAN here.  3.24pm BST  A snap reaction in strong favor from the junior senator from Massachusetts: This is the beginning of the end of America’s long, dirty power plant era. #ActOnClimate http://t.co/0dHap6BK8E (h/t @kaylaepstein)  3.23pm BST  In his weekly radio address at the weekend, President Barack Obama touted the potential health benefits from curbed carbon emissions.  ""We don’t have to choose between the health of our economy and the health of our children,” Obama said. “As president, and as a parent, I refuse to condemn our children to a planet that’s beyond fixing.” The American Lung Association is one of the first groups to embrace today's EPA proposal. ALA president Harold P. Wimmer said the plan shows ""serious commitment to addressing one of the most serious public health challenges of our day, climate change"": “Power plant pollution makes people sick and cuts short lives. We are pleased to see significant health benefits from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s (EPA) proposed limits on carbon pollution from power plants, which would reduce the burden of air pollution in America, prevent up to 4,000 premature deaths and 100,000 asthma attacks in the first year they are in place, and prevent up to 6,600 premature deaths and 150,000 asthma attacks in 2030.  3.16pm BST  On the long road to today's announcement, environmental groups eventually rallied behind the new rules, Guardian US environment correspondent Suzanne Goldenberg (@suzyji) writes. Andrew Steer, president of the World Resources Institute, called the EPA proposal a ""momentous development"" that ""raises the bar for controlling carbon emissions in the United States."" A statement from Steer read in part: It’s the most important action available to cut US emissions—and the Obama administration has seized the opportunity. These new standards send a powerful message around the world that it’s time to face the global threat of climate change [...] Despite the usual grumbling from some critics, it’s abundantly clear that these rules can be implemented cost-effectively. Time and again opposition groups have made dire economic predictions about new regulations, when in fact they repeatedly drive innovation and open new economic opportunities. Updated at 7.31pm BST  3.08pm BST  Here's more from former vice president Al Gore, reacting to the EPA announcement, which he calls ""the most important step taken to combat the climate crisis in our country’s history"": President Obama has taken hold of the challenges we face through a series of critical actions, empowering the EPA to enforce limits on CO2 emissions for new power plants, accelerating the adoption of renewable energy and enforcing bold new standards for fuel economy, while continuing to raise awareness of the urgency of the climate crisis and reestablish American leadership on the global stage. Solving the climate crisis will no doubt be difficult, but - thanks to this action by President Obama and many others - we are now in a position to put ourselves on the path to a sustainable future. Much more reaction to come.   3.05pm BST  Guardian US environment correspondent Suzanne Goldenberg (@suzyji) says the EPA proposal ""spurs prospects for a global deal to end climate change but sets up an epic battle over the environment in this year's mid-term elections"": The new rules were not as ambitious as some environmental groups had hoped. America is already a third of the way towards meeting the national average of a 30% cut in emissions. Some states, especially those in the north-east have already exceeded the standard. Even so, reaction from environmental groups to the new power plant rules ranged from “momentous” to “historic”. Al Gore said the new rules were “the most important step taken to combat the climate crisis in our country's history”. But a lobby group for the coal industry – which will be hit hardest by the new rules – said the regulations would hurt the economy and lead to power outages. “If these rules are allowed to go into effect, the administration for all intents and purposes is creating America's next energy crisis,” the American Coalition for Clean Coal Electricity said. Updated at 7.31pm BST  2.56pm BST  What will it cost? (1/?) The EPA proposal projects that, in 2030, the significant reductions in the harmful carbon pollution and in other air pollution, to which this rule would lead, would result in net climate and health benefits of $48bn to $82bn.  ""At the same time,"" the report says, ""coal and natural gas would remain the two leading sources of electricity generation in the U.S., with each providing more than 30 percent of the projected generation."" One of the main opponents of the new regulations, the US Chamber of Commerce, does not foresee the net benefits the EPA predicts. A chamber study estimates that between now and 2030, the program would cost $50.2 billion in constant dollars per year.  That's supposed to sound expensive – but it's not, the economist Paul Krugman wrote last week: Remember, we have a $17 trillion economy right now, and it’s going to grow over time. So what the Chamber of Commerce is actually saying is that we can take dramatic steps on climate — steps that would transform international negotiations, setting the stage for global action — while reducing our incomes by only one-fifth of 1 percent. That’s cheap! Another part of this equation: consumer energy prices. If it's expensive for power plants to comply with the regulations, those costs are likely to show up on your power bill. The EPA predicts a 4-7% rise in electricity prices, a Vox correspondent notes: Electricity prices are relatively low now. EPA expects a 4-7% rise by 2020 under new rule: http://t.co/jeyLrz2mWI pic.twitter.com/8fnTJkuWh3  2.49pm BST  The EPA proposal is split into two parts: 1) state-specific emission rate-based CO2 goals and 2) guidelines for the development, submission and implementation of state plans. In the first part, the state goals, the proposal is at pains to say ""each state’s goal reflects its unique conditions."" ""In calculating each state’s CO2 goal, the EPA took into consideration the state’s fuel mix, its electricity market and numerous other factors,"" the proposal says. It does not ""prescribe how a state should meet its goal"", but proposes a partnership between states and the agency to craft a plan. In the second part, the submission and implementation guidelines, the proposal lays out ""latitude states have in developing compliance strategies,"" as well as ""the flexibility they have in the timing for submittal of their plans and the flexibility they have in determining the schedule by which their sources must achieve the required CO2 reductions."" We'll bring you some highlights of the state-by-state breakdown as the day unfolds.   2.31pm BST  The EPA has published its proposal for new carbon pollution targets by 2030. As previously reported, the agency proposes a 30% reduction in carbon pollution from 2005 levels by the year 2030.  ""This proposal is a significant step forward in the EPA and states partnering to reduce GHG [greenhouse gas] emissions in the U.S.,"" the agency writes, according to a prepublication version, signed today by EPA Administrator Gina McCarthy.  The proposal is at pains to emphasize its flexible approach to regulation. It puts forward ""state-specific rate-based goals for carbon dioxide emissions from the power sector, as well as guidelines for states to follow in developing plans to achieve the state-specific goals.""  The subtext is that this should not be seen as a heavy-handed federal regulation imposed on the unwilling states. ""EPA's proposal... is flexible – reflecting that different states have a different mix of sources and opportunities, and reflecting the important role of states as full partners with the federal government in cutting pollution,"" the prepublication version says. The proposal describes the many parties who contributed: This effort encompassed several hundred meetings across the country with state environmental and energy officials, public utility commissioners, system operators, utilities and public interest advocates, as well as members of the public. Many participants submitted written material and data to the EPA as well. The agency has put out a public call for comment and announced public hearings to take the new rule under advisement. The new regulations would take effect next June. We'll have more shortly. Updated at 2.34pm BST  2.10pm BST  Good morning and welcome to our live blog coverage as President Barack Obama and the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) unveil a bold new effort to confront climate change. According to advance reports, the president will announce new regulations requiring existing power plants to, by the year 2030, produce 30% less carbon pollution than they were in 2005. Power plants are the largest single source of carbon pollution, accounting for nearly 40% of the emissions that cause climate change. Today’s move represents the first attempt by any president to regulate carbon pollution from power plants. Guardian US environment correspondent Suzanne Goldenberg (@suzyji) has written a preview of today’s announcement. “The regulations could lead to a sweeping transformation of America's energy economy, if they survive an onslaught from business and conservative groups, and Republicans in Congress,” she writes: The rules could also break open negotiations for a global climate change deal, the United Nations climate chief, Christiana Figueres, said. [...] The rules could affect some 1,600 power plants. About 600 of these operate on coal, including many that are nearly 50 years old and will have the most difficulty meeting the new standards. Under the rule, states and power companies will have a range of options to meet the new standards: switching from coal to cleaner-burning natural gas; forming cap-and-trade markets; expanding renewables such as wind and solar power; or encouraging customers to use less energy by moving to more efficient heating and cooling systems and appliances.  That's a departure for the EPA, which generally has focused on curbing emissions from specific smoke stacks. We will be live blogging the EPA announcement, which will be followed by a statement from the president. We’ll also be gathering reaction from environmental groups and from opponents of the new regulations, who say they will be ineffective and too costly. And we’ll take a closer look at the energy and pollution picture at the state and company level. We hope you’ll join us."

"Researchers in the US have identified a way in which city-dwellers are inadvertently stoking up the heat of the night – by installing air conditioners.Because the cities are getting hotter as the climate changes, residents are increasingly investing in aircon systems − which discharge heat from offices and apartment blocks straight into the city air. And the vicious circle effect is that cities get still warmer, making air conditioning all the more attractive to residents.According to scientists at Arizona State University, the air conditioning system is now having a measurable effect. During the days, the systems emit waste heat, but because the days are hot anyway, the difference is negligible. At night, heat from air conditioning systems now raises some urban temperatures by more than 1C, they report in the Journal of Geophysical Research Atmospheres.The team focused on the role of air conditioning systems in the metropolitan area of the city of Phoenix, which is in the Sonora desert in Arizona, and conditions in the summertime are harsh there anyway.But, worldwide, normally warm countries are experiencing increasing extremes of heat, and conditions in cities have on occasion become lethal.To cap this, cities are inevitably hotspots – and it’s not just because of global warming. The concentration of traffic, commuter systems, street and indoor lighting, central heating, light industry, tarmac, tiles, bricks, building activity and millions of people can raise temperatures as much as 5C above the surrounding countryside.At present, 87% of US households have air conditioning, and the US – which is not one of the warmer nations – uses more electricity to keep cool than all the other countries of the world combined. To keep the people of Phoenix cool during periods of extreme heat, air conditioning systems can consume more than half of total electricity needs, which puts a strain on power grids.The Arizona scientists simulated a 10-day period of unusually hot weather between 10 July and 19 July, 2009, and used computer models and detailed readings from weather records to analyse the effect of air conditioning systems on local temperatures. Even though the biggest demand for air conditioning was in the daytime, they found the biggest difference was always at night.“Our work demonstrates 1C degree local heating of urban atmospheres in hot and dry cities due to air conditioning use at night time,” said Francisco Salamanca, the report’s lead author. “This increase in outside air temperature in turn results in additional demands for air conditioning.“Sustainable development and optimisation of electricity consumption would require turning wasted heat from air conditioning into useful energy, which can be used inside houses for various purposes − including, for example, water heaters.”Such actions would reduce local air temperatures: in Phoenix alone, they could directly save more than 1200 Megawatt hours of electricity per day.In 2012, the US experienced a set of record-breaking temperatures, and the US Department of Energy has warned that days of extreme heat are expected to become more frequent and more intense because of climate change.But this seems already to be a pattern worldwide, according to recent analyses of climate patterns. And the demand for air conditioning is expected to accelerate in India, China and other emerging economies."

"Children in the US are traumatized by a school shooting roughly every week. Radical religion-fueled vigilantes have bombed abortion clinics and stalked and killed the doctors who perform them. But it's not gun rights or abortion that has Democrats and Republicans most at odds today – it's the science of climate change. “This is sort of an ideal wedge issue, and it’s been exploited that way,” said Lawrence Hamilton, a University of New Hampshire sociology professor who specializes in the study of the environment and social change.  For the past seven years, Hamilton has been contributing science-related questions to the quarterly Granite State Poll conducted by the University of New Hampshire’s Survey Center. Earlier this year, the poll guided 568 randomly selected respondents through a series of questions intended to discern what level of trust the state’s public has in the science community. Historical hot-button social policy topics were included as well. A statistical chasm opened over the recent warming of the planet, an event almost universally ascribed by climate researchers to the emission of greenhouse gases by human industry. While 83% of self-described Democrats agreed with the scientific consensus that the earth is warming chiefly in response to human activities, only 36% of Republicans accepted that conclusion.  It’s a yawning divide of 53 points, far outpacing historically contentious social issues such as support for gun control (69/36), legal abortion (61/35), the death penalty (42/67), and evolution (66/50), in a survey with a four-point margin of error. “Things like abortion appeal to social conservatives but not economic or Wall Street conservatives, whereas climate change cuts across the whole spectrum,” Hamilton said. “It appeals to the social, the economic, and the libertarian, the whole spectrum of conservative ideologies.” But it’s not just ideology at work, said Ben Orlove, director of the Center for Research on Environmental Decisions at Columbia University and sometime Hamilton collaborator. There are also issues of identity in play, particularly among the so-called losers in the post-industrial economy who have grown unabashedly anti-intellectual, skeptical of experts, and opposed to federal regulations, as a rule.  That anti-intellectual pulse has been well channeled by the ultra-conservative tea party wing of the Republican Party, as captured by the New Hampshire poll. When asked if they trusted scientists as a source of information about environmental issues, a majority of Democrats, Independents, and Republicans said yes. A mere 28% of tea party Republicans agreed scientists could be trusted and only 23% were willing to say that humans were the main driver of climate change. Though the poll was limited to New Hampshire residents, Hamilton said that the primacy of climate among a range of divisive policy issues is supported by other polls that he has conducted around the nation. Tom Smith, director of the National Opinion Research Center at the University of Chicago, said he was surprised by the results, cautioning that New England conservatives aren't typically as strident on social issues like abortion. The 55% of New Hampshire residents who believe climate change is both happening now and is due to human activities is right on track with several recent national surveys. A March Gallup poll, for instance, found that 54% of Americans believe that global warming is underway. And a national survey conducted in late 2013 by the Yale Project on Climate Change Communication and George Mason University Center for Climate Change Communication found that 47% of Americans (down from 54% the previous year) believe that global warming is happening and is caused by human activity. That may feel too much like an even split for multinationals to christen any climate-focused ad campaigns, but time (and the facts) would be on their side if they did. Consider that, despite repeated calls of climate change “alarmism” leveled at climate scientists and those who dare to repeat their findings in public, these researchers actually consistently downplay, or “underpredict”, their own findings, according to a 2012 study.  The result has been that sea-level rise, loss of sea ice, and even the pace of greenhouse gas accumulation in the atmosphere have all occurred more quickly than predicted. Part of the reason for this process of ""erring on the side of least drama"", as the authors term the self-censoring behavior, has to do with the fear of being attacked by the fossil-fuel-funded denial industry and their libertarian-leaning allies, many of whom troll climate change stories online to inject doubt. To practice climate science today means risking death threats, just like the abortion doctors of past decades. So what’s a concerned company that wants to promote its good stewardship to do? If you're thinking of marketing to conservatives about the environment, one Canadian expert in climate change communication has an idea: Just don't. “Conservatives resonate to appeals that promise financial savings and ideally do not mention the environment at all,” explains Robert Gifford, a professor of psychology and environmental studies at the University of Victoria in British Columbia. If stakeholders, the board of directors, or your CEO simply insist on addressing the environment, choose your words carefully. Try peppering your copy with the word “purity”, a concept that resonates with that audience, Gifford said. The Yale Project poll bears this out. It found, for instance, that the phrase “global warming” is far more effective than ""climate change"" in generating the belief that researchers both understand what is happening to the planet and that a concerted response is needed. “By contrast”, the report states, “the use of the term climate change appears to actually reduce issue engagement by Democrats, independents, liberals, and moderates, as well as a variety of subgroups within American society, including men, women, minorities, different generations, and across political and partisan lines.” Orlove also recommends ripping a page from Obama’s playbook. When the President rolled out his plan earlier this month to slash 30% of carbon emissions from the nation’s coal plants by 2030, he called in anti-coal allies at the American Lung Association to pair his concern about climate change with more immediate long-documented health care impacts like asthma and premature death. “Coal really has huge underappreciated public health impacts,” Orlove said. “ Yes, we want to decarbonize the economy, but you can link that with other issues rather than make it a stand-alone issue.” Of course, as the saying goes, no good deed goes unpunished. Referring to research he’s done in coastal communities around the nation, Hamilton added that the same party divides documented over climate change have grown across the environmental spectrum. “It sort of bleeds over into trust in scientists generally to support for any other environmental legislation, whether it’s beach pollution, Clean Air Act, endangered species, clean water,” he said. “Clean water was once upon a time a bipartisan thing, but it sure isn’t now.” Greg Harman is an independent journalist based in San Antonio, Texas.

"Civil disobedience is a way of expressing political opposition that pushes beyond what the law allows you to do, in terms of resistance. It is an act that says ""we are deliberately breaking an unjust law."" We often talk about it as a problem. In fact, I would argue that our problem is civil obedience. People too readily accept governments that do not hold to their promises. My first brush with civil disobedience was when I was 15 and in the years since, I've learned a few things about its power, and its limitations. Here's a few of my lessons:  I was one of thousands of young people in South Africa that joined the national student protests against inequality in apartheid education. At that age, you don’t always understand the wider context of your actions. The slogan at the front of the march was “we want equality”, and at the back it was “ we want a colour TV”.  Despite this, what we were doing was important: we were resisting by refusing to go to classes and challenging the law that legally prohibited more than four people to march in the streets together. It was only here that I discovered that Nelson Mandela actually existed, and learned about the bigger picture of apartheid in South Africa. The media were restricted in how much they could report on him and so I had never seen his picture.  Following this I led a protest in my community with between 3,000-4,000 people, where the police charged at us with tear gas. The experience of participating in these acts early on affected me in a very direct sense. They taught me the important lesson that nothing important will come without sacrifice, commitment and courage. South Africa has a strong connection to Gandhi. It was during his time there that he learned his politics, and honed his Satyagraha, which means passive resistance or civil disobedience as we now tend to call it.  There was always a photo of Gandhi in my family home and he was an influential figure for me as I was growing up. I developed a strong adherence to his notion of ""soul force"". For me, this translated as the importance of being willing to take the violence of the state. The moral authority to take this stance means that ultimately you will succeed in your mission.  My favourite quote is from Gandhi and it is one that is so relevant to civil disobedience today: “First they ignore you, then they laugh at you, then they fight you, and then you win”. If you look at the situation Greenpeace is in, they are fighting us really hard in the courts, they are invading our privacy and preventing our actions. But Gandhi's philosophy makes me optimistic that this is a positive indication that we are closing in on the changes we are campaigning for.  The power of civil disobedience as a strategy lies in its moral authority. If you have numbers, diversity of voices, and are able to maintain a peaceful event, then it can be immensely powerful. It speaks to the oppressed and the oppressor in different ways. To the oppressed, or the people affected, it gives them strength to continue their struggle. To the oppressors, exceptional acts of moral courage force them to listen. The recent Arctic 30 campaign and the arrests it incurred on many activists, myself included, is a good example of this. It is clear that when I was up a rig on the oil ship being bombarded with water for 15 hours, I wasn’t doing it for selfish reasons, and nor were any of the Arctic 30 doing it for personal gain. It was remarkable how many heads of state then came out and called for the release of the arrested activists. Governments badly miscalculate when they respond to civil disobedience by throwing activists in prison and assuming this will terrify the public. In fact, the effect is always the opposite: it helps to grow the movement. It forces those in power to recalibrate and recognise the democratic intent of what activists are trying to achieve.  You could say most acts of civil disobedience fail because they don’t get results immediately. In the case of Arctic 30 they failed because oil was eventually drilled and removed from the area. But on the flipside, we now have more than 10 million people campaigning to have the Arctic declared a global sanctuary with no industrial activities. It is important to remember that not everything that counts can be measured.  We can learn from those who have engaged in civil disobedience in the past that it wasn’t their first action that delivered their result. For Martin Luther King or Rosa Parks, it was an accumulation of lots of different actions over a long time. Wikileaks and the Edward Snowden NSA revelations created an opportunity for people to know what governments were hiding from them and have changed the whole debate around privacy. These are good examples of digital civil disobedience.  I think the social media space has thrown up a lot of possibilities for civil disobedience, protest and the strengthening of civil society generally. When you look at resistance during the Arab spring, people used Facebook to spread the word, Twitter to tell people where to be when, and YouTube to document and share what they experienced and what they achieved. The question is what laws do you break online in terms of pushing that space? At Greenpeace we are trying to make sense of this new area but the future looks promising. Today, unlike 50 years ago there are lots of forums for engagement between civil society and those in business and government. This is evident at UN meetings, where national civil society groups are invited to take part of the consultative process. I think we’ve long chased after some sort of explosion of democracy, and the idea that success would be when governments wanted to talk to us. But I think we should beware of the value of some of these engagements. Sometimes they are more insults than anything else, just a box-ticking exercise. We may need a different measure of meaningful progress.

"During his speech at West Point Military Academy earlier this week, President Barack Obama described climate change as a ""creeping national security crisis"" that will require the armed forces to ""respond to refugee flows, natural disasters, and conflicts over water and food."" The speech emphasised that US foreign policy in the 21st century is increasingly being honed in recognition of heightened risks of social, political and economic upheaval around the world due the impacts of global warming.   A more detailed insight into US military planning could be seen in the report published a couple of weeks earlier by the Center for Naval Analyses (CNA) Military Advisory Board, written and endorsed by a dozen or so senior retired US generals. Describing climate change as a not just a ""threat multiplier,"" but now - even worse - a ""catalyst for conflict"", the study concluded that environmental impacts from climate change in coming decades:  "".... will aggravate stressors abroad, such as poverty, environmental degradation, political instability and social tensions - conditions that can enable terrorist activity and other forms of violence."" To be sure, the link between climate change and the risk of violence is supported by many independent studies. No wonder, reports NBC News citing various former and active US officials, the Pentagon has long been mapping out strategies ""to protect US interests in the aftermath of massive floods, water shortages and famines that are expected to hit and decimate unstable nations."" But the era of climate warfare is not laying in wait, in some far-flung distant future. It has already begun, and it is accelerating - faster than most predicted. Pentagon officials and the CNA's new study point to the Arab Spring upheavals across the Middle East and North Africa as a prime example. As I've argued previously, violence and unrest in Syria and Egypt can be linked not just to the regional impacts of climate change in terms of water scarcity and food production, but also their complex interconnections with domestic oil and gas scarcity, neoliberal austerity, rampant inequality, endemic corruption, and massive political repression. Such cases show that climate change in itself does not drive conflict - but the way in which climate change interacts with multiple related factors like declining oil production, food prices, and overlapping political, cultural and economic processes is already generating wild cards that repressive states are ill-equipped to deal with. In that context, such states resort to the thing they do best in an increasingly uncertain world: more repression. As the UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) has warned in its latest climate impacts assessment, though, more repression just makes things even worse, triggering a vicious cycle of increasing vulnerabilty to climate destabilisation. A new study accepted for publication in the July issue of the American Meteorological Society's journal Weather, Climate, and Society, underscores the role of climate change and drought in Syria's ongoing civil war, which by some accounts has taken the lives of over 150,000 people.  The research paper by Dr Peter Gleick demonstrates clearly that the Syrian conflict is not just a climate war, or a resource war, but a water war. Between 2006 and 2011, the country suffered the worst long-term drought and the most severe set of crop failures in recorded history.  This was compounded by water mismanagement and economic deterioration which, in turn, led to further agricultural failures, population dislocations and the migration of rural communities to nearby cities. The resulting combination of urban unemployment, inequality and food insecurity, affecting over a million people, heightened sectarian tensions, and helped spark the social unrest that exploded into conflict. But the destabilising role of climate change in Syria did not come to light solely with hindsight - US officials were aware for years of the risks. In his paper, Dr Gleick, who is president of the Pacific Institute for Studies in Development, Environment and Security - refers to leaked US diplomatic cables from the US embassy in Damascus to the State Department in Washington DC warning of the implications of the unprecedented drought. In Gleick's words:  ""That cable describes a briefing by FAO Syrian Representative Abdullah bin Yehia on drought impacts, which he described as a 'perfect storm' when combined with other economic and social pressure. Concerns expressed at that time also noted that the population displacements 'could act as a multiplier on social and economic pressures already at play and undermine stability in Syria.'"" The response of the US national security apparatus (and that of its poodlish ally Britain) to such warnings is instructive. As I wrote in The Guardian last year, from 2009 through to 2011, US and UK special forces were training ""Syrian opposition forces"" with a view to elicit the ""collapse"" of Bashir al-Assad's regime ""from within.""  While that oil-soaked, blood-drenched geopolitical gamble appears to have failed, the US and regional partner Israel have accommodated themselves to what the New York Times described as a ""horrific"" status quo that is nevertheless ""preferable to either a victory by Mr. Assad's government and his Iranian backers or a strengthening of rebel groups, increasingly dominated by Sunni jihadis."" The west, adds America's newspaper of record, ""needs more time to prop up opposition forces it finds more palatable."" And this, indeed, is the problem: Viewed through the narrow, self-serving, systematically abused lens of 'national security' (which of course is the noble title of the American intelligence agency responsible for mass surveillance of entire populations), climate change becomes not a springboard for much-need social transformation to save the planet; instead it becomes the beaten-to-death horse justifying innovative new ways to save the profits of the few who run the planet.  Take a look at the CNA's thoughts on climate change and Africa, for instance. Africa is ""an increasingly important source of US oil and gas imports,"" but is ""suffering tension and stress resulting from weakgovernance"" and ""food and water shortages"" to be exacerbated by climate change. The Pentagon's new Africa Command thus ""reflects Africa's emerging strategic importance to the US."" A ""worsening ofconditions"" due to climate impacts ""could prompt further US militaryengagement."" So far the record hasn't been spectacular. Consider how the US and UK have tacitly overseen the expansion of Islamist extremism across North Africa at the behest of client-regime-aka-terror-state Algeria - all to access its oil and gas; a short-sighted strategy that indirectly led to the recent Nigeria crisis. The securitisation of climate change - and with it the entire planet - is not leading to meaningful transformative action to transform the social relations necessary to mitigate and prevent dangerous global warming. Instead, while climate change accelerates, the corporate-military-industrial complex accelerates profits. Indeed, the very companies most responsible for climate change are set to make a killing from its intensification. ""I think climate change is a real opportunity for the aerospace and defense industry,"" said Lord Drayson, then British Minister of State for Strategic Defence Acquisition Reform, in 2009.  One of the world's largest defence contractors, Raytheon, agrees. In a briefing to the Carbon Disclosure Project last year, the corporation said that ""expanded business opportunities will arise"" as a result of ""security concerns and their possible consequences,"" due to the ""effects of climate change"" both at home and abroad in the form of ""storms, droughts, and floods."" This is what happens when one views the world, even with the best of intentions, through the twin lenses of military might and economic clout. We become incapable of recognising that the fundamental obstacle to addressing our global challenges is that we see enemies everywhere.  Climate change can create security risks, but to deal with them seriously, we need to stop projecting and recognise our own hand in the violence we're so terrified of out there.

"President Obama just announced a major effort to reduce global-warming gases from United States power plants. These new rules, and his prior strong actions on climate change, signify a major shift for the United States. No longer is the U.S. the world laggard on dealing with climate change - we are quickly becoming the leader.  We finally have a president that understands science. We finally have a president that honestly includes scientists as decision makers – rather than effectively muzzle them. We finally have a president that recognizes the social and economic costs of climate change. We finally have a president who is charting a pathway that may lead us to bend the curve of emissions downward so that the most serious climate change consequences are avoided.  Most importantly, we finally have a president who is a world leader. The new rules are expected to result in a significant reduction of greenhouse gas emissions from existing power plants – among the worst carbon pollution sources in the U.S. and around the world. These standards are probably the most important issued by the Administration to meet their goals of reducing greenhouse gases emissions by 2020. To put this action in perspective, it must be considered as a latest step in U.S. actions. Under Obama, the United States has already issue new rules for increasing fuel efficiency for vehicles – rules that simultaneously save money while slowing global warming. His administration has also worked with international partners (such as China) to target emissions of specific greenhouse gas other than carbon dioxide. The president's administration has also developed new rules for future coal plants. So, the latest action comes in a long line of significant progress. What makes this new step important is the applicability to already-built power plants. While details of the plan are still emerging, it appears that the rules will be based on the National Resources Defense Council recommendations. Currently, some U.S. states are already taking climate change seriously. For instance, some have adopted renewable energy standards. But, these actions are not replicated across the entire country. With these new rules, and by authority granted to the EPA by the Supreme Court, each state would, in effect, be audited. Many states that are currently leading on this issue will likely continue their current trajectory. Other states that have delayed and denied on climate change will be forced to be more aggressive.  All of this makes sense. In order to solve this problem, we need all parties to work together. We cannot stop climate change by just asking a few thoughtful states to bear the burden for the irresponsible states. This also makes sense because for too long, the delay and deny camps have argued that it is too expensive to deal with climate change. We now know that it is too expensive to do nothing. Using our energy more wisely and reducing pollution will save us money, create the new energy economy of the future, and preserve our world. It will also limit the incredibly high costs we could face in the future from extreme weather. Taking these actions just makes economic and ethical sense. Already the usual suspects are opposing Obama. Some of them are trying to say that these rules by themselves are not going to stop climate change. Of course this is misleading. I could find 100 polluters, each who contributes 1% of the problem who would say, “my contribution is small, it just doesn’t matter”.  One reason why this is important is it helps set the U.S. as the world leader. Now, we can engage in international discussions on climate change from a position of authority and leadership. We are already taking actions so we can ask others to come along.  Dr. Joe Romm, who was formerly acting Assistant Secretary of Energy during the Clinton administration, agreed. He told me,    “These rules, modest though they are, establish President Obama as the first president to take serious action on climate change. They affirm his commitment to achieve the 17% economy-wide reduction he committed to in 2009 before the Copenhagen climate treaty. And they put pressure on every other major country to make equally serious commitments in the lead up to be 2015 Paris conference, which will be so crucial in determining whether the nations of the world act together to preserve a livable climate or will continue on this wantonly self-destructive path.”  The other accomplishment set forth by this announcement is that it firmly puts environmental stewardship in Democratic politics. Readers of this blog know that I’ve often stated that inaction on climate change characterized both major political parties in the U.S. But that has changed now. Now, real action is being taken by a U.S. President.   It will no doubt be opposed by politicians who would trade our world’s future for today’s profit and campaign donations. But with climate change impacting us in more significant ways, the larger public is waking up to the realization that the deniers and delayers, from politicians from Oklahoma and Texas, to coal-funded anti-science lobby organizations, have sold us a bill of worthless goods. Can you imagine, a President of the U.S. with a well publicized effort to articulate the importance of climate change and the need for action? It's the dawn of a new day. The history books are being written right now. "

"The days of ""king corn"" could be numbered as climate change brings higher temperatures and water shortages to America's farmland, a new report warned on Wednesday. Nearly one-third of US farmland is devoted to raising corn and the country produces about 40% of the world's corn crop. But the $1.7tn (£1tn) industry – the equivalent of Australia's GDP – is under threat from water shortages, heatwaves and unpredictable rainfall caused by climate change. ""Corn is an essential input to our economy, and climate change, water scarcity and pollution are a critical threat to that sector going forward,"" said Brooke Barton, director of the water programme at the Ceres green investor network and author of the report. The report amplifies warnings earlier this year from United Nations climate scientists and the National Climate Assessment that America's agricultural industry – and specifically its corn crop – was at risk from the high temperatures and water shortages anticipated under climate change. In the case of corn, however, there are potentially trillions at stake because the industry now touches on almost every aspect of the American economy. Corn production has doubled over the past 20 years and on its own was worth $65bn last year. But corn supplies a vast spread of industries. The 45 largest companies in the corn production chain together account for about $1.7tn in earnings, the report said. Some 40% of the crop now goes for production of ethanol. Another 35% of the crop is grown for animal feed, but corn is used across the economy. ""It is fed to the cattle that become Big Mac. It is in the ethanol that goes into the gasoline we buy,"" Barton said. ""It's in the snackfoods that we buy, even in some of the plastics in the products we buy. It is in laundry detergents. It's everywhere."" But the crop carries a heavy environmental toll. Corn uses the most water for irrigation of any crop, and accounts for half of all fertiliser use. Some of that corn is raised in areas experiencing water shortages because of over-use and recurring droughts, such as California's Central Valley or the high plains states of Kansas and Nebraska. About 20% of corn production is in irrigated areas. Most of those areas, about 87%, are undergoing water shortages. Corn production is threatening dwindling groundwater reserves, the report said. The heavy use of fertiliser also imposes costs. Fertiliser for corn production is the single largest cause of the dead zone in the Gulf of Mexico. About 10% of fertiliser used on corn ends up as run-off, polluting water supplies across the mid-west, the report said. It estimated some $420m in fertiliser was washed into the Gulf last year, depleting oxygen levels and killing off marine life. The report goes on to urge farmers and food producers to work together to reduce those climate-related risks and the environmental costs of growing corn. Recent studies have found corn at high risk from the higher temperatures, changing rainfall patterns, and water shortages caused by climate change. Corn plants are especially sensitive to heatwaves and drought. A report in Science last month found that growers were having more trouble than initially expected in adapting to hotter and drier conditions. Over the years, farmers in the mid-west have taken advantage of new corn varieties that are more resistant to pests and have more water-resistant roots by planting corn plants closer together. But the Science study found those densely planted fields were even more vulnerable to heat and water stress. The scientists said growers in the mid-west could lose as much as 15% of their yield within the next 50 years."
"A cargo believed to be Europe's first major shipment of tar sands oil arrived in Spain this week, as European policymakers proposed scrapping the requirement that such oil be labeled as more polluting than other forms of crude. 570,000 barrels of Western Canada Select heavy blend crude, originally from Canada, arrived in Spain's port of Bilbao in the middle of this week, said a spokesman for Repsol.   The shipment, which he said was a first for the Spanish oil and gas company, is part of a pilot project to test the capacity of its refineries to process the heavy grade crude.  ""We're trying to give a future for oil refining in Europe, where many refineries have been shutting down in recent years,"" he said. ""We share environmental concerns but we think the solution is in efficiency and technology."" Producing oil from tar sands generates higher greenhouse gas emissions than conventional oil. It has also been criticised for the amount of water needed to extract it. In anticipation of the shipment, Spanish environmentalists held a protest at the port of Bilbao last week. Mariano González of Ecologists in Action said ""this was a good occasion to raise awareness about what's happening and express our disapproval. The group is planning to continue its protests. ""That was just our first action in coordinating a rejection of the entry of this type of oil into Europe,"" he told the Guardian.  The fact that this week's cargo is a test shipment, he said, gave a sense of urgency. ""It's likely that if the EU doesn't do something, tar sands oil will start to arrive in massive quantities to Europe."" Currently Europe imports about 4,000 barrels per day of tar sands oil, he said. A report by US-based green group, the Natural Resource Defense Council, estimated that current imports of tar sands oil could skyrocket to more than 700,000 barrels per day by 2020 if planned pipelines in the US and Canada are approved and built.  Reports emerged this week that European policymakers are poised to do away with the methodology that would have seen fuels derived from tar sands labeled as more polluting as compared to conventional forms of crude.  The fuel quality directive, approved by EU member states in 2009, mandates a 6% reduction in greenhouse gas emission from fuel by 2020. One proposal to achieve this goal was to designate oil from tar sands as 25% more polluting as compared to other forms of crude. The Canadian government has spent years lobbying against the proposal, arguing that it unfairly singles out Canadian crude. EU member states failed to reach an agreement over the proposal. According to a draft document seen by Reuters, EU policymakers have proposed changes to the directive that would require companies to report an EU-wide average of the emissions for raw materials, rather than having fuel suppliers divulge the carbon footprint for the original crude oil used to make their product. The changes could eliminate potential hurdles for Canada in selling tar sands oil to Europe.  Speaking to reporters after G7 talks in Brussels this week, Canadian prime minister Stephen Harper didn't mention by name the changes, but pushed the idea that Europe should be embracing oil from Canada as a secure source of energy, particularly given the crisis in Ukraine.  ""We don't see the crisis in Ukraine as simply an opportunity to market Canadian products, but obviously we're deeply engaged in an discussion with our allies on how we can make sure that globally our energy supplies are secure and stable,"" said Harper.  The changes to the fuel quality directive are still being discussed by the EU executive, reported Reuters. The final directive is expected to be published next month and then must be approved by EU member states and the parliament."

"The reappearance of the sun has not done everything to restore people’s faith in the constancy of climate. During the several weeks when it seemed as if winter would not give way to spring, let alone summer, it was only natural to wonder whether some permanent change had taken place in the world’s climate. Now that it seems there will be summer after all, the sense of insecurity irrationally remains. Is there some great change of climate under way? The answer, as it turns out, is most probably that there is. As evidence of climate in prehistory is accumulated, it becomes more and more evident that slow changes are continually taking place. Not merely was there an Ice Age nearly 11,000 years ago. On several occasions in the 1880s and 1890s the Thames froze during winters colder than any in recent memory. The river was still more thickly covered with ice in the seventeenth century; in 1680 there were eleven inches of ice on the Thames.  The chances are that these continual processes of change which have taken place in the last several thousand years are even now working in one way or another on the world’s climate. This proposition is not in dispute. To know what changes may be under way at the moment is more difficult. There are some signs that the gradual warming up of the atmosphere which marked the first half of this century may have come to an end with the Second World War, and that a slow decline of temperature may then have taken over. It is not exceptional for the average annual temperature to vary by several degrees centigrade from one year to another. One year may be hot and the next may be cold, and there is apparently no more pattern in the variations than in the results of tossing a succession of pennies. Only the comparison of these fluctuations over a period of decades will show accurately the slow changes of climate.  The average temperature of the Northern Hemisphere increased by something like half a degree (C) during the century starting in 1840. For most of this interval the average warming of the atmosphere brought about the retreat of glaciers in Northern Europe and the melting of the ice in the Arctic. Thus parts of the sea bordering on the Arctic which were locked by ice in winter as recently as half a century ago have now become navigable. The Russians and Canadians particularly have reaped substantial benefits by gaining access to northern ports for longer periods. British fishermen are less happy because they now have to follow fish such as cod much farther north. More recently the process of climatic change seems - for a reason not properly understood - to have carried hurricanes farther inland on the eastern seaboard of the United States. As yet the signs are inconclusive that the warming tendency of the last century has now come to an end, though evidence is accumulating to support this conclusion. The retreat of some glaciers in North America and in Switzerland and Scandinavia appears to have halted. Elsewhere some glaciers are actually advancing, while others continue to retreat. Given the lack of systematic records of a typical collection of glaciers (and some understanding of how their length should vary with climate) it is hard to rely on evidence like this. But support is also provided by the collection of statistics about temperature and rainfall, incomplete though these are. The signs are that the decades to come will see a halt to the warming process, or even its reversal. This is an edited extract, click to read on."

"A widely reported ""pause"" in global warming may be an artefact of scientists looking at the wrong data, says a climate scientist at the European Space Agency. Global average surface temperatures rose rapidly from the 1970s but have been relatively flat for the past 15 years. This has prompted speculation from some quarters that global warming has stalled.  Now, Stephen Briggs from the European Space Agency's Directorate of Earth Observation says that surface air temperature data is the worst indicator of global climate that can be used, describing it as ""lousy"". ""It is like looking at the last hair on the tail of a dog and trying to decide what breed it is,"" he said on Friday at the Royal Society in London. Climate scientists have been arguing for some time that the lack of rising temperatures is due to most of the extra heat being taken up by the deep ocean. A better measure, he said, was to look at the average rise in sea levels. The oceans store the vast majority of the climate's heat energy. Increases in this stored energy translate into sea level rises. ""Sea level is a very good integrator of different indicators of climate change,"" said Briggs. In the past 50 years, ocean temperature has indicated that the stored energy has increased by 250 zetajoules, he said. A zetajoule is 1021 joules. For comparison, mankind generates 0.5 zetajoules of energy every year in its power stations. Since 1993, satellites have measured sea levels rising by an average of 3mm per year. Unlike the surface air temperature, this rise continued throughout the supposed pause in global warming. Christopher Merchant at the University of Reading has been working to understand why the increase in the stored energy has not translated into an increase in surface temperature. ""There are a number of contributions and a picture is emerging,"" he says. Those contributions include the cooling effect of aerosols from Asian industrialisation, natural variability in the climate system and solar variability. In March, climate scientists identified another potentially important contribution. The trade winds across the Pacific have strengthened in the past decade, which could be helping to drive a deep circulation of water that traps heat in the depths of the ocean, leaving the surface relatively unaffected for now. Scientists are now trying to simulate the behaviour using computer models. This is difficult because the behaviour of the deep ocean is too poorly known to be reliably included. ""The models don't have the skill we thought they had. That's the problem,"" said Peter Jan van Leeuwen, director of the National Centre of Earth Observation at the University of Reading. Building reliable computer models is dependent on knowing which parameters are important to the climate, and over the past decade scientists have homed in on the key parameters of the Earth's system. They call these the Essential Climate Variables or ECVs. There are 50 of them and they include measurable quantities such as air pressure and temperature, sea ice cover, ocean colour, ozone and carbon dioxide content. Another problem in building computer models has been knowing how to compare measurements taken by different satellites. Instruments and techniques change and each has its own quirks. So, even if two instruments have measured the same property, it can be like comparing apples with oranges. The Esa Climate Change Initiative (CCI) is a €88m programme, active since 2009, to address this and produce a trustworthy set of ECV data that can be accessed by all. It has transformed the entire 30-year-old data archives of Esa and its member states' Earth observation satellites into a number of long-term, calibrated data sets. Ruth Boumphrey, head of Earth observation at the UK Space Agency, said, ""CCI allows us to put trust into our climate observations. This is a paradigm shift for how we look at our planet. Even if we don't agree on the interpretation of the data, we can now all agree on what has been measured."" Smartphone apps for scientists and the general public will be released in the coming weeks to allow them to access this data. In addition, a workshop for app developers is taking place at Esa's Esrin centre, Italy, in September to develop new ideas and concepts for other apps that use Esa's satellite Earth observation data. ""The data from CCI will really help us build better models of the Earth's climate,"" said van Leeuwen. Esa operates a fleet of Earth observation satellites. The latest, Sentinel-1, was launched on 4 April 2014 and is the first satellite in the Copernicus Earth observation programme. To foster trust and transparency in climate science, all data will be made accessible to anyone who wants it through the CCI initiative. • This article was amended on 17 June 2014. An editing error meant Stephen Briggs was quoted as saying that sea surface temperature data was a ""lousy"" indicator of global climate. He was actually talking about surface air temperature.

"Rupert Murdoch’s The Wall Street Journal editorial page has long published op-eds denying basic climate science. This week, they published an editorial denying the 97% expert scientific consensus that humans are causing global warming. The editorial may have been published as a damage control effort in the wake of John Oliver’s brilliant and hilarious global warming debate viral video, which has now surpassed 3 million views. After all, fossil fuel interests and Republican political strategists have been waging a campaign to obscure public awareness of the expert consensus on global warming for nearly three decades. The Wall Street Journal editorial was written by Joseph Bast, president of the Heartland Institute political advocacy group of Unabomber billboard infamy, and Roy Spencer of “global warming Nazis” infamy. Spencer previously claimed in testimony to US Congress to be part of the 97% consensus, although his research actually falls within the less than 3% fringe minority of papers that minimize or reject the human influence on global warming.   Spencer’s claim to the contrary was a result of failing to understand the consensus research he referenced. In The Wall Street Journal this week, Spencer and Bast continued that tradition of misunderstanding and misrepresenting the scientific literature on the expert global warming consensus. For example, in order to reject the findings of the paper my colleagues and I published last year finding a 97% consensus on human-caused global warming in the peer-reviewed literature, Bast and Spencer referenced a critical comment subsequently published by David Legates et al. in an obscure off-topic journal called Science and Education. That paper was based on a blog post written by Christopher Monckton, who's infamous for calling environmental activists “Hitler Youth.” Monckton's blog post and paper tried to deny the consensus by ignoring 98% of the papers that endorse it. He compared only papers that explicitly quantified the human contribution to global warming to the full sample of all peer-reviewed papers that mention the phrases “global warming” or “global climate change.”  By that standard, there’s less than a 1% expert consensus on evolution, germ theory, and heliocentric theory, because there are hardly any papers in those scientific fields that bother to say something so obvious as, for example, “the Earth revolves around the sun.” The same is true of human-caused global warming. That Bast and Spencer refer to Monckton and Legates’ fundamentally wrong paper in an obscure off-topic journal as “more reliable research” reveals their bias in only considering denial “reliable.” Bast and Spencer didn’t just limit their misrepresentations to our paper; they spread the wealth to all of the big global warming consensus studies. The first was done by Naomi Oreskes and published in Science in 2004, finding that in a sample of 928 peer-reviewed climate research abstracts, none rejected human-caused global warming. Bast and Spencer claimed, “scores of articles by prominent [contrarian] scientists … who question the consensus, were excluded.”  This is inaccurate; their ‘skeptical’ papers simply weren’t represented in Oreskes’ sample of 928 papers, which isn’t surprising since these contrarian papers account for less than 3% of the peer-reviewed global warming research. Oreskes’ sample also didn’t capture tens of thousands of other climate papers that are consistent with the 97% consensus. That’s why it’s called a sample. Bast and Spencer also argued that abstracts don’t necessarily accurately reflect the content of a complete scientific paper, which could be a weakness in Oreskes’ study, given that she only considered the abstracts. However, our study last year included ratings of over 2,000 full papers by the scientist authors themselves. The result? Once again, a 97% consensus on human-caused global warming. Next came a survey of Earth scientists by Doran & Zimmerman in 2009, and a survey of public statements made by climate researchers by Anderegg and colleagues in 2010, both again finding a 97% consensus on human-caused global warming among climate experts. In their opinion article, Bast and Spencer tried to reject these studies as having relatively small sample sizes.  However, their results were consistent with those in our study, which had a much larger sample size. We found 10,356 scientists whose published climate research has stated a position on human-caused global warming. Among those 10,356 scientists, 98.4% endorsed the consensus. In addition to these consensus studies, at least 80 National Academies of Science and dozens of scientific organizations from around the world agree with the consensus; none oppose it. Instead of accepting these consistent results that have been published in prestigious peer-reviewed journals like Science, the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, and Environmental Research Letters, Spencer and Bast choose to believe some less robust data that they find more convenient.  The first source they cite is a survey of members of the American Meteorological Society, in which only 13% of participants described climate science as their area of expertise. Worse yet, Bast and Spencer also referenced the Oregon Petition, which can be signed by anyone with just about any college science degree, and which has included “signatures” from fictional characters and Spice Girls. After complaining about the relatively small sample sizes of climate experts in previous surveys, Bast and Spencer instead put their trust in two documents that mostly include non-climate experts. Bast and Spencer also tried to downplay the expert consensus, arguing that climate scientists don’t specify that global warming is “dangerous.” What we each consider dangerous is subjective and not scientific – some people think that driving 100 miles per hour in a rain storm isn’t dangerous. However, if the 97% expert consensus is right, it means we’re in for several more degrees of global warming if we continue on a business-as-usual path.  Climate Science Watch lists some key climate reports that summarize the “disruptive” and “highly damaging” threats we face from the impacts of further global warming. According to the IPCC, over 40% of global species will face increasing risk of extinction in a business-as-usual scenario. Glacier retreats will threaten water supplies in Central Asia and South America. Global sea level will rise in excess of 1 meter. We’re probably currently experiencing global warming at a rate unprecedented for the past 11,000 years. Scientists tend to shy away from making subjective assessments about what’s “dangerous,” but those are the types of threats climate scientists tell us we face from continued global warming. Bottom line – the 97% expert scientific consensus on human-caused global warming is real. It presents a strong litmus test; those who deny this reality aren’t interested in good faith discussions about climate change. They’re simply in denial. We’re well past the point where we need to stop “debating” established facts like human-caused global warming and the 97% expert consensus. If Murdoch’s The Wall Street Journal keeps publishing editorials that flat-out deny reality, especially from people who compare those they disagree with to terrorists and Nazis, it will lose credibility and fall by the wayside as the rest of the world moves on to debate how to best solve the problem."
"The US secretary of state, John Kerry, launched a new global effort on Wednesday to save oceans “under siege” from over-fishing, plastic pollution and climate change. Kerry said he hoped to build momentum for the protection effort at a two-day summit at the State Department next week.  The 16-17 June gathering will for the first time bring together world leaders, business executives, scientists, and environmental activists in an attempt to deal with major threats to oceans. “Increasingly, the ocean is threatened,” Kerry told a small group of reporters at the State Department. “The world's oceans, as vast as they are, as much as they elicit a sense of awe for size and power, they are under siege.” Next week's summit offers Kerry a chance to elevate those concerns in the public arena. State Department officials said the conference is an important start to a much broader effort to mobilise the international community around ocean protection. For Kerry the issue is personal. He said he been passionate about the oceans since he was a small child growing up in Massachusetts and as a young man serving in the navy. In the Senate, Kerry was known as a champion on both oceans and climate change. He told reporters he had worked for years to end drift net fishing – which he likened to strip mining. Next week's summit is an attempt to get the international community to focus on three major threats: over-fishing, pollution, and acidification, which is caused by climate change. In recent years, there has been growing concern about the threat to food security from over-fishing. Global fisheries stocks are severely depleted – from illegal and unsustainable fishing, and because of changing migration patterns under climate change. “Most of the world's fisheries are being overfished,” Kerry said. New technologies made it easier to monitor shipping vessels on the high seas and even track catches from ship to port. But Kerry acknowledged there remained a big gap between regulations and enforcement. “The problem is there is a great debate over the science. There is a great battle over who is right and how do you base a regulatory rule on something if you don't really know,” he said. Officials and some environmental groups said they hoped the summit would spur efforts to get the public to commit to only buy sustainable seafood, as a way of safeguarding severely depleted fishing stocks. There was growing anticipation that American and British officials would commit to new marine protection areas, which would allow some stocks to recover. There could also be moves by some companies to sign on to efforts to collect their plastic products, before they end up as ocean debris. The State Department said it also hoped to set specific targets for reducing plastic that goes into the sea, as well as fertiliser run-off which is polluting water ways and adding to ocean dead zones. But Kerry faces only limited scope for concrete results. State Department officials said they expected perhaps a handful of prime ministers and presidents at the summit, mostly from small island states. There is virtually no chance of getting any action from Congress, so long as it remains dominated by Republicans. But Kerry and officials said they hoped the mix of guests at the summit could help unlock efforts to deal with ocean threats. The conference would be part of a longstanding initiative to elevate oceans as part of foreign policy. “We want to come out of it with an action agenda,” he said."
"If we had set out to alienate and antagonise the people we've been trying to reach, we could scarcely have done it better. This is how I feel, looking back on the past few decades of environmental campaigning, including my own. This thought is prompted by responses to the column I wrote last week. It examined the psychological illiteracy that's driving leftwing politics into oblivion. It argued that the failure by Labour and Democratic party strategists to listen to psychologists and cognitive linguists has resulted in a terrible mistake: the belief that they can best secure their survival by narrowing the distance between themselves and their conservative opponents.  Twenty years of research, comprehensively ignored by these parties, reveals that shifts such as privatisation and cutting essential public services strongly promote people's extrinsic values (an attraction to power, prestige, image and status) while suppressing intrinsic values (intimacy, kindness, self-acceptance, independent thought and action). As extrinsic values are powerfully linked to conservative politics, pursuing policies that reinforce them is blatantly self-destructive. One of the drivers of extrinsic values is a sense of threat. Experimental work suggests that when fears are whipped up, they trigger an instinctive survival response. You suppress your concern for other people and focus on your own interests. Conservative strategists seem to know this, which is why they emphasise crime, terrorism, deficits and immigration. ""Isn't this what you've spent your life doing?"" several people asked. ""Emphasising threats?"" It took me a while. If threats promote extrinsic values and if (as the research strongly suggests) extrinsic values are linked to a lack of interest in the state of the living planet, I've been engaged in contradiction and futility. For about 30 years. The threats, of course, are of a different nature: climate breakdown, mass extinction, pollution and the rest. And they are real. But there's no obvious reason why the results should be different. Terrify the living daylights out of people, and they will protect themselves at the expense of others and of the living world. It's an issue taken up in a report by several green groups called Common Cause for Nature. ""Provoking feelings of threat, fear or loss may successfully raise the profile of an issue,"" but ""these feelings may leave people feeling helpless and increasingly demotivated, or even inclined to actively avoid the issue"". People respond to feelings of insecurity ""by attempting to exert control elsewhere, or retreating into materialistic comforts"". Where we have not used threat and terror, we have tried money: an even graver mistake. Nothing better reinforces extrinsic values than putting a price on nature, or appealing to financial self-interest. It doesn't work, even on its own terms. A study published in Nature Climate Change tested two notices placed in a filling station. One asked: ""Want to protect the environment? Check your car's tyre pressure."" The other tried: ""Want to save money? Check your car's tyre pressure."" The first was effective, the second useless. We've tended to assume people are more selfish than they really are. Surveys across 60 countries show that most people consistently hold concern for others, tolerance, kindness and thinking for themselves to be more important than wealth, image and power. But those whose voices are loudest belong to a small minority with the opposite set of values. And often, idiotically, we have sought to appease them. This is a form of lying – to ourselves and other people. I don't know anyone who became an environmentalist because she or he was worried about ecological impacts on their bank balance. Almost everyone I know in this field is motivated by something completely different: the love and wonder and enchantment nature inspires. Yet, perhaps because we fear we will not be taken seriously, we scarcely mention them. We hide our passions behind columns of figures. Sure, we need the numbers and the rigour and the science, but we should stop pretending these came first. Without being fully conscious of the failure and frustration that's been driving it, I've been trying, like others, to promote a positive environmentalism, based on promise, not threat. This is what rewilding, the mass restoration of ecosystems, is all about; and why I wrote my book Feral, which is a manifesto for rewilding – and for wonder and enchantment. But I'm beginning to see that this is not just another method: expounding a positive vision should be at the centre of attempts to protect the things we love. An ounce of hope is worth a ton of despair. Part of this means changing the language. The language we use to describe our relations with nature could scarcely be more alienating. ""Reserve"" is alienation itself, or at least detachment: think of what it means when you apply that word to people. ""Site of special scientific interest"", ""no-take zone"", ""ecosystem services"": these terms are a communications disaster. Even ""environment"" is a cold and distancing word, which creates no pictures. These days I tend to use natural world or living planet, which invoke vivid images. One of the many tasks for the rewilding campaign some of us will be launching in the next few months is to set up a working group to change the language. There's a parallel here with the Landreader project by the photographer Dominick Tyler, which seeks to rescue beautiful words describing nature from obscurity. None of this is to suggest that we should not discuss the threats or pretend that the crises faced by this magnificent planet are not happening. Or that we should cease to employ rigorous research and statistics. What it means is that we should embed both the awareness of these threats and their scientific description in a different framework: one that emphasises the joy and awe to be found in the marvels at risk; one that proposes a better world, rather than (if we work really hard for it), just a slightly-less-shitty-one-than-there-would-otherwise-have-been. Above all, this means not abandoning ourselves to attempts to appease a minority who couldn't give a cuss about the living world, but think only of their wealth and power. Be true to yourself and those around you, and you will find the necessary means of reaching others. • Twitter: @georgemonbiot. A fully referenced version of this article can be found at monbiot.com"
"US president Barack Obama has laid out his legacy on one of the issues that will define the world long after his brief term in power is over. He has been frustrated in several other attempts to bring climate change to the fore of US politics, with the demise of cap and trade plans a notable failure, but his move to use the Environmental Protection Agency to cap carbon emissions is his boldest effort yet, trying to circumvent the Congressional stalemate on the issue using his constitutional powers. Climate change is one of the trickiest issues to face for any leader. A long-term problem manifesting first in the poorest regions of the world, that will only make serious inroads into developed economies long after a current politician's half-life is spent. Vested and highly profitable interests – party donors, indeed, and pension funds – that rely on fossil fuels. Contrarian attacks on the clear science that tells us the world is warming, supported by a sceptic media and believed by millions. . No wonder Obama was initially reluctant to take this on.  President Obama has been burned on this issue before – along with dozens of other world leaders, he attended the Copenhagen climate change conference in 2009, but despite reaching the most effective international agreement that the world has yet seen on climate change, that summit was widely jeered in the media. He forged an alliance with developing countries including China and India, but that fell apart in subsequent rounds of fractious talks. On Monday, the world was finally able to judge where President Obama hopes to take his country. He laid out what was lauded as a ""bold"" and ""historic"" vision that – if it is passed – will reduce US greenhouse gas emissions drastically. The response from climate experts was overwhelmingly positive. Lord Stern, author of the 2005 review of the economics of climate change, said: ""These new plans should help the US achieve its target of reducing annual emissions of greenhouse gases by 17% by 2020, compared with 2005. This represents real leadership."" Yvo de Boer, former United Nations climate chief, told the Guardian: ""It's essential to get the US and China aligned [on climate change] as that is what will make the real difference."" He was hopeful that President Obama's stance would make that a reality. Beijing has not yet officially responded to President Obama's announcement, but has its own plans for cutting emissions, partly in response to the air pollution crisis. In little more than a year's time, this wrangling will become very important: world governments have set themselves a deadline of the end of 2015, at a meeting in Paris, to draft a new global agreement to cut greenhouse gas emissions and halt dangerous climate change. This matters. Where China places itself on this potential treaty will be of vital importance. Europe is certainly behind Obama – one Brussels insider told the Guardian the US and the EU were finally joining forces. Lined up against him, Russia is likely to oppose agreements in international forums, as it has done in the past, as is Australia, while the votes of most developing countries are still up for grabs. But the biggest hurdle President Obama has to face will not be from his peers in other capitals. The opposition to his historic moves will come from the Republican party, within the toxic world of US politics, and even from his own side. Despite opinion polls that consistently show Americans are concerned about global warming, the forces of climate denial will still do their utmost to oppose any curbs on their power to emit carbon dioxide. And they have a lot of money."
"Australian mining giant BHP Billiton accounts for more than half of 1% of all global greenhouse gas emissions, a report has found. The Heinrich Böll Foundation, a German thinktank, ranks BHP No 20 on its list of 81 major carbon emitters in its annual Carbon Majors Funding, Loss and Damage report.  The report calls on fossil fuel companies to take their share of the burden and pay into a fund for the victims of global warming. BHP accounts for 0.52% of emissions, which is far behind No 1 emitter Chevron Texaco at 3.51%. ""The big oil and gas companies can no longer dodge their legal and moral responsibility to pay for climate change loss and damage their products have caused,"" Heinrich Böll Foundation president Barbara Unmuessig said. ""Top international companies, such as Chevron, Exxon Mobil, Saudi Aramco, BP, Gazprom and Shell have made huge profits with fossil fuels while the victims of climate change, often in the poorest regions of the world, are faced with ruin."" Report co-authors Julie-Anne Richards and Keely Boom of the Climate Justice Programme propose a levy on fossil fuel extraction. ""It could start at approximately $2 per tonne of CO2, which would raise $50bn per year initially,"" Richards said. The levy would be calculated against a company's historic emissions and projected future extractions of coal, oil and gas. Over time, it could be increased by 5% to 10% each year, the report says. The money raised would be allocated to the world's poorest communities and to those who have experienced the greatest effects of climate change. The foundation's report comes as Australian prime minister Tony Abbott faces criticism from the US and Europe for not including climate change on the G20 leader's agenda at November's meeting in Brisbane. Abbott aims to repeal Labor's carbon tax in July and replace it with a taxpayer-funded ""direct action"" policy. Earlier in the week, the annual Lowy Institute poll showed public concern over climate change has risen to 45% of the population, after five years of steady decline. Comment was being sought from BHP Billiton."
"Barack Obama’s tough new environmental rules for power plants confirm that Australia’s minimum greenhouse emission reduction target is inadequate by global standards, according to experts. The US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has finalised new regulations to cut carbon pollution from power plants by 30% by 2030 compared with 2005 levels.  According to the former Labor government’s expert climate adviser, Professor Ross Garnaut, the move confirms the judgment of Australia’s independent Climate Change Authority that the country’s target – to reduce reducing total greenhouse emissions by 5% by 2020 compared with 2000 – is too low and out of step with international efforts. In its most recent report, the authority, which the government is seeking to abolish, found that Australia would have to treble its minimum 2020 target of reducing emissions by 15% to have a “credible” role in international efforts to slow global warming. It also found the costs of such an increase would be “manageable” – involving a reduction of only 0.02% in annual average income growth per person – compared with meeting the 5% target, under “effective” domestic policies, especially if Australia bought some carbon abatement internationally. But the government said its immediate priority was to abolish the former Labor government’s carbon pricing scheme and implement its own grants-based policy designed to meet only a 5% target. Garnaut said the latest US move again showed that a 5% target for 2020 was “out of step with international action”. It showed the US would probably meet, and could perhaps overshoot, its overall 2020 target to reduce greenhouse emissions by 17%. The new US policy – evidence of the high priority climate change issues are being given by the US administration – comes as Tony Abbott departs on a trip that will include his first bilateral talks with the US president, who is reported to “routinely” raise the issue in discussions with other world leaders. The Grattan institute’s energy policy director, Tony Wood, also said the US move put pressure on Australia to increase its efforts. “It means the United States is really back at the table in terms of climate change negotiations internationally,” Wood told the ABC. “The Australian government may need to look very closely at whether it needs to increase its 5% target by 2020 … and beyond that it means Australia will have to put much more effort into what commitments we will make going beyond 2020,” he said. The environment minister, Greg Hunt, has said the government would meet its 5% target through its Direct Action plan and “any additional targets will be reviewed in 2015 in the lead-up to the Paris conference, as has been our longstanding position”. But the Paris conference will negotiate an agreement to take effect after 2020, not the 2020 targets discussed in the authority’s report. Despite the Coalition’s pre-election bipartisan commitment to increase Australia’s 2020 emissions reduction target to up to 25% under a specific set of conditions for global action set down in 2009, the prime minister has claimed since the election the government had made no commitments to go further than 5%. “We have made one commitment and one commitment only, which is to reduce our emissions by 5% … we have never made any commitments to any binding targets over and above that, in the absence of absolutely clear evidence that other countries are going to take a very serious like approach,” Abbott said last year. But – even before the latest US move – the authority said Australia’s 5% target was much weaker than targets set by countries including the US, Britain and Norway, and pointed out countries such as China are also stepping up emission reduction efforts. It said all the previously agreed 2009 conditions for moving above a 5% target have been met, as have many of the conditions for a 15% target. As well as abolishing the independent Climate Change Authority and the carbon pricing scheme itself, the government is also seeking to abolish the Clean Energy Finance Corporation and the Australian Renewable Energy Agency. It appears likely to win the repeal of the existing carbon pricing laws in the new Senate, which sits from July, but the fate of its alternative Direct Action policy remains unclear. The chief executive of the Climate institute, John Connor, said that even if Direct Action was implemented “it will have little chance of meeting even the minimum 5% target”.  Hunt said he “welcomed” the US position and said that if the Australian target was compared against the same base year as America's then the domestic target amounted to a 12% cut”. “I’ll let the two leaders reflect on their own agenda,” he said when asked about next week’s meeting between Obama and Abbott. “I have discussed with the US ambassador common approaches in reducing emissions ... and we want a good global agreement, and America’s role in this we welcome, clearly and categorically,” Hunt told the ABC."
"Insects are particularly sensitive to warmth and sunlight. As the climate changes many are moving northwards and increasing their range while others retreat. Scientists have been trying to work out exactly what helps individual species to be successful in new places. A study of 366 types of European butterflies and 107 dragonflies over 18 years discovered that it is the lighter-coloured species that are doing better in a warmer world. They are out-competing darker-coloured insects, which are retreating northwards to cooler climes. The coasts of Kent and Norfolk are now home to light-coloured damselflies that have crossed the Channel and previously only occurred further south on the continent.  The crucial issue seems to be the colour of the insect's body and its ability to absorb heat from the sun. This warmth helps to fuel their flight and regulate body temperature. Dark insects are therefore able to survive in cooler climes by absorbing warmth more easily but in a warmer world can suffer from overheating. A lighter insect will absorb less heat and be active for longer in the sunshine so gaining competitive advantage. Scientists are confident that for these two major insect groups they have established a direct link between climate and colour. Previously they knew that insects of all sorts in Europe were moving to new habitats at a remarkable speed in response to higher temperatures but did not know what was driving the changes. Now they should be able to predict where species will go by checking their ability to absorb or reflect sunlight."

"The Obama administration unveiled historic environment rules cutting carbon pollution from power plants by 30% on Monday, spurring prospects for a global deal to end climate change but setting up an epic battle over the environment in this year's mid-term elections. The new rules, formally announced by the Environmental Protection Agency, represent the first time Barack Obama, or any other president, has moved to regulate carbon pollution from power plants – the largest single source of carbon dioxide emissions that cause climate change.  The EPA said the regulations, which would cut carbon pollution from power plants 30% from 2005 levels by 2030, would “fight climate change while supplying America with reliable and affordable power”. The EPA administrator, Gina McCarthy, said the new rules would be critical to Obama's efforts to deliver on his promise – to Americans and the international community – to fight climate change. ""The EPA is delivering on a vital piece of President Obama's climate action plan by proposing a clean power plan that will cut harmful carbon pollution from our largest source – power plants,"" she said in a statement. “This is not just about disappearing polar bears and melting ice caps,” McCarthy said in a speech at EPA headquarters. “This is about protecting our health and protecting our homes. This is about protecting local economies and this is about protecting jobs.” The new rules were not as ambitious as some environmental groups had hoped. America is already a third of the way towards meeting the national average of a 30% cut in emissions. Some states, especially those in the north-east, have already exceeded the standard. Even so, reaction from environmental groups to the new power plant rules ranged from “momentous” to “historic”. Al Gore said the new rules were “the most important step taken to combat the climate crisis in our country's history”. Michael Brune, executive director of the Sierra Club, said ""today, the president made good on his promise to American families that his administration would tackle the climate crisis, and clean up and modernize the way we power our country."" In an initiative organised by Ceres, the green investor network, 128 companies and 49 investors managing $800 billion in assets, sent letters to the White House and leaders of both parties in Congress supporting the new rules as ""a critical step"" to dealing with climate change.  But a lobby group for the coal industry – which will be hit hardest by the new rules – said the regulations would hurt the economy and lead to power outages. “If these rules are allowed to go into effect, the administration, for all intents and purposes, is creating America's next energy crisis,” the American Coalition for Clean Coal Electricity said. Obama had initially sought to deal with climate change through Congress. But after that effort collapsed, and with Republicans in Congress uniformly opposed to cutting carbon emissions – or even acknowledging climate change was occurring – Obama decided last year to use his executive authority to cut carbon pollution. In her announcement on Monday, McCarthy hit back at criticism from industry and conservative groups that the rules will lead to power outages or higher electricity prices. “Critics say that their energy bills will skyrocket. Well, they're wrong,” she said. McCarthy said the new rules would result in pollution savings that amount to ""double what every power plant in America generated in the way of pollution in 2012."" The result, she said, would be lower medical bills and fewer trips to the emergency rooms, especially for kids with asthma, the elderly and infirm. McCarthy says the plan ""is also about environmental justice"" because ""lower-income families and communities of color are hardest-hit."" Power plants are the largest single source of carbon pollution, accounting for nearly 40% of the emissions that cause climate change. Obama, in his weekly radio address on Saturday, said it was past time to set national limits on carbon dioxide emissions – just as the EPA has done for years with arsenic, mercury and other toxins. “Right now, there are no national limits to the amount of carbon pollution that existing plants can pump into the air we breathe. None,” he said. “They can dump unlimited amounts of carbon pollution into the air. It's not smart, it's not safe, and it doesn't make sense.” Carbon dioxide emissions from power plants had been falling since 2005, because of the economic downturn and because of the switch from coal to cheaper natural gas. Ethan Zindler of Bloomberg New Energy Finance said the power industry was already about a third of the way towards the 30% goal. But emissions crept up last year and again in the first months of 2014, and the regulations would put America on course for long term and lasting cuts to carbon pollution. Andrew Steer, the chief executive of the World Resources Institute, said it was a “momentous development” for America's efforts to deal with climate change. “It's the most important action available to cut US emissions – and the Obama administration has seized the opportunity,” he said. “These new standards send a powerful message around the world that it's time to face the global threat of climate change.” The rules could affect 1,600 power plants. About 600 of these operate on coal, including many that are nearly 50 years old and will have the most difficulty meeting the new standards. Under the rule, states and power companies will have a range of options to meet the new standards: switching from coal to cleaner-burning natural gas; forming cap-and-trade markets; expanding renewables such as wind and solar power; or encouraging customers to use less energy by moving to more efficient heating and cooling systems and appliances.  That's a departure for the EPA, which generally has focused on curbing emissions from specific smoke stacks. But the Natural Resources Defense Council, which produced models that helped guide the EPA, said a system-wide approach would make it easier and cheaper for power companies to reach the new standard. The 30% national target will not be applied uniformly across the country. The EPA will set individual reductions targets for each state, taking into account their energy mix, according to those briefed on the plan. States have until 2016 to come up with a strategy for meeting the targets. However, the EPA rules will not come into force in all states until 2020, according to one individual briefed on the plan. “They are not going to spread it out smoothly all over the place like creamy peanut butter,” said Vicki Arroyo, who heads the climate centre at the Georgetown University law school. “It's going to be more lumpy than that. Some states will have less ambitious targets, and some states will have more.” The idea is to take account of the available energy sources in each state, as well as the measures some states have already undertaken to cut carbon pollution. North-eastern states have already cut their power plant emissions by 40% compared with 2005. McCarthy said Monday the plan is tailored for the states. ""The glue that holds this plan together ... is that each state's goal is tailored to their own circumstances ... each state's different, so each goal, and each path, can be different,"" she said. Arroyo said it was possible the rule could bring about the same level of reductions in carbon pollution as a climate change bill that was defeated by Congress five years ago. The new EPA rule bypasses Congress, relying on Obama's executive authority and supreme court decisions, to propose new rules under the Clean Air Act. The Chamber of Commerce, the country's biggest business lobby, said last week the new rules would cost the economy $51bn and put 224,000 people out of work. Coal-mining companies, some power companies and Republican state officials have accused the EPA of overstepping its authority, and will be studying the bill closely for possible legal challenges. In their rebuttal to Obama's radio address, the Republicans said the new standards would ""kill coal"" and lead to power outages. ""We'll all be paying a lot more money for electricity – if we can get it,"" said Wyoming senator Mike Enzi. But Obama has been marshalling his own supporters. Environmental and public health groups have been pushing hard for the new rules. Researchers from Harvard and Syracuse universities put out a study last week saying that curbs on carbon pollution would also reduce smog and soot, avoiding premature deaths from heart attacks and lung disease. That campaign effort is due to pick up again on Monday. Obama is scheduled to hold a conference call with the American Lung Association and other public health groups on Monday afternoon. White House officials spent Sunday briefing governors and business leaders about the new rule."

"Environmentalists have bitterly condemned a new EU research fund which invites shale gas firms to apply for €113m (£90m) of subsidies, under a programme designed to encourage ‘competitive low carbon energy’. The Horizon 2020 research fund, which runs from 2014-2020, is intended to help identify potential environmental impacts and risks from shale gas exploitation by using satellite observation, developing models and establishing scientific recommendations for best practices.  But the monies will go to gas companies, who would otherwise have had to pay for such research themselves, and campaigners were quick to slam the new awards for contradicting bloc policy on decarbonisation. ''The commission says that it ensures a high level of environmental protection and that it is serious about combating climate change, but at the same time it funds research for the shale gas industry. This conflict of interest cannot be ignored,'' Antoine Simon a spokesman for Friends of the Earth Europe told EurActiv. “It's particularly cynical as it involves handing out public money to an industry dominated by some of the richest companies in the world where there are many more important energy efficiency and renewable energy research priorities,” he added. The EU’s research and innovation directorate would not reveal which companies had applied for revenues, but said that a €33m pot had been set aside for funding awards this year. “Of the initial 23 eligible applications, seven will be invited to submit final proposals by the call deadline of 23 September,” an official said. “We cannot say yet how many projects will be retained, nor who is asking for money because it is a competitive tender.” While the commission would prefer to limit the awards to €3m each, it will consider requests for higher amounts, the official added. A European council decision last December allowed Horizon 2020 funding to be given to unconventional gas and oil resource exploration and production where this was considered appropriate. The funding call was published a few days later. Shale gas was deemed to be low carbon in the programme because it “may help in the transition towards a low-carbon economy provided its air emissions, including greenhouse gas emissions, are adequately mitigated,” an EU official said. The new funding might help to do this, he implied. But a report by the UK government’s chief scientific adviser David MacKay last year concluded that carbon emissions from shale gas were similar to those from liquefied natural gas imports from Qatar.  It found that ""the principal effect of UK shale gas production and use will be that it displaces imported LNG, or possibly piped gas from outside Europe. The net effect on total UK [greenhouse gas] emissions rates is likely to be small."" While lifecycle CO2 emissions from gas are roughly half as much as from coal or oil, they are still exponentially more than from renewable energies such as wind and solar energy, according to the UN’s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change.  Marcus Pepperell, a spokesman for Shale Gas Europe pointed out that IPCC reports had also identified unconventional gas as a potential bridging fuel on the way to a renewables-based power system. “Europe is facing particular energy security issues and yet we have no commercial shale gas operations in Europe,” he told EurActiv. “It is logical that the commission should look at all opportunities to diversify Europe’s energy mix.” “Given the significant amounts of investments we are looking at in other energy sources such as renewables, it is appropriate to see where Europe can help develop a shale gas industry within an environmentally sustainable framework,” he said. Isaac Valero, the spokesman for the EU’s climate commissioner, Connie Hedegaard, said shale could be a bridge towards renewables and energy efficiency, “but shale gas alone will not solve the climate problem"", he cautioned. Hedegaard has previously called for European development banks to take a lead in eliminating public support for fossil fuels.  Key to the debate over the potential contribution that gas can make to tackling climate change, is the question of methane, a greenhouse gas at least 25 times more potent than carbon dioxide over a shorter 100-year period, and 72 times greater over 20 years. Scientists believe that it could be a particularly dangerous trigger for global warming feedback loops. When methane emissions were considered, a 2011 Cornell University study by Professor Robert Howarth found that the climate-warming impacts of shale gas could be between 20% and 100% worse than coal. Other reports though have been less alarming. Once the hydraulic fracturing (or fracking) of shale gas wells has been completed, large amounts of methane gas flow to the surface, along with chemicals used in the fracking fluid. There, they may be either vented into the atmosphere, burned and so converted to carbon dioxide, or captured and sold to markets under ‘green completion’ techniques.  Speaking to EurActiv last year, Howarth said that green completion was “the best [method] environmentally, although some methane is still probably released during the operation. But it has not been commonly done in the US. It takes time, and companies would rather push ahead as fast as they can and move on to develop and frack another well.” US Environmental Protection Agency regulations intended to make these techniques mandatory – with some exceptions – by 2015, would depend on industry reporting of methane emissions rather than inspections, and so could be ‘gamed’ he feared. European firms will also be required to self-monitor their methane emissions under proposed new EU guidelines, which could be made binding in 2015. But “venting is invisible to the naked eye,” Howarth said. “Unwatched rigs seem likely to cheat at least some times, given the history of the US oil and gas industry in complying with regulations in the past. Industry will have to provide information in Europe, perhaps, but how will anyone know if the information is accurate? Industry certainly has a very strong interest in trying to project that methane emissions are low.” The gas industry counters that shale drills in Europe could already be covered by legislation such as the Mining Waste Directive and Water framework Directive. ""We don’t believe there is a need for specific new rules on shale gas but if legislative gaps are identified we are happy to analyse the situation and co-operate with policy makers on finding the best way forward,” said Alessandro Torello, a spokesman for the International Association of Oil and Gas producers."
"Emerging from a meeting with US President Barack Obama, Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott told reporters he took climate change “very seriously”. Abbott said the world should do something to cut greenhouse gases emissions, but this shouldn’t be done with policies that “clobber the economy”.  But if anyone thinks that Abbott’s “very serious” position on climate change represents even a small shift in his thinking then they’re mistaken. Over recent years, Abbott has taken some irreconcilable positions on the science and policy of climate change. His views have changed little. Famously in September 2009 Abbott told a Liberal Party dinner in regional Victoria that he thought the science of human-caused climate change was “crap”. The same year, Abbott published his political autobiography Battlelines where he set out his position in more detail. His argument then was the same as it is now, when he wrote: It sounds like common sense to minimise human impact on the environment and to reduce the human contribution to increased atmospheric-gas concentrations. It doesn’t make much sense, though, to impose certain and substantial costs on the economy now in order to avoid unknown and perhaps even benign changes in the future. But in the same book chapter, Abbott promoted climate denialist talking points and referenced a mining entrepreneur who says climate change is all natural. In Battlelines, Abbott wrote: “Whether humans have had a significant impact on the climate as a whole is much less clear. Climate change is a relatively new political issue, but it’s been happening since the earth’s beginning.”  Abbott wrote that “in Roman times, grapes were widely grown in Britain” and how “in medieval times, Greenland supported agriculture”. “Of course these climatic changes had little or nothing to do with human activity,” Abbott adds.  Watchers of climate science denialist blogs will recognise these well worn talking points. Abbott was trying to post an argument that because the climate had changed before without human intervention, it can’t be changing much now because of emissions. This was the same false logic Abbott employed a few months ago when he flat out denied any link between bushfires and human-caused climate change.  In Battlelines, Abbott concedes “carbon dioxide in the atmosphere has had some effect on climate, but debate rages among scientists over its extent and relative impact”. Cold weather in Europe and North America had made “the concept of ‘global warming’ less plausible”, he wrote. He added: “Perhaps this explains the shift in polemical terminology to the less prescriptive ‘climate change’.” In fact, it was the US Republican pollster Frank Luntz who suggested to the George Bush-led administration in 2001 that the term ‘global warming’ should be replaced with ‘climate change’ because it was seen as ‘less frightening’. Abbott quotes from a book by “Australia’s leading geologist, Professor Ian Plimer” who is a mining entrepreneur appointed in recent years as a director to the boards of several of Gina Rinehart’s mining companies.  Plimer’s stock phrase is “the climate has always changed” and he claims any observed changes are natural. Later in the book, Abbott discusses his decision to run for the Liberal party leadership to oppose then leader Malcolm Turnbull's support for pricing greenhouse gases. He recalls a ""long phone conversation"" with then Senator Nick Minchin, a climate science denier. Abbott’s claim to take climate change “very seriously” is at odds with the people he has appointed to advise his government. For Abbott, taking climate change “very seriously” apparently means appointing a climate science denier as your top business adviser and putting another sceptic in charge of a review into your country’s key renewable energy policy. Taking climate change “very seriously” also means cutting the agency set up to drive the growth of renewable energy.  The proposed axing of the Australian Renewable Energy Agency, “saving” $1.1 billion, places about 190 renewable projects worth $7.7 billion at risk, according to the agency’s chief executive. Analysts have said Abbott’s ""direct action"" scheme to replace the current carbon price legislation is likely to fall several billion dollars short of achieving the five per cent cut in emissions by 2020 his government clings to. Australia’s Climate Change Authority has described that target as “not credible” and said it should be trebled. The authority is to be scrapped. After recent Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change reports outlined the risks of failing to rapidly cut emissions, environment minister Greg Hunt said emissions from coal burning could be captured. Yet among the budget cuts that Abbott is trying to push through parliament is $459 million from the Carbon Capture and Storage Programme. Abbott’s meeting with Obama might be seen as the first bookend of a key 18-month period for national and international climate change negotiations. In September, the UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon has invited world leaders to a New York summit to bring bold pledges to cut greenhouse gas emissions.  Abbott has said he won’t be going. He will be too busy trying to repeal the carbon price legislation and pushing his budget cuts to renewables through parliament. At the end of this year the next major United Nations climate change negotiations take place in Peru.  The expectation, or hope, is that the Lima talks will put some flesh on the very bare bones of a new global agreement to be signed in Paris in late 2015 to cut emissions post-2020. If the world’s climate shifts to an El Niño, as is now expected, then there is a good chance negotiators could enter those Paris talks with the sound of splintering global heat records in their ears. What are the chances of Abbott changing his views on climate change between now and Paris?  My view. Seriously crap."
"The Australian and Canadian prime ministers have suggested that economic growth is more important than tackling climate change, playing down the prospects of strong co-ordinated global action. Tony Abbott and Stephen Harper indicated during a joint media conference in Ottawa that they felt no additional pressure to address climate change as a result of the US president Barack Obama's new package to reduce emissions.  Reflecting pessimism about the likelihood of ambitious co-ordinated global action, Abbott said climate change was ""not the only or even the most important problem"" the world faced and argued each country ""should take the action that it thinks is best to reduce emissions"". The Australian Greens accused Abbott and Harper of creating a ""conservative climate deniers club"" while the Australian Labor party said the surest way to destroy jobs and growth in the long term was to do nothing about climate change. Abbott, who is due to meet Obama in the US this week, characterised the US president’s announcements as similar to the Australian government's ""Direct Action measures"" to reduce emissions. ""We should do what we reasonably can to limit emissions and avoid climate change – man-made climate change – but we shouldn’t clobber the economy,"" the Australian prime minister said. ""That’s why I’ve always been against a carbon tax or an emissions trading scheme because it harms our economy without necessarily helping the environment."" Harper said he did not feel any additional pressure ""other than the pressure we all feel to make progress on this important issue"". The Canadian leader argued Obama's measures, aiming to cut power plant emissions by 30% by 2030 compared with 2005 levels, did not go as far in the electricity sector as the actions Canada had already taken. ""It's not that we don’t seek to deal with climate change, but we seek to deal with it in a way that will protect and enhance our ability to create jobs and growth, not destroy jobs and growth in our countries,"" Harper said. ""And frankly, every single country in the world, this is their position. No country is going to undertake actions in climate change, no matter what they say, no country is going to take actions that are going to deliberately destroy jobs and growth in their country. ""We are just a little more frank about that, but that is the approach that every country’s taking."" The former Australian prime minister Kevin Rudd previously described climate change as ""the greatest moral, economic and social challenge of our time"".  Abbott struck a different tone in Ottawa: ""It’s not the only or even the most important problem that the world faces, but it is a significant problem and it’s important that every country should take the action that it thinks is best to reduce emissions, because we should rest lightly on the planet."" The Australian Labor party's climate change spokesman, Mark Butler, said Australia, as the chair of the G20, should allow climate change to be on the agenda for discussion at the key meeting in Brisbane later this year. Butler said Abbott was wrong to say the rest of the world was moving away from carbon trading schemes, because a seventh Chinese region was about to begin an emissions trading scheme. ""The surest way to destroy jobs and growth in the medium and long term is to do nothing about climate change,"" Butler told the Australian Broadcasting Corporation on Tuesday. ""We know from all of the scientific advice internationally and here in our own country, Australia, that global warming is already having a very significant impact on our climate and it's already having an impact on a range of industries, most notably agriculture, but many others as well, so there's not a clear choice here to do nothing and save all existing jobs and have uninterrupted global growth or to undertake carbon trading schemes. We have to do something."" The Australian Greens leader, Christine Milne, said Abbott ""should take this opportunity to brainstorm with his Canadian counterpart about how they're going to meet new, higher expectations set by the US, EU and China"". ""There is no point creating a conservative climate deniers club,"" Milne said. ""The two conservative leaders of two resource-based economies shouldn't get together, put their fingers in their ears and pretend nothing needs to change."" Abbott said that by the time of the G20 Australia's carbon taxes and mining taxes would be gone – an indication of his confidence the new Senate would wave through his repeal plans after 1 July.  The Abbott government has committed to a 2020 target of reducing Australia’s greenhouse gas emissions by 5% against 2000 levels. It is seeking to scrap the emissions trading scheme legislated by the former Labor government and replace it with a grants-based system to encourage emissions reduction.  But the Climate Change Authority, which the government wants to abolish, found that Australia would have to treble its minimum emissions reduction target to have a “credible” role in international efforts to slow global warming.  The former Labor government's climate adviser, Ross Garnaut, argued last week that the latest US move again showed that a 5% target for 2020 was “out of step with international action” while the Grattan institute’s energy policy director, Tony Wood, said the announcement put pressure on Australia to increase its efforts. "
"The global El Niño weather phenomenon, whose impacts cause global famines, floods – and even wars – now has a 90% chance of striking this year, according to the latest forecast released to the Guardian. El Niño begins as a giant pool of warm water swelling in the eastern tropical Pacific Ocean, that sets off a chain reaction of weather events around the world – some devastating and some beneficial. India is expected to be the first to suffer, with weaker monsoon rains undermining the nation’s fragile food supply, followed by further scorching droughts in Australia and collapsing fisheries off South America. But some regions could benefit, in particular the US, where El Niño is seen as the “great wet hope” whose rains could break the searing drought in the west. The knock-on effects can have impacts even more widely, from cutting global gold prices to making England’s World Cup footballers sweat a little more. The latest El Niño prediction comes from the European Centre for Medium-range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF), which is considered one the most reliable of the 15 or so prediction centres around the world. “It is very much odds-on for an event,” said Tim Stockdale, principal scientist at ECMWF, who said 90% of their scenarios now deliver an El Niño. ""The amount of warm water in the Pacific is now significant, perhaps the biggest since the 1997-98 event.” That El Niño was the biggest in a century, producing the hottest year on record at the time and major global impacts, including a mass die-off of corals. “But what is very much unknowable at this stage is whether this year’s El Niño will be a small event, a moderate event – that’s most likely – or a really major event,” said Stockdale, adding the picture will become clearer in the next month or two. “It is which way the winds blow that determines what happens next and there is always a random element to the winds.” The movement of hot, rain-bringing water to the eastern Pacific ramps up the risk of downpours in the nations flanking that side of the great ocean, while the normally damp western flank dries out. Governments, commodity traders, insurers and aid groups like the Red Cross and World Food Programme all monitor developments closely and water conservation and food stockpiling is already underway in some countries. Professor Axel Timmermann, an oceanographer at the University of Hawaii, argues that a major El Niño is more likely than not, because of the specific pattern of winds and warm water being seen in the Pacific. “In the past, such alignments have always triggered strong El Niño events,” he said. El Niño events occur every five years or so and peak in December, but the first, and potentially greatest, human impacts are felt in India. The reliance of its 1 billion-strong population on the monsoon, which usually sweeps up over the southern tip of the sub-continent around 1 June, has led its monitoring to be dubbed “the most important weather forecast in the world”. This year, it is has already got off to a delayed start, with the first week’s rains 40% below average. “El Niño could be quite devastating for agriculture and the water supply in India,” said Dr Nick Klingaman, an El Niño expert at the University of Reading in the UK. Two-thirds of Indian farmland lacks irrigation and is reliant solely on rainfall, meaning even current official prediction of a 5% reduction in monsoon rains would have a major impact: a 10% fall is an official drought. Krishna Kumar, an Indian meteorologist and El Niño expert, said that even if the 2014 El Niño turns out not to be a very hot one, it can still have a major effect on the monsoon because it is the specific location of the warm Pacific water which is the critical factor. “The moderate El Niños of 2002 and 2009 impacted the monsoon in India much more greatly then the major 1997 event,” he said, adding that the biggest cut in rainfall is not usually felt until September. Open contributions: How has El Niño weather phenomenon affected you? Rana Kapoor, president of the Associated Chambers of Commerce of India, warned: “We recommend the government to immediately announce steps to control food inflation in view of the impending El Niño and the cascading negative affect it will have on crop production.” The impact on farmers means past monsoon failures have cost the nation $20bn (£12bn) in lost output and, because the Indian market dominates global gold prices, the cost of the precious metal has already fallen. New research in May showed the global impact of El Niño events on food supplies, with corn, rice and wheat yield much lower than normal, although soybean harvests tend to rise. While food production has improved in the last year, El Niño is set to reverse that trend, according to Leo Abruzzese, global forecasting director for the Economist Intelligence Unit. “It may reduce agricultural output over the next few years, which could weigh on global food security”. Drought linked to the 2007 El Niño led to a surge in food prices in 2008 that sparked riots in countries as far afield as Egypt, Cameroon and Haiti. After India, El Niño’s impacts roll eastwards and officials in Cebu, the Philippines’ second city, have already urged all households to save water to reduce the impact of the drier weather due to hit by the end June. In Malaysia, the national water authority is preparing for a dry spell of up to 18 months and calling for water rationing, while meteorologists have warned of forest fires. The hot, dry skies will then track to heat-wracked Australia, where 2013 was already its hottest year on record and El Niño is threatening to turn the temperature up even further. Andrew Watkins, manager of climate prediction services at the Australian Bureau of Meteorology, said: “El Niño is one of the largest influences on Australia’s climate. It’s why historically Australia has had one of the most variable climates on the planet.” Watkins said El Niño increases the chances of low rainfall in the country’s southern and most populous half and tends to deliver hotter years and higher extreme temperatures. Brent Finlay, president of Australia’s National Farmers’ Federation, said he was hoping El Niño just does not happen. “We have farmers and graziers in New South Wales and Queensland who are in drought now, and so to have this prediction of a possible El Niño will be of grave concern.” Severe drought at any time could have “tragic” consequences on rural communities where he said some farmers had even taken their own lives, he said: “That is what drought does.” However, on the opposite side of the Pacific, in the US, El Niño holds out the prospect of relief for the parched western states and nowhere is more desperate for rain than California. The entire state is in severe or extreme drought, after receiving barely a quarter of its annual rainfall, and communities have been under water rations since March, which ordinarily would still be the rainy season. The result is a tinder box, with governor Jerry Brown warning the state faces the worst wildfire season on record. A strong El Niño would bring rain, typically double the annual average in southern California. “I commonly refer to El Niño as the great wet hope,” said Bill Patzert, a climate scientist at Nasa’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in California. “Everyone in the west has their fingers crossed because we are bone dry. We have had three of the four driest years in the west in recorded history. Dry land farmers and ranchers are definitely on their knees right now. We are running on reserves, we are pumping aquifers, and our reservoirs are at record lows.” El Niños also typically lead to wetter winters in Texas, and other parts of the south-west, which also depend on getting most of their rain in the winter months. However, big El Niños like the 1997-98 event – what Patzert calls “godzillas” – are rare and forecasters at the US government’s climate prediction centre said on 5 June that time was running out for a significant El Niño to be set in train. A modest or small El Niño would have little impact on the drought, said Patzert, noting that the 2006-07 drought – the worst on record at the time – occurred during a weak El Niño year. Even a “godzilla” would not be enough on its own to bail California out, he said: “But it would be a fantastic down payment on drought relief.” Strong El Niños also typically bring warmer winters to the northern US states, which would be a relief after last winter’s Arctic conditions. El Niños also typically damp down hurricane activity. But Prof Kerry Emanuel, an atmospheric scientist at MIT, said even in an El Niño year a hurricane, given the right conditions, could still cause tremendous destruction. Hurricane Andrew, one of the deadliest and costliest in recent history, roared through Florida in 1992, which was an El Niño year. “It would be tragic if everyone let their guard down,” Emanuel said. Elsewhere in the Americas, a careful watch is being kept in Peru, where the huge anchovy fishery has been wiped out by previous El Niños – it was Peruvian sailors who first named the phenomenon “the Christ child” because its peak occurs at Christmas. The 1997-98 El Niño slashed the catch by 80%, as the fish migrated away from the abnormally warm waters. Luis Icochea, a fisheries expert at the National Agrarian University in Lima, warned that the event this year is developing in a similar way. Rodney Martínez, at Ecuador’s International El Niño Centre, said El Niño would affect the whole of south America, meaning heavy rainfall and floods in Ecuador, Peru, Chile and northern Argentina but potential drought relief in Chile and Bolivia. The early effects of El Niño in Brazil are expected to raise temperatures during the football World Cup. But, despite better El Niño warnings nowadays, Martinez said many nations were worse prepared than in 1997: “In many cases the vulnerability has increased: more exposed population, more land degradation, river sedimentation, collapse of underground water sources, degradation of natural protection in riversides, badly designed infrastructure and lack of coordination and planning to cope with El Niño.” Stockdale said other global impacts could be droughts in the Caribbean and southern Africa at the end of the year, and also in central Asia, although the precise impacts of each El Niño vary due to local climatic variations. Europe is the continent least affected by El Niño by virtue of being on the opposite side of the world. However, in the tropics and sub-tropics, another deadly impact of El Niño is becoming better understood: its ability to spark civil wars. Solomon Hsiang, at Columbia University, New York, showed in 2011 that 50 of the 250 conflicts between 1950 and 2004 were triggered by the El Niño cycle, probably due to the loss of crops, jobs and the psychological effects of hotter weather. Hsiang told the Guardian that, based on historical data, a Pacific warming of 0.8C is associated with a rise in the annual risk of conflict of 15%. The current forecasts indicate that this year’s warming will most probably lie between 0.5C and 1.5C. “Of course, conflicts may not occur just because the risk of conflict is higher, in the same way car accidents don’t always occur on rainy days when the risk of accident is higher,” Hsiang said. “But it is certainly a developing situation that we should keep track of and it would be excellent to have policy-makers and the public aware of the potential risk.” Policymakers are likely also to feel the heat of El Niño in the negotiations towards a global deal to cut carbon emissions and tackle global warming, which must culminate in Paris in December 2015. Since the scorching year of 1998, the rate of global warming has slowed, with over 90% of the heat trapped by CO2 going into the oceans. “A lot of energy that should have been in the atmosphere has gone into the Pacific,” said Kumar. “If El Niño does set in that could trigger the release of that heat and faster warming: that has been a major concern.” An El-Niño-boosted 2015 could well be the hottest year on record, according to Klingaman, just as nations have to agree a climate change deal. “If 2014 turns out to be an El Niño year as currently forecast, increased public awareness of the dangers of human-induced climate change is likely to follow,” said Prof Michael Raupach, director of the Climate Change Institute at the Australian National University. “However, it is very important that our policy responses do not wax and wane with El Niño.” The link between global warming and El Niño, a natural climate phenomenon, is not yet well understood by scientists. But a study published in January predicted a doubling of extreme El Niño events, as climate change ramps up. Either way, adding the impacts of El Niño to the extreme weather already being driven by climate change increases the damage caused, said Stockdale: “El Niño can be the thing that pushes you over the edge. It will be in the years when you get a big El Niño when you feel the impact of climate change the most.”"
"Buyers must beware as climate change threatens to increase insurance premiums and lower property values, Australia’s Climate Institute and the consumer watchdog Choice have warned. Extreme weather risk and climate events could lower property values in some areas by 20% or more, and double the cost of insurance premiums, within the space of one mortgage term, a report released on Thursday said.  “Climate change will make a bad situation worse,” it said, listing extreme weather events including floods, storms, fires and coastal soil erosion. Because developers are not obliged to ensure new dwellings are built to resist future climate and weather hazards, and governments are sometimes failing to make risk information easily accessible, insurers have been increasingly exposed, leading to more expensive premiums, the report said.  “Climate projections clearly indicate that some risk factors will evolve substantially over the typical 30-year term of a mortgage,” it said. “It is reasonable to assume that some of these changes will be reflected in even higher insurance premiums for properties already exposed to extreme weather risks.” Houses affected by extreme weather events, such as the Queensland floods of 2011, are also left underinsured when faced with expensive rebuilding regulations. In areas examined, the study found replacement values of buildings were up to 95% higher than their value. The organisations said the lack of information from governments and insurance companies was leaving homebuyers and owners at risk.  “Councils should be providing better information about historical climate data about whether a property is at risk, and what they think about some of the future risks might be,” the Climate Institute’s chief executive, John Connor, told Guardian Australia. “And there are some basics, such as the full range of hazard mapping, that we know some local governments have got and which should be publicly available. But they’re not,” he said. Until buyers are assured all information is being given to them, there are a number of measures they can take for themselves, the report said. A clue is whether or not an insurance company offers online quotes in the area the consumer is looking at. It said a range of quotes being offered in low-risk areas, but not high-risk areas, is a consistent occurrence. “In half of the tested locations that are at high risk from weather events, one or more insurers declined to make online quotes available,” the report said. “In some locations, the companies refusing to do so include four of Australia’s six major insurers. By contrast, in a control sample containing only low-risk homes, refusal of online quotes was never observed.” Connor said this pattern of unavailable quotes was “a very good indicator for people to be aware of”. The report made a number of recommendations to buyers, insurers and governments, including mandated disclosure of all available hazard mapping. The Insurance Council of Australia (ICA) agreed with some recommendations to governments, but not those to insurers, which included adding “policy options to include climate-exacerbated risks including erosion, soil contraction and actions of the sea”. “Our overall view is the ICA sees the climate risk report as further evidence of the link between risk exposure and risk-based premiums,” a spokesman for the ICA, Campbell Fuller, told Guardian Australia. “We also agree that there is some benefit to consumers from disclosing risks from extreme risks and anticipated climate change.” However, the council disagreed with the recommendation the government “disclose current and projected insurance premiums for a property at the point of sale, based on independent metrics (such as those presented in this report)”. “The commercial nature of insurance means that insurers will use a number of different criteria when pricing a product. To try and anticipate what a premium will be is incredibly difficult because there are too many criteria being used,” Fuller said. “Consumers in high-hazard areas should be presented with information on hazards and any planned mitigation. And they should then seek out and receive professional advice on their insurance options.”"
"The Lulworth skipper is the only British butterfly with a geographically accurate name – it is found flying around Lulworth cove in Dorset and along a small section of the south coast. It is one of our rarest butterflies, and my 1980s field guide says it emerges in July. Last year it was first seen on 1 July. This year, however, an adult was spotted flying on 21 May.  Six weeks early is a drastic change, but flying in May is the new normal for the Lulworth skipper: apart from 2013, it has emerged in May in each of the last eight years – apart from two summers when it appeared in April. Climate change has turned a mid-summer butterfly into a spring one. Nature lovers are concerned that some species may fall out of step with crucial food plants or nectar, but Richard Fox of Butterfly Conservation says no butterflies are causing concern so far. He believes that natural selection pressures help butterflies adapt quickly enough. But earlier risers may create problems for themselves if they try to squeeze extra generations into a summer. The orange tip is a quintessential spring creature, but last year a few children of its spring generation were seen flying in August and September. ""There won't be the right climatic conditions or food plants for these butterflies to leave any offspring themselves,"" says Fox. Other butterflies which have started producing an extra autumn generation include the white admiral and the very rare Duke of Burgundy. Hopefully no others will acquire this habit because it looks like a generational dead-end."
"Tony Abbott might be in for a bit of a surprise when he takes a business delegation to New York as part of his current overseas trip. Earlier this week Australia's prime minister was reacting to news from the US that President Barack Obama’s administration had announced new rules to cut greenhouse gas emissions from power plants by 30% by 2030.  Describing the US actions as “sensible” and in line with his own, Abbott then inserted his customary attack on any market-based mechanism to put a price on greenhouse gas emissions. ""There is no carbon tax in the United States. There is no emissions trading scheme in the United States,"" he told parliament. Except, there are emissions trading schemes in the US and the surprise Abbott might get when he visits the Big Apple is that New York is part of one of those emissions trading schemes that don't exist. Along with eight other states, New York takes part in the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative (RGGI). Announcing the new rules on power plants, the US Environmental Protection Agency even pointed out that “from 2009 through 2012, the nine RGGI states invested auction proceeds of more than $700m in programs that lower costs for energy consumers and reduce CO2 emissions”. If the EPA proposals survive the expected attacks then individual states will be allowed to use a range of actions to cut emissions from power plants. One of those actions recommended by the EPA? ""Market-based trading programs”. Abbott might like to know that California (a state with a bigger GDP than Australia’s) also has a non-existent market-based emissions trading scheme that also gets a mention in the new EPA rules. Australia’s environment minister, Greg Hunt, also claimed the US was cleaning up power stations “without a carbon tax” when the EPA rules specifically identify carbon pricing as a way of cutting emissions from the power sector. Hunt could at least have checked one his favourite sources – good old Wikipedia. Just days before the US announcement, Abbott gave a speech to a mining industry dinner that gave a far clearer picture of his views on energy and fossil fuels. He told the miners that “our prosperity rides on the ore and gas and coal carriers steaming the seas to our north”. He described how his government was establishing a “one-stop shop for environmental approvals” – a description that appeared to pre-judge the fate of all environmental applications (where’s that rubber stamp?) But then came this: It’s particularly important that we do not demonise the coal industry and if there was one fundamental problem, above all else, with the carbon tax was that it said to our people, it said to the wider world, that a commodity which in many years is our biggest single export, somehow should be left in the ground and not sold. Well really and truly, I can think of few things more damaging to our future."" Given Tony Abbott has surrounded himself with advisers who deny the science of climate change (which he once described as “absolute crap” but now publicly claims to accept) I’m willing to believe the prime minister when he says he “can think of few things more damaging” than leaving coal in the ground. But if he genuinely can’t think of any, then perhaps Barack Obama might offer just one suggestion (it starts with ""c"" and ends in ""limate"") when the pair meet in Washington next week. Last year Obama said in a climate change speech: “Some day our children and our children's children will look us in eye they and they will ask us, did we do all that we could when we had the chance to deal with this problem and leave them a cleaner, safer and more stable world?” If Abbott is going to tell Obama that doing “all that we could” includes digging up all the available coal, then it’s going to be an interesting meeting."
"A US Department of Defense (DoD) research programme is funding universities to model the dynamics, risks and tipping points for large-scale civil unrest across the world, under the supervision of various US military agencies. The multi-million dollar programme is designed to develop immediate and long-term ""warfighter-relevant insights"" for senior officials and decision makers in ""the defense policy community,"" and to inform policy implemented by ""combatant commands.""  Launched in 2008 – the year of the global banking crisis – the DoD 'Minerva Research Initiative' partners with universities ""to improve DoD's basic understanding of the social, cultural, behavioral, and political forces that shape regions of the world of strategic importance to the US.""  Among the projects awarded for the period 2014-2017 is a Cornell University-led study managed by the US Air Force Office of Scientific Research which aims to develop an empirical model ""of the dynamics of social movement mobilisation and contagions."" The project will determine ""the critical mass (tipping point)"" of social contagians by studying their ""digital traces"" in the cases of ""the 2011 Egyptian revolution, the 2011 Russian Duma elections, the 2012 Nigerian fuel subsidy crisis and the 2013 Gazi park protests in Turkey.""  Twitter posts and conversations will be examined ""to identify individuals mobilised in a social contagion and when they become mobilised."" Another project awarded this year to the University of Washington ""seeks to uncover the conditions under which political movements aimed at large-scale political and economic change originate,"" along with their ""characteristics and consequences."" The project, managed by the US Army Research Office, focuses on ""large-scale movements involving more than 1,000 participants in enduring activity,"" and will cover 58 countries in total.  Last year, the DoD's Minerva Initiative funded a project to determine 'Who Does Not Become a Terrorist, and Why?' which, however, conflates peaceful activists with ""supporters of political violence"" who are different from terrorists only in that they do not embark on ""armed militancy"" themselves. The project explicitly sets out to study non-violent activists: ""In every context we find many individuals who share the demographic, family, cultural, and/or socioeconomic background of those who decided to engage in terrorism, and yet refrained themselves from taking up armed militancy, even though they were sympathetic to the end goals of armed groups. The field of terrorism studies has not, until recently, attempted to look at this control group. This project is not about terrorists, but about supporters of political violence."" The project's 14 case studies each ""involve extensive interviews with ten or more activists and militants in parties and NGOs who, though sympathetic to radical causes, have chosen a path of non-violence.""  I contacted the project's principal investigator, Prof Maria Rasmussen of the US Naval Postgraduate School, asking why non-violent activists working for NGOs should be equated to supporters of political violence – and which ""parties and NGOs"" were being investigated – but received no response.  Similarly, Minerva programme staff refused to answer a series of similar questions I put to them, including asking how ""radical causes"" promoted by peaceful NGOs constituted a potential national security threat of interest to the DoD. Among my questions, I asked:  ""Does the US Department of Defense see protest movements and social activism in different parts of the world as a threat to US national security? If so, why? Does the US Department of Defense consider political movements aiming for large scale political and economic change as a national security matter? If so, why? Activism, protest, 'political movements' and of course NGOs are a vital element of a healthy civil society and democracy - why is it that the DoD is funding research to investigate such issues?"" Minerva's programme director Dr Erin Fitzgerald said ""I appreciate your concerns and am glad that you reached out to give us the opportunity to clarify"" before promising a more detailed response. Instead, I received the following bland statement from the DoD's press office:  ""The Department of Defense takes seriously its role in the security of the United States, its citizens, and US allies and partners. While every security challenge does not cause conflict, and every conflict does not involve the US military, Minerva helps fund basic social science research that helps increase the Department of Defense's understanding of what causes instability and insecurity around the world. By better understanding these conflicts and their causes beforehand, the Department of Defense can better prepare for the dynamic future security environment."" In 2013, Minerva funded a University of Maryland project in collaboration with the US Department of Energy's Pacific Northwest National Laboratory to gauge the risk of civil unrest due to climate change. The three-year $1.9 million project is developing models to anticipate what could happen to societies under a range of potential climate change scenarios. From the outset, the Minerva programme was slated to provide over $75 million over five years for social and behavioural science research. This year alone it has been allocated a total budget of $17.8 million by US Congress. An internal Minerva staff email communication referenced in a 2012 Masters dissertation reveals that the programme is geared toward producing quick results that are directly applicable to field operations. The dissertation was part of a Minerva-funded project on ""counter-radical Muslim discourse"" at Arizona State University.  The internal email from Prof Steve Corman, a principal investigator for the project, describes a meeting hosted by the DoD's Human Social Cultural and Behavioural Modeling (HSCB) programme in which senior Pentagon officials said their priority was ""to develop capabilities that are deliverable quickly"" in the form of ""models and tools that can be integrated with operations.""  Although Office of Naval Research supervisor Dr Harold Hawkins had assured the university researchers at the outset that the project was merely ""a basic research effort, so we shouldn't be concerned about doing applied stuff"", the meeting in fact showed that DoD is looking to ""feed results"" into ""applications,"" Corman said in the email. He advised his researchers to ""think about shaping results, reports, etc., so they [DoD] can clearly see their application for tools that can be taken to the field."" Many independent scholars are critical of what they see as the US government's efforts to militarise social science in the service of war. In May 2008, the American Anthropological Association (AAA) wrote to the US government noting that the Pentagon lacks ""the kind of infrastructure for evaluating anthropological [and other social science] research"" in a way that involves ""rigorous, balanced and objective peer review"", calling for such research to be managed instead by civilian agencies like the National Science Foundation (NSF). The following month, the DoD signed a memorandum of understanding (MoU) with the NSF to cooperate on the management of Minerva. In response, the AAA cautioned that although research proposals would now be evaluated by NSF's merit-review panels. ""Pentagon officials will have decision-making power in deciding who sits on the panels"":  ""… there remain concerns within the discipline that research will only be funded when it supports the Pentagon's agenda. Other critics of the programme, including the Network of Concerned Anthropologists, have raised concerns that the programme would discourage research in other important areas and undermine the role of the university as a place for independent discussion and critique of the military."" According to Prof David Price, a cultural anthropologist at St Martin's University in Washington DC and author of Weaponizing Anthropology: Social Science in Service of the Militarized State, ""when you looked at the individual bits of many of these projects they sort of looked like normal social science, textual analysis, historical research, and so on, but when you added these bits up they all shared themes of legibility with all the distortions of over-simplification. Minerva is farming out the piece-work of empire in ways that can allow individuals to disassociate their individual contributions from the larger project."" Prof Price has previously exposed how the Pentagon's Human Terrain Systems (HTS) programme - designed to embed social scientists in military field operations - routinely conducted training scenarios set in regions ""within the United States.""  Citing a summary critique of the programme sent to HTS directors by a former employee, Price reported that the HTS training scenarios ""adapted COIN [counterinsurgency] for Afghanistan/Iraq"" to domestic situations ""in the USA where the local population was seen from the military perspective as threatening the established balance of power and influence, and challenging law and order.""  One war-game, said Price, involved environmental activists protesting pollution from a coal-fired plant near Missouri, some of whom were members of the well-known environmental NGO Sierra Club. Participants were tasked to ""identify those who were 'problem-solvers' and those who were 'problem-causers,' and the rest of the population whom would be the target of the information operations to move their Center of Gravity toward that set of viewpoints and values which was the 'desired end-state' of the military's strategy."" Such war-games are consistent with a raft of Pentagon planning documents which suggest that National Security Agency (NSA) mass surveillance is partially motivated to prepare for the destabilising impact of coming environmental, energy and economic shocks. James Petras, Bartle Professor of Sociology at Binghamton University in New York, concurs with Price's concerns. Minerva-funded social scientists tied to Pentagon counterinsurgency operations are involved in the ""study of emotions in stoking or quelling ideologically driven movements,"" he said, including how ""to counteract grassroots movements.""  Minerva is a prime example of the deeply narrow-minded and self-defeating nature of military ideology. Worse still, the unwillingness of DoD officials to answer the most basic questions is symptomatic of a simple fact – in their unswerving mission to defend an increasingly unpopular global system serving the interests of a tiny minority, security agencies have no qualms about painting the rest of us as potential terrorists.

"One benefit of working in the climate science arena is that I have the privilege to interact with some of the world’s most talented individuals. I have learned their stories while we have shared hypotheses about how the Earth works. I hope this will be the first in a series of articles showcasing the personal stories of some of the most impactful scientists today. Among my first entries into climate research was through ocean measurements. A number of years ago, I met Drs. John Lyman and Greg Johnson. These colleagues have worked to modernize our understanding of the oceans and their role in climate change. I wanted to know how they become scientists and what they see over the horizon in their field.  I asked John Lyman, who is affiliated with JIMAR/University of Hawaii and NOAA’s Pacific Marine Environmental Laboratory, how he got into studying the oceans. ""I have always been interested in the ocean. Before entering college, my dad and I went on a trip to the west coast to visit schools. On the trip we had a chance to visit with Walter Munk at Scripps. I asked him about Oceanography as an undergraduate and he strongly discouraged me. He told me that you should have a strong background in a basic science first; math, physics, biology or chemistry. So that’s what I did. I studied physics and somewhere along the line forgot about oceanography. After college I joined the Peace Corps in an attempt to give something back. I ended up teaching math in Zimbabwe. It gave me time to think. At the end of two-years of teaching I found myself reading up on oceanography again. I applied to grad school from Africa, got a Ph.D., and eventually found my way to climate science.""   I also asked John what the emerging understanding of oceanography is and what important projects were ongoing. He responded, ""Deep Argo! Most of the world oceans under 2000 meters are woefully under-sampled. Deep Argo will extend the Argo array to the bottom and for the first time we will be able to resolve most of the large-scale variability in the world’s oceans. We will be able to resolve how much heat is really going deep. There is also the added excitement of exploring an area of the world that so little is known about and being the first to describe it."" While John has made many great contributions to the field, he is most fond of two items in particular. The first is a major study he had published in Nature that described and quantified warming of the oceans and another study that was written while a post-doc that used a simple stability model to describe tropical waves; these waves are important to the ENSO process. I put the same questions to Greg, an oceanographer at the Pacific Marine Environmental Laboratory, and an affiliate professor with the University of Washington. He told me that he went into oceanography because he,  “wanted to combine my interest in physics with my love of the sea. For the first decade or so of my career, I studied mostly ocean temperature, salinity, and currents, and their variability. However, as time has gone on, the importance to climate variations over seasons to millennia have become increasingly apparent, and important in my work.” Johnson's research is important because,  ""With the buildup of greenhouse gasses in the atmosphere, more energy enters the Earth environment than escapes. Over the last 4 decades, 93% of this energy imbalance has warmed the ocean, with about 3% warming the land, 3% melting ice, and 1% warming and adding moisture to the atmosphere. Warmed oceans also expand, raising sea level. Hence measuring how much the oceans are warming and where is important to understanding how much and how fast the Earth will warm and sea level will rise."" Greg and his team collect much of their data using Conductivity-Temperature-Depth instruments (CTDs for short). They make accurate measurements of the ocean waters. The CTDs are positioned on autonomous floats (Argo floats), lowered on ship-borne cables, or even attached to marine animals. He also says,  “In my research, I also use data from many other sources including sea level, sea-surface-temperature, sea-surface-salinity, winds, and even ocean mass variations from satellites. I also use current data from drifting buoys, Argo floats, and various types of current meters including acoustic Doppler instruments.”  I asked Greg what his biggest scientific contribution has been and he responded, “The data my research group and I have worked to collect over the past three decades.” He's right; those data allow long-term assessments of the changes to the world’s waters. So why write about these oceanographers in my first SCIENTISTS IN FOCUS post? It is because, whenever someone asks me whether we can prove the world is warming, it is to the research of Greg, John, and their colleagues that I point them. The story of climate change is largely a story of the oceans. They are wide, deep, and hard to measure. But the painstaking work these scientists have undertaken has provided a remarkably good picture of the health of the oceans and a view toward the future of the planet."
"Tony Abbott has labelled himself a conservationist who believes humanity should “rest lightly on the planet”. The Australian prime minister made the remark as he sought to downplay any suggestion of disagreement with Barack Obama over climate change.  Abbott, who is pushing to dismantle the legislated carbon pricing scheme and replace it with a government-funded competitive grants scheme, said after a meeting with the US president that both leaders took climate change “very seriously”. “It was a very constructive and genial discussion because we all want to do the right thing by our planet,” Abbott told the ABC.  “I regard myself as a conservationist. Frankly, we should rest lightly on the planet and I’m determined to ensure that we do our duty by the future here.” It is not the first time Abbott has described himself as a conservationist. He has previously said that the terms “conservative” and “conservation” had a common root – both involved “keeping the best of what we have”.  But Abbott has also previously drawn criticism from environmental groups for describing the forestry industry as “the ultimate conservationists” and for saying he could “think of few things more damaging to our future” than leaving coal in the ground. Abbott told a forestry industry dinner in March: “So when I look out at an audience such as this this evening, when I look out tonight at an audience of people who work with timber, who work in forests, I don’t see people who are environmental bandits. I see people who are the ultimate conservationists.  “Man and the environment are meant for each other. The last thing we do – the last thing we should want – if we want to genuinely improve our environment is to want to ban men and women from enjoying it, is to ban men and women from making the most of it. And that’s what you do. You intelligently make the most of the good things that God has given us.” In May Abbott told a minerals industry event it was important not to demonise the coal industry: “If there was one fundamental problem, above all else, with the carbon tax was that it said to our people, it said to the wider world, that a commodity which in many years is our biggest single export, somehow should be left in the ground and not sold. “Well, really and truly, I can think of few things more damaging to our future.”"
"The Gemasolar solar tower power plant in Fuentes de Andalucía, Seville, Spain, uses unique technology to generate electricity. A circular solar field of 2,650 heliostat mirrors covering 185 hectares concentrates the sun's energy onto the central receiving tower, where the intense heat generated is stored using molten-salt heat storage technology. The heat collected by the salts, capable of reaching temperatures above 5,000C, generates steam and produces electrical power. The surplus heat accumulated during sun hours is stored in the molten-salt tank, allowing Gemasolar to generate electrical power 24 hours a day for many months of the year. Solar efficiency guarantees electrical production for 6,500 hours a year. This provides 1.5 to 3 times more power than other renewable energy sources. The plant could supply clean, safe power to 25,000 homes and reduce carbon dioxide emissions by more than 30,000 tonnes a year.  In 1984 a pesticide plant in Bhopal, Madhya Pradesh, India, leaked gas, exposing over 500,000 people to a toxic chemicals and substances. A government affidavit stated the leak caused 558,125 injuries, including 38,478 temporary, 3,900 permanently disabling injurieds and over 8,000 deaths. Everyone photographed in the series has been affected by the disaster.

The tropical climate has resulted in different physical effects from climate change, including increased temperature and precipitation, increased salinity and extreme weather events such as floods, cyclones and droughts. Cambodian Buddhist monks and local villagers bless one of the remaining large trees in an area destroyed to make way for a banana plantation. While arriving too late to stop the destruction completely, by wrapping an orange cloth around the remaining trees and praying, they are making the trees sacred with the hope to deter future loggers. Following uncontrolled forest destruction in the Central Cardamom Protected Forest in south-west Cambodia, an eco-warrior monk movement had begun to try and protect forests at risk. Photographer description: The flooding on the Somerset Levels at Burrowbridge. Numerous properties in the rural areas of Thorney, Muchelney and Burrowbridge in Somerset were hit with up to four feet of water when the nearby River Parrett burst its banks in January 2014. A group of women weave a fishing net in the Mekong Delta, Vietnam, in preparation for the annual flooding of the river and its tributaries. Fishing communities rely on this flooding to bring an influx of fish and shrimp to the region. With climate change worsening, flood levels are becoming more inconsistent, which has important consequences for the livelihood of locals. In 2012, lower than average flood levels saw fish yields decrease by 40% compared to previous year. Agbogbloshie in Accra, Ghana is one of the world's largest e-waste dump site. For more than 10 years, boys and girls between the age of 7 and 25, smash stones against old monitors, use old magnets to collect metal and (most times) burn cables to get the copper from it. More 400 ship containers full of unusable electronics and falsely labelled as 'development aid' or 'second hand products' are emptied in Agbogbloshie every year. Almost every worker has heavy headaches, lung problems, eye and back damage and suffer from insomnia. Most of them die from cancer before they are 30.  A collapsed coastal road between Skipsea and Ulrome on Yorkshire's east coast. The coast is composed of soft boulder clays which are very vulnerable to coastal erosion. This section of coast has been eroding since Roman times, with many villages having disappeared into the sea and is the fastest eroding coast in Europe. Climate change is speeding up the erosion, with rising sea levels rising, frequent storms and heavy rainfall all playing their part. A suburb where old buildings are partly cleared to build new skyscrapers in Shanghai. This photo is part of a body work called Camp of shame. Antonio Busiello explains: ""I have been photographing the waste crisis in Campania, south of Italy for over a year. A large Roma camp has recently been relocated in an area called Aria vasta Giuliana, a polluted piece of land between two toxic and confiscated dumps. The area, according to the declaration of the ex-Mafia boss Carmine Schiavone, is filled with toxic and industrial waste and it can be considered one of the most polluted area in the western world."" Far from the capital of Bulgaria in the sleepy south-east of the country the farming community of Krumovgrad is torn by a controversial topic: the opening of an open-pit gold mine. A local man who lives in the Krumovgrad area fears that the mine will cause severe water pollution and also pollute the land where he grows his vegetables. Many locals fear that the mine will destroy the farm produce and cause irreversible damage to the environment. Others see the potential for economic improvement and future employment in the area that currently has high levels of youth unemployment.  An indigenous Munduruku man and a federal policeman during an occupation of the Belo Monte Dam near Altamira, Brazil. The Belo Monte is the first of a series of dams planned across the Amazon, and the Munduruku have come from the Tapajós River to protest against the construction. When complete, the Belo Monte will alter the ecosystem of more than 1,500 sq km around the 'big bend' of the Xingu River. Since construction began in June 2011, the dam has depleted fish stocks and limited river access for indigenous fishermen whose livelihoods depend on the river. The dam has been condemned by indigenous groups for over 20 years.  The small seaside resort of Swakopmund lies on the coast of Namibia. It was established in 1892 as the main harbour for Namibia’s German colonisers, and still bears the marks of those years of German rule. For much of the year, Swakopmund lies silently shrouded in fog. But in the summer, the fog lifts, and the tourists flock, drawn to the grand hotels, the moody beach and the bustling cafes. The population is a colourful mix of retired Germans, young natives living in housing projects just outside the main village, and the Himba tribes people who trek down from the north, dressed in traditional garb and sell self-made jewellery crafted from found objects."

"Why doesn't anyone do anything about the situation in Ukraine?One reason is that Russia supplies one third of the European Union’s oil and gas. The EU, in turn, represents 20% of the world’s economy, and any precipitous rise in the energy prices they pay is a very scary proposition.  In other words, oil and gas are both the fueling impetus for Vladimir Putin’s current forays and the reason for subsequent global inaction.   Russia is hardly alone. On the other side of Asia, China is risking a hot war with Vietnam in order to plant an oil rig in disputed waters. No nations have come to Vietnam’s side. Meanwhile, Russia and China have just signed a $400bn deal for 30 years of natural gas supply and demand. This alliance creates an economic and defensive bloc that could limit the rest of the world’s move towards safe energy development.  China’s $400bn bet on natural gas added to its central role as the world’s top manufacturer and primary emerging market, create a conflict. If the world chooses to place a price on carbon, which is desperately needed, China and Russia now have an alliance against other economies that might want to incentivize safer renewable energies.  Some of the world’s great oil reserves are on land governed by repressive regimes and dictators, including the House of Saud, Vladimir Putin, Sudanese warlords and Mahmoud Ahmadinejad. The pipelines and ports to transport this oil go through lands of every geo-political leaning, from Canada, whose tar sands aim to serve the US, to Kazakhstan, whose pipeline to China is now being expanded.  Oil and gas wars (hot, cold and economic) will only intensify as at least six different nations, including Russia, lay claim to the Arctic oil reserves. Now that climate change is creating traversable Arctic waters and oil companies are negotiating for deep water drilling there, the likelihood of armed conflict has caused US Defense Secretary Hagel to create an Arctic Defense Strategy.  The companies that profit from extracting and selling fossil fuels have terrible environmental and safety records, with a long record of disasters that include Chevron, fined billions of dollars by an Ecuador court for pollution of the Amazon, the Tennessee Valley Authority’s coal ash spill in Tennessee, natural gas companies found to have contaminated the waters around the Marcellus Shale in Pennsylvania, BP’s negligence in the Gulf of Mexico and more. Some energy companies, especially in the US, have financed a global disinformation campaign regarding climate change and greenhouse gases that has slowed the wheels of real progress towards energy independence. Energy businesses that refuse to acknowledge their direct and indirect impact on climate change are compromising national - actually, global - security.   But we are full accomplices in this conspiracy of fools. Energy companies and their geo-political sponsors are only as powerful as we, their customers, allow them to be. We demand cheap natural resources and presume that we are entitled to cheap energy. Despite knowing better, we believe that we deserve to live with the convenience of kings (instant food, instant transport, instant delivery, instant stuff) at insanely cheap prices. And every day, advertisements confirm our sense of entitlement.  This notion of our own entitlement to cheap consumption is the fundamental fallacy of 21st century commerce. It has given too much power to tyrants, too much power to corrupt politicians, and too much power to business people of bad faith. It is robbing our children of a livable world, politically and environmentally.  It’s far too high a price.  It's hard to overestimate the impact of our fossil fuel consumption on the environment. Oil runoff from our consumption represents a greater percentage of marine pollution than transport and extraction combined, and energy from our buildings causes about 35% of North American greenhouse gas emissions.  Just as families might skip movies and dinners out to save for college, each of us can change our habits for the sake of those we love most. We can use less energy and fewer private cars, eat less meat, choose products that use dramatically less - or better, no - plastic (an oil derivative), demand that politicians and business people account for the costs of environmental damage, and accept the limitations of the carbon-constrained world we will live in for the foreseeable future.  If we do not make this transition, global instability, food and water shortages, mass migrations, hot wars and energy disruptions are certain. But despite what will surely be some extremely hard transitions, a new economic framework will yield resilient businesses, healthier citizens and safer nations.  Most importantly, we must incentivize every extant and future energy company, including today’s behemoths, to spend their extraordinary technological prowess, marketing genius, deep understanding of impossibly complex systems and money on finding our way out of this mess. I have met with senior executives in the oil industry who genuinely desire radical change. We must help them come out of the closet and lead their companies in a new direction. When we talk about energy independence bolstering national security, here’s what it looks like: much more decentralized, clean energy sources – like solar and wind power – connected by a network of microgrids; fast, frequent and convenient mass transit and private transportation fueled by clean electricity; disposable goods replaced by well-made, well-sourced and well-manufactured goods that last; diets and agricultural practices that respect nature’s limitations as well as its bounty; an economy that reflects the environmental impact of every financial transaction; and cleaner air and water as a result of all of the above. This is what it will take to achieve real national security. It’s the moonshot for the next decade and the Marshall Plan for restructuring the world and its economy.

"Footage released by the Taliban on Wednesday showed the Taliban's handover of US army sergeant Bowe Bergdahl. Captioned ""Don' come back to afghanistan"" [sic], the video shows a nervous and twitchy Bergdahl being led to a helicopter and patted down for explosives. While the video is undeniably dramatic, it has an oddly informal feel. Footage of American forces shaking hands with and waving to Bergdahl's Taliban captors is likely to further intensify the debate surrounding the swap. The initial euphoria at Bergdahl's release has been clouded by accusations that Barack Obama's administration has negotiated with terrorists. Other soldiers have claimed that Bergdahl deserted his post in 2009 when he was captured, culminating in the cancellation of a welcome home party, which was due to be hosted in his home town of Sun Valley, Idaho. • Senators battle White House over release strategy • Does Bowe Bergdahl's release signal an end to the 'war on terror'? In a story characterised by what we don't know rather than what we've learned, it was revealed that a major terrorism trial could be heard behind closed doors for the first time in modern Britain. Until now, it has not been possible to report that the trial of terror suspects ""AB"" and ""CD"" even exists, but although the gagging order was lifted by three appeal court judges, information regarding the need for secrecy is still, well, secret. Richard Whittam QC, for the crown, said the jurisdiction for a private court was ""quite clear"", but added that the evidence on which the crown relied to argue for the secret trial could not be presented openly. In the midst of this cloud of mystery, justice secretary Chris Grayling reminded the country of the importance of trust, telling BBC Radio 4: ""We trust the judges, that's why we have them, to take the right decisions on behalf of all of us"". • Secret terror trial is threat to open justice, say human rights campaigners • Owen Jones on Britain's first secret trial: this way lies trouble The government made valiant efforts to demonstrate that it still has fire in its belly for the final year of parliament before the general election next May. The Queen's speech on Wednesday included 11 bills, covering issues from modern slavery to pensions. But the plans for a law allowing voters to dismiss MPs were criticised for being diluted to the extent of ineffectiveness, with one Conservative backbencher claiming: ""At the very next scandal voters will realise they've been duped.""

The new rules, unveiled by the Environmental Protection Agency, are expected to see a significant reduction in existing power plants, and signify what Al Gore is calling “the most important step taken to combat the climate crisis in our country's history”. While some environmental groups believe the changes don't go far enough, thy demonstrate that the Obama administration is not simply spouting hot air when it comes to reducing emissions and addressing global warming. Obama himself seems personally invested in the changes, taking charge of the campaign and urging citizens to ignore ""naysayers"" and ""misinformation"" but to get behind the EPA's changes, underscoring their importance to all ""folks who care about the health of our families and also want to make sure that future generations are able to enjoy this beautiful blue ball in the middle of space that we’re a part of"". • Obama defends new carbon emission rules in face of mounting backlash • President Obama gets serious on climate change Stocks of the infected IV drip that led to the death of a newborn have been urgently removed from use by hospitals. The drip, received by 22 other UK hospitals, also led to blood poisoning in 14 other babies. The head of Public Health England (PHE), Paul Cosford, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that an urgent recall had been ordered after a baby died of septicaemia in intensive care in London. He described the contamination as ""an extremely unusual instance"", adding that a detailed investigation was already under way. Dr Deborah Turbitt said that PHE was ""confident"" the product was no longer in use and that the problem had been contained. The manufacturer of the feed said they were ""very saddened"" by the death, and were ""cooperating fully"" with the investigation. • Liquid food linked to poisoning of babies was sent to 22 hospitals The dramatic increase in the number of migrants attempting treacherous journeys from north Africa to Europe in unsafe boats has forced the United Nations to consider establishing refugee holding centres in Africa and the Middle East. It is estimated that hundreds of thousands of people are preparing to undertake the perilous Mediterranean crossing in the coming ""boat season"", in what authorities have labelled as a catastrophe for refugee welfare. One refugee from Herat, Afghanistan, told the Guardian about how he lost his wife and child during the crossing from Izmir to the Greek coast. Vincent Cochetel, the European director of the UN's refugee agency, UNHCR, said the UN ""would not be totally against external processing if certain safeguards were in place"". However, some campaigners for refugee rights have criticised the plans as poorly conceived. • Sherif Elsayed-Ali: Holding centres will not stop migrants risking their lives • Voices from Europe's deadliest journey The future is bright (yellow) for Lego women, as a new line of female scientists and their lab tools is set to hit shelves in August 2014. The series won over 10,000 votes on the Lego Ideas site where enthusiasts are able to tell manufacturers what they want to see in upcoming lines of the toy. The series hopes to break down (and rebuild) the plastic walls that women face in traditionally masculine jobs, after many criticised the company's stereotypical gender roles played out in its toy sets. Even seven-year-old Charlotte Benjamin demonstrated the issue was not simply child's play when she noticed that ""all the girls did was sit at home, go to the beach, and shop, and had no jobs."" Some, however, remain concerned that this step is miniature in the face of the company's vast gender imbalances. • Lego to launch female scientists series after online campaign Eating his own words – ""kings don't abdicate, they die in their sleep"" – King Juan Carlos of Spain surprised his country when he announced on Monday his decision to step down from the throne in favour of his son, Crown Prince Felipe. Like Pope Benedict before him, Juan Carlos's decision teaches us that in modern times, abdication may be a more dignified response to age and infirmity than waiting for an inglorious passing, legitimising Lear's ""crawl toward death"" as a commendable motive for resignation. But if passing on the crown was the only way to restore Juan Carlos's dwindling popularity, is the very structure of monarchy across Europe doomed to fail? • Abdication in Europe: a change of thrones • Is the writing on the wall for all European royals? • Editorial: Spain's royal renewal Following the outpouring of corruption allegations surrounding Qatar's 2022 World Cup bid, Fifa's chief ethics investigator has decided to discount millions of documents obtained by the Sunday Times, including emails linked to the Qatari former Fifa vice-president Mohamed bin Hammam. Michael Garcia said his impending 9 June deadline was the reason behind his refusal to examine the emails, but the decision hardly restores faith in the organisation, already under international scrutiny. Jim Murphy, the shadow secretary for international development, labelled the investigation ""a sham"" and said Fifa would be ""forever tainted"". Unsurprisingly, calls on Fifa to order a rerun of the vote that saw Qatar win the right to stage the 2022 World Cup have only increased in light of Garcia's decision. • Fifa faces calls to quash Qatar World Cup vote • Simon Jenkins: cleanse Fifa of corruption by leaving it • Interactive guide: the allegations against Bin Hammam Richard Dawkins has denounced widespread reports that he said fairy stories were damaging for young children.

Dawkins added that he'd rather be cast as a ""big bad wolf"" than the current role of ""Gradgrindian bore"" thrust upon him, but did little to correct this image when he claimed that the value of fairy stories and even Santa Claus lies in the fact that ""the child will learn that there are some things you are told that are not true.""

"Yesterday I wrote about the Pentagon's dubious role in funding social science research that could be applied to active military operations in the context of the increasing propensity for global systemic crises to challenge US interests. Several key research projects highlighted the extent to which US security agencies, assisted by civilian academic institutions, view entire populations – particularly those involved in political activism – as potential terror suspects who, therefore, deserve to be carefully monitored and studied.  It is not just the US where the effort to subordinate social science to the demands of state military ideology continues apace. In Britain, a key area where this is occurring is in the Research Councils UK (RCUK) Global Uncertainties programme, recently rebranded as the 'Partnership for Conflict, Crime and Security Research.' The programme is led by the Economics and Social Research Council (ESRC), and supported by the Arts and Humanities Research Council (AHRC) and the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC). But it is not an independent exercise.  Rather it is explicitly designed to ""help governments, businesses and societies to better predict, detect, prevent and mitigate threats to society"" in the context of"" environmental change and diminishing natural recourses, food security, demographic change, poverty, inequality and poor governance, new and old conflicts, natural disasters and pandemics, expansion of digital technologies, economic downturn and other important global developments."" The RCUK partnership is thus deeply politicised. It ""works closely"" with a wide range of UK government departments, including the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills, Department of Communities and Local Government, Foreign Office, Ministry of Defence (MoD), Home Office, and the US Homeland Security Department. Its strategic advisory board is chaired by Sir Richard Mottram, a longtime Whitehall civil servant for defence whose last post was as Permanent Secretary for Intelligence, Security and Resilience in the Cabinet Office – Prime Minister Tony Blair's top national security adviser – who also recently praised the coalition government's Strategic Defence and Security Review as containing ""much of value.""  He is also currently chair of the board of the Defence Science and Technology Laboratory (Dstl), an MoD executive agency which performs science and technology work for defence purposes. Among Dstl's activities are high-level operational analysis to support the Ministry of Defence along with providing support to counter-terrorism and frontline operations – to name just a few. The government's defence review which happened to meet with Sir Mottram's approval, titled 'Securing Britain in an Age of Uncertainty', highlights the future risks of heightening ""competition for resources, growing populations and climate change."" Priorities include ""securing trade and energy supply routes""; working ""overseas, using diplomatic, military, intelligence and economic activity to mitigate disruption to the transit of energy supplies""; as well as tackling risks ""associated with other resources, such as key mineral components important for particular industries (e.g. rare earth metals which are crucial for some low carbon technologies), water and food.""  Domestically, the review calls for ""enhanced central government and Armed Forces planning, coordination and capabilities"" under the extraordinary totalitarian powers of the Civil Contingencies Act, to respond to domestic emergencies in the form of natural hazards, environmental disasters or other forms of strategic shocks. Other members of the RCUK Global Uncertainty programme's strategic advisory board represent a veritable 'who's who' of the British defence policy establishment. They include Prof Michael Clarke, head of the Royal United Services Institute but also a 2009 appointee to the Prime Minister's National Security Forum, a 2010 appointee to the Chief of Defence Staff's Strategic Advisory Group, and a defence advisor to the UK Trade and Industry; former head of defence and security at the Government Office for Science and now deputy chief scientific advisor at the Department of Transport; Rob MacFarlane, assistant director for resilience in the Civil Contingencies Secretariat, National Security Secretariat, Cabinet Office; Prof Martyn Thomas, a member of the MoD's Defence Scientific Advisory Council (DSAC), and a non-executive director of the Serious Organised Crime Agency (SOCA); Dr Seamus Tucker, a former career Foreign Office official who worked in Afghanistan and Pakistan supporting counter-terrorism efforts, and currently deputy director for science and technology in the Office for Security and Counter-Terrorism (OSCT) of the Home Office where his remit includes engaging with the UK security industry. These individuals are responsible for the Global Uncertainty programme's ""strategic direction"" and ""core themes"", co-ordination of its activities with the work of ""research funders and potential users"" – primarily ""government"" and ""businesses"" – and effective ""exploitation of the research,"" including ""how best to ensure inputs from 'connected' RCUK and stakeholder investments.""  Some of the research generated through this programme is undoubtedly useful, and occasionally innocuous - but ultimately its fundamental direction is constrained by the naval-gazing limitations of the establishment ideology pertaining to UK security agencies and officials. It is no surprise then that UK social scientists are feeling the pressure. Over the years, dozens of my senior academic colleagues at various international relations departments of top universities up and down the country have told me they are increasingly concerned and demoralised by the escalating encroachment of defence-related funding on the research environment. International relations departments are being transformed, they say, into conveyor belts for establishment-friendly 'security studies', with research designed for practical policy and operational utility being favoured the most for funding. Meanwhile, the scope for the sort of independent critical and sceptical inquiry that should be the hallmark of sound scholarship is being undermined.  These concerns are borne out by the facts. In 2007 the Guardian reported on an in-depth report exposing how 26 British universities had received contracts for research from the defence industry to the tune of nearly a billion pounds. ""Corporate interests tend to favour secrecy, a monopoly of intellectual property rights, and the silencing of dissidence,"" concluded the joint study by Campaign Against the Arms Trade (CAAT) and Fellowship for Reconciliation (FoR). This sort of funding has continued, and includes extensive UK government military funding – and the numbers are probably much higher as several institutions refuse to provide information. The ideological impetus behind this sort of research can be gleaned from a UK Ministy of Defence (MoD) report on global strategic trends published in 2010, updated in 2013, which contributed to the UK government's Defence Green Paper. This is the first part of the process leading to the 2010 Strategic Defence Review, which met with the approval of Global Uncertainty chair Sir Mottram.  The key theme of the report by the MoD's Development, Concept and Doctrines Centre (DCDC) is that the world ""is likely to face the reality of a changing climate, rapid population growth, resource scarcity, resurgence in ideology, and shifts in global power from West to East"" out to 2040. Dependence on complex global systems, chiefly ""global supply chains for resources"" is likely to ""increase the risk of systemic failures.""  Although globalisation is ""likely to be an engine for accelerating economic growth"" the report said, it could also be ""a source of risk, as local markets become increasingly exposed to destabilising fluctuations in the wider global economy. Economically, globalisation is likely to generate winners and losers, especially in the labour market.""  Globalisation will likely benefit ""the globalised core, which comprises the most interdependent and economically successful regions of the world."" However, the report alludes to the danger of civil unrest in the core: ""Instability within the globalised core is likely to adversely affect the national interests of major powers."" Furthermore it is the job of the globalised core's security agencies to protect its dominant access to resources and technologies of production:  ""Resources, trade, capital and intellectual property are likely to flow through this core, and rely on complex networks of physical and virtual infrastructure"" including ""air and sea lanes and their associated ports, rail and road infrastructure, communications links, gas, oil, electricity pipelines and cables, food distribution centres, banking and finance hubs, universities and science parks, manufacturing and energy production facilities."" Therefore: ""Ensuring the security of this globally distributed infrastructure is likely to be of multilateral interest."" Given that a tightly-knit network of just 147 of the world's most powerful companies own and control the bulk of the world's productive assets, this is virtually a defence manifesto for the 1% (or, perhaps more accurately, the 0.1%).  Despite the world producing sufficient energy, food and freshwater resources, the MoD report continues, ""distribution and access to resources will be uneven"" – concentrated in the richer core at the expense of the poorer periphery – ""and local and regional shortages will occur, increasing the likelihood of societal instability and of disagreement between states, and providing the triggers that may ignite conflict."" Most disturbing is the report's implicit securitisation of foreign Muslim-majority populations in the periphery, and diaspora communities in the ""core."" Rising populations ""especially in the Middle East, Central Asia and sub-Saharan Africa"" may ""fuel instability"" by generating ""youth bulges"" that could ""provide a reservoir of disaffected young people. In particular, young males with limited economic prospects may be susceptible to radicalisation."" The report emphasises the vulnerability of cities, stating that ""large urban areas"" especially those with poor governance could become ""centres of criminality and disaffection,"" and as such, ""focal points for extremist ideologies."" This could culminate in ""urban, rather than rural, insurgency"", and at worst the failure of local governments. Here, the MoD refers directly to the rationale for the sort of social science research currently being funded in earnest by its American counterpart:  ""A greater understanding of the dynamics of urban societies will be required if instability within these regions is to be identified and managed. New ideologies will emerge, driven by religion, ethnic differences, nationalism, inequality or a combination of these factors. Ideological conflicts are likely to occur and extremist groups may use violence to achieve political objectives."" Note here that the sweeping reference to ""extremist groups"" indicates that violence is not integral to the assumption of their extremist character; what, then, makes them ""extremist""? The MoD report is conveniently vague on this point, but it seems the context suggests any group working for major political and economic change that challenges the dominance of the ""globalised core"" - very similar themes to research funded by the DoD:  ""There may be a resurgence of anti-capitalist ideologies, such as Marxism. Diaspora communities are likely to increase in size and influence and many will bring economic benefits to their host states. However, those that fail to integrate are likely to remain reservoirs for resentment. Some of these groups are likely to become involved in ideologically driven conflicts, and may act as proxies for other states. Similarly, host states may be drawn into regions and conflicts that reflect the interests of their diaspora communities."" So ideologies which oppose global capitalism are ""extreme"" or ""radical"", and assumed to be inherently vulnerable to political violence. Meanwhile, ""diaspora communities"" in the west - a polite euphemism for black and ethnic minority groups - will be particularly vulnerable to becoming ""reservoirs for resentment"" as capitalist globalisation continues to deepen inequalities between ""winners"" and ""losers"", and thus to operating as fifth column ""proxies"" for foreign interests. Though the language here is carefully articulated, its racist, imperialist pretensions are difficult to overlook: in coming decades, Muslims, immigrants, foreigners and activists are all potential terrorists, and must therefore be watched. The analysis is subliminally premised on the axiomatic drive to protect the multilateral supremacy of the globalised core at the expense of the periphery, rather than recognising the causal role of that very structure in accelerating security risks.  The underlying assumption is that the present system is the most advanced ever possible for humanity, and thus must be protected in its current structure at all cost. The upshot is that Anglo-American security agencies, with the best of intentions, believe that civilian populations across both the core and periphery will become vortexes for 'extremism' as the normal operation of global capitalism concentrates the benefits of growth in a powerful minority dominating the planet's productive resources, and thus ramps up resentment against the system – with the core locus of such dangerous resentment orienting around activists, civil society groups, and minority communities.  As the instability of global capitalism accelerates, the 'war on terror' is increasingly transforming into a war on dissent – a war on everyone who either opposes global capitalism in its current form, or is marginalised by it. In a world where 85 people are collectively worth $1 trillion - equal to the entire wealth of the bottom half of the world's population – it's fair to say that makes most of us.

"Scientists have discovered a frozen underworld beneath the ice sheet covering northern Greenland. The previously unknown landscape, a vast expanse of warped shapes including some as tall as a Manhattan skyscraper, was found using ice-penetrating radar loaded aboard Nasa survey flights.   The findings and the first images of the frozen world more than a mile below the surface of the ice sheet are published on Sunday in the journal Nature Geoscience. Scientists said the findings could deepen understanding of how the ice sheets of Greenland and Antarctica respond to climate change. “We see more of these features where the ice sheet starts to go fast,” Robin Bell, the study's lead author and a geophysicist at Columbia University's Lamont Doherty Earth Observatory, said in a statement. “We think the refreezing process uplifts, distorts and warms the ice above, making it softer and easier to flow.” Until recently, scientists studying the Greenland ice sheet for evidence of change under global warming had thought the shapes they discerned beneath the ice sheet were mountain ranges. But with sophisticated new gravity-sensing and radar operating from Nasa's airborne surveys of the ice sheet over the last 20 years, scientists eventually concluded the formations were ice – not rock. The formations were caused by the melting and subsequent re-freezing of water at the bottom of the ice sheet and the scientists said they were initially stunned by the results.  “They simply look spectacular,” said Kirsty Tinto, a geophysicist at Lamont-Doherty. “Everything was just flat parallel lines. That is how ice is supposed to be. But here it is breaking all the rules. You get these crazy, folded, distorted, overturned, undulating things at the bottom of the ice, and they are the size of skyscrapers.” The structures – some measuring up to 1km thick - cover about 10% of the surveyed areas of northern Greenland. About a dozen were found around Petermann glacier in north-western Greenland, which has been undergoing rapid changes and two years ago calved an iceberg twice the size of Manhattan. The melting and re-freezing at the bottom of the ice sheet has been underway for hundreds of thousands of years.  Scientists were aware of the process but until now did not realise the meltwater was re-freezing into complex formations. The glacier warms under its own weight, producing meltwater that freezes and grows up into the forms around its base. The process appears to accelerate the flow of glaciers, such as Petermann towards the sea, but Tinto said further study was needed.  “If we want to understand how ice is going to respond to climate change, we have to understand its fundamental dynamic,” she said. “It is not just that you are melting the surface and the surface is just running into the sea. There is a complicated and quite beautiful system running through the ice and you have to understand it top to bottom to understand what it is doing.”"

"Credit markets are central to the global financial system. Valued at over $100tn they provide an essential way for governments, corporations and municipalities to raise bonds for public infrastructure and long-term development. Credit markets are also pivotal for the transition to a green economy – and are already being impacted by the disruptive effects of climate change. The credit ratings agency, Standard & Poor's (S&P) has recently issued a wide-ranging set of research reports on the implications of climate change for the bonds issued by both countries and corporations. S&P's president, Neeraj Sahai, serves on the International Advisory Council of the UNEP Inquiry into the Design of a Sustainable Financial System, which aims to identify policy options to deliver a step-change in capital mobilisation for a green and inclusive economy.  S&P recently co-hosted an event with the Inquiry (disclaimer: I am a co-director of UNEP Inquiry) in New York to examine the strategic agenda linking bonds, climate change and the financial system. The event brought together leading banks, investors, public bodies and civil society organisations working to promote market and policy innovations that align finance with the green economy. The findings of S&P's research highlight the growing materiality of climate for credit markets. According to S&P, climate change will put downward pressure on sovereign credit ratings through the 21st century, with the poorest countries bearing the brunt: all the top 20 most vulnerable nations are emerging markets. Economic output, fiscal strength and trade performance will all be hit. Corporate bonds are also being affected by extreme events and carbon risk – with the first credit downgrade for climate policy reasons occurring back in 2009. So far, climate has had limited impacts on the bonds issued by insurance companies, but this could change if the severity and frequency of extreme events intensifies. On the upside, the bond market is also becoming a growing source of capital for the green economy – with a 50% increase in 'green bond' issuance in 2013 to $11bn, and expectations of $40-50bn in 2014. To help build integrity into this burgeoning market, a set of Green Bond Principles was issued by a coalition of 25 banks in January. Discussions at the event highlighted that three critical issues look set to shape the way climate and other sustainability issues build tomorrow's financial system. Climate change is a long-term risk Climate change is a structural, long-term threat to the global economy, and one of the challenges facing both the analysts who rate the bonds and the institutional investors who buy them is how to factor in impacts outside the conventional five year window for credit ratings. Extending time horizons is central to a financial system geared to sustainability. More information is needed Credit markets also need deeper and more quantifiable information on climate and environmental risks more broadly. Some securities regulators have started to require corporate disclosure of environmental, social and governance (ESG) factors, but a more strategic response is required, and in the case of climate change, focusing on the twin risks of extreme events and stranded assets. Embed sustainability - the right way The risks revealed by the latest credit research point to the broader need for policymakers to embed sustainability factors in ways that ensure the fundamental stability of both financial institutions and financial markets. For example, climate change clearly impinges on the core task of insurance regulators to ensure that insurers are 'safe and sound'. Likewise, the rising burden of extreme events will profoundly shape the management of systemic risk, particularly in vulnerable developing countries. In the last year, the green economy agenda has taken off in the world of credit, highlighting how quickly market forces of supply and demand can change. Yet this is only the beginning, with key steps still needed to make long-term environmental sustainability a routine part of global bond markets. But the momentum is set to grow – not least with the prospect of the UN Climate Summit in September and the finalisation of climate talks in Paris 2015.

"The last time Congress made a serious effort on climate change, Joe Manchin campaigned for a Senate seat in West Virginia by shooting a rifle at a cap-and-trade bill. And Manchin, who won, is a Democrat. Four years on, Republican candidates who deny the existence of climate change may be shooting themselves in the foot – and Democrats might even be able to say the words ""global warming"" out loud on the campaign trail between now and November.  The rules being announced by the Environmental Protection Agency on Monday represent a workaround – President Obama had to circumvent Congress and use his executive authority to enact the EPA's new regulations on power plants. But they also mark a sea change on sea-level rise: in a year when big money and big policy changes have made climate change a legitimate mid-term election issue, it's no longer political poison to talk about the threat to the planet. In 2014, it may even be a plus for some candidates trying to save it. As it turns out, the political climate is changing. Two-thirds of Americans supported strict carbon rules for power plants. Heat waves, Arctic winters, drought, wildfires, hurricanes, storm surges, even a rise in hay fever - these have made climate change personal to many Americans, and the conventional wisdom no longer holds. West Virginia is West Virginia – a coal state where guns and the pro-coal crowd tend to win, and talking green doesn't – but some strategists even see climate change as part of a winning Democratic brand headed all the way to 2016. ""I think we own this,"" outgoing White House press secretary Jay Carney said of the sleeper issue of this election year. And like all election issues these days, somebody tries to help buy ownership. It's no coincidence that Senate majority leader Harry Reid's favorite targets are the conservative oil billionaire Koch brothers – all the better for attacking Republicans as anti-science, and beholden to industry and conservative groups. Others are also speaking up, too, encouraged by an infusion of $100m from the billionaire environmentalist Tom Steyer for pro-climate candidates in seven Senate and gubernatorial races. In Michigan, Steyer is supporting Democrat Gary Peters against Republican Terri Lynn Land, who says she does not agree with ""radical liberals"" about the causes of climate change, and that there should be a debate as to whether or not it is real. Peters warns the Great Lakes are in danger because of global warming, he has protested against pet coke dumps along the Detroit river, and he opposes the Keystone XL pipeline – a decision on which the administration has put off until after November, not that it's going anywhere as part of the conversation. Steyer is also supporting Jeanne Shaheen, who is trying to hold her New Hampshire Senate seat – and who argues Americans have a ""moral obligation"" to deal with climate change. Others are out in front on climate change, even without encouragement from billionaire campaign contributers. Don Beyer, a car dealer running for a House seat in northern Virginia, sent out direct mail and bought television ads calling for a carbon tax – a position that not too long ago would have been seen as political suicide. Of course, Democrats fighting in oil states like Alaska or Arkansas rarely, if ever, mention climate change or Keystone. Senator Mary Landrieu may actually be losing mega-donor support in her razor-close Louisiana re-election bid because of her pro-Keystone, anti-EPA positions. But there are growing signs that scientific truth may beat out political fear. Even in red-state Georgia, the Democratic Senate candidate, Michelle Nunn, has no time for climate deniers: ""The science is clear,"" her campaign website says. And when the campaign chair for one of her potential opponents does something like go on Facebook during last winter's epic ice storm with a post beginning ""Hey Atlanta! Quit whining..."", Democrats start to realize it's just bad politics to ignore the environment when it affects so many people. A lot of this country is already moving away from coal - to natural gas, wind and solar. Iowa, where Tuesday's Senate primary is hinging on climate legislation, gets more than 25% of its electricity from wind power. Kansas gets about 20%. Texas, North Dakota and other states are profiting from the oil and natural gas boom. All of those states can come out winners with the EPA's new power plant rules. A poll for the Natural Resources Defense Council (NRDC) Action Fund of nine battleground states – Arkansas, Alaska, Colorado, Iowa, Louisiana, Michigan, New Hampshire, North Carolina and Virginia – found 53% support for the carbon pollution controls, even among red-state Republicans. ""Climate denial will not last,"" Heather Taylor-Miesle, who directs the NRDC action fund, said last week. And she might be right already. Climate deniers remain in the majority among Republicans in Congress, but even they're beginning to dial it down. Marco Rubio, whose home state of Florida will be swamped by sea-level rise, was forced last month to backpedal on his denial, and House speaker John Boehner said last week he is ""not qualified"" to debate climate science. If all unfolds according to Obama's plan, the EPA rules will be final by mid-2016, just in time for the next presidential election. By then, any Republican eyeing a run for the White House is going to have to face up to the facts, Taylor-Miesle insists. ""I don't believe a person can win the White House in 2016 that is a climate denier,"" she said. ""I just don't."""
"Scottish ministers are under intense pressure to step up their action on climate change after missing their statutory targets for cutting emissions for the third year in a row. The latest figures showed Scotland missed its legally binding emissions targets by 2.4m tonnes equivalent (mte) of CO2 in 2012.   Under Scotland's climate act – touted repeatedly by Alex Salmond, the first minister, as the most ambitious in the world – the emissions target for 2012 was 53.226mte CO2, only marginally lower than the 2011 target. But the country emitted 55.6mte CO2, and has now failed to hit any of its targets. Meanwhile, the Scottish government and Scottish National party are campaigning to abolish air passenger duty, a measure seen by its supporters as helping reduce aviation emissions, after independence. Scotland's annual target for 2013 is the most ambitious cut of the entire programme, a cut of 10% in a single year to 47,976mte – a target the Scottish Labour party and Scottish Green party told Holyrood ministers are now almost certain to miss by a large margin. That target is likely to be missed by even more significant amount of around 8mte CO2, they said, due to failure to take radical steps on transport, heating and industrial emissions. Paul Wheelhouse, the Scottish environment minister, said the slight rise in 2012 emissions was due largely to an unexpected change in the emissions counting methodology and new emissions data, which added 5.4mte to Scotland's total that year. His officials also blamed a cold snap increasing home heating, and a switch from gas to much more carbon-intensive coal by power companies that winter. If those revisions had been backdated to the start of the baseline period and included in the annual legislative targets, the revised goal for 2012 would have been 57.3mte, and his government would have been celebrating a 1.6mte cut in emissions. He said the independent UK Committee on Climate Change had reported earlier this year that Scotland's “underlying progress appears on track in most sectors” despite missing the previous two targets. Wheelhouse said: “Be assured - this government’s ambition is resolute. I am confident our world-leading targets are driving the changes required for a smooth transition to a low carbon Scotland. Scottish ministers remain fully committed to delivering Scotland’s ambitious greenhouse gas emission targets and the economic advantages of an early transition are clear.” After accepting demands for more action from opposition parties, he said the Scottish government had set up a new cabinet sub-committee to coordinate its policies with a new climate change delivery board, as well as working on new district heating schemes, more funding for energy efficiency and a new framework for delivering national planning projects. The environment umbrella group Stop Climate Chaos Scotland said these were welcome serious commitments, but Patrick Harvie, co-leader of the Scottish Green party said far tougher action was needed. ""It’s deeply concerning that after years of self-congratulation for setting ambitious targets, Scotland has now missed the first three in a row,” he said. ""The tough reality is that the first three annual targets were the easy ones – and these are the ones the government has missed. The next annual target is the first which demands a really big cut of over 5m tonnes, and there is little sign that the government understands the scale of the challenge that lies ahead."""
"A growing number of scientists are predicting a major El Niño weather event this year, which could wreak havoc across South America and Asia as droughts, floods and other extreme weather events hit industry and farming. But the impacts on the world’s coral reefs could be even more disastrous. The last big El Niño in 1997/98 caused the worst coral bleaching in recorded history. In total, 16% of the world’s coral was lost and some countries like the Maldives lost up to 90% of their reef coverage. The Australian Bureau of Meteorology suggests there’s a 70% chance of an El Niño occurring this year – and all the signs are that it will rival the ’98 event.  El Niño arises out of a confluence of factors that are still not fully understood, but its outcome is clear – parts of the ocean get hotter. A band of warm water develops in the western Pacific, while the Indo-Pacific Warm Pool – a blob of heat that spans much of Indonesia – starts oscillating wildly. This could spell disaster for the Coral Triangle, a southeast Asian bioregion that’s the underwater equivalent of the Amazon, home to more marine species than anywhere else on Earth. “In 1998, the Coral Triangle started to bleach in May and continued till September,” says Professor Ove Hoeg Guldberg, a marine biologist and head of the Global Change Institute at the University of Queensland. “The Coral Triangle sees prolonged periods of temperature anomaly during an El Niño because the equator passes through the middle of it, so it experiences both northern and southern hemisphere summers.” Professor Guldberg, who led the Oceans chapter of the IPCC report on climate change, is less than sanguine about the prospects for the region’s coral reefs. “It only takes about half a degree on top of background sea temperatures to cause bleaching,” he explains. “Atmospheric scientists are telling us we’re headed for temperatures that will trump those of 1998.” Corals are animals that behave like plants. They’re able to do this by maintaining a symbiotic relationship with dinoflagellates, a type of microbe that lives inside the coral’s tissue where it photosynthesises, passing sugar to its host. But when temperatures rise, the dinoflagellates stop making sugar and produce harmful free radicals instead. The corals then spit them out, stop producing their carbonate shell and steadily fade to white. Coral bleaching is actually quite a common occurrence and bleached reefs can make comebacks – many of the reefs affected by the 1998 El Niño have made at least partial recoveries. “The thing is, under mild conditions, corals can recover their symbiotes,” says Professor Guldberg. “But because background temperatures are warmer, the corals can’t recover as before.” Even when reefs do recover, old growth corals that may have taken centuries to mature are often replaced with faster growing species that quickly colonise large areas, homogenising the ecosystem. The elephant in the room of course is global warming and this is where things get scary. According to Professor Guldberg, current rates of ocean warming and acidification are unmatched in most if not all of the last 65 million years. “This sends chills down back of any biologist worth their salt because life will have to struggle in circumstances that it’s just not evolved for.” It’s not so much the fact that 10 or 20% of global reef coverage could be lost in the next year or so, but the reduced ability of these reefs to recover. This is death by a thousand cuts, an aggregation of impacts, from extreme weather events to invasive species to destructive fishing practices, with global warming reverberating across all of them. A landmark 2007 study by John Bruno and Elizabeth Selig showed that the Coral Triangle had lost nearly 50% of its reefs since the 1980s. Beset by constantly rising temperatures, they simply can’t bounce back. The Coral Triangle is particularly vulnerable because it’s more prone to non-climate related pressures than other reefs. According to the World Resources Institute, more than 85% of reefs within the bioregion are threatened by local stressors (overfishing, destructive fishing and pollution), which is substantially higher than the global average of 60%. About 120 million people depend directly on these reefs for their livelihood. As the coral dies, more and more of them will be forced to migrate to live. “You’re looking at a situation where a once vibrant ecosystem that offered goods and services for humanity is heading towards extinction,” says Professor Guldberg. The broad scientific consensus is that corals worldwide could be on the verge of extinction by as early as 2050. In the broader context of global warming, coral reefs are not necessarily the first ecosystems to go, but they are the most graphic. They can be seen as an early warning system – the proverbial canary in the coalmine, except when corals start to expire, it tends to presage species annihilation on a scale witnessed only five times previously in the planet’s history. That’s why the term “sixth extinction” is becoming part of the media lexicon. The only meaningful solution in the long term is to drastically reduce carbon emissions worldwide. Not much can be done to mitigate the impact of an impending El Niño, but some of the other non-climate related stresses can be removed. This means establishing areas of undisturbed marine habitat – lots of them – and reducing pressure on fisheries. Guldberg offers the metaphor of a chronically ill patient that needs radical treatment – “but they also need remedial care – blankets, water, food. That’s something immediate we can achieve.” As for the radical treatment, it needs to happen very soon. If not, corals could soon become mere aquarium artefacts. • Johnny Langenheim is a contributor to The Coral Triangle website"

"Fox News loves to declare wars. Wishing someone 'happy holidays' is a War on Christmas. Support for marriage equality is a War on Marriage. And trying to limit carbon pollution to preserve a livable climate for future generations is now a War on Coal. Recently, President Obama's Environmental Protection Agency administrator Gina McCarthy went on HBO's Real Time with Bill Maher. Maher asked if the EPA's new regulations on greenhouse gas emissions from existing power plants could be described as a 'war on coal,' as some conservative media outlets have called it. McCarthy responded:  Actually, EPA is all about fighting against pollution and fighting for public health. That’s exactly what this is. Exactly.  That's an accurate description – the regulations were implemented to fight against carbon pollution and to protect public health. Coal isn't the only target, but it is the source of about a quarter of America's carbon pollution.  The problem we face is that if we want to limit global warming to no more than 2°C above pre-industrial temperatures – a level that represents significant risks, but is the lowest target we can feasibly achieve – we have to leave about 80% of proven coal, oil, and gas reserves in the ground. If we burn all available coal, oil, and gas, we'll cause high-risk and potentially catastrophic climate change. Calling these legally mandated and important regulations a 'war on coal' is a rhetorical strategy. The phrase evokes images of government attacks on noble coal miners. While coal mining is a difficult and extremely dangerous job, it's also an uncommon one. Employment by the coal industry has been dropping in the USA since the late 1970s. The industry now employs under 80,000 miners, less than one-third its peak numbers 35 years ago thanks to a rise in strip mining and other machinery use. It represents just 0.06% of the American work force. On the other hand, employment in the renewable energy sector has been growing rapidly, in large part because low-carbon energy tends to be more job-intensive than fossil fuel energy. For example, a 2004 UC Berkeley study concluded, ""Across a broad range of scenarios, the renewable energy sector generates more jobs than the fossil fuel-based energy sector per unit of energy delivered (i.e., per average megawatt)."" The study found that investing in various types of renewable energy would create about twice as many jobs in the USA by 2020 as investing in coal and natural gas. Joining in the rhetorical games, the EPA greenhouse gas regulations could easily be called a 'war on unemployment.'  In fact, a recent REMI study found that a revenue-neutral carbon tax would create jobs, increase personal disposable income, and grow the economy even in coal-heavy American regions (with the exception of the oil-heavy region of Texas and neighboring states). Those who fear the economic impact of EPA greenhouse gas regulations could support its replacement with a revenue-neutral carbon tax or some other type of free market solution. Business as usual just isn't an option anymore. Coal and other fossil fuels have been getting a free ride for over a century, pumping billions of tons of carbon pollution into the atmosphere for free. That pollution has inescapable costs through the damages it causes via climate change, committing us to about $1 trillion in costs every year, globally. Fossil fuel industries don't pay these costs – we do. They're effectively a massive subsidy, government welfare on steroids. Regulating or putting a price on carbon pollution is a no-brainer, and long overdue. Even contrarian climate economists agree on this. It's not specifically a war on coal, but it is an effort to hold fossil fuels accountable for their full costs.  We also need to face the fact that to mitigate global warming risks, we need to leave most existing fossil fuel reserves in the ground. There are ways to accomplish the transition to low-carbon energy sources while maintaining economic growth. Playing rhetorical games is not constructive; we need all parties to come to the table and participate in crafting the best possible climate policies. Otherwise we'll just be stuck with government regulation of carbon pollution – an imperfect solution, but an important step towards solving this critical problem."
"Jamestown Island, America's oldest known permanent European settlement runs the risk of being swept away by rising seas, with some sections of it already beneath the James River. Interior Secretary Sally Jewell got a firsthand look Thursday at the effect of climate change on ever-receding coastline Jamestown Island, Virgina.  Jewell trekked around the island, and heard of the devastation in 2003 when Hurricane Isabel raked the low-lying landscape. The storm left many parts of the island underwater and destroyed thousands of artifacts retrieved from archaeological digs. Many are still being restored. Jewell told the Associated Press that Jamestown is certainly vulnerable. ""I know enough now having been in this job looking at vulnerable sites that this is a highly vulnerable site,"" Jewell said. ""We don't have very many places in the United States that talk about the super-early history of settlers connecting with the native people of the land, so this is a really an important place."" Dorothy Geyer, a Park Service natural resource specialist, said a one-and-a-half-foot rise in sea level would put 60% of the island under water and a four-foot-plus rise would increase that number to 80%. Jewell said her visit to Jamestown is part of the Obama administration's push to address climate change. ""It's very clear we have global warming and sea level rise and this is a hot spot for it,"" Jewell said. ""And what's at risk is the history of our country."" Jamestown was settled in 1607 by Europeans, including Captain John Smith. When European settlers arrived, there already was a thriving population of Native Americans led by paramount Chief Powhatan. The remnants of both native people and settlers can be found on the island. The Tidewater of Virginia and sections of the Chesapeake Bay are among the most vulnerable to sea change in the world. While climate change is a big factor, the region is also sinking the result of a meteor that gouged out the Chesapeake Bay 35m years ago. The tour followed a report in May by the Union of Concerned Scientists that lists Jamestown as among 30 historic and cultural sites in the nation that are at risk because of climate change. Jewell trekked through mosquito-infested wetlands and through stands of loblolly during the tour. At Black Point, the eastern-most point of land on the island, she saw where waters had reclaimed 20ft of the island through the years. Jewell visited a research center where thousands of artifacts are still being restored. More than one million artifacts pipe stems, ceramic cookware, silver settings were damaged. Jewell later had discussions with climate scientists."
"Forget old-style alchemy. A California-based tech company has come up with something far cooler than just turning dull metal into shiny metal. Using a proprietary 'biocatalyst' machine, Newlight Technologies has devised a way of taking greenhouse gas from the atmosphere and turning it into plastic pellets. The AirCarbon technology promises not only to reduce the use of petroleum in plastic manufacturing, but to reduce greenhouse gases in the atmosphere at the same time. The net result could be a ""whole new paradigm for how plastics impact the world"", says Mark Herrema, Newlight's co-founder and chief executive.  ""We harness carbon from greenhouse gas and use it as a resource to make materials that are as strong as oil-based plastics but less expensive"", he adds. So will it take off? The early signs are certainly promising. US telecommunications firm Sprint has just announced that it will launch an iPhone 5 and iPhone 5s case based on the revolutionary thermoplastic. The case, which is certified by the independent environmental auditor Trucost as ""carbon-negative"" (meaning it stores more carbon than it emits), will initially sell in limited volumes online. ""Phone cases are a significant use of plastics for us [and] a very easy market for us to get into"", says Amy Hargroves, Sprint's director of corporate responsibility and sustainability. ""The point really isn't just about the sales of an AirCarbon case, but it's getting it to scale as an acceptable material in our broader portfolio and that of other companies."" To that end, news from Dell will help. The US computer manufacturer recently reported its intention to release packaging sleeves made from the eco plastic for its Latitude series notebooks. If successful, Dells says it will move more of its packaging and products over to AirCarbon in the future. Newlight is currently in discussions with a number of other manufacturers to develop a range of other applications based on the technology, from automotive and beverage solutions through to apparel and packaging. ""The AirCarbon production technology was scaled to small commercial scale in August 2013, so our mission now is to ramp up capacity to global scale. Our next major target is 50m pounds per year capacity"", says Herrema, who founded Newlight back in 2003. The technology works by initially isolating carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases from industrial sources, such digesters and methane capture technologies on dairy farms. The carbon-heavy air is then pumped into a biocatalyst that isolates the carbon, before reassembling it in a polymerising process into a long-chain thermopolymer. Newlight insists that the technology outcompetes conventional oil-based plastic on price and its overall environmental footprint. It also operates recycling facilities to re-process AirCarbon products, edging it towards the holy grail of ""cradle-to-cradle"" manufacturing. Plastic manufacturing currently accounts for 4% of global oil consumption, according to the British Plastics Federation. Sprint's Hargroves concedes that integrating any new innovation into the plastics supply chain carries risks and that manufacturers are often cautious breed about adopting new technologies. That said, she predicts a ""pretty broad acceptance"" of the disruptive technology within a decade. ""The question is 'why wouldn't you do it?'"" she says. ""If you can get to the point where it is less expensive that other options, it has environmental benefits and it has the same quality, it should become the obvious choice.""

"Business lobbies and conservative thinktanks have carried out a series of pre-emptive strikes aimed at wrecking Monday's launch of Barack Obama's historic climate plan. The new rules – the first to cut carbon pollution from power plants – will define Obama's environmental legacy and could break open negotiations for a global deal on climate change.  But well before their release, they set off duelling spin campaigns on the costs and benefits of the new rules, and their impact on climate change. The new rules, which were written by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), will for the first time cut carbon pollution from the country's power plants – the single biggest source of carbon dioxide emissions that cause climate change. The country's biggest business lobby, the Chamber of Commerce, got out in front, claiming the plan would cost the economy $51bn a year by 2030, and that 224,000 Americans would lose their jobs. The chamber, a committed opponent of Obama and any curbs on pollution, said the burden of the new rules would fall heaviest on south-eastern states which are heavily dependent on coal, and not as well-suited for wind or hydro power as other regions. The coal lobby – which had more apocalyptic economic forecasts – said the rules would have no effect on climate change. “Even if our nation’s entire coal fleet was shut down, global emissions of greenhouse gases would be reduced by just 3%,” Mike Duncan, the president of the American Coalition for Clean Coal Electricity wrote in a blogpost on Friday. The chamber said the EPA plan would cut global emissions by just 1.8%, while the Cato Institute, which was founded by the conservative oil billionaire Koch brothers, said the new rules would reduce warming by an even more miniscule 0.018%. Joe Manchin, a Democratic senator from the coal state of West Virginia, said the new rules would not just hurt the economy – they would kill people outright. ""A lot of people on the lower end of the socio-economic spectrum [are] going to die,” he said earlier this month. As expected, the view from the opposite side of the political spectrum is decidedly different. The Natural Resources Defense Council, which produced the model plan that served as a guideline for the EPA regulations, said cutting carbon pollution from power plans would save Americans $37.4 bn on their electricity bills in 2020. It would create more than 274,000 jobs for roofers and electricians installing solar panels and new energy-saving technologies, the analysis said. The NRDC said the plan could cut carbon pollution by about 35% from 2005 levels, or the equivalent of up to 700m tons. The Union of Concerned Scientists, the Clean Air Task Force and the Environmental Defense Fund have also put out reports arguing that the climate plan is relatively affordable, and would produce widespread benefits. So who is right? The White House criticised the chamber's projections as “doomsday claims”. The New York Times' Paul Krugman wrote on Thursday that $50bn was a pretty good deal. “So, is $50bn a lot? Let’s look at the CBO’s long-term projections. These say that average annual US real GDP over the period 2014-2030 will be $21.5tn. So the chamber is telling us that we can achieve major reductions in greenhouse gases at a cost of 0.2% of GDP. That’s cheap!” He said the chamber's estimate for job losses was also a small number for a workforce of 140 million. Brian Murray, director of economic analysis at Duke University's Nicholas Institute, said it was impossible to gauge the full economic impact of the new rules before their release. But he suggested it might make sense to look at both studies as outliers. “I wouldn’t conclude one is more biased than the other,” he said in an email. “It may be reasonable to view these as upper and lower bounds of economic impact. “ The EPA said any costs to power companies of the new rules should be weighed against the far greater risks of not dealing with the threat of climate change. “The cost of inaction on climate is a real drain on our economy,” the agency said. Researchers at Harvard and Syracuse universities said this week the new rules could produce significant public health benefits – if they were stringent enough. The researchers said steep cuts in carbon pollution would also deliver reductions of mercury and other pollutants,. That would avoid tens of thousands of premature deaths from heart attacks, lung cancer, and asthma, the report said. It put the annual public health savings at $280bn."
"Barack Obama, scientists and campaigners have all looked at how to engage Americans more powerfully on the environment. Now researchers have come up with one critical piece of advice: do say ""global warming"", don't say ""climate change"". New research released on Tuesday found Americans care more deeply when the term ""global warming"" is used to describe the major environmental challenge. ""Climate change"", in contrast, leaves them relatively cold.   The two terms are often used interchangeably but they generate very different responses, the researchers from the Yale Project on Climate Change Communications and the George Mason University Center for Climate Change Communications said. “Those two terms get heard and interpreted in very different ways,” Anthony Leiserowitz, a research scientist at Yale and one of the lead authors, told The Guardian. “The choice of these two terms really does matter, depending on who you are talking to.” The term “global warming” resonates far more powerfully, triggering images of ice melt, extreme weather and catastrophe. Mention “climate change”, however, and many Americans begin to disengage, the researchers found. The researchers found naming the issue as “global warming” rather than climate change made it easier to connect. Americans in general were 13% more likely to say that global warming was a bad thing. The differences were even more pronounced among Latinos, African-Americans, women, and young people. Latinos were 30% more likely to view global warming as a personal threat, compared to climate change. African-Americans were 20% more likely to rate global warming as a very big risk, compared to climate change. George W Bush swapped the term climate change for global warming in 2002, on the advice of the Republican political consultant, Frank Luntz. In a secret memo before the mid-term elections, Luntz warned Republicans – and Bush in particular – were singularly weak on the environment. He advised a strategy of disputing climate science, and of avoiding the term ""global warming' because of its highly negative connotations. “It's time for us to start talking about 'climate change' instead of global warming ... 'climate change' is less frightening than 'global warming',” said the memo obtained by the Environmental Working Group. The confusion stuck. The Obama administration, scientists and campaign groups have all struggled with how to communicate with Americans about the global challenge. Officials in Obama's first term avoided any mention of the words global warming or climate change – believing it would provoke a backlash from Republicans – and spoke instead of “clean energy” and “green jobs”. Scientists often prefer climate change to global warming for technical reasons. Meanwhile, some campaign groups have argued that “global warming” was considered too political, and that “climate change” would make it easier to appeal to Republicans. The Bush administration preferred to use ""climate change"".  Others coined new terms such as “climate crisis” and “global weirding”. It turns out they would have all been better off sticking with global warming. The survey sample of 1,657 people, compiled over a two-week period late last year, found a large swathe of Americans turned off by the words “climate change”. “The use of the term climate change appears to actually reduce issue engagement by Democrats, Independents, liberals, and moderates, as well as a variety of subgroups within American society, including men, women, minorities, different generations, and across political and partisan lines,” the researchers said. “While global warming has catastrophic connotations attached to it, climate change suggests a more controllable and less emotional challenge.” Meanwhile, there was no sign that using the term climate change was making any inroads in winning over Republicans, the researchers found. “It is a kind of a wake-up call that it is complicated and that sometimes, depending on who you are communicating with, you are not achieving what you think you are,” Leiserowitz said."
"According to a new peer-reviewed scientific report, industrial civilisation is likely to deplete its low-cost mineral resources within the next century, with debilitating impacts for the global economy and key infrastructures within the coming decade. The study, the 33rd report to the Club of Rome, is authored by Prof Ugo Bardi of the University of Florence's Earth Sciences Department, and includes contributions from a wide range of senior scientists across relevant disciplines.  The Club of Rome is a Swiss-based global think tank consisting of current and former heads of state, UN bureaucrats, government officials, diplomats, scientists, economists and business leaders.  Its first report in 1972, The Limits to Growth, was conducted by a scientific team at the Massachusetts Institute for Technology (MIT), and warned that limited availability of natural resources relative to rising costs would undermine continued economic growth by around the second decade of the 21st century. Although widely ridiculed, recent scientific reviews confirm that the original report's projections in its 'base scenario' remain robust. In 2008, Australia's federal government scientific research agency CSIRO concluded that The Limits to Growth forecast of potential ""global ecological and economic collapse coming up in the middle of the 21st Century"" due to convergence of ""peak oil, climate change, and food and water security"", is ""on-track."" Actual current trends in these areas ""resonate strongly with the overshoot and collapse displayed in the book's 'business-as-usual scenario.'""  In 2009, American Scientist published similar findings by other scientists. That review, by leading systems ecologists Prof Charles Hall of State University of New York and Prof John W Day of Louisiana State University, concluded that while the limits-to-growth model's ""predictions of extreme pollution and population decline have not come true"", the model results are:  ""... almost exactly on course some 35 years later in 2008 (with a few appropriate assumptions)... it is important to recognise that its predictions have not been invalidated and in fact seem quite on target. We are not aware of any model made by economists that is as accurate over such a long time span."" The new Club of Rome report says that: ""The phase of mining by humans is a spectacular but very brief episode in the geological history of the planet… The limits to mineral extraction are not limits of quantity; they are limits of energy. Extracting minerals takes energy, and the more dispersed the minerals are, the more energy is needed… Only conventional ores can be profitably mined with the amounts of energy we can produce today."" The combination of mineral depletion, associated radioactive and heavy metal pollution, and the accumulation of greenhouse gases from fossil fuel exploitation is leaving our descendants the ""heavy legacy"" of a virtually terraformed world:  ""The Earth will never be the same; it is being transformed into a new and different planet.""  Drawing on the work of leading climate scientists including James Hansen, the former head of NASA's Goddard Institute for Space Studies, the report warns that a continuation of 'business as usual' exploitation of the world's fossil fuels could potentially trigger runaway global warming that, in several centuries or thousands of years, permanently destroy the planet's capacity to host life. Despite this verdict, the report argues that neither a ""collapse"" of the current structure of civilisation, nor the ""extinction"" of the human species are unavoidable.  A fundamental reorganisation of the way societies produce, manage and consume resources could support a new high-technology civilisation, but this would entail a new ""circular economy"" premised on wide-scale practices of recycling across production and consumption chains, a wholesale shift to renewable energy, application of agro-ecological methods to food production, and with all that, very different types of social structures.  In the absence of a major technological breakthrough in clean energy production such as nuclear fusion – which so far seems improbable - recycling, conservation and efficiency in the management of the planet's remaining accessible mineral resources will need to be undertaken carefully and cooperatively, with the assistance of cutting-edge science. Limits to economic growth, or even ""degrowth"", the report says, do not need to imply an end to prosperity, but rather require a conscious decision by societies to lower their environmental impacts, reduce wasteful consumption, and increase efficiency – changes which could in fact increase quality of life while lowering inequality. These findings of the new Club of Rome report have been confirmed by other major research projects. In January last year, a detailed scientific study by Anglia Ruskin University's Global Sustainability Institute commissioned by the Institute and Faculty of Actuaries, found ""overwhelming"" evidence for resource constraints:  ""... across a range of resources over the short (years) and medium (decades) term… Resource constraints will, at best, increase energy and commodity prices over the next century and, at worse, trigger a long term decline in the global economy and civil unrest.""  The good news, though is that ""If governments and economic agents anticipate resource constraints and act in a constructive manner, many of the worst affects can be avoided."" According to Dr Aled Jones, lead author of the study and head of the Global Sustainability Institute:  ""Resource constraints will, at best, steadily increase energy and commodity prices over the next century and, at worst, could represent financial disaster, with the assets of pension schemes effectively wiped out and pensions reduced to negligible levels.""  It is imperative to recognise that ""dwindling resources raise the possibility of a limit to economic growth in the medium term."" In his 2014 report to the Club of Rome, Prof Bardi takes a long-term view of the prospects for humanity, noting that the many technological achievements of industrial societies mean there is still a chance now to ensure the survival and prosperity of a future post-industrial civilization: ""It is not easy to imagine the details of the society that will emerge on an Earth stripped of its mineral ores but still maintaining a high technological level. We can say, however, that most of the crucial technologies for our society can function without rare minerals or with very small amounts of them, although with modifications and at lower efficiency."" Although expensive and environmentally intrusive industrial structures ""like highways and plane travel"" would become obsolete, technologies like ""the Internet, computers, robotics, long-range communications, public transportation, comfortable homes, food security, and more"" could remain attainable with the right approach - even if societies undergo disastrous crises in the short-run. Bardi is surprisingly matter-of-fact about the import of his study. ""I am not a doomster,"" he told me. ""Unfortunately, depletion is a fact of life, not unlike death and taxes. We cannot ignore depletion - just like it is not a good idea to ignore death and taxes…  ""If we insist in investing most of what remains for fossil fuels; then we are truly doomed. Yet I think that we still have time to manage the transition. To counter depletion, we must invest a substantial amount of the remaining resources in renewable energy and efficient recycling technologies - things which are not subjected to depletion. And we need to do that before is too late, that is before the energy return on investment of fossil fuels has declined so much that we have nothing left to invest.""

"Barack Obama  (interview with Thomas Friedman 2014, published in the New York Times): “The science is compelling ... If you profess leadership in this country at this moment in our history then you have to recognise that this is going to be one of the most significant long-term challenges, if not the most significant long-term challenge, that this country faces and the planet faces. The good news is that the public may get out ahead of some of these politicians, and I think that as the public starts seeing greater frequency of extreme weather events, as they start seeing what used to be 100-year storms happening every year or two and you start seeing the economics of inaction, then the public start thinking: “You know what? We are going to start rewarding politicians who start talking ... honestly about this problem.”  Tony Abbott in New York on Tuesday: “Climate change is a significant global issue; it is a very significant global issue. Is it the most important issue the world faces right now? I don’t believe so. It is one of a number of significant issues that the world faces and we will do our bit. We will be a good international citizen. What we are not going to do is clobber our economy and cost jobs with things like a job-killing carbon tax.” Abbott (Speech to minerals industry dinner 28 May, 2014): “It’s particularly important that we do not demonise the coal industry and if there was one fundamental problem, above all else, with the carbon tax was that it said to our people, it said to the wider world, that a commodity which in many years is our biggest single export, somehow should be left in the ground and not sold. Well really and truly, I can think of few things more damaging to our future.” Obama (in the Friedman interview): “Science is science … And there is no doubt that if we burnt all the fossil fuel that’s in the ground right now that the planet’s going to get too hot and the consequences could be dire.” Friedman: ""So we can’t burn it all?"" Obama: “We’re not going to be able to burn it all. Over the course of the next several decades, we’re going to have to build a ramp from how we currently use energy to where we need to use energy. And we’re not going to suddenly turn off a switch and suddenly we’re no longer using fossil fuels, but we have to use this time wisely, so that you have a tapering off of fossil fuels replaced by clean energy sources that are not releasing carbon ... But I very much believe in keeping that 2 [degree] celsius target as a goal.” Abbott, October 2013: “Climate change is real, as I've often said, and we should take strong action against it … But these fires are certainly not a function of climate change. They're just a function of life in Australia.” Asked about comments by the executive secretary of the UN framework convention on climate change, Christiana Figueres, that the fires proved the world is “already paying the price of carbon”, Abbott said: “The official in question is talking through her hat.” Obama, speech at Georgetown University 25 June, 2013: “Now, we know that no single weather event is caused solely by climate change. Droughts and fires and floods, they go back to ancient times. But we also know that in a world that’s warmer than it used to be, all weather events are affected by a warming planet. The fact that sea level in New York, in New York harbour, are now a foot higher than a century ago – that didn’t cause hurricane Sandy, but it certainly contributed to the destruction that left large parts of our mightiest city dark and underwater … “And we know that the costs of these events can be measured in lost lives and lost livelihoods, lost homes, lost businesses, hundreds of billions of dollars in emergency services and disaster relief. In fact, those who are already feeling the effects of climate change don’t have time to deny it – they’re busy dealing with it. Firefighters are braving longer wildfire seasons, and states and federal governments have to figure out how to budget for that. I had to sit on a meeting with the Department of Interior and Agriculture and some of the rest of my team just to figure out how we're going to pay for more and more expensive fire seasons.” Abbott, July 2013: “This is not a true market. Just ask yourself what an emissions trading scheme is all about,” he told reporters. “It's a market, a so-called market, in the non-delivery of an invisible substance to no one.” Liberal policy document 2013: “This toxic, job-destroying tax punishes successful and hard-working Australian businesses, particularly trade-exposed businesses.” Obama, Friedman interview: “So if there’s one thing I would like to see, it’d be for us to be able to price the cost of carbon emissions … We’ve obviously seen resistance from the Republican side of the aisle on that. And, out of fairness, there’s some Democrats who’ve been concerned about it as well, because regionally they’re very reliant on heavy industry and old-power plants … I still believe, though, that the more we can show the price of inaction – that billions and potentially trillions of dollars are going to be lost because we do not do something about it – ultimately leads us to be able to say, ‘Let’s go ahead and help the marketplace discourage this kind of activity.’ “ Obama, Georgetown speech, 25 June, 2013: “Nearly a dozen states have already implemented or are implementing their own market-based programs to reduce carbon pollution ... So the idea of setting higher pollution standards for our power plants is not new. It’s just time for Washington to catch up with the rest of the country. And that's what we intend to do … Now, what you’ll hear from the special interests and their allies in Congress is that this will kill jobs and crush the economy, and basically end American free enterprise as we know it. And the reason I know you'll hear those things is because that's what they said every time America sets clear rules and better standards for our air and our water and our children’s health. And every time, they've been wrong.”"
