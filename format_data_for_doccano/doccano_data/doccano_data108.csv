"Last week, authorities in Sweden took an unusual step. They issued an appeal for international aid to help them tackle an epidemic of wildfires that has spread across the nation over the past few days. After months without rain, followed by weeks of soaring temperatures, the nation’s forests had become tinderboxes.  The result was inevitable. Wildfires broke out and, by the end of last week, more than 50 forest blazes – a dozen inside the Arctic circle – had spread across Sweden. A nation famous for its cold and snow found itself unable to cope with the conflagrations taking place within its border and so made its appeal for international help, a request that has already been answered by Norway and Italy who have both sent airborne firefighting teams to help battle Sweden’s blazes. Nor is the nation’s fiery fate particularly unusual at present. Across much of the northern hemisphere, intense and prolonged heatwaves have triggered disruption and devastation as North America, the Arctic, northern Europe and Africa have sweltered in record-breaking temperatures. In Africa, a weather station at Ouargla, Algeria, in the Sahara desert, recorded a temperature of 51.3C, the highest reliable temperature ever recorded in Africa. In Japan, where temperatures have reached more than 40C, people were last week urged to take precautions after the death toll reached 30 with thousands more having sought hospital treatment for heat-related conditions. And in California increased use of air conditioning units, switched on to counter the scorching conditions there, has led to power shortages. But perhaps the strangest impact of the intense heat has been felt in Canada. It too has been gripped by ferocious heat, with Toronto recording temperatures that have exceeded 30C on 18 days so far this year. This figure compares with only nine such days all last summer. Dozens have died in the withering heat – with startling and grim consequences. Montreal’s morgue has been swamped with the bodies of those who have died because of the heat, and many corpses have had to be stored elsewhere in the city. Montreal coroner Jean Brochu said it was first time the city’s morgue had been overwhelmed this way. Britain’s scorching weather – which has melted the roof of Glasgow’s Science Centre and parched the lawns of the nation’s historic homes – may have made regular UK headlines. However, it has been relatively mild in impact compared to those experienced in many other parts of the world. Far from being a parochial problem, the current heatwave is clearly an issue that affects vast stretches of our planet: a global concern not a local one. But why is so much of our world currently being afflicted with blisteringly hot weather? What is driving the wildfires, the soaring temperatures and those melting rooftops? These are tricky questions to answer, such is the complex nature of the planet’s weather systems. Most scientists point to a number of factors with global warming being the most obvious candidate. Others warn that it would be wrong to overstate its role in the current heatwaves, however. “Yes, it is hard not to believe that climate change has to be playing a part in what is going on round the globe at present,” said Dann Mitchell of Bristol University. “There have been some remarkable extremes recorded in the past few weeks, after all. However, we should take care about overstating climate change’s influence for it is equally clear there are also other influences at work.” One of those other factors is the jet stream – a core of strong winds around five to seven miles above the Earth’s surface that blow from west to east and which steer weather around the globe. Sometimes, when they are intense, they bring storms. On other occasions, when they are weak, they bring very calm and settled days. And that is what is occurring at present. “The jet stream we are currently experiencing is extremely weak and, as a result, areas of atmospheric high pressure are lingering for long periods over the same place,” added Mitchell. Other factors involved in creating the meteorological conditions that have brought such heat to the northern hemisphere include substantial changes to sea surface temperatures in the North Atlantic. “These are part of a phenomenon known as the Atlantic multidecadal oscillation,” said Professor Adam Scaife, of the Met Office. “In fact, the situation is very like the one we had in 1976, when we had similar ocean temperatures in the Atlantic and an unchanging jet stream that left great areas of high pressure over many areas for long periods,” said Scaife. “And of course, that year we had one of the driest, sunniest and warmest summers in the UK in the 20th century.” However, there is one crucial difference between 1976 and today, added Professor Tim Osborn, director of research at the Climatic Research Unit, University of East Anglia. “The baseline on which these effects operated is very different today. Since 1976 we have had several decades of global warming – caused by rising carbon emissions – which has raised baseline global temperatures significantly.” As a result, any phenomenon such as the weakening of the jet stream is going to have a more pronounced effect than it did 40 years ago. And as global carbon emissions continue to rise and predictions suggest the world will be unable to hold global temperature rises this century to below 2C above pre-industrial levels, widespread heatwaves are very likely to get worse and become more frequent, scientists warn. Nor is the problem of increasingly severe heatwaves confined to the land. “We have marine heatwaves as well – all over the globe,” said Michael Burrows, of the Scottish Marine Institute, Oban. “For example, there was a major marine heatwave that struck the coast of Australia last year. It devastated vast swathes of the Great Barrier Reef. More to the point, marine heatwaves are also becoming more and more frequent and intense, like those on land, and that is something else that we should be very worried about.” Additional reporting: Ashifa Kassam, Toronto"
"In March this year I started to care about the planet. Like, in a big way. Before that, I fretted about it and treated it like an extremely beautiful but very sick creature I was afraid to get too attached to. If you want to know how my change of heart started, I’ll tell you the same thing I told the poor old Texan man sitting beside me on a flight out of JFK. “I’m going for a chemistry test with the first woman president of Ireland so I could potentially be her co-host for this climate justice podcast she’s about to make.” He stayed quiet after that. The following morning, jet-lagged and disoriented on a winding London street, I couldn’t find the restaurant where I was supposed to meet Mary Robinson. When I eventually did find it, I couldn’t find the door, so her first impression of me was of a tardy wild-eyed woman knocking on a window mouthing “so sorry” and “just an omelette please”. My first impression of her was way back when I was eight years old, and she became the president of Ireland. Back then, she came across as powerful and good and clever, certainly not someone to mess with. Those were the instincts of a child and three decades later I’m glad to have been proven correct. After the Irish presidency Mary Robinson became the UN high commissioner for human rights, and it was during this time she began to see the link between climate change and human rights. She focused in on this and 15 years ago set up the Mary Robinson Foundation for Climate Justice. Climate justice means a people-centered solution to climate change. It pushes for restorative justice and recognizes the integrity of the planet and every creature on it. And I’ve come to understand that climate justice is a way out of the capitalist and paternalist way of living that’s gotten us into this climate change mess in the first place. I’m a comedian and a podcaster, as I explained to the Texan on the airplane who was now pretending to be asleep. My job as co-host, should I get it, would be to help navigate the world of podcasting and, I whispered as I patted his hand, I’d add in my own sense of curiosity and hopefully some levity too.  The following morning, after hurriedly eating my omelette, we headed to a studio where we had some classic podcast banter, which went as follows: Me: “On you and your husband’s first date, who paid for dinner?” Mary, narrowing her eyes: “This is a little frivolous. Shall we begin the divestment discussion?”  That’s how it started; that’s how I learned more about climate justice in the past six months than in the whole rest of my life. I count myself lucky, because climate justice is fascinating, uplifting, and intersectional in a way that’s still too large for me to comprehend but could change the course of the world.  Over the course of five months, Mary and I spoke to and heard from amazing women all over the world. There are scientists in Africa, farmers in Asia, politicians in Brussels, and indigenous community leaders in America, all working to solve climate problems every single day. People I didn’t realize were helping turn out to be the heroes of this story – like lawyers and children and midwives. People like Tara Houska, an attorney who advocates on behalf of tribal nations at the local and federal levels, who spent six months on the frontlines in North Dakota fighting the Dakota Access pipeline.  She is also heavily engaged in the movement to defund fossil fuels, and she travels the world challenging major banks and institutions about this. I got so fired up after listening to that I called my bank to see what they were doing with my savings: $3,200 at the time (less now that I had to buy a new sofa). Turns out I needed to move it (my money, not my sofa) because Chase Bank is … not a good choice if you care about divestment from fossil fuels. Two youngsters stick in my mind, Victoria Barrett and Ridhima Pandey. They are just a couple out of dozens of kids worldwide using the law to force their governments to take climate change more seriously. Victoria is a 19-year-old New Yorker. Her school was flooded by Superstorm Sandy and she’s a plaintiff in a groundbreaking constitutional climate lawsuit against the US government, arguing the administration’s climate-changing actions violate young people’s constitutional rights to life, liberty and property. The trial starts in October. Ridhima, from Uttarakhand, India, filed a petition against her government in 2017 when she was just nine years old. She argued that the Indian government had failed to fulfill its duties to her and the Indian people to protect them from climate impacts – a hearing on the case is expected soon. When I was nine, all I wanted was one of those pens with lots of different colors to click between.  While all of us have contributed to climate change to some extent, its results are not gender neutral I also learned that while all of us have contributed to climate change to some extent, its results are not gender neutral. It affects women first and worst: women are more likely to die in a climate disaster, and day to day they are the ones cooking on solid fuel stoves that can ultimately poison them. Climate justice offers a feminist solution, one that sees women as equally valuable as men. I learned too that the countries that do the worst damage to the planet don’t actually feel its effects, at least not fully and not yet.  Which brings me to what I unlearned. I’m sorry to say that in the past I’ve seen people in countries and communities hit worst by climate change as unfortunate victims, and failed to see that precisely because of this suffering, they are often the ones leading the fight against it. Climate justice heroes come from Bangladesh, Rwanda and Puerto Rico, to name a few, and also from indigenous communities worldwide. It took repeated conversations and actual listening on my part to break down my colonial mindset, my internalized “the west knows best” attitude, one I wasn’t aware I had.  Within the US, people of color and poor people breathe dirtier air than whiter, wealthier people. In LA, you’re almost twice as likely to die in a heatwave if you’re black, because of the urban heat island effect and less access to air conditioning and cars than other Angelenos. Isn’t that just disgusting? But again, leadership is coming from within the communities at risk. We had a conversation with Sarra Tekola. She’s a climate justice and Black Lives Matter activist working on a PhD in climate science in Seattle. It was thrilling to sit in a studio and be part of a discussion between Mary, someone accustomed to and comfortable moving through the halls of power, and Sarra, someone who is 40 years younger and usually found protesting outside those very halls.  As you would expect, there was more in common than not, and what I found moving was the women’s shared sense of urgency and fighting spirit, and the unspoken kinship that comes with it. Anyone can be a part of this, you just have to join in. Until now, I’ve felt a pervasive sense of doom that’s kept me stuck when it comes to climate change. But today, there are new elements I’ve learned about that bolster me and give me hope: namely the ethics, the politics and the spiritual dimension in our relationship to the planet and the people who live on it. "
"Marc Morano is the real-world fossil fuel industry version of Nick Naylor. His career began working for Rush Limbaugh, followed by a job at Cybercast News Service where he launched the ‘Swift Boat’ attacks on 2004 Democratic presidential candidate John Kerry. In 2006, Morano became the director of communications for Senator Jim Inhofe (R-OK), who is perhaps best known for throwing a snowball on the Senate floor and calling human-caused global warming “the greatest hoax ever perpetrated on the American people.” Thus it’s unsurprising that in 2009, Morano began directing fossil fuel-funded think tanks designed to cast doubt on the reality of and dangers associated with human-caused global warming. As he admitted in Merchants of Doubt, Morano frequently embodies the strategy of climate denial known as ‘fake experts’:  Most recently, Morano created a short video that centers on three common climate myths and has garnered over 5m views on Facebook.  Morano begins his video by denying the 97% expert consensus on human-caused global warming. Consensus denial is one of the most popular climate myths, and was the subject of the most widely-shared climate story of 2016. Morano’s strategy is to critique two of the studies that found a 97% expert consensus. One, published in 2009 by Peter Doran and Maggie Zimmerman surveyed 3,146 Earth scientists, but fewer than 80 of the participants were actively publishing climate science research (and hence experts on the subject). Basically, the critique is that the study sample size was too small to make a conclusive determination about the level of expert consensus.  That’s a valid point, except this was just one among many such climate consensus studies. In fact, the authors of seven separate consensus studies using a variety of approaches (some with very large sample sizes) teamed up in 2016 to publish a paper concluding that the expert consensus on human-caused global warming is between 90 and 100%. So, this critique is invalid when considering all the available consensus research. Morano also critiques the consensus study that my colleagues and I published in 2013. He does so simply by quoting economist Richard Tol saying our 97% figure “was pulled from thin air.” Tol argued that the methodology in our study was flawed, but when we applied his critiques in a follow-up paper published in 2014, we found that the consensus was still 97 ± 1%.  Moreover, Tol himself has said, “The consensus is of course in the high nineties” and “There is no doubt in my mind that the literature on climate change overwhelmingly supports the hypothesis that climate change is caused by humans. I have very little reason to doubt that the consensus is indeed correct.” In short, Morano’s only evidence to dispute the expert consensus on human-caused global warming is to quote an economist who agrees the consensus is 90–100%, and that the experts are correct that humans are responsible for global warming. Next in the video, Morano claims that we’re not actually in the midst of the hottest period on record, and that ‘hottest year’ claims are “merely political statements” because for example, he claims, scientists can’t say with 100% certainty that 2016 was hotter than 2015 due to the margin of uncertainty in the data. This claim is similar to one made on Fox News that earned a ‘Pants on Fire’ rating from Politifact based on consultation with climate scientists. 2014 through 2017 are indeed the four hottest years on record, outside the range of uncertainty. Morano concludes the video by claiming “the most outrageous myth of all is that carbon dioxide is somehow the control knob of the climate.” Ironically, Nasa climate scientists published a paper in 2010 titled, “Atmospheric CO2: Principal Control Knob Governing Earth’s Temperature.” Morano argues that the experts are wrong because there are hundreds of factors influencing Earth’s climate, and that carbon dioxide “is one of these factors that gets essentially drowned out, and you can’t distinguish its effect from natural variability.” That claim is entirely false, as elegantly illustrated in this graphic created by Bloomberg. Human-caused global warming now far outside the range of natural variability. In fact, we’re now warming global temperatures more than 20 times faster than Earth’s fastest natural climate changes. And of course, climate scientists have observed human fingerprints all over climate change, most recently in the atmosphere. It would be absurd to take Marc Morano’s word over the evidence published in peer-reviewed studies by climate scientists at Nasa and other scientific institutions around the world. Lately, Facebook has struggled mightily in trying to figure out how to combat the epidemic of fake news propagated via its platform. Mark Zuckerberg made headlines last week when he defended fake news from Holocaust deniers, saying he didn’t “think that they’re intentionally getting it wrong.” It’s virtually impossible to discern an individual’s intent, but if that person is spreading misinformation, intent is irrelevant. If Facebook wants to stop misinforming millions of its users, it needs to tackle the problem of fake news regardless of intent. So far, Facebook seems more concerned about the appearance of ‘bias’ than about making sure the content shared on its site is factually correct. Fortunately, the exposure to Morano’s misinformation video is not as bad as it seems at first blush. Although Facebook implies the video has been viewed over 5m times, a “view” is counted after just three seconds, and videos on the site play automatically.  Nevertheless, the video has been shared over 75,000 times, so it has certainly reached a wide audience. Facebook needs to come to terms with the fact that there is an objective reality. Even if Marc Morano sincerely believes humans aren’t causing global warming, that belief is false, and by continuing to host his myth-filled video, Facebook is misinforming tens of thousands, perhaps even millions of its users."

"Environmental campaigners have lost their high court challenge against the government over its policy for tackling climate change. The charity Plan B Earth brought legal action against the government’s stance on the 2050 carbon target, set out under the Climate Change Act 2008.  The charity and 11 UK citizens aged nine to 79 – including the publisher Dame Carmen Callil – wanted to bring a judicial review against the business secretary, Greg Clark. But Mr Justice Supperstone rejected Plan B Earth’s case on Friday, saying it was “unarguable”. Lawyers for the charity previously argued the government should have, in light of the current scientific consensus, gone further than its original target of reducing carbon levels by 2050 to 80% of that present in 1990. They said the decision not to amend the 2050 target put the UK in breach of its international obligations under the Paris agreement on climate change and was influenced by the government’s belief that a “more ambitious target was not feasible”. At a hearing on 4 July, Jonathan Crow QC told the court: “The secretary of state’s belief that he needs to have regard to what is feasible, rather than what is necessary, betrays a fundamental misunderstanding of the scheme of the 2008 act and must be quashed. “All of the individual claimants are deeply concerned about climate change.” The barrister argued the business secretary’s “continuing refusal” to amend the 2050 target means the UK is playing “Russian roulette with two bullets, instead of one”. But, refusing permission for a full hearing, Mr Justice Supperstone said Plan B Earth’s arguments were based on an “incorrect interpretation” of the Paris agreement. He said: “In my view the secretary of state was plainly entitled ... to refuse to change the 2050 target at the present time. “I do not consider it arguable that the secretary of state’s refusal to amend the 2050 target is an unlawful exercise of his discretion.” Tim Crosland, director of Plan B Earth, said the charity was “surprised and disappointed” by the ruling and plans to appeal. He said: “We consider it clear and widely accepted that the current carbon target is not compatible with the Paris agreement. “Neither the government nor the committee on climate change suggested during our correspondence with them prior to the claim that the target was compatible. “Indeed, it was only in January of this year that the committee published a report accepting that the Paris agreement was ‘likely to require’ a more ambitious 2050 target. “Moreover the government acknowledged in these proceedings that it was uncontroversial that the 2050 target was insufficient to meet the 1.5C target, one of the key aspects of the Paris commitment. “In these circumstances, Plan B and the other 11 claimants continue to consider that a full hearing on an issue of such urgent and vital importance is necessary. “As with other legal campaigns confronting powerful vested interests it takes time to break through, and time is not on our side. “We’ll be doing everything possible to accelerate the process. Wildfires raging in the Arctic Circle must surely be a wake-up call.” "
"I don’t know anybody who remembers 10 August 2003 and its significance, although the date has never faded from my mind. That was Britain’s hottest ever day, the day the current British air temperature record was set: it leapt from the old record of 37.1C, set on 3 August 1990, to the new figure of 38.5C.  Those bare numbers may not mean much to you, though they may well appear more meaningful if you convert them to fahrenheit. For the old record was 98.8F,but the new one was 101.3F, and that meant that the 100F barrier had been broken in Britain for the first time ever. It seemed to me then, as it does now, that this was a hugely symbolic crossing of an environmental threshold; yet the population instantly forgot all about it. The current heatwave bids fair to be the longest period of sustained hot weather since the fabled summer of 1976. But will it actually be the hottest? Might we actually see a new British record air temperature? Local records are already being broken and there was a brief flurry of excitement 10 days ago when it appeared that the Scottish national record had been smashed with a temperature of 33.2C (91.7F) recorded in Motherwell, but now the Met Office has rejected the claim because a vehicle with its engine running was too close to the thermometer. It seems a new British record is certainly possible this summer that, if achieved, would give considerable force to the suggestion that the very high temperatures that have been in evidence all over the northern hemisphere this summer are at least partly the product of global warming, rather than just natural variation. For anyone interested in following and watching out for this, I have a suggestion: keep your eye on the fahrenheit as well as the celsius measurement it will mean more. I say this as a baby boomer who grew up with F rather than C; it was not until 1962 that the Met Office adopted celsius, and in my early childhood I acquired the instinctive feel that everybody then had (and people still have in the US), which told you that, in fahrenheit terms, 60 was pleasantly warm, and 70 was really lovely weather, and 80 was seriously hot, while 90 represented the sort of heatwave that was a major event. Anything approaching 90 would result in front-page headlines in the Daily Express proclaiming: “88 … 89 … 90! Phew! What a scorcher!” That was the point about the 100 figure. It was off the map. It had never been recorded in meteorological history, in the daily temperature records that go back to 1772. But it had no place in cultural history either. There was no reference point for it: no stories, no memories, no jokes, no newspaper headlines. In our native land of showers and cool summers, 100 degrees fahrenheit represented an unknown country. The round number certainly helped. In celsius terms, 100F is 37.8C, and of course 37.8C as such isn’t any sort of figure the mind will register, any sort of boldly marked frontier whose breaching will seem significant. But once you represent it in fahrenheit, the move up from two digits to three has a symbolical significance of real power. That’s what I thought, anyway, in the years I spent writing about climate change and being something of a temperature nerd, waiting for the 100 mark to be hit, for “the ton to be up”. When the 100F threshold is broken, I thought, everyone will see at once that we are in new territory in terms of climate; everyone will perceive the reality of global warming, in an instinctive way. And in August 2003 the day finally came, and I remember vividly how hot it was; and the day went; and people carried on with their business just as before, and have forgotten it completely. Yet my own view is that we did indeed enter new territory that day; and if we have waited 15 years to get back there (and maybe we will wait still longer), it merely illustrates what we know, that climate change proceeds in a non-linear way, in irregular jumps rather than a smooth ascent. But watch out for it, this sweltering summer (probably in the first week of August); watch out for it on the old-fashioned fahrenheit scale as well as on the modern celsius. And if you see that the ton is up, and 100F is exceeded, be assured that even if a new outright temperature record is not set, the world is changing in the profoundest of ways. • Michael McCarthy is the author of The Moth Snowstorm: Nature and Joy"

"Hundreds of glaciers in Canada’s high Arctic are shrinking and many are at risk of disappearing completely, an unprecedented inventory of glaciers in the country’s northernmost island has revealed.  Using satellite imagery, researchers catalogued more than 1,700 glaciers in northern Ellesmere Island and traced how they had changed between 1999 and 2015.   The results offered a glimpse into how warming temperatures may be affecting ice in the region, from glaciers that sprawl across the land to the 200-metre thick ice shelves, said Adrienne White, a glaciologist at the University of Ottawa. “It’s an area that’s very difficult to study,” said White. “Logistically it’s very hard to get to and even with satellite imagery – for the longest time Google Earth didn’t even have complete imagery – it was kind of the forgotten place.”  White’s study, published last month in the Journal of Glaciology, found that the glaciers had shrank by more than 1,700 sq km of over a 16-year period, representing a loss of about 6%.  A previous study of glaciers in the region – which used air photos and did not include ice shelves – showed a loss of 927 sq km between 1959 and 2000, hinting that the pace of loss may be increasing. Of the 1,773 glaciers tracked by White, 1,353 were found to have shrunk significantly. A handful had disappeared altogether: “What we found is a loss of three complete ice shelves,” she said. “In terms of glaciers that terminate on land, we’ve lost three small ice caps.”  None of the glaciers in the study showed any signs of growing.  The findings echo the changes White has observed during her years of visiting the island. “We see a lot more icebergs,” said White. “Where there was one continuous ice shelf, we now see individual icebergs broken up, we see a lot more crevasses.”  She attributed the findings to an increase in temperatures. Canada’s Arctic – one of the world’s most glaciated regions – is warming at one of the fastest rates of anywhere on Earth.  In northern Ellesmere Island, the annual average temperature in the region increased by 3.6C between 1948 and 2016.  In particular, “there seemed to be a shift in the mid-90s,” she said, describing it as a “sudden increase in warming,” that saw temperatures increase at about 0.78C per decade between 1995 and 2016. “These increases were greatest in autumn and winter,” she said. “So what you end up with is a lot more melt.”  While the most direct impact is rising sea levels, the melting ice also risks wiping out the region’s unique ecosystems, such as the freshwater lakes that form when the water flowing off a glacier is trapped by a floating ice shelf.  “When these glaciers break away, all of a sudden there’s nothing holding back these ecosystems that have been growing and developing for thousands of years,” said White. “And they’re gone before we even have the chance to study them.”  Extrapolating from research done on glaciers from a neighbouring island, White’s study suggested that many of the glaciers on northern Ellesmere Island may not be high enough to accumulate enough snow to counter the pace at which they are melting. “Without growth, that glacier is just in a state of loss,” she said. “It will disappear if climates don’t change.” "
"The Republic of Ireland will become the world’s first country to sell off its investments in fossil fuel companies, after a bill was passed with all-party support in the lower house of parliament. The state’s €8bn national investment fund will be required to sell all investments in coal, oil, gas and peat “as soon as is practicable”, which is expected to mean within five years. Norway’s huge $1tn sovereign wealth fund has only partially divested from fossil fuels, targeting some coal companies, and is still considering its oil and gas holdings.  The fossil fuel divestment movement has grown rapidly and trillions of dollars of investment funds have been divested, including large pension funds and insurers, cities such as New York, churches and universities.  Supporters of divestment say existing fossil fuel resources are already far greater than can be burned without causing catastrophic climate change and that exploring and producing more fossil fuels is therefore morally wrong and economically risky. However, some critics argue say that remaining as shareholders and persuading fossil fuel companies to change can be more effective.  The Irish fossil fuel divestment bill was passed in the lower house of parliament on Thursday and it is expected to pass rapidly through the upper house, meaning it could become law before the end of the year. The Irish state investment fund holds more than €300m in fossil fuel investments in 150 companies. “The [divestment] movement is highlighting the need to stop investing in the expansion of a global industry which must be brought into managed decline if catastrophic climate change is to be averted,” said Thomas Pringle, the independent member of parliament who introduced the bill. “Ireland by divesting is sending a clear message that the Irish public and the international community are ready to think and act beyond narrow short term vested interests.” Éamonn Meehan, executive director of international development charity Trócaire, said: “Today the Oireachtas [Irish parliament] has sent a powerful signal to the international community about the need to speed up the phase-out of fossil fuels.” Meehan said: “Just last month Ireland was ranked the second worst European country for climate action, so the passing of this bill is good news. But it has to mark a significant change of pace on the issue.” The bill defines a fossil fuel company as a company that derives 20% or more of its revenue from exploration, extraction or refinement of fossil fuels. The bill also allows investment in Irish fossil fuel companies if this funds their move away from fossil fuels. Gerry Liston at Global Legal Action Network, who drafted the bill, said: “Governments will not meet their obligations under the Paris agreement on climate change if they continue to financially sustain the fossil fuel industry. Countries the world over must now urgently follow Ireland’s lead and divest from fossil fuels.”"
"The warm temperatures that have scorched much of the US appear to be influencing Americans’ acceptance of climate science, with a new poll finding a record level of public confidence that the world is warming due to human activity. A long-running survey of American attitudes to climate change has found that 73% of people now think there is solid evidence of global warming. A further 60% believe that this warming is due, at least in some part, to human influences. Both of these findings are record highs in a twice-yearly survey that has been conducted by the University of Michigan and Muhlenberg College since 2008. The latest poll was conducted during May, which was hotter than any May recorded in the contiguous US in 124 years of record keeping, according to the National Ocean and Atmospheric Administration, eclipsing the 1930s during the Dust Bowl era.  “There’s lots of evidence that contemporary weather is a contributing factor to belief in climate change,” said Chris Borick, director of the Muhlenberg College Institute of Public Opinion. “But there are other factors. People are telling us they are experiencing a climate that isn’t what they remember in the past and the evidence itself, such as declining polar ice, is having an effect. Americans are moving to a lot more confident space on this.” But there remains a yawning ideological divide when it comes to climate change in the US. The survey found that while 90% of Democrats accept there is solid evidence of climate change, only 50% of Republicans feel the same.  However, Borick said that messaging from those who deny or obfuscate climate science has shifted away from outright rejection of temperature data. While Donald Trump has previously called climate change “bullshit” and a Chinese-inspired hoax, he has rarely spoken of the issue while president apart from framing action to address it as economically costly.  “The talking points have turned more to the cost to mitigate climate change rather than deny its existence,” Borick said. “That said, if you want one factor that influences your view on climate change, it’s party affiliation. Age, race and gender don’t even come close.” The hot temperatures have persisted in much of the country since the May survey, with Los Angeles hitting a monthly overnight record of 79F (26.1C) on 7 July. Chino, near Los Angeles, saw a record temperature of 120F (48.9C), while Death Valley in California reached 125.6F (52C) on 8 July. About 80 million Americans have been placed under heat warnings in recent weeks, with cities such as Denver, Colorado and Cheyenne, Wyoming, both experiencing record temperatures.  The heat has been fierce on the US east coast and Canada, too. About 70 deaths have been blamed upon a punishing heatwave experienced in and around Montreal, with further deaths recorded in New York and Pennsylvania due to the high temperatures. A string of warm days in New York City helped trigger a return to smog-like conditions on 2 July, when the temperature in the city reached 95F (35C). Researchers who flew a light aircraft taking measurements over a hazy New York were astonished to find that the ozone concentration was 150 parts per billion. This far exceeds the Environmental Protection Agency’s eight-hour average ozone health standard of 70 parts per billion. The high ozone readings have continued, with preliminary data for Tuesday showing 85 parts per billion in New York. Ground-level ozone is created when pollutants react to intense sunlight, potentially causing haze or smog. This can cause serious health problems and even death for people who are elderly, sick or who have respiratory conditions. “This is a disturbingly high level, we were very surprised at the results,” said Russell Dickerson, a professor at the University of Maryland’s department of atmospheric and oceanic science. “The sky was very gray. It reminded me of Beijing. It was like what New York used to be like, before it cleaned itself up.” Overall air quality in the US has improved markedly in recent decades following the introduction of federal clean air rules. Ozone levels have remained stubbornly high in New York, however. “We are trying to work out why this is but the recent high level could well be because of the hot, stagnant weather, with weak winds,” Dickerson said. “It’s a public health concern. I’d certainly advise people to stay indoors during the hottest part of the day.”"

"Ocean waters are rising because of global warming. They are rising for two reasons. First, and perhaps most obvious, ice is melting. There is a tremendous amount of ice locked away in Greenland, Antarctica, and in glaciers. As the world warms, that ice melts and the liquid water flows to the oceans.  The other reason why water is rising is that warmer water is less dense – it expands. This expansion causes the surface of the water to rise.  Rising oceans are a big deal. About 150 million people live within 1 meter (3 feet) of sea level. About 600 million live within 10 meters (33 feet) of sea level. As waters rise, these people will have to go somewhere. It is inevitable that climate refugees will have to move their homes and workplaces because of rising waters.  In some places, humans will be able to build sea walls to block off the water’s rise. But, in many places, that won’t be possible. For instance, Miami, Florida has a porous base rock that allows sea water to permeate through the soils. You cannot wall that off. In other places, any sea walls would be prohibitively expensive.  It isn’t just the inevitable march of sea level that is an issue. Rising waters make storm surges worse. A great example is Superstorm Sandy, which hit the US East Coast in 2012. It cost approximately $65 bn of damage. The cost was higher because of sea level rise caused by global warming. Climate scientists do their best to project how much and how fast oceans will rise in the future. These projections help city planners prepare future infrastructure. My estimation is that oceans will be approximately 1 meter higher in the year 2100; that is what our infrastructure should be prepared for. What I don’t know is how much this will cost us as a society. A very recent paper was published that looked into this issue. The authors analyzed the cost of sea level if we limit the Earth to 1.5°C or 2°C warming. They also considered the future cost using “business as usual” scenarios.  What the authors found was fascinating. If humans take action to limit warming to 1.5°C, they estimate sea level will rise 52 cm by the year 2100. If humans hold global warming to 2°C, sea levels will rise by perhaps 63 cm by 2100. The difference (11 cm) could cost $1.4 tn per year if no other societal adaptation is made. This is a staggering number and in itself, should motivate us to take action. But the authors went further, they considered an even higher future temperature scenario (one that is essentially business as usual). With that future, global annual flood costs would increase to a whopping $14 tn per year.  In the study, the authors considered which countries and regions would suffer most. It turns out upper middle income countries will be worse off, particularly China. Higher-income countries have a slightly better prognosis because of their present flood protection standards. But make no mistake about it, we will all suffer and the suffering will be very costly.  There are four important takeaways from this study. First, while the economic costs are large, there is some range of projections. The actual costs may be lower or higher than the median predicted in the study. This is largely due to the fact that we don’t know how fast Greenland and Antarctica will melt. If they melt faster than projected, things will be worse than what I’ve described here. Second, adaptation will help. By adaptation I mean making our societies less susceptible to sea level rise. For example, building sea walls when possible, building new infrastructure away from coasts, putting in natural breaks to limit storm surge during large storms, and making infrastructure more water-resistant. Third, what we do now matters. If we can get off the high-emissions business as usual scenarios – if we can increase investment in clean and renewable energy – we can reduce the future costs. Finally, while scientists often use 2100 as a benchmark year, it isn’t like oceans will stop rising then. In fact, we are committing ourselves to hundreds of years of rising oceans. The ocean has a lot of climate inertia. Once it starts rising, you cannot stop it. So, by focusing only on the year 2100, we are deluding ourselves into underestimating the long term costs.  This research shows it’s important to connect climate science with economic science. Too often, social scientists and economists with very little climate science understanding have tried to tell us that climate change is not a problem. Whenever you hear an economist or a social scientist give you a rosy future prediction, take it with a grain of salt. Their opinion is worthless without being backed by physical understanding. And the loudest economists and social scientists often have very little of this physical understanding."
"The water company ordering a hosepipe ban on 7m households in the north-west of England has the second-worst record for leaking pipes of any supplier, industry data shows. The temporary use ban being imposed by United Utilities from 5 August has led to calls for water firms to do more to tackle leakage on their networks. United Utilities is second only to Thames Water for the amount of water lost en route to households, at 133 litres per property per day, well above the sector’s average of 121 litres. The amount of water wasted through leaking pipes is almost identical to regional average daily use, which stands at 132 litres per customer. The company is also the industry’s third-worst performer on the other main measurement, cubic metres of water leaked per kilometre per day. Tony Juniper, the executive director for advocacy and campaigns at WWF-UK, said: “In the short-term one would hope the water companies, all of them, would be putting more effort into leakage reduction, the promotion of water efficient appliances from dishwashers to showers, and about communicating to consumers.” He added the hosepipe ban was “another reminder that on climate change we’ve entered the era of consequences”. United Utilities said it took water wastage seriously, and had 160 inspectors looking for leaks, as well as sniffer dogs and satellites. “Reducing leaks is a top priority. We have cut leakage by half since the 1990s and are working hard to do even more,” a spokesperson said. The company met its leakage targets for 2016-17. Around 2,900m litres a day, or 20% of all public water supply, is lost through leaks on suppliers’ networks. The government was recently told by its infrastructure advisers to set a target for firms to halve leakage by 2050. The National Infrastructure Commission pointed out that reductions had largely stalled over the past decade and households needed to be encouraged to conserve more. The average use per person nationally is 141 litres per day, down from 150 litres in 2000, but still well behind Europe’s best-performers, the Belgians and the Danes, who use about 115 litres per day. One of United Utilities’ customers, the fracking firm Cuadrilla, has said residents would not be left short at its Lancashire operations, at a site between Blackpool and Preston.  The water industry has warned shale firms they could face a shortage of water supplies in some areas. Cuadrilla said that fracking the two wells at Preston New Road, which is now expected to take place in late August or early September, would use up to 32,500 litres of water. A company spokesperson said: “It is highly unlikely that our operations would be affected by a water shortage, however estimates of predicted water demands have been supplied to United Utilities to allow them to assess their existing systems and any impacts on their wider network.” Reservoir levels in the north-west fell 10-15% in June. The region has been more seriously affected by the warm, dry weather than other parts of the country, which were cushioned by a wet spring."
"The UK is “woefully unprepared” for deadly heatwaves, according to a cross-party committee of MPs, with the government ignoring warnings from its official climate change adviser. One in five homes dangerously overheats during heatwaves today, the MPs found, while on the hottest day of 2016 alone there were almost 400 heat-related deaths. But climate change has doubled the risk of heatwaves and events even worse than the heat currently baking the nation could occur every other year by the 2040s, the MPs report said, with a tripling of heat deaths to 7,000 a year as a result. Buildings, particularly hospitals and care homes, must be prepared for heatwaves, the MPs said, with sick and elderly people especially vulnerable to heart and breathing problems. But currently the NHS is only required to prepare plans for severe cold weather and there are no building regulations to prevent overheating with ventilation and shading.  The MPs also called for other measures, including formal guidance from Public Health England to relax office dress codes and allow home working during heatwaves, and to head teachers about relaxing school uniform policy. The MPs said a public information campaign on the serious dangers of heatwaves was needed and health minister Steve Brine, giving evidence to the MPs in June, acknowledged this: “Heat alerts tend to be seen as barbecue alerts, as opposed to there being a risk.” Mary Creagh MP, chair of the environmental audit committee, said: “The government has sat on its hands, ignored the warnings of the Committee on Climate Change (CCC) and left the UK woefully unprepared.” As far back as 2003, a severe heatwave saw temperatures reach 38.5C and more than 2,000 heat-related deaths in 10 days, she said: “But the government has continued to allow homes, hospitals and schools to be built that are not resilient to heatwaves.” Kathryn Brown, head of adaptation at the CCC said: “We have recommended to government every year since 2014 that a new standard or regulation is needed to address the risk from overheating in new homes.” Ministers have rejected the advice, citing a commitment to “reduce net regulation on homebuilders”. The government published its updated National Adaptation Strategy on 19 July but Brown said it made no commitment to deal with the issue. “Action is needed now to redouble efforts to tackle overheating – one of the key risks facing the UK from climate change.” Heatwaves are known killers in the UK and the number of hot days is rising. “It is likely that more than 1,000 people have died in the UK as a result of the extended heatwave conditions this summer,” said Bob Ward, policy director at the Grantham Research Institute on Climate Change at the London School of Economics. “There would justifiably be an outcry if more than 1,000 people had died in a flood.”  “The government’s apparent lack of concern about the growing risks of deadly heatwaves is absolutely woeful,” he said. “The lack of communication by government departments and agencies about the risks of heatwaves is contributing to the death toll every year.” The EAC report found that homes in densely populated urban areas, which can be 10C hotter than the countryside, are already at significant risk of overheating, as are certain other buildings, including houses built in the 1960s and 1970s. “The current lack of regulation to prevent overheating, means that new developments, including hospitals and care homes, which will be around for the next 70 years will add to the number of buildings that overheat,” it said. Excess deaths in nursing homes increased more than 40% in some parts of the UK during the 2003 heatwave, the MPs reported, but the homes are still not required to report their readiness to cope under NHS emergency preparedness rules. Heatwaves are also economically costly, the EAC reported, particularly due to lost working days as a result of transport problems. “Only 50% of the UK’s motorways and major roads are surfaced with material that is the most resilient to the kind of summer temperatures the UK is beginning to experience regularly,” the MPs said, while in June, railway tracks buckled in the heat and caused significant delays. Research cited in the report found that in 2010, 5m staff days were lost due to overheating above 26C, resulting in an economic loss of about £770m. The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs did not respond to a request for comment."
"Farmers across northern and central Europe are facing crop failure and bankruptcy as one of the most intense regional droughts in recent memory strengthens its grip. States of emergency have been declared in Latvia and Lithuania, while the sun continues to bake Swedish fields that have received only 12% of their normal rainfall.   The abnormally hot temperatures – which have topped 30C in the Arctic Circle – are in line with climate change trends, according to the World Meteorological Organization. And as about 50 wildfires rage across Sweden, no respite from the heatwave is yet in sight. Lennart Nilsson, a 55-year-old cattle farmer from Falkenberg near Malmo and co-chair of the Swedish Farmers Association, said it was the worst drought he had experienced.  “This is really serious,” he said. “Most of south-west Sweden hasn’t had rain since the first days of May. A very early harvest has started but yields seem to be the lowest for 25 years – 50% lower, or more in some cases – and it is causing severe losses.”  If no rain comes soon, Nilsson’s association estimates agricultural losses of up to 8bn Swedish kronor (£700m) this year and widespread bankruptcies. The drought would personally cost him around 500,000 kronor (£43,000), Nilsson said, adding that, like most farmers, he is now operating at a loss.  The picture is little different in the Netherlands, where Iris Bouwers, a 25-year-old farmer, said the parched summer had been a “catastrophe” for her farm. “Older families around me are comparing this to 1976,” she said. “My dad can’t remember any drought like this.”  The Bouwerses expect to lose €100,000 this year after a 30% drop in their potato crop. After investing in a pig stable over the winter, the family have no savings to cover the loss.   Asked what she would do, Bouwers just laughed. “Hope and pray,” she said. “There is not much more I can do. I wouldn’t talk about bankruptcy yet, but our deficit will be substantial. It probably means we need to have a very good talk with the bank.” If anything, the situation is even worse in Poland, Belarus and the Czech Republic, where vegetation stress has taken hold. In parts of Germany, some farmers are reportedly destroying arid crops. After June was declared the second warmest on record, the European commission pledged to help farmers with a raft of measures, including the temporary suspension of “greening” obligations partly intended to prevent climate change. Farmers who have diversified their crops and invested in irrigation are in a better position to handle extreme weather events, which will become more common as the climate warms. But that is not an option for smallholders with monocultures and little access to irrigation. Jannes Maes, a small dairy farmer in Flanders and the president of the European council of young farmers, said concerns about insolvent farms were rising but were not the only problem.  “Bankruptcies would be hard,” he said, “but the economic loss farmers are suffering is often just as bad because they are hidden bankruptcies that have been prevented by wasting family capital on a farm.”  Thomas Duffy, an Irish dairy farmer from County Cavan, said the drought “won’t break us, but our feeding costs are 50% higher than last year and all the money we’d normally be putting into improving conditions for the cows and infrastructure is now going to silages [winter feed] and buying forage.” The European Drought Observatory (EDO) has described the drought as “an extensive and severe anomaly” affecting Scandinavia, Scotland, Ireland, the Baltics, the Netherlands and northern Germany. A spokeswoman for the EU’s Joint Research Centre, which oversees the EDO, said farmers should prepare to adapt to a warmer climate with “diversification or change of crop types and varieties, but also a more efficient use of water”. All water-related sectors “should be preparing sustainable adaptation measures towards an increase of drought frequency and intensity in the future”, she said."
"The NHS is experiencing a “summer crisis”, with increased emergency admissions and uncomfortable conditions in buildings not equipped for the heat, while the Met Office has warned that the UK temperature record of 38.5C could be broken on Friday. Authorities in Greece are dealing with the aftermath of devastating wildfires that killed at least 85 people, while efforts to control blazes in Sweden and in California continue. In Japan, 23,000 people have been taken to hospital in the past week and the weather described by officials as a “disaster”. In Algeria, a new African record has been set of 51.3C. Weather systems are highly complex and scientists are cautious about assigning specific causes to one-off events. But experts are already pointing to global warming as a driver for the current heatwave, with a study based on computer models and temperature data due to be published by scientists at Oxford University on Friday. Meanwhile, a new report from the environmental audit committee points to the likelihood of more frequent heatwaves in future, and the UK government’s failure to prepare adequately for them.  There’s nothing wrong with enjoying the heatwave, as many people are. Such a long spell of warm weather is extraordinary and, for sun lovers, a treat. No doubt many are hoping it doesn’t break before they take their holidays. But whether or not any more records are broken, or wildfires ignited in the coming weeks, the claim that rising temperatures have nothing to do with the global state of extreme weather must not go unchallenged. When the former US environment secretary Scott Pruitt was asked about climate change following Hurricane Harvey last year, he said that it was not the right time to talk about it. The opposite case is that the aftermath of an extreme event, when the atmospheric conditions have become the news, rather than the backdrop to the news, can be a “teachable moment”, when different kinds of conversations become possible. One of those conversations is the one about adaptation. Since some effects of climate change are now inevitable, we must deal with them. As this week’s committee report says, building regulations must be altered to ensure heat resilience, and new measures must be brought in to improve drainage and water efficiency. The public information campaign that the committee calls for is even more urgent. The 2008 Climate Change Act commits the UK government to reducing emissions by 80% of their 1990 levels by 2050. The latest British Social Attitudes survey showed that more than 90% of British people accept that climate change is happening. But only around a quarter describe themselves as very worried about this. Politicians, along with journalists, scientists and others, have a responsibility to make sure that people know what to expect and can make informed decisions – for example, about how to heat and insulate their own homes. Treating the symptoms of climate change makes no sense if the causes are not tackled at the same time. British laws – as well as the Paris agreement – commit the UK government to doing this, meaning decarbonisation of the electricity supply, heating and transport. These measures have cross-party support, but commitment by politicians is inconsistent. Just a few weeks ago, parliament approved a new runway at Heathrow, a decision that now faces a legal challenge. This week, the government gave approval for fracking in Lancashire, enraging all those who fear that this is proof – combined with slashed solar subsidies, the de facto ban on new onshore wind farms, and the rejection of the Swansea bay tidal scheme – that the government is unenthusiastic about renewables. Enjoy the sun if you can. We only live once and in countries with temperate climates such as the UK not all of the effects of climate change are necessarily harmful. Domestic tourism could even benefit. But don’t lose sight of the suffering caused by higher temperatures. In all our hands rests the future of life on earth."
"In my corner of south-eastern Ireland, even a comparatively modest heatwave has been taking its toll. “We’re just not made for this weather,” said the woman at the petrol station. “It has to end soon.” And, indeed, it did, the rain spilling down that very evening. But though it brought relief to our yellowed fields and gardens, we didn’t need the downpour to grant us a return of sanity – because, unlike the UK, we hadn’t lost our marbles in the first place. It’s a strange thing to look at your nearest neighbour, until a few weeks ago your home, and wonder if it’s losing it. To look at its leaders and movers and shakers and think: “Are they high?” Last week’s corker: stockpiling food on the outside chance that the catastrophically hobbled Brexit talks do not suddenly surge forwards and yield a happy ending. I’ve found myself humming The Quartermaster’s Song (“There are mice, mice, mice/ Running through the rice, at the Quartermaster’s store”) as I think of Dominic Raab counting in the boxes of hardtack and pemmican, growing ever more furious as the supermarket top brass ring to tell him they haven’t any shelf space left.  It is, of course, not funny. We can safely assume that taking back control was never supposed to mean growing our own onions in a window box and bartering scraps of ham on street corners and yet here we seem to be. Add in the latest headlines – health chiefs warning of outbreaks of super-gonorrhoea – and you begin to think that things might be going slightly awry. Ah, a nation of hungry, sun-stroked belligerents with the clap. Meanwhile, two developments of a more cheering, but nonetheless mildly puzzling, nature. Those of a certain vintage will recall Saturday afternoons round at your nana’s watching wrestling on the telly – Mick McManus, Jackie Pallo, Kendo Nagasaki (real name: Peter Thornley), Giant Haystacks (Martin Ruane) and Big Daddy (Shirley Crabtree). These guys had it all: the names, the costumes, the bizarre rituals (Catweazle licking a lucky toad between rounds). They were who we watched when we weren’t watching Leonard Sachs barking up the acts on The Good Old Days and the snooker programme Pot Black, even if you didn’t have a colour set. This was a time when truly sophisticated television – by which I mean Bergerac – was a rare and carefully husbanded treat. But now, wrestling is back! As of teatime yesterday, you can watch Dave Mastiff (aka Human Hate Machine) and Grado (The Chubby Wee) slugging it out, with the addition of two female wrestlers, nicknamed Lilith and Viper. And while Mastiff’s declaration that this new incarnation of British wrestling is “like the punk rock scene used to be” might not bear close examination, I’m willing to get with the 1976 vibe. “Greetings, grapple fans!” And today’s political scene is agreeably amenable to the retro-feel. Young people are declaring themselves communists and free-floating liberals are plotting new parties. Jeremy Corbyn, 40-odd years ago a Haringey councillor calling for free dentistry and the national ownership of everything, hasn’t even had to change his Donovan hat. On the other side of the house, Jacob Rees-Mogg looks like he’s stepped off the front page of the Daily Sketch, where he jumps out of his Triumph Stag to rail against union leaders meeting behind closed Downing Street doors for beer and sandwiches. But in all this disarray, a truly delightful moment, this time courtesy of the 1980s. In Albert Square, Walford, the home of the BBC soap opera EastEnders, residents are about to see a long-lost face, that of Dr Harold Legg, beloved GP and community stalwart. Dr Legg, who appeared in the very first episode, and who subsequently found himself at the heart of several major storylines, many of them also featuring Ethel Skinner and Dot Cotton. What could be more bolstering than the revival of a treasured doctor? One whose fictional back story – his Jewish family driven from the East End during the rise of Oswald Mosley and the British Union of Fascists, but who himself returned to serve and nurture the community – hardly seems out of kilter with the times. The actor who plays Dr Legg, Leonard Fenton, is now 92, and has a career that encompasses such TV series as Secret Army and Shine on Harvey Moon. What a swansong. But nostalgia, as we know, is dangerous, and although these cultural throwbacks and revivals are pleasant, they can’t displace the depth of our current troubles. As numerous experts, including the food writer Jack Monroe and the botanist James Wong, are in the process of pointing out, the potential shortage of food and medicines will have a disproportionately grave effect on those least equipped to withstand them, and even the apprehension of the instability and duress they will cause is damaging. In the heat of the last few weeks, it seems as though people were losing their minds and were driven to ever more ingenious ways of keeping cool. One such was the idea of drenching a sheet in cold water, then wrapping it around oneself before attempting to sleep. But as the mercury dips – for now at least – the country and those gifted its governance need to be careful that a cooling swathe of linen doesn’t become a winding sheet.Put more simply: it’s time to get a grip. • Alex Clark is an Observer columnist"
"Eleven teams participated in a recent Stanford Energy Modeling Forum (EMF) project, examining the economic and environmental impacts of a carbon tax. The studies included “revenue recycling,” in which the funds generated from a carbon tax are returned to taxpayers either through regular household rebate checks (similar to the Citizens’ Climate Lobby [CCL] and Climate Leadership Council [CLC] proposals) or by offsetting income taxes (similar to the approach in British Columbia). Among the eleven modeling teams the key findings were consistent. First, a carbon tax is effective at reducing carbon pollution, although the structure of the tax (the price and the rate at which it rises) are important. Second, this type of revenue-neutral carbon tax would have a very modest impact on the economy in terms of gross domestic product (GDP). In all likelihood it would slightly slow economic growth, but by an amount that would be more than offset by the benefits of cutting pollution and slowing global warming.  Meanwhile, House Republicans are again on the verge of introducing a Resolution denouncing a carbon tax as “detrimental to American families and businesses, and is not in the best interest of the United States.” The modeling teams examined four carbon tax scenarios, with starting prices of $25 or $50 per ton of carbon dioxide, rising at 1% or 5% per year. These are somewhat modest policy scenarios; CCL proposes a starting tax of $15 per ton rising at $10 per year, and the CLC proposes $40 per ton rising around 4% per year. The most aggressive policy considered by the Stanford EMF teams ($50 per ton rising 5% per year) falls in between these two proposals. The modeling studies consistently found that for all four carbon tax policies considered, whether the revenue is returned via rebate checks or by offsetting income taxes, the direct economic impact is minimal: in every policy scenario, in every model, the U.S. economy continues to grow at or near its long-term average baseline rate, deviating from reference growth by no more than about 0.1% points. We find robust evidence that even the most ambitious carbon tax is consistent with long-term positive economic growth, near baseline rates, not even counting the growth benefits of a less-disrupted climate or lower ambient air pollution The last sentence is critical. The analyses consistently found that coal power plants would be the biggest losers if a carbon tax were implemented, and the costs associated with health impacts from other pollutants released by burning coal (e.g. soot and mercury) are substantial. Phasing out coal power plants results in significant health and economic benefits to society.  So does slowing global warming, of course. A working paper recently published by the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond concluded that US economic growth would slow by an extra 0.2–0.5% per year if we stay on our current climate path (3–3.5°C global warming) than if we meet the 2°C Paris target. This compares favorably to a less than 0.1% per year slowing of the US economic growth rate under the carbon tax scenarios. In short, climate change will slow American economic growth. If we don’t curb global warming, the economic impact will be larger. If we implement a carbon tax to help meet the Paris climate targets, the economic impact will be negligible, and will be offset by the benefits of phasing out dirty coal power plants. The Stanford EMF studies also consistently concluded that a carbon tax is an effective way to curb carbon pollution, especially in the power sector: carbon price scenarios lead to significant reductions in CO2 emissions, with the vast majority of the reductions occurring in the electricity sector and disproportionately through reductions in coal … Expected economic costs (not accounting for any of the benefits of GHG and conventional pollutant mitigation), in terms of either GDP or welfare, are modest The analyses also found that the rate of increase of the carbon tax was more important than the starting price. For example, a tax of $50 per ton of carbon dioxide rising by 5% per year would cut carbon pollution 33–56% by 2040. A tax of $25 per ton rising 5% per year cuts it by 25–50% by 2040. However, the policies including a tax increasing at just 1% per year would result in a short-term cut (of about 20–40%), but carbon pollution would remain stable at those levels.  These results suggest that the most effective carbon tax might start relatively low to give taxpayers time to adjust, but increase rapidly over time, similar to the CCL proposal, which a separate report projected to cut carbon pollution 52% by 2040. The Stanford EMF studies also found that returning the tax revenue by offsetting income taxes was slightly more beneficial for the economy than using dividend checks as the rebate mechanism, but the former is a regressive policy and the latter is progressive. Real-world examples demonstrate that pricing carbon pollution is smart. British Columbia’s emissions have fallen as its economy has continued to grow. California’s carbon cap and trade system has helped the state meet its climate targets 4 years ahead of schedule, while its economy has flourished.

That’s why there’s a 95% consensus among economists that the US government should commit to cutting carbon pollution, with 81% favoring a market-based solution like a carbon tax."
"At least 11 wildfires are raging inside the Arctic Circle as the hot, dry summer turns an abnormally wide area of Europe into a tinderbox. The worst affected country, Sweden, has called for emergency assistance from its partners in the European Union to help fight the blazes, which have broken out across a wide range of its territory and prompted the evacuations of four communities. Tens of thousands of people have been warned to remain inside and close windows and vents to avoid smoke inhalation. Rail services have been disrupted. The Copernicus Earth observation programme, which gives daily updates of fires in Europe, shows more than 60 fires burning across Sweden, with sites also ablaze in Norway, Finland and Russia, including in the Arctic Circle. Norway has sent six fire-fighting helicopters in response to its neighbour’s request for assistance. Italy is sending two Canadair CL-415s – which can dump 6,000 litres of water on each run – to Örebro in central southern Sweden.  In western Sweden, fire-fighting operations were temporarily halted near an artillery training range near Älvdalen forest due to concerns that unexploded ordnance might be detonated by the extreme heat.  Residents in Uppsala said they could see the plumes of smoke and have been banned from barbecuing in national parks, after 18 consecutive days without rain. “This is definitely the worst year in recent times for forest fires. Whilst we get them every year, 2018 is shaping up to be excessive,” said Mike Peacock, a university researcher and local resident.  There have been huge fires in the past in Sweden, but not over such a wide area. This appears to be a trend as more and bigger blazes are reported in other far northern regions like Greenland, Alaska, Siberia and Canada. The sparks come from a variety of sources: BBQs, cigarettes and increasingly lightning, which is becoming more frequent as the planet warms. Swedish authorities say the risk of more fires in the days ahead is “extremely high” due to temperatures forecast in excess of 30C. Much of the northern hemisphere has sweltered in unusually hot weather in recent weeks, breaking records from Algeria to California and causing fires from Siberia to Yorkshire. Ukraine has been hit especially hard by wildfires. The European Forest Fire Information System warned fire danger conditions were likely to be extreme across much of central and northern Europe in the coming weeks. EU officials said many of this year’s fires are outside the traditional European fire zone of the Mediterranean, and are increasingly taking place at unexpected times of year. 2017 was the worst fire year in Europe’s history, causing destruction to thousands of hectares of forest and cropland in Portugal, Spain and Italy, as late as November. “There are clear trends of longer fire seasons and frequent critical periods in Europe that are leading to dangerous fire situations,” said a European commission official. Climate scientists said the Arctic and other areas that were once relatively fire-free are likely to become more vulnerable. “What we’re seeing with this global heatwave is that these areas of fire susceptibility are now broadening, with the moors in north-west England and now these Swedish fires a consequence of that,” said Vincent Gauci, professor of global change ecology at the Open University.  “Both these areas are typically mild and wet which allows forests and peatlands to develop quite large carbon stores,” he added. “When such carbon-dense ecosystems experience aridity and heat and there is a source of ignition – lightning or people – fires will happen.”"
"At least three people have died and thousands have been evacuated in California as eight active wildfires continue to burn across the state. More than 3,000 firefighters have been deployed to contain the flames, and the destruction is expected to worsen throughout the weekend as high temperatures and dry conditions inhibit efforts. The state governor, Jerry Brown, has declared a state of emergency in northern California’s Shasta county, and in southern California’s Riverside county, to help provide local fire crews with the resources they need to battle the blazes. Donald Trump has not yet commented on the fires.  Redding, a city of 92,000 near the Oregon border, is at grave risk from the Carr fire, which has so far killed two people. The fire is only 3% contained and has already scorched more than 44,450 aces. “Really, we’re in a life-saving mode right now in Redding,” said the Cal Fire battalion chief, Jonathan Cox. “We’re not fighting a fire. We’re trying to move people out of the path of it because it is now deadly, and it is now moving at speeds and in ways we have not seen before in this area.” The Carr fire erupted on Monday 23 July and is being propelled by “extreme fire behavior and challenging wind conditions”, according to CalFire officials. The blaze continues to threaten nearly 5,000 structures and 65 buildings have already been incinerated.  Meanwhile, in southern California, the Cranston fire has consumed 11,500 acres and is also only 3% contained. The fire threatens swaths of lands in Idyllwild, and Mt San Jacinto state park and San Bernardino national forest have both been closed. The Ferguson fire, which has burned close to 46,000 acres near Yosemite national park and caused the death of a firefighter, prompted national parks officials to close the most popular areas, including evacuating the famous Yosemite valley at the peak of tourist season. More than 3,800 fire personnel are working to protect the groves of ancient sequoias along the western edge of the park. The season has followed a particularly destructive and deadly fire year in the state –in 2017 nearly 9,000 wildfires tore through 1.2m acres, taking down close to 11,000 structures. Forty-six people lost their lives, making it one of the deadliest fire seasons on record in the state. This year could prove to be even worse – already this year, roughly 4,000 fires have erupted in California, scorching more than 144,303 acres, and officials say it is still early in the season. “We are still in July, which is kind of unnerving for us here in California because we are seeing this kind of destruction happening already,” Lynne Tolmachoff, a CalFire representative, said. “We still have at least three months – and generally the worst part of fire season – yet to come.” She explained that California’s recent five-year drought killed 129m trees, which are fuel for the fires. So are the grasses that grew over the winter but have now dried out. “It’s the kindling for a big fire,” she adds. California’s climate has become drier, with longer, hotter summers. Over the past two decades the fire seasons has become longer, stretching from May to November or December.  “There have been numerous homes destroyed in the Carr fire just last night and two deaths that we have confirmed already,” Tolmachoff said. “So it is definitely not looking good and it’s turning out to be a very difficult fire season. It could, depending on what occurs down the road, could easily meet or surpass last year.” The Associated Press contributed reporting"
"The sun shone and shone over County Cork last week, just as it did over most of Britain. When we came last year, to the same place in the same week, the steep banks of the lanes grew thick with wild roses, fuchsia and foxgloves; now the vegetation looked limper and dustier, the roses drier, the foxgloves solitary and stooped. But a poorer foreground view had its compensation in the background, where the lack of drizzle, cloud and mist revealed a rolling landscape of hills and woods that was unexpectedly Tuscan in its clarity. By four in the afternoon, the airless main streets of the small towns felt like ovens.  On the coast east of Skibbereen we found a delightful cove, of the sort that in my experience rarely exists outside children’s fiction: perfect in its firm sand, its protective reefs of smooth black rock, and its warren of caves that ran back into the cliffs, invaded every day by the tide, and entirely free of plastic flotsam. The sea was calm and clear, and changed its shade of blue according to the depth and composition of the seabed. Moreover, it wasn’t chill. In 60-odd years swimming off the British coastline, I’ve rarely known water as welcoming or as hard to leave: even after 40 minutes, it seemed a shame to get out. Newspaper reports said the prolonged heatwave had raised sea temperatures in other places to over 20C, which sounded impossibly warm, almost like a heated swimming pool. In that temperature, there would surely be no dallying in the shallows, no theatrical shivering when the water reached crotch level, no complaining that the cold was unbearable, no need to stand there uncertainly while your companion, already swimming briskly, urged you to “get in and get it over with”. Instead immersion would be a swift, Mediterranean experience – a run or brisk walk into the sea and then a splash as you struck out for the diving platform. Temperatures in the Firth of Forth never made getting into the water so easy. To be consistently tempting, the estuary needed exceptional conditions – and the summer of 1955 provided them. The sun shone for weeks, and day after day my friends and I made the 10-minute walk to the beach – not a Blue Flag candidate, if Blue Flags had existed then, because a pipe ran right down the middle of it that carried sewage to the sea from the army barracks to the rear. Looking back, it seems odd that people made no fuss about this, or about another more torrential outlet not far upstream, where the sewage turned the sea pink with its infusions of potassium permanganate. But it was a beach, all the same, with a sandbank that appeared at low tide and a hut at the far end that opened on especially busy days to sell crisps and lemonade; and by the second week, I had taught myself to swim. All kinds of things happened in 1955: Anthony Eden won the general election; Princess Margaret announced that she didn’t intend to marry RAF Group Captain Peter Townsend; Ruth Ellis became the last woman to be hanged in the UK. I remember none of them. For me, it was the year I was turned brown by the sun. A family snapshot, one of our first in colour, shows me in swimming trunks, staring across a shiny flat sea towards a visiting American battleship, the USS Wisconsin, which lay anchored in the firth. My back is unselfconsciously brown – there had been no lying on towels and striving for this effect – which tells a story of capering about on the beach with no recourse to the plastic macs and sweaters that in most years the visitor to the Scottish seaside was wise to bring. (As the actor and comedian Stanley Baxter remembers, returned Glaswegian holidaymakers when questioned about the weather might reply stoically, “Well, it never kept us in.”) The strong sunlight gave everything a memorable clarity, just as it did in Ireland last week, so that certain scenes of no particular emotional importance remain fixed, when in other years they would have faded: the sight of a spoil tip near an old mine or ironworks – abandoned even in 1955 – that revealed an interior of bright red cinders where a jagged crack had split its grassy surface. It makes no sense to remember it, and yet there it is through the window of the Glasgow bus, under a bright blue sky. Unclothed adults at the seaside were then hardly visible, other than in newspaper pictures of crowded beaches at sophisticated resorts such as Ayr or Blackpool. When my grandfathers came to the beach, they retained their flat caps and waistcoats. My mother never owned a swimsuit. My father had trunks – as a boy he’d liked to swim – but I only once saw him wear them. None of this was very exceptional. I can’t think of any adult in our street who went to the beach and did much more than roll up a trouser leg. Nobody could have complained, as the aesthete James Lees-Milne did in his diary in July 1976: “Heatwave continuing. Whole country parched, and trees dying. Found E naked but for a pair of long blue shorts, with white skin, smarmed hair (for he had just had a bath), flabby muscles, pendulous breasts, looking like Picasso aged 90. How can aesthetic persons bear to be seen in this condition at 74 even by their intimates?” The great summers of my lifetime have been 1955, 1976 and now this one. With each, a little more innocence has been shed as well as clothes. Prolonged sunshine now seems ominous – a portent as well as a pleasure. Ireland, for instance, has a rural economy that largely depends on grass, and in a drought grass fails to thrive. That has huge consequences for every cattle farmer, but posterity may see it as no more than a little local difficulty, one of the negligible effects of a global temperature change that melts glaciers and ice caps. Carpe diem, then, in a cove near Skibbereen. • Ian Jack is a Guardian columnist"
"Whether summer in your city is present or past, there is a good chance you weathered record-breaking temperatures this year.  A heatwave swept the planet, and it was not simply one hot summer: the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration shows that all 18 years of the 21st century are among the 19 warmest on record, and 2016 was the warmest year ever. “In 20 years’ time, the [recent] heat ... will no longer be news. It will be routine,” warned a Guardian editorial. Climate change in cities is frequently discussed in terms of flooding or storms – but its most dangerous consequence may be heat. Air conditioning, private transport and water engineering have allowed urban settlements in arid areas to expand at a dizzying and unsustainable rate, while outdated paradigms of urban planning and design give little relief from rising temperatures. Cities around the world may find their water use restricted – Cape Town, South Africa and Shimla, India have already have already come dangerously close to “day zero”, when taps run dry – and their power infrastructure compromised by reliance on air conditioning. Standards of living are likely to fall. Heat islands, droughts and disrupted seasons will likely lead to more deaths – particularly among the young, the old and those with health issues. Guardian Cities will be publishing a special week of journalism next month investigating heat in cities, and we want to hear from you. How are rising temperatures affecting or changing your city?

"The heatwave searing northern Europe was made more than twice as likely by climate change, according to a rapid assessment by scientists. The result is preliminary but they say the signal of climate change is “unambiguous”. Scientists have long predicted that global warming is ramping up the number and intensity of heatwaves, with events even worse than current one set to strike every other year by the 2040s. “The logic that climate change will do this is inescapable – the world is becoming warmer, and so heatwaves like this are becoming more common,” said Friederike Otto, at the University of Oxford and part of the World Weather Attribution (WWA) consortium that did the work. “What was once regarded as unusually warm weather will become commonplace, and in some cases, it already has,” she said. “So this is something that society can and should prepare for. But equally there is no doubt that we can and should constrain the increasing likelihood of all kinds of extreme weather events by restricting greenhouse gas emissions as sharply as possible.” The new analysis is a climate-change attribution study. By comparing extreme weather with historical measurements and with computer models of a climate unaltered by carbon emissions, researchers can find how much global warming is increasing the risk of dangerous weather. The researchers analysed records of the hottest three-day period at seven weather stations in northern Europe, from Ireland to the Netherlands to Scandinavia, where data was easily accessible. “We found that for the weather station in the far north, in the Arctic Circle, the current heatwave is just extraordinary – unprecedented in the historical record,” said Geert Jan van Oldenborgh, at the Royal Netherlands Meteorological Institute and also part of WWA.  Across northern Europe, the group found global warming more than doubled the risk of scorching temperatures. “We can can see the fingerprints of climate change on local extremes,” he said. “It is amazing now that it is something you can really see at a local level.” “Most heatwave studies have been done on large scale averages, so European-wide temperatures,” said Otto. “In this study, we have looked at individual locations, where people live, to represent the heatwave people are actually experiencing.” The analysis is a preliminary study as a full study requires many climate models to be run on high-powered computers, which takes months. Previous attribution analyses have shown very strong connections between climate change and extreme weather events. The scorching summer in New South Wales, Australia, in 2016-17 was made at least 50 times more likely by global warming, meaning it can be “linked directly to climate change”, said the scientists.  The “Lucifer” heatwave across Europe’s Mediterranean nations in 2017 summer was made at least 10 times more likely by climate change, while the unprecedented deluge delivered in the US by Hurricane Harvey also in 2017 was made three times more likely by climate change, new research has found. However, other events, such as storms Eleanor and Friederike, which hit western Europe in January, were not made more likely by climate change, according to the scientists. In Europe, the heatwave has been caused by the stalling of the jet stream wind, which usually funnels cool Atlantic weather over the continent. This has left hot, dry air in place for two months – far longer than than usual. The stalling of the northern hemisphere jet stream is being increasingly firmly linked to global warming, in particular to the rapid heating of the Arctic and resulting loss of sea ice. The role of climate change in driving extreme weather events may actually be underestimated by these attribution studies, according to Prof Michael E Mann at Penn State University in the US. The work is good, he said, but computer models cannot yet reliably account for the complex jet stream changes caused by global warming, making the attribution studies “inherently conservative”.  Serious climate change is “unfolding before our eyes”, said Prof Rowan Sutton, director of climate research at the University of Reading. “No one should be in the slightest surprised that we are seeing very serious heatwaves and associated impacts in many parts of the world.” The wide geographical spread of the heatwave, right across four continents, points to global warming as the culprit, said Prof Peter Stott, a science fellow at the UK’s Met Office: “That pattern is something we wouldn’t be seeing without climate change.” The heatwave across northern Europe has seen wildfires in the Arctic Circle and prolonged heat across the UK and the European continent. In the south, fierce blazes have devastated parts of Greece, with scores of people killed.  But extreme weather has struck across the globe. Severe floods killed at least 220 people in Japan in early July, with the nation then hit by an “unprecedented” heatwave that peaked at 41.1C and left 35,000 people in hospital. In the US, extreme heat in the west is feeding wildfires, with Yosemite national park being evacuated, while flooding is affecting the east. Temperature records have also fallen in Taiwan, with a temperature of 40.3C in Tianxiang, and in Ouargla in Algeria’s Sahara desert, which reported a maximum temperature of 51.3C, the highest temperature ever reliably recorded in Africa. The first six months of the 2018 are the hottest recorded for any year without an El Niño event, a natural climate cycle that raises temperatures."
"Australia’s richest person, mining magnate Gina Rinehart, has been revealed as a key funder of the rightwing thinktank the Institute of Public Affairs – a consistent promoter of climate science scepticism. Rinehart’s company, Hancock Prospecting, donated $2.3m to the IPA in 2016 and $2.2m in 2017, according to disclosures made to the New South Wales supreme court.  As part of a long-running legal dispute over the use of company funds, Rinehart’s daughter Bianca had served a subpoena to access documents that would have shed light on the two donations from Hancock Prospecting to the IPA. The IPA has close ties to the Liberal party and IPA fellows regularly appear in the media. The payments suggest that more than a third of the IPA’s income in 2016 and 2017 was from Hancock Prospecting, the majority of which is owned privately by Rinehart. According to Forbes, Rinehart was the seventh-richest woman in the world in 2017 and Australia’s richest person, with current wealth estimated to be $17.6bn. The IPA is a registered charity but is not legally required to disclose its funders and has declined to reveal them in recent years, citing concerns that donors could be “intimidated”. According to the court judgment, Bianca Rinehart’s solicitors had been provided with a schedule of “donations and sponsorships” from Hancock Prospecting where it was disclosed, the judgment said, that the company “paid or provided amounts to IPA in a total of $2.3m for the 2016 financial year and $2.2m in the 2017 financial year”. The donations also raise questions about the way the IPA has disclosed the nature of its revenues.  The IPA’s 2017 annual report declared $6.1m of income but said that 86% had come from individuals. Based on that report, Hancock Prospecting’s $2.2m donation would appear to have constituted more than a third of the IPA’s income that year. In 2016, the IPA reported that 91% of donations were from individuals, but that year Hancock Prospecting’s $2.3m donation constituted almost half the IPA’s income of $4.96m. Hancock Prospecting was asked why it was supporting the IPA, if the donations were linked to specific work, and if it was still a supporter. IPA spokesman Evan Mulholland replied, “no comment” when asked about the donations and if supporters should be concerned that so much if its income is derived from one person. The IPA has a long history of publishing books and sponsoring speaking tours of prominent climate science deniers. Rinehart’s own views on human-caused climate change match those promoted by the IPA. In 2011, she wrote in a magazine column that she had “yet to hear scientific evidence to satisfy me that if the very, very small amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere (approximately 0.38%) was increased, it could lead to significant global warming”. She added: “I have never met a geologist or leading scientist who believes adding more carbon dioxide to the atmosphere will have any significant effect on climate change, especially not from a relatively small country like Australia.” Rinehart has also supported Australian speaking tours of British climate change denier Lord Christopher Monckton. Prof Ian Plimer, another prominent geologist who rejects climate change science, sits on the board of Hancock Prospecting subsidiary Roy Hill Holdings. In 2013, the IPA gave Rinehart a “free enterprise leader award” – which she accepted at a dinner alongside Tony Abbott just before he became prime minister and Rupert Murdoch. Murdoch’s father, Sir Keith Murdoch, helped found the institute and the News Corp boss served on its council from 1986 to 2000. In 2016 Rinehart was made an “honorary life member” of the IPA. The IPA has also promoted massive export-focused coalmines planned for the Galilee basin, arguing they would help lift Indians out of poverty. Rinehart has a direct stake in GVK Hancock, one company looking to develop coalmines in the Queensland deposit. The IPA is seen among progressives as having an outgrown influence on the Liberal party. Liberal MP Tim Wilson and Senator James Paterson are both former IPA staff members. In May it was reported the IPA had been proposed as a potential co-host of a later-cancelled visit to Australia by former US EPA chief Scott Pruitt. An IPA-sponsored climate study that claimed most global warming was natural was heavily promoted among conservative media outlets around the world. Climate scientists who reviewed the paper, which had appeared in a journal, described the work as “junk science”. HPPL was approached for this article but no response had been received at the time of publication."
"Humanity is devouring our planet’s resources in increasingly destructive volumes, according to a new study that reveals we have consumed a year’s worth of carbon, food, water, fibre, land and timber in a record 212 days. As a result, the Earth Overshoot Day – which marks the point at which consumption exceeds the capacity of nature to regenerate – has moved forward two days to 1 August, the earliest date ever recorded. To maintain our current appetite for resources, we would need the equivalent of 1.7 Earths, according to Global Footprint Network, an international research organisation that makes an annual assessment of how far humankind is falling into ecological debt. The overshoot began in the 1970s, when rising populations and increasing average demands pushed consumption beyond a sustainable level. Since then, the day at which humanity has busted its annual planetary budget has moved forward. Thirty years ago, the overshoot was on 15 October. Twenty years ago, 30 September. Ten years ago, 15 August. There was a brief slowdown, but the pace has picked back up in the past two years. On current trends, next year could mark the first time, the planet’s budget is busted in July. While ever greater food production, mineral extraction, forest clearance and fossil-fuel burning bring short-term (and unequally distributed) lifestyle gains, the long-term consequences are increasingly apparent in terms of soil erosion, water shortages and climate disruption. The day of reckoning is moving nearer, according to Mathis Wackernagel, chief executive and co-founder of Global Footprint Network. “Our current economies are running a Ponzi scheme with our planet,” he said. “We are borrowing the Earth’s future resources to operate our economies in the present. Like any Ponzi scheme, this works for some time. But as nations, companies, or households dig themselves deeper and deeper into debt, they eventually fall apart.” The situation is reversible. Research by the group indicates political action is far more effective than individual choices. It notes, for example, that replacing 50% of meat consumption with a vegetarian diet would push back the overshoot date by five days. Efficiency improvements in building and industry could make a difference of three weeks, and a 50% reduction of the carbon component of the footprint would give an extra three months of breathing space.   In the past, economic slowdowns – which tend to reduce energy consumption – have also shifted the ecological budget in a positive direction. The 2007-08 financial crisis saw the date push back by five days. Recessions in the 90s and 80s also lifted some of the pressure, as did the oil shock of the mid 1970s.  But the overall trend is of costs increasingly being paid by planetary support systems.  Separate scientific studies over the past year has revealed a third of land is now acutely degraded, while tropical forests have become a source rather than a sink of carbon. Scientists have also raised the alarm about increasingly erratic weather, particularly in the Arctic, and worrying declines in populations of bees and other insect pollinators, which are essential for crops.

"Record high temperatures have been set across much of the world this week as an unusually prolonged and broad heatwave intensifies concerns about climate change. The past month has seen power shortages in California as record heat forced a surge of demand for air conditioners. Algeria has experienced the hottest temperature ever reliably registered in Africa. Britain, meanwhile, has experienced its third longest heatwave, melting the roof of a science building in Glasgow and exposing ancient hill forts in Wales.  The World Meteorological Organization (WMO) said the rising temperatures were at odds with a global cyclical climate phenomenon known as La Niña, which is usually associated with cooling. 28 June Glasgow 31.9CBelfast 29.5CDenver, US 40.6C 2 July Montreal, Canada 36.6CYerevan, Armenia 42C 4 July Tbilisi, Georgia 40.5C 5 July Ouargla, Algeria 51.3C 9 July Tianxiang, Taiwan 40.3C 11 July  Saih al-Salem 51.4C  “The first six months of the year have made it the hottest La Niña year to date on record,” said Clare Nullis of the WMO. Taiwan is the most recent place to report a new high with a temperature of 40.3C in Tianxiang on Monday. This followed a flurry of other anomalies. Last week, a weather station at Ouargla in Algeria’s Sahara Desert, reported a maximum temperature of 51.3C on 5 July, the highest temperature reliably recorded in Africa.  Even when the sun goes down, night is not providing the cooling relief it once did in many parts of the world. At Quriyat, on the coast of Oman, overnight temperatures remained above 42.6C, which is believed to be the highest “low” temperature ever recorded in the world. Downtown Los Angeles also saw a new monthly July minimum overnight record of 26.1C on 7 July. Globally, the warmest year on record was in 2016, boosted by the natural climate cycle El Niño. Last year, temperatures hit the highest level without that amplifying phenomenon. This year, at the other cooling end of the cycle, is continuing the overall upward trend. Swathes of the northern hemisphere have seen unusually persistent warmth due to strong, persistent high pressure systems that have created a “heat dome” over much of Eurasia. “What’s unusual is the hemispheric scale of the heatwave,” said Michael Mann, director of the Earth System Science Center at Pennsylvania State University. “It’s not just the magnitude in any one location but that high temperatures are being seen over such a large area.” Northern Russia’s exceptionally sunny weather – seen on TV by billions thanks to the World Cup – has caused wildfires that affected 80,000 hectares of forest near the Krasnoyarsk region, which reported daily anomalies of 7C above average. The Western Siberian Hydromet Center has issued storm warnings after temperatures of more than 30C for five days. Climate watchers fear this will accelerate the melting of permafrost, releasing methane – a far more potent greenhouse gas than CO2. In California, daytime records were also set last week at Chino (48.9C), Burbank airport (45.6C) and Van Nuys airport (47.2C). In Canada, at least 54 deaths have been attributed to the prolonged heatwave and high humidity in Quebec. Montreal saw a new record high temperature of 36.6C on 2 July. In Europe, the WMO has warned of droughts, wildfires and harvest losses after the second hottest June on record. Over the past two weeks, records have been set in Tbilisi (40.5C), Shannon (32C), and Belfast (29.5C)  Britain has cooled slightly in the past two days, after 17 days of temperatures over 28C. This was the third longest heatwave on record, following the record 19-day run in 2013 and the famous summer of 1976, when there were two prolonged spells of 18 days and 15 days. Dean Hall of the UK’s Met Office said Britain’s temperatures were forecast to rise again over the coming week. The concern is that weather fronts – hot and cold – are being blocked more frequently due to climate change. This causes droughts and storms to linger, amplifying the damage they cause. This was a factor in the recent devastating floods in Japan, where at least 150 people died after rainfall up to four times the normal level. Paolo Ruti of the WMO said it was difficult to ascribe any one weather event to climate change, but that recent high temperatures, intense rains and slow-moving fronts were in line with forecasts of how rising emissions will affect the climate. “Recent analysis suggests that anthropogenic forcing might indeed affect the characteristics of summer blocking events in the Euro-Asia sector, in particular leading to longer blocking episodes,” he said.  Extreme weather events have buffeted much of the world over the past 12months, from the “Day Zero” drought in Cape Town to the abnormally powerful hurricanes Harvey and Irma that buffeted the east coast of the US and Caribbean.   Underscoring the link, a new report from scientists at the World Weather Attribution group indicates that manmade climate change and its effect on rainfall made the recent Cape Town drought three times more likely."
"The United Nations Special Rapporteur on indigenous peoples, Victoria Tauli-Corpuz, has released a report highly critical of the global conservation movement and calling for indigenous peoples and other local communities to have a greater say in protecting the world’s forests. Titled Cornered by Protected Areas and co-authored with the US-based NGO Rights and Resources Initiative (RRI), the report is an explicit condemnation of “fortress conservation.” What exactly is meant by that? It is “the idea that to protect forests and biodiversity, ecosystems need to function in isolation, devoid of people,” the Rapporteur told the Guardian. “This model - favoured by governments for over a century - ignores the growing body of evidence that forests thrive when Indigenous Peoples remain on their customary lands and have legally recognised rights to manage and protect them.”  The report effectively consists of an open letter by the Rapporteur, a brief by her and two former RRI employees, and five case-studies on India, Indonesia, Panama, Peru and the Republic of the Congo written by other researchers. It was made public during the recent Oslo Tropical Forest Forum. Here are 10 of the most fascinating take-aways: 1 Vast areas. The global network of “protected areas” such as national parks expanded by 80% between 1970 and 1985 - the majority in so-called “developing” countries - and today they cover 15% of global land surface excluding Antarctica. Expanding the network is integral to meeting the aims of the 2015 Paris Agreement on climate change and the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. Such areas are seen as a fundamental way of combatting anthropomorphic climate change and protecting the world’s forests, biodiversity and ecosystems. 2 Devastating impacts. Huge areas of indigenous peoples’ and other local communities’ land have been overlapped by “protected areas”, according to the Rapporteur, and the impacts are alleged to have been devastating. They include an estimated 250,000 people forcibly evicted from their homes and land between 1990 and 2014 according to one study, houses burnt down, access to land and important sites denied, extrajudicial killings, social conflict, access to justice obstructed, and food sovereignty eroded by bans on subsistence hunting and the “vilification” and “criminalisation” of “slash-and-burn” agriculture. “Protected areas” have caused - and continue to cause - “chronic patterns of abuse” and “large-scale human rights violations.” 3 Lots of words, little action. Despite commitments by “the world’s most influential conservation organisations” to respect indigenous peoples and other local communities’ rights, it is argued that “little has changed” in practice over the last 14 years. Which conservation organisations exactly? The Rapporteur doesn’t say, but she footnotes a 2014 report summarising commitments made by Birdlife, Conservation International, Fauna and Flora International, International Union for the Conservation of Nature, The Nature Conservancy, the Wildlife Conservation Society and the World Wide Fund for Nature.  4 Local peoples’ contributions. Indigenous peoples and other local communities are described as “effective biodiversity and conservation managers”, and the “primary custodians of most of the world’s remaining tropical forests and biodiversity hotspots.” Tree cover loss is reported to be less than half on land that is indigenous- and/or community-run when compared to elsewhere, and when rights to own their land are legally recognised “the difference is even greater.” 5 Not enough rights or money. Despite such contributions, the Rapporteur argues that there has been “no or limited recognition of rights” and that indigenous peoples and local communities receive “only a small percentage” of official “protected areas” funding, which is roughly estimated at $6-6.5 billion a year and called “consistently inadequate.” However, indigenous peoples and other local communities themselves are reported to be “substantial investors”, and represent better value for money than official conservation funding by achieving “at least equal results with a fraction of the budget.” 6 Tigers v tribes. The India case-study focuses on tiger reserves - reportedly comprising 50 of 617 “protected areas’” but capturing 70% of the national conservation budget - and one in particular now called the Biligiri Rangaswamy Temple Tiger Reserve. Many people - mostly Soliga adivasi - have been forcibly relocated, denied access to land and important sites, and banned from hunting, “shifting cultivation” agriculture and traditional forest management using controlled burning. There was some good news in 2011 when 32 Soliga settlements were granted rights under the 2006 Forest Rights Act - reportedly India’s first case of rights being given to a community in a protected area under that law - and another 10 communities were granted rights earlier this year, but financial and state support for community-run conservation “has not been forthcoming.” Some settlements still face relocation. 7 Indigenous peoples in “isolation.” The Peru case-study focuses on the Manu National Park in the Amazon where the situation is made even more complicated by the presence of indigenous peoples living in “isolation” or “initial contact.” Despite some advances, a system to protect them is reportedly “yet to be developed”, while four “stable” - effectively “contacted” - indigenous communities remain without title to their land and have had their collective rights “infringed upon.” The park was established “on the basis it would be inviolable and free of human interference”, but the heart of it was - and remains - indigenous territory. 8 Connection to nature. One point emerging from the report is the importance of their land to indigenous peoples and other local communities. This is emphasised in the case-studies on Indonesia, which describes forests as “forming the basis” of indigenous peoples’ “existence and identities”, and India, which describes the landscape in the tiger reserve as “alive with meaning and connection” for the Soliga - “none of which is recognised by protectionist conservation.” The Rapporteur puts it like this: “In indigenous worldviews people are seen largely as intrinsic parts of nature rather than as distinct and separate from it,” and “many share an ethical interconnection with nature through their languages, beliefs, and practices” which reflects “a commitment to respecting and caring for the natural world.” 9 Culture clash. Another point that emerges is how indigenous peoples’ and other local communities’ worldviews differ to that of governments and the global conservation movement. The India case-study reports that the Soliga think a “good” forest means an “open-canopy savanna woodland”, but for the government and conservationists the “ideal condition” is a “closed forest.” In the Indonesia case-study, one Kasepuhan leader is quoted as saying: “conservation has different meanings for people with or without education. For local people, we are doing conservation, we are taking responsibility for what is alive and what has died. But for people with education, conservation means that we do not do anything: when forest is green, people can only look at it.” 10 What to do - now and urgently. All the case-studies make country-specific recommendations, but the Rapporteur’s brief issues a rallying-cry to “take down the wall of fortress conservation” and calls for a “new approach” to conservation in general. It lists four things that urgently need doing now: 1) create a global “monitoring and grievance mechanism; 2) establish national “accountability and reparation mechanisms”; 3) ensure the UN Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples is fully integrated into all future conservation and climate change mitigation measures; and 4) spend more conservation finance on “community-run conservation initiatives” based around an “emerging suite of approaches such as co-management, indigenous-managed protected areas, and indigenous territorial governance.”"
"Women around the world who are leading the fight against climate damage are to be highlighted by Mary Robinson, former president of Ireland and UN high commissioner, in the hopes of building a new global movement that will create “a feminist solution for climate change”. Perhaps more revolutionary still, the new initiative is light-hearted in tone, optimistic in outlook and presents positive stories in what the originators hope will be seen as a fun way.  Called Mothers of Invention, the initiative will kick off with a series of podcasts showcasing the work of grassroots climate activists at a local level, as well as globally resonant initiatives such as the legal challenges under way in numerous jurisdictions to force governments to adhere to the Paris agreement goals. Scientists and politicians feature alongside farmers and indigenous community leaders from Europe, the US and Australia to India, Kenya, South Africa and Peru. The podcast is a first for Robinson, who has focused on climate justice for the last 15 years through her charity, the Mary Robinson Foundation – Climate Justice, and as one of the Elders group, after seeing at first-hand as UN commissioner for human rights the danger that global warming presents to women whose lives are already precarious. “Climate change is a manmade problem that requires a feminist solution,” she said ahead of the podcast launch. “What we are hoping to do is create a movement. Climate change is not gender-neutral – it affects women far more. So this is not about climate change, it is about climate justice.” The movement, she added, would grow organically from the women who feature and the women who join in: “It will be happening in an unstructured way, which is all the better, because we are not prescribing what a feminist solution should look like, we are listening – we want women to tell us what they want. That to me is more interesting.” Robinson has paired with Maeve Higgins, an Irish-born comedian based in New York and self-styled “sidekick”. They jointly introduce their female guests through a series of informal conversations larded with backchat and jokes – an unusual way of presenting the often gloomy subject of climate damage, Higgins admits, but one she hopes will reach people more effectively than the standard models of climate communication and male-dominated discourse. “There is a lot of doom and gloom – this is not like that,” Higgins said. “This is for people like myself who feel stuck, knowing there are actions they should be taking but paralysed by despondency. The capitalist patriarchy is not going to solve this. We need to.” The internet provides the means to reach women all over the world, she said: “This is democratic, this is available to as many people as possible.” The series will bring in issues of colonialism, racism, poverty, migration and social justice and how these are bound up with feminism and the effects of climate change, and will include related environmental issues such as plastic pollution. Podcasts are new departure for Robinson. “This is taking me way beyond my comfort zone,” she said. But “I’m willing to go there – I am so urgent about the fact that we need to do more.” The first five episodes in the series, which is funded by philanthropic foundations, focus on women, but Robinson promised the initiative would not exclude men’s voices. “We will include men in the future,” she said, “but we have started with women, who have found it hard to be heard. A feminist solution to climate change involves everyone.”"
"The Queensland and Victorian governments will be hit with a new television advertising campaign in an effort to persuade them to torpedo the national energy guarantee at a critical meeting in early August. The activist group GetUp has combined with Greenpeace to bankroll what it describes as hard-hitting television advertisements targeting the two Labor-held states ahead of a meeting of energy ministers in August that will make or break the Turnbull government’s signature energy policy.  Opponents of the national energy guarantee have been frustrated that the Victorian government thus far has been muted in its public criticism of the scheme, and fear the Australian Capital Territory – which has been persistently critical – won’t sink the Neg at the Coag energy council unless one of the larger states is also on board. With the Queensland energy minister, Anthony Lynham, calling in key stakeholders on Thursday to take soundings on the policy, GetUp’s national director, Paul Oosting, told Guardian Australia the activist group “expects all states to use their veto power” in August and fight for a national energy policy that would cut pollution and assist the transition to renewables. The Australian Conservation Foundation echoed GetUp’s stance, declaring the current policy “unsupportable” because the emissions reduction target is insufficient to see Australia meet its commitments under the Paris agreement, and the policy as drafted makes it difficult to adjust the level of ambition. The ACF’s Gavan McFadzean said: “What every state and territory government needs to understand is that if they sign up to this Neg, they own it and its woefully inadequate 26% pollution reduction target, locked in to 2030. “It won’t be just Malcolm Turnbull’s Neg, or Tony Abbott’s, but Daniel Andrews’ and Annastacia Palaszczuk’s as well.” The Turnbull government needs the backing of states that are in the national electricity market to implement the Neg, with any one jurisdiction possessing the power to kill the scheme. Business groups have lined up in support of the Neg, urging a truce in the decade-long toxic political battle over climate and energy policy. They want a settled policy mechanism to give energy market participants certainty to invest. Privately, some business stakeholders would also be relaxed about the commonwealth legislating a scheme that would make ramping up the level of ambition in the emissions reduction target easier to achieve – understanding that could help get the Labor states over the line on the mechanism. But adding that flexibility could sink the policy when it returns for consideration by the Coalition party room, assuming the states don’t end it first. The energy policy fight has been complicated in recent weeks by a renewed push by some Nationals and conservative Liberals to make ongoing support for coal part of the quid pro quo for supporting the Neg. The states are also processing a new report this week from the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission, which recommended major changes to the electricity market, including the commonwealth underwriting new generation projects in order to get more competition into the system and lower prices for consumers. The energy minister, Josh Frydenberg, has added the new ACCC report to the agenda for discussion at the critical August meeting. Nationals this week have attempted to front-run the debate and shape public perceptions of the report by claiming the ACCC investigation supports government backing of new coal generation, when the relevant recommendation is clearly technology-neutral. The ACT’s climate change minister, Shane Rattenbury, told Guardian Australia the report was being used by Liberals and Nationals “shamelessly to back up each of their internal arguments about the Neg”. He warned: “Unless the Coalition sorts out what the Neg will finally look like, it will be impossible for Coag to endorse or reject it.” Frydenberg and the prime minister, Malcolm Turnbull, have both said the proposed government underwriting would apply to all technologies that met the criteria, including, potentially, coal projects, as well as gas and renewables with battery back-up. But Turnbull has also pushed back against the Nationals. On Thursday Turnbull said: “We are not in the business of subsidising one technology or another. We’ve done enough of that. I mean, frankly, too much of that has been done.” He said subsidies for various forms of energy were in the process of winding down “and we should simply allow the technologies to compete”. Turnbull said the outcome the government was seeking was lower energy prices. The shadow federal climate change minister, Mark Butler, has declared it is a “fantasy” that anyone would seek to build a new coal-fired power station underwritten by the commonwealth, and he warned government MPs against hijacking a useful investigation by Australia’s competition watchdog. Butler said the idea of the government underwriting new market entrants with generation projects was an idea “very worthy of consideration, but unfortunately it’s already been hijacked by these ideological zealots in the Coalition party room”. “Everyone in the industry has recognised that building new coal-fired power stations, one isn’t suitable for the nature of the market in the future; it’s not sufficiently flexible, it’s more expensive than other power options, but also there is very substantial carbon risk, regulatory risk, price risk, associated with building new, high polluting, or high emitting assets,” Butler said. “That’s why the industry won’t go near it, investors, bankers, won’t go near it, because they understand quite how risky it is.”"

"Yesterday, the House of Representatives voted on an anti-carbon tax Resolution. The Resolution was introduced by Steve Scalise (R-LA) with essentially the same language as he introduced in 2013 and 2016. On those past versions, every Republican House member voted against carbon taxes. This time, six Republicans rejected the Resolution and one abstained, voting ‘Present.’ However, 97% of the House Republicans on the floor voted against carbon taxes.  House Democrats have been fairly consistent in their votes on these Resolutions as well. In 2013, 94% voted against the Resolution, and in 2016 and 2018, 96% voted ‘Nay,’ with six to seven pro-fossil fuel Democrats voting ‘Yes.’ The text of the Resolution claims that carbon taxes are necessarily bad for America: Expressing the sense of Congress that a carbon tax would be detrimental to the United States economy … [and] to American families and businesses, and is not in the best interest of the United States. This week’s Resolution ironically came right on the heels of a comprehensive study showing that a carbon tax whose revenues were returned to taxpayers either via rebate checks or by offsetting income taxes would have a negligible impact on the economy – significantly less than the cost of unchecked global warming. In fact, research has shown that it’s global warming that will seriously slow economic growth. We already pay a ""carbon tax"". It's the extra money we pay on electricity to run our air conditioners; it's the price increases due to agricultural impacts of heat and precip. changes; it's the cost of sea level rise; 1/2 https://t.co/D6OyvPmXeY Simply put, the only way to protect the economy is to stop global warming. Accomplishing that will require that virtually every world country implement climate policies aimed at curbing carbon pollution. That was the purpose of the Paris climate accords. Disgracefully, the Trump administration made America the only country in the world whose leadership rejects that international climate agreement. But a carbon tax would be one of the most effective and efficient ways to cut America’s carbon pollution.  The text of the Resolution has it exactly backwards – a carbon tax would help protect the American economy by slowing global warming and its detrimental effects on economic growth. Citizens’ Climate Lobby (CCL) Executive Director Mark Reynolds characterized yesterday’s vote as progress, saying: The fact that six Republicans voted ‘no’ on an anti-carbon tax resolution is an indication that there are cracks in the wall separating Democrats and Republicans on climate change. At the CCL blog, Flannery Winchester also noted that the number of co-sponsors on Scalise’s Resolutions dropped from 155 in 2013, to 82 in 2016, to just 48 in 2018. That’s a nearly 70% decline over five years and an encouraging sign that the number of vehement anti-carbon tax members of Congress is dwindling. Given that the share of the Republican vote against carbon taxes only dropped from 100% in 2016 to 97% in 2018, the cracks are still small, but a crack is better than an unyielding wall of denial. Nevertheless, it’s frustrating that just four of the 43 Republican members of the Climate Solutions Caucus voted against the Resolution (with one more abstaining by voting ‘Present’). Especially given the conditions under which yesterday’s vote happened: It really should have been an easy ‘Nay’ vote, and yet only a handful of Republicans voted the right way. Climate Solutions Caucus member Darrell Issa (R-CA) explained his ‘Yes’ vote, saying a “carbon tax isn’t the solution” and that the Caucus should focus on policies that can generate bipartisan support, like energy efficiency programs and keeping nuclear power plants open.  Those are indeed valid climate policies. They’re also wholly insufficient to tackle global warming, and if Republicans can only support inadequate climate policies, they’re unbefitting the role of governance. The cracks in the wall should be much bigger by now. A new study by Robert Brulle identified why the CCL volunteer lobbying on this Resolution was relatively ineffective: Professional lobbying organizations are a permanent presence on Capitol Hill. Thus, the vast expenditures and continuous presence of professional lobbyists limit the impact of volunteer climate advocates. Brulle found that over $2bn has been spent lobbying Congress on climate change legislation since 2000 (an average of $125m per year). And an analysis by the Center for American Progress found that in 2009–2010 leading up to a vote on a cap and trade bill, the fossil fuel industry spent over $500m lobbying against it. In Washington DC, money talks, as Brulle noted: We seem to have a public opinion fetish where if we get public opinion to be supportive of climate change legislation, then it’ll happen. My answer to that is, gee, well, we should have gun control legislation then. Fortunately, Americans have an opportunity to remedy this problem in less than four months, when every House member will be up for election in the 2018 midterms.  If we agree that climate change poses an existential threat (it does), that this should have been an easy ‘Nay’ vote, and that Republican members of Congress are beholden to the fossil fuel industry rather than voter preferences, then the answer is simple. In November, Americans should replace all members of Congress who voted in favor of the Resolution and who face opponents that aren’t in bed with the fossil fuel industry."
"An unusually dry winter, with less than average rainfall interspersed with localised flooding in some areas, is emerging as a major contributing factor to the wildfires that are ravaging the mainland of Greece. Lack of the expected steady rainfall in the winter months meant groundwater sources failed to recharge and left vegetation unable to recover fully from the high temperatures of the 2017 summer. As a result, when temperatures topping 40C hit some areas during this summer’s heatwave and drought, the conditions were already in place for wildfires to take hold. Strong winds then fanned the flames and spread the fires widely before stretched fire-fighting teams could gain control. The fact that the fires took hold on land close to densely inhabited and resort areas was largely a matter of chance, but one that led to a death toll of more than 70 people and wrought devastation on homes. These are widely regarded as the short-term causes of the fires, but experts are also concerned that the conditions experienced in Greece in the last two years are likely to be replicated more often in future, owing to the changing climate. Nikos Charalambides, executive director of Greenpeace Greece, said: “As the death toll rises and the full size of the disaster is still to be recorded, it would be premature to attribute these [fires] to either climate change or the failures of the fire prevention and fire-fighting mechanisms.” However, he said the contributing factors included drought, strong winds and unusually high temperatures, all of which are likely to be aggravated by climate change. The current heatwave across Europe and much of the northern hemisphere could be seen as “a foretaste of what weather extremes we are threatened by as the climate crisis progresses”, said Charalambides. Growing more trees and managing forests properly would help to make the land more resilient to droughts, heatwaves and fires, he added. Forests also act as a cooling factor on the local climate and support a range of biodiversity. Charalambides also called for a greater focus on the prevention of fires in Greece in place of a traditional focus on boosting firefighting capacity. Alongside this, there should be more emphasis on drawing up plans for evacuation in the case of disaster, particularly in areas where pine forests are near to human habitation. Rachel Kennerley, climate campaigner at Friends of the Earth, said: “The immediate priority must be to tackle the terrible fires, and to support the people whose homes, lives and livelihoods have been put at risk or devastated.” But she said the longer-term impacts must also be taken into account when the immediate danger has passed: “Extreme heatwaves are predicted to become more frequent as climate change takes hold, meaning drier forests and countryside, and a greater risk of fire. Politicians must wake up to the extreme weather battering the planet and take tough and urgent steps to slash the climate-wrecking pollution being pumped into our atmosphere.” Ray Rasker of Headwaters Economics, an expert on wildfires and the built environment in California, said buildings in high-risk areas could be made more resistant to fires in future, often through relatively simple measures. He cited nonflammable roofing material and siding for houses, not using wooden decks, installing fine mesh screens on roof vents, and planting fire-resistant vegetation close to houses. He also warned that in the aftermath of large fires there is often a temptation to waive or loosen high building standards in order to rebuild as quickly as possible, which he said would be a mistake. The short-term Met Office forecast for Greece is for temperatures from around 26C to around 30C, with some localised thunderstorms and a small amount of rainfall in a few areas."
"A Republican lawmaker has proposed that the US introduce a tax on carbon dioxide emissions, in a departure from the party’s decade-long hostility toward any measure aimed at addressing climate change. Carlos Curbelo of Florida, considered a moderate GOP member of Congress, said a carbon tax would avoid “saddling young Americans with a crushing environmental debt” and expressed his belief that “this bill or legislation similar to it” will become law one day.  Curbelo’s bill has virtually no chance of becoming law, however, due to the serried ranks of Republicans in Congress who instinctively reject any sort of government intervention, particularly taxes, to help stem the increasing heatwaves, floods, fierce storms and social upheaval caused by a warming planet. Last week, the Republican-led House of Representatives passed a resolution denouncing the idea of a carbon tax as “detrimental to the United States economy”. Of the 43 Republicans who are members of the Climate Solutions Caucus – a bipartisan group formed to help craft climate policy – only six voted against the motion.  Curbelo, one of the six Republicans to vote with Democrats in favor of a carbon tax, has now unveiled his own proposal. Curbelo represents a district that takes in the southern tip of Florida – an area extremely vulnerable to sea level rise – and faces an uphill battle in this year’s midterm elections. His plan would tax industrial carbon dioxide emissions $24 a ton from 2020. It would also scrap federal excise taxes on gasoline and diesel fuels, as well as kill off the Clean Power Plan, an Obama-era strategy to limit emissions from coal-fired power plants.  According to Columbia University, Curbelo’s plan would cut the US’s greenhouse gas emissions by up to a third by 2025, putting it on course to meet its commitments made in the 2015 Paris climate agreement. It would also raise at least $57bn in 2020, growing to at least $63bn by 2030 as the tax increases. Curbelo wants to use this cash to upgrade infrastructure, particularly roads. “While there are still some deniers out there, most Americans today understand that climate change caused by human activity is a reality that must be addressed,” he said.  “I remind my conservative colleagues who often decry our nation’s growing debt; saddling young Americans with a crushing environmental debt – meaning an unhealthy planet where life is less viable – is at least as immoral as leaving behind an unsustainable fiscal debt.” Republican hostility to any sort of action on climate change has hardened over the past decade, despite increasingly urgent warnings from scientists. Donald Trump, who has called global warming “bullshit” and a Chinese-inspired hoax, has taken an axe to various climate regulations and said the US will withdraw from the Paris climate accords. Curbelo’s plan has received a mixed reaction from environmentalists. Some green groups have derided it as an empty re-election gesture that could actually increase emissions in a major sector – transportation – by funneling money into road construction and slashing fuel taxes. Others, though, see it as a sign the American political conversation around climate change is slowly evolving, given a backdrop of increasing public confidence in climate science. “It’s a breakthrough to see a serious Republican proposal take aim at the central environmental threat of our time,” said David Doniger, senior strategic director of the climate and clan energy program at the Natural Resources Defense Council.  “But this carbon tax plan is only a conversation starter. It falls far short of what’s needed to protect our climate. We must deploy all available tools, not limit them as this bill does, to head off the worst damages from climate change.”  Cities and states have sought to fill the void left by Trump’s retreat from climate change, with several attempting to sue major oil companies for damages.  Last week, a judge tossed out New York City’s claim against five oil giants, stating that the issue should be dealt with by legislation. Similar climate legal action has been launched in recent weeks by Rhode Island and Baltimore."
"In Cairo people swim in the Nile and absorb the heat in their homes with sacks of rice. In Tokyo they carry parasols. Farmers in Bukhara fear for their future, while in Jordan, refugees cover themselves with wet towels. And anyone who can relies on air conditioning (AC).  Around the world, people are trying to cope with the intense and prolonged heat. As always, the most vulnerable in society – the homeless, the elderly, the poor or disenfranchised – are suffering the most. Guardian Cities is investigating heat in cities for a special week of journalism next month. Tell us how heat has affected you.  I live in a house on Waraq Island, in the Nile, with my uncles, their families and grandparents. When we were kids we used to swim in the Nile, and some of us still do to overcome the heat.  The family saved up and bought one AC unit for the living room; now that’s where everyone spends their day – preparing food, watching TV, playing or studying. But it doesn’t always work because the electricity is very weak. My grandmother used to put the bedsheets in the fridge or the cooler, or hold a bag of cold water against our backs. My mother used a trick from Upper Egypt: using sacks of rice and buckwheat to absorb the heat. I plan so that I can spend the day in air-conditioned offices at university or work, only returning home at night. I take the metro every day: when it’s hot, everyone is sweaty and smells. And sometimes the metro breaks down due to the heat. Reported by Ruth Michaelson with Adham Youssef in Cairo It’s much worse this summer than last year. The reflected heat off the ground has been much more intense compared with the last few years. I use a parasol but it doesn’t really help me,because the heat from the ground is so hot.  I try to walk in the shade and also take lots of water, and then use AC in my home during the night. In past summers I used a timer to switch it off two hours after I fell asleep; now I leave it on through the night.  When I leave the office to get lunch, I try to go somewhere nearby. On weekends I try not to go out when the sun is really high. Sometimes I try to escape from Tokyo to cooler areas, but even there it’s too hot this year.  When I was a kid I could sleep with the window open but lately I can’t. I’m concerned about temperatures getting hotter in the future due to climate change; I hope America will stay signed up to the Paris agreement. We rely on AC more and more, which uses electricity, so I think it will get hotter because of that. Reported by Daniel Hurst in Tokyo There have been days when I couldn’t really go out for very long. It’s always been hot in Montreal for a few weeks here and there, but now it feels like it’s double the amount of time we have intense heat. I’m living at the Old Brewery Mission [a non-profit supporting the homeless in Montreal]. I’m also helping some kids on the street; they’re not in as good a situation as me because they don’t have AC. The water situation is not that great. The mission give you popsicles [with electrolytes] … so that replenishes the salts and whatever you need. We dehydrate ourselves and we don’t even know it. Then all of a sudden you’re dizzy; that’s when accidents happen. You don’t have to buy water, you just have to buy one good water container and carry it with you. But we need more water fountains in the parks.  I have bronchitis and pneumonia. I go from here to Saint Denis and Sherbrooke [an intersection about 2km away]. I do it in two or three blocks at a time and I have to find an air-conditioned place and sit down and relax – or sit down and cough – because of the pollution and the heat. There’s a lot of coughing when it starts. Try to find a friendly tree in the city and give it a hug. You have to find some AC, so shopping centres are good and large stores. People should be aware that other people need AC and water. Give them the time of day and a smile, and pass along a little water. Reported by Jillian Kestler-D’Amours in Montreal The prosperity of our whole region depends on the quality of cotton that we produce. Because of the extremely dry climate, we have to keep the soil as wet as possible during the summer to get a good crop in the autumn. This becomes very complicated because the available water evaporates faster as the temperature rises. A lot of local farmers get into debt just keeping the cotton fields watered.  A new channel was created several years ago to get water to Bukhara’s fields from the Amu Darya, the river between Uzbekistan and Turkmenistan. A couple of smaller rivers near Bukhara had dried out. Only 20 or 30 years ago the temperature did not rise too high, farming was easier, there was more rain in the summer.  We have to take this issue seriously now. Life will be really harsh if the temperature keeps rising. Reported by Sevil Khikmatova I work two jobs, like most of the people who sell produce at the laikes [farmers’ markets]: two days a week growing fruits and vegetables in the fields of Marathonas [a town about an hour’s drive north-east of Athens], where I live with my family, and five days selling them at different laikes across Athens. Working outside is always worst at the beginning of a heatwave – as it goes on, the body adapts as much as it can, and you begin to get used to it. Here in the market, working during the afternoon is bearable because we have umbrellas above each stall. Working in the fields is much more difficult: there is no shade, you are constantly in the sun. We start working at 6am: it is light outside but not yet too hot. We rest from 11am and start work again after 4pm until it gets dark. It is also vital to dress properly for the Greek sun – light, light-coloured clothing and hats. Reported by Clea Skopeliti in Athens This year’s heatwave has been remarkable, coupled with rare humidity on consecutive days – like living in a sauna. A colleague recalled that, five or so years ago, he could have cooled himself down in the shade at midday on a summer’s day; now he’s soaked with sweat as soon as he steps outside, and AC is the only remedy. As a northern city in China, Beijing typically has low rainfall and humidity. Clothes could be dried quickly after washing; this year it takes weeks. There are regular heavy downpours, I felt as if I were living in a coastal city. In the past only record-breaking temperatures have captured public attention in China. My home city of Wuhan is famous for its melting weather in summer. But my mom could still jog even on summer days. The highest temperature in Wuhan lately has been 38C, on July 21, and it stayed around 37-38C in the following days. It’s a matter of time before it reaches 40C or higher. Nowadays, people resort to spending their summer holidays in the mountains, where the temperature is lower. In the city, lots of concrete buildings spring up with limited ability to absorb the heat. The ecosystem possesses its own ability to adjust the temperature and to balance living conditions. We need to find a way to rebuild the ecosystem, to restore the balance. Submitted online to Guardian Cities It’s a desert area, and we’re suffering. It is summer so it’s dusty. We live in a caravan, and it’s so hot because they are made of metal. We have different ways of coping. We wake early and soak the floor with water. Then we sprinkle water on ourselves. Most of the time we soak towels and put them on our heads. In dust storms, we can’t go outside. They are sudden and frequent. We have to close the windows, it’s suffocating. We soak the towels and try to breathe through them. We have issues with asthma. My son has respiratory infections on a regular basis. There is limited electricity in the camp. We have power from six in the evening until four in the morning. But we need it for electric fans during the peak temperatures in the day. We used to collect water with jerry cans and had to carry it for long distances. Now, with an operational water network, things are much easier. We don’t have to fight in a long queue to get our share of water. Reported by Oliver Holmes in Jerusalem     This summer has been extreme, we went over 40C in July, which has had an average of 30C historically. For the first time, I installed AC in my house. My wife is pregnant, we simply couldn’t survive at home with the unbearable heat. We try to avoid using it because it’s not environmentally-friendly, we tried to get by with fans but we couldn’t. People who can afford to do so usually leave Tbilisi in August, to go to summer houses in one of the surrounding small villages. But because there was such heat, everybody tried to get out of the city earlier. There’s such smog, people don’t go out in the daytime anymore. The city feels empty.  My impression is that, for the last five years or even longer, it’s been getting hotter and hotter every year. It is worrying. The local government is trying to improve air pollution, but it’s targeted at the use of private vehicles. It’s not only about cars, it’s also about the people who live in the city. We need more awareness, but it seems that the issue of climate change is low priority. People are more worried about other things.

"The government’s official climate change adviser says politicians and policymakers are failing to rise to the challenge of a rapidly warming planet and will be judged harshly by future generations unless they act now. Lord Deben, chair of the UK’s Climate Change Committee (CCC), said “anyone who read the news” could see mounting evidence of alarming trends – from melting polar ice to record heatwaves and rising sea levels. He called on politicians to “make the connections” between these events and act with more urgency. “The thing that I want to bring home to policymakers is that this is increasingly urgent and that these things will be laid at your door if you don’t recognise that and act accordingly.” Deben compared the threat posed by climate change to the black death, adding: “With the black death, where one in three of the population died, we did not know how it happened, how it spread, so we were not responsible.  “With climate change we do know and so we are responsible. So it is no good saying ‘oh well, it will all work out one way or another’. We are responsible, and if we don’t take on that responsibility we are shoving it on to our children and no parent should do that in any circumstances.” Lord Deben’s intervention comes as record high temperatures are being set across much of the world, intensifying concerns about climate change. In the UK the heatwave has contributed to wildfires but environmentalists have expressed exasperation at the government’s environment policies – especially the decision to push ahead with Heathrow expansion and, on the same day, the cancellation of a huge tidal lagoon project in south Wales. Critics said it revealed that much of the governing class – including those Labour MPs who supported the government’s Heathrow expansion plans – had failed to grasp of the scale of the threat posed by climate change Lord Deben praised some politicians, including climate change minister Claire Perry, but warned there was a widespread lack of urgency. “Anybody who has been reading the newspapers will know there is a serious issue about Arctic ice, there are serious issues about Antarctic ice … the current hot period we are experiencing in Britain at the moment does remind us that we have had most of the hottest years we have had in the past 10 to 15 years. “If you add all that to the rising of the sea levels and what is happening to the permafrost, you put those things together – [you] can’t put down any one of them to this year’s global warming, but you can put all of them down together to climate change in general.” The CCC’s annual report, published last month, found the UK is on track to miss its legally binding carbon budgets in 2025 and 2030, due to lack of progress in cutting emissions from buildings and transport. It also said ministers were spurning low-cost options, such as onshore windfarms, home insulation and tree-planting, meaning people would end up paying more than needed to fight climate change. Climate scientists have warned that there would be more wildfires like the one on Saddleworth Moor across northern Europe because of climate change. Deben said that while no one individual weather event could be attributed to climate change the signs of a planet in crisis were undeniable. “This is extremely urgent because these things are now happening much more often and – in aggregate – it is clearly because of climate change.”"
"Over the course of Britain’s sweltering summer, the landlord of the building inhabited by the Observer periodically informs us that our air conditioning is undergoing an “automated controlled shutdown” because the weather has become so hot and humid that the system is at risk of damaging itself. So just when you really need cooling air, you can’t have it. One to be filed under: you couldn’t make it up. This is not uncommon. The offices, factories, homes, roads and railways of Britain were designed on the assumption that it is a country of blessedly temperate conditions, immune to extremes of heat and cold. When people say that Britain is not built to withstand a sizzling summer, this is more literally true than they may know.  We can avoid thinking about what this intense heatwave could mean for the future of the planet by taking careless refuge in the consolation that others are having it much worse. The devastating wildfires in Greece have killed at least 87 people and ignited national fury about the state’s inadequate response. Japan has declared a national disaster after more than 20,000 people were taken to hospital in a week. Algeria has reported the highest temperature ever reliably recorded in Africa: 51.3C. That’s hot. Forests are blazing within the Arctic Circle. That’s not usual. Scientists tell us to expect weird weather to become more familiar. The fiery conditions we have seen this summer are the result of the jet stream stalling, an effect caused when the poles heat up more than the equator does. There is further broad and deep scientific consensus that climate change is at the heart of it. The jet stream has been hinky in the past. The consequences are more severe this time because global warming has raised baseline global temperatures. This is a glimpse into a frazzled future, a warning every inhabitant of the third rock from the sun would be wise to heed. Extreme weather events – ferocious heatwaves, epic floods and violent storms – are going to happen with increasing frequency. The most catastrophic consequences will be felt by other, often much poorer countries, but Britain won’t be unscathed. You can’t run from climate change and you can’t hide. Not absent the ability to get to another planet suitable for human life. The question then becomes a political one: what, if anything, are we going to do about it? There is a school of thought that contends that politics is fundamentally incapable of addressing this challenge. It is just too overwhelming for politicians and electorates to handle. The problem is so complex and so global that it induces fatalism in the leaders and the led. I find this view to be self-defeating and self-harming. There are things that governments can do and they have even managed to achieve some of them. There are now days when Britain meets all its energy needs without burning any coal, something that hasn’t happened since before the Industrial Revolution and a development that would have astonished earlier generations. We produced more electricity from renewable and nuclear energy in 2017 than from gas and coal, making it the first year that low-carbon resources met most of the country’s demand for power.  That is a legacy of good decisions made by earlier governments. This is progress. It is not sufficient progress, but it does demonstrate that there are things that can be done to mitigate climate change and there are smarter responses to this threat than burying your overheated head in your sweaty hands. Political engagement has fluxed depending upon who is in charge, how much pressure there is from the public and what else is happening. It was on the agenda of Labour governments after 1997. David Cameron then positioned the Tories as a party that liked the planet. He once campaigned with the slogan “vote blue, go green”, which rather gave away that rebranding his party was his primary motive. More voters and opinion-shapers have become engaged. Witness the pressure to do something about plastics. Michael Gove’s positive response can be welcomed, even while recognising that the greening of Gove is another attempt at a rebranding, in this case of himself. The past decade has seen a compelling accumulation of frightening data about what is happening to the planet, but the world and its politicians have been distracted by other threats that seemed more immediately menacing, especially the financial crash of 2008 and subsequent austerity. George Osborne, who was blue but never green as chancellor, strangled the budget for developing carbon capture and storage. Theresa May has never been animated enough by climate change to make a major speech about it. Her government recently scrapped the Swansea Bay tidal lagoon power scheme, dashing hopes that Britain could lead development of a new source of renewable energy. Scrubbing a planet-friendly project followed the decision to press ahead with Heathrow expansion. The international picture has deteriorated. Global warming has been crowded out as a subject energising international leadership and the push to tackle the danger has lost momentum. The Paris climate agreement signed in 2016 was supposed to commit more than 170 countries to measures to hold the increase in the global average temperature to “well below” 2C above pre-industrial levels. What it lacks is any mechanism for holding the signatories to their promises and not one of the major industrialised nations has published a full and plausible strategy for meeting their targets. A growing number of the scientists of climate change fear that global warming is going to be in excess of 2C. Donald Trump, who dismisses climate change as a hoax made up by the Chinese to hurt US industry, has ripped up the commitments made by his predecessor. American withdrawal is a double disaster. The Paris agreement is much less of one without the signature of the world’s most profligate emitter of greenhouse gases. Absent a commitment from the US, other countries are likely to feel less incentive to make good on their pledges and less shame when they break them. This disappointing international picture is something to lament, but not an excuse for Britain to do nothing. We live on a windy island inhabited by a lot of clever people and surrounded by a lot of sea. With the right levels of public investment and well-targeted incentives for the private sector, this country could be a world leader in tidal and wave power. There are changes that will be simply forced on Britain as the heating planet has an increasing impact on the way we live and work. MPs on the environmental audit committee have just offered some useful, if largely remedial, suggestions. These include making buildings and transport systems more heat-resilient and using water more efficiently. Such recommendations are, of course, measures to relieve the symptoms of global warming. They do not address the causes. Stronger action will require politicians ready to drive global warming up the agenda, lead public opinion and take bold decisions, many of which will be tough and some of which will not be popular with everyone. This politicians will do only if they genuinely care about climate change or are made to care because a critical mass of their voters tell them that they want something done. The most recent British Social Attitudes survey reports that more than 90% of Britons agree that climate change is a fact, but the rub is that only around a quarter describe themselves as very worried about it and only a minority feel a responsibility to reduce it. Climate change struggles to get into the top 10 of issues that voters tell pollsters that they are most bothered about and almost never reaches the top three. This means that, while most Britons appreciate that there is a threat, not enough grasp its scale or think that it ought to be a serious priority for the government. That could change. It certainly ought to change and is more likely to change as extreme events become a more regular occurrence. Britons have been accustomed to the weather forecast coming after the news. For most of us, for most of the time, the only information we required was whether we needed to take a brolly with us. Britons may adjust their attitudes and demand a lot more leadership and action from their politicians, when the weather leads the news. • Andrew Rawnsley is an Observer columnist"
"Partly, it’s just the luck of the weather. The jet stream – the west-to-east winds that play a big role in determining Europe’s weather – has been further north than usual for about two months. A stationary high-pressure weather system has left the UK and much of continental Europe sweltering. Iceland, by contrast, has been hit with clouds and storms that would normally come further south. The jet stream’s northerly position may have been influenced by temperatures in the north of the Atlantic, which have been relatively warm in the subtropics and colder south of Greenland. “The current hot and dry spell in the UK is partly due a combination of North Atlantic ocean temperatures, climate change and the weather,” said Len Shaffrey, a professor of climate science at the University of Reading. The influence of climate change on the jet stream is still being explored. The heatwaves in the northern hemisphere are undoubtedly linked to global warming, scientists say. “There’s no question human influence on climate is playing a huge role in this heatwave,” said Prof Myles Allen, a climate scientist at the University of Oxford. On Thursday the university will publish an analysis of how much more likely climate change made Europe’s current heatwave. Similar heatwaves have happened in the past when the planet was cooler – the world was two-thirds of a degree celsius cooler in 1976, a notably hot year in the UK. But climate change made them happen more often, Allen said. Prof Peter Stott, a science fellow at the Met Office, said global warming of 1C since the industrial revolution was clearly making extreme heat more likely. “It is increasing quite significantly the risk of such a heatwave. The temperatures of 30C (86F) and above this week have gone from being a very rare occurrence to, not a frequent occurrence, but much more likely,” he said. The wide geographical spread of the heatwave, right across four continents, also points to global warming as the culprit. “That pattern is something we wouldn’t be seeing without climate change,” Stott said. Britons are only somewhat worried about climate change, according to the British Social Attitudes tracker. Wildfires, such as those that have occurred recently in northern England, are one reason to be more concerned. “The moorland fires is an example of an impact that comes with such prolonged heatwaves,” Stott said. Older people are vulnerable to extremes of heat, with 20,000 people believed to have died across Europe in the 2003 heatwave. Transport infrastructure suffers, with rail lines buckling. The other major short-term impact is on agriculture. Shaffrey said the hot, dry spell was wreaking havoc on farming. Heatwaves in other countries will probably cut yields of crops that the UK imports, pushing up prices. Longer-term, the green and pleasant landscape of the UK may vanish if rainfall patterns change because of global warming. “People might like a Mediterranean climate but it will be very different. For wildlife, a change of that magnitude could be very traumatic because it has nowhere to go,” said Allen. Yes. “It’s a warning of what we will have to deal with,” said Stott. Michael Mann, a US climate scientist, tweeted: “What we call an ‘extreme heatwave’ today we will simply call ‘summer’ in a matter of decades if we do not sharply reduce carbon emissions.”"
"Rising temperatures are linked to increasing rates of suicide, according to a large new study. The researchers warn that the impact of climate change on suicides may be as significant as economic recessions, which are known to increase rates of self-harm. The links between mental health and global warming have not been widely researched but the new work analysed temperature and suicides across the US and Mexico in recent decades. It found that the rate of suicide rose by 0.7% in the US and by 2.1% in Mexico when the average monthly temperature rose by 1C.  The analysis was done at county level and took into account seasonal variation, levels of poverty and even the news of celebrity suicides that can lead to more deaths. The scientists found that hotter periods resulted in more suicides irrespective of wealth and the usual climate of the area. “Determining whether or not the rate of suicide responds to climatic conditions is important, as suicide alone causes more deaths globally than all forms of violence combined and is among the top 10–15 causes of death globally,” said Prof Marshall Burke, at Stanford University in the US, and his colleagues, who published their research in the journal Nature Climate Change. “Even modest changes in suicide rates due to climate change could [lead to] large changes in the associated global health burden, particularly in wealthier countries where current suicide rates are relatively high,” the researchers said. Record high temperatures have been recorded around the world in recent weeks and are likely to have been driven by climate change. This kind of study cannot prove a causal link between rising temperature and more suicides. But the results show “remarkable consistency” over time and in many different places, according to the scientists. It is also supported by recent research that linked climate change to 60,000 suicides in India in the last three decades.  The researchers also analysed more than 600m messages on Twitter and found that the use of depressive words, such as alone, bleak, lonely and trapped, increased as temperatures rose. “This further suggests that mental wellbeing deteriorates during warmer periods,” said the scientists. One possible way in which this might happen is that when the body cools itself during warmer conditions, the blood flow to the brain is altered. If current carbon emissions are not curbed, the scientists estimated that between 9,000 and 40,000 additional suicides could be expected by 2050 in the US and Canada due to climate change. That number of deaths is significantly more than would be expected from a 1% rise in unemployment due to an economic recession, the researchers said. Other research has already clearly shown that rising heat increases violence between people. • In the UK, the Samaritans can be contacted on 116 123. In the US, the National Suicide Prevention Hotline is 1-800-273-8255. In Australia, the crisis support service Lifeline is on 13 11 14. Hotlines in other countries can be found here."
"Blaming China for climate change is a clearcut case of “yellow peril” hysteria (Letters, 12 July). On average, a person in China consumes less than half of the emissions of a person in the US (7.2 tonnes per capita annually compared with 16.5 tonnes). So why all the finger-wagging at China? There’s a blatant mistake recurring in carbon politics. Yes, as a nation, China emits the most carbon dioxide, but an astronomical volume of these emissions are to manufacture our goods in the west. Is it fair to maintain a voracious level of consumption in the US and UK while blaming China for producing the goods that we’re consuming? Don’t look at emissions in isolation. Look at them in tandem with consumption, and then we’ll see where to place the burden of blame. Also, China’s investments in renewables have caused the costs to plummet, from which the entire world can now benefit. China invests more than $100bn in domestic renewables every year – more than twice the level of the US, and more than the US and the EU combined.Marcus NieldClimate Change Adaptation Unit, UN Environment, Nairobi, Kenya • Your article (23 July) accurately sums up the excellent work done by the Global Footprint Network regarding our depletion of the planet’s ability to support us. What, unlike GFN themselves, the article did not acknowledge is that the number of people consuming those resources is a critical, if not the critical, driver of the unfolding crisis. In 1970, our global population was less than half of the 7.6 billion we have presently. In 1970, Earth Overshoot Day fell on the 29 December: in 2018, on 1 August. Can anyone credibly claim that those two changes are not linked?  Population is a solvable problem – family planning, lifting people out of poverty, education, empowering women and challenging cultural norms opposing small family size are vital, positive mechanisms to bring our human footprint back in line with with what our only home can sustainably provide.

"A British professional football club that is powered by renewable energy and serves vegan food to players, staff and fans has received a prestigious United Nations certification. Forest Green Rovers, which plays in League Two, announced on Monday that it has become the world’s first UN certified carbon-neutral football club.  Based in the Gloucestershire town of Nailsworth, the club has signed up for a United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) initiative called Climate Neutral Now for the 2018-19 season. FGR’s green credentials have been attracting attention around the world for several years. It claims to be the first vegan football club in the world after receiving the vegan trademark from the Vegan Society. The club says it became vegan because of the “huge environmental and animal welfare impacts of livestock farming”, as well as to improve player performance and give fans healthier, tastier food on match days. FGR is powered by 100% green energy from Ecotricity – the company founded by the club’s chairman, Dale Vince – some of which is generated by the solar panels on the stadium roof. The team plays on an organic pitch, which is cut by a solar-powered robot lawnmower, and all rainwater that falls on the stands or on the pitch is recycled to minimise the club’s use of mains water. FGR has electric car charging facilities at the stadium, to encourage fans to travel to games sustainably. FGR was promoted to the Football League for the first time in the club’s 129-year history last year and will start its second season in League Two – the fourth tier of professional football in England – next month."
"It was just another moment in this long, increasingly strange summer. I was on a train home from Paddington station, and the carriage’s air-conditioning was just about fighting off the heat outside. Most people seemed to be staring at their phones – in many cases, they were trying to stream a World Cup match, as the 4G signal came and went, and Great Western Railway’s onboard wifi proved to be maddeningly erratic. The trebly chatter of headphone leakage was constant. And thousands of miles and a few time zones away in Loudoun County, Virginia, one of the world’s largest concentrations of computing power was playing its part in keeping everything I saw ticking over, as data from around the world passed back and forth from its vast buildings. Most of us communicate with this small and wealthy corner of the US every day. Thanks to a combination of factors – its proximity to Washington DC, competitive electricity prices, and its low susceptibility to natural disasters – the county is the home of data centres used by about 3,000 tech companies: huge agglomerations of circuitry, cables and cooling systems that sit in corners of the world most of us rarely see, but that are now at the core of how we live. About 70% of the world’s online traffic is reckoned to pass through Loudoun County.  But there is a big problem, centred on a power company called Dominion, which supplies the vast majority of Loudoun County’s electricity. According to a 2017 Greenpeace report, only 1% of Dominion’s total electricity comes from credibly renewable sources: 2% originates in hydroelectric plants, and the rest is split evenly between coal, gas and nuclear power. Dominion is also in the middle of a huge regional controversy about a proposed pipeline that will carry fracked gas to its power plants, which it says is partly driven by data centres’ insatiable appetite for electricity. Clearly, then, the video streams, digital photographs and messaging that pour out of all those servers come with a price. I was reminded of all this by the recently published book New Dark Age, by the British writer James Bridle. He cites a study in Japan that suggests that by 2030, the power requirements of digital services will outstrip the nation’s entire current generation capacity. He quotes an American report from 2013 – ironically enough, commissioned by coal industry lobbyists – that pointed out that using either a tablet or smartphone to wirelessly watch an hour of video a week used roughly the same amount of electricity (largely consumed at the data-centre end of the process) as two new domestic fridges. If you worry about climate change and a cause celebre such as the expansion of Heathrow airport, it is worth considering that data centres are set to soon have a bigger carbon footprint than the entire aviation industry. Yet as Bridle points out, even that statistic doesn’t quite do justice to some huge potential problems. He mentions the vast amounts of electricity consumed by the operations of the online currency Bitcoin – which, at the height of the speculative frenzies earlier this year, was set to produce an annual amount of carbon dioxide equivalent to 1m transatlantic flights. And he’s anxious about what will happen next: “In response to vast increases in data storage and computational capacity in the last decade, the amount of energy used by data centres has doubled every four years, and is expected to triple in the next 10 years.” These changes are partly being driven by the so-called internet of things: the increasing array of everyday devices – from TVs, through domestic security devices, to lighting systems, and countless modes of transport – that constantly emit and receive data. If driverless cars ever arrive in our lives, those same flows will increase hugely. At the same time, the accelerating rollout of the internet and its associated technologies in the developing world will add to the load.  About a decade ago, we were being told to fight climate change by switching off our TVs and stereos. If the battle is now even more urgent, how does it fit with a world in which router lights constantly flicker, and all the devices we own will be in constant, energy-intensive communication with distant mega-computers? But some good news. Whatever its other ethical contortions, Silicon Valley has an environmental conscience. Facebook has pledged to, sooner or later, power its operations using “100% clean and renewable energy”. Google says it has already achieved that goal. So does Apple. Yet even if you factor in efficiency improvements, beneath many of these claims lies a reality in which the vast and constant demand for power means such companies inevitably use energy generated by fossil fuels, and then atone for it using the often questionable practice of carbon offsetting. And among the big tech corporations, there is one big focus of worry: Amazon, whose ever-expanding cloud computing wing, Amazon Web Services, offers “the on-demand delivery of computer power, database storage … and other IT resources” and provides most of the computing power behind Netflix. This sits at the heart of data centres’ relentless expansion. Green campaigners bemoan the fact that the details of AWS’s electricity consumption and its carbon footprint remain under wraps; on its corporate website, the story of its use of renewable energy suddenly stops in 2016. Besides, for all their power, even the most enlightened US giants obviously command only part of a global industry. To quote from that Greenpeace report: “Among emerging Chinese internet giants such as Baidu, Tencent and Alibaba, the silence on energy performance still remains. Neither the public nor customers are able to obtain any information about their electricity use and CO2 target.” Irrespective of the good work carried out by some tech giants, and whether or not you take seriously projections that the entire communication technology industry could account for up to 14% of carbon emissions by 2040, one stark fact remains: the vast majority of electricity used in the world’s data centres comes from non-renewable sources, and as their numbers rapidly increase, there are no guarantees that this will change. On the fringes of the industry, a few voices have been heard describing the kind of future at which most of us – expecting everything streamed as a right – would balk. They talk about eventually rationing internet use, insisting that people send black and white images, or forcibly pushing them away from binge-streaming videos. Their basic point, it seems, chimes with those occasions when the smartphone in your pocket starts to suddenly heat up: a metaphor for our warming planet, and the fact that even the most well-intentioned corporations may yet find that their supposedly unlimited digital delights are, in the dictionary definition of the term, unsustainable. • John Harris is a Guardian columnist"

"The UK’s historic churches are at serious risk from the impact of climate change, including higher levels of rainfall and invasive pests such as termites, according to the National Churches Trust. Roofs, towers and spires are threatened by strong winds and more frequent storms. The trust saw a 26% year-on-year increase in applications for grants for urgent repairs, maintenance and development projects in 2017, its annual review says.  A total of 480 churches and chapels around the country sought financial help from the trust, which awarded 230 grants worth £1.7m – an increase of £300,000 compared with 2016. Claire Walker, the trust’s chief executive, said many church buildings had reached a tipping point due to the combined impact of climate change, cuts to Heritage Lottery Fund grants and the end of the government-funded roof repair scheme for listed places of worship. “The intensity of extreme weather patterns, including heavier rainfalls and storms, is putting church gutters and drains under strain, and systems designed in the past cannot cope,” she said. “Looking to the future, the impact of climate change could have a serious impact on the UK’s historic churches. Higher levels of rainfall in the UK, such as the 20% increase seen in Scotland since the 1960s, with more cycles of wetting and drying, will cause damage to timber and stonework. Stronger winds and more frequent storms will threaten roofs, towers and spires. “Climate change is also making the UK ever more vulnerable to invasive pests. The biggest danger for church buildings would be from termites, which are now widespread in France, with infestations being found close to the Channel coast.” Termites can cause extensive damage to structural timber. The pests excavate it from the inside, leaving a thin skin of unharmed wood which can conceal the damage being caused. The only colony of termites known to have become established in the UK was found in south Devon in the 1990s. It was eliminated after years of action by government agencies. Among the churches awarded grants by the trust last year were St Botolph’s in Boston, Lincolnshire, a Grade I-listed building and the UK’s largest parish church, which received £40,000 for roof repairs. The Grade II-listed St David’s Old Church in Llanwrtyd, Wales, which has a recorded history spanning more than 1,000 years, received £20,000 from the trust for urgent repairs to stonework and gutters."
"The extreme heatwaves and wildfires wreaking havoc around the globe are “the face of climate change,” one of the world’s leading climate scientists has declared, with the impacts of global warming now “playing out in real time.” Climate change has long been predicted to increase extreme weather incidents, and scientists are now confident these predictions are coming true. Scientists say the global warming has contributed to the scorching temperatures that have baked the UK and northern Europe for weeks. The hot spell was made more than twice as likely by climate change, a new analysis found, demonstrating an “unambiguous” link.  Extreme weather has struck across Europe, from the Arctic Circle to Greece, and across the world, from North America to Japan. “This is the face of climate change,” said Prof Michael Mann, at Penn State University, and one the world’s most eminent climate scientists. “We literally would not have seen these extremes in the absence of climate change.” “The impacts of climate change are no longer subtle,” he told the Guardian. “We are seeing them play out in real time and what is happening this summer is a perfect example of that.” “We are seeing our predictions come true,” he said. “As a scientist that is reassuring, but as a citizen of planet Earth, it is very distressing to see that as it means we have not taken the necessary action.” The rapid scientific assessment of the northern European heatwave was done by Geert Jan van Oldenborgh, at the Royal Netherlands Meteorological Institute and also colleagues in the World Weather Attribution (WWA) consortium. “We can see the fingerprints of climate change on local extremes,” he said. The current heatwave has been caused by an extraordinary stalling of the jet stream wind, which usually funnels cool Atlantic weather over the continent. This has left hot, dry air in place for two months – far longer than usual. The stalling of the northern hemisphere jet stream is being increasingly firmly linked to global warming, in particular to the rapid heating of the Arctic and resulting loss of sea ice. Prof Mann said that asking if climate change “causes” specific events is the wrong question: “The relevant question is: ‘Is climate change impacting these events and making them more extreme?’, and we can say with great confidence that it is.” Mann points out that the link between smoking tobacco and lung cancer is a statistical one, which does not prove every cancer was caused by smoking, but epidemiologists know that smoking greatly increases the risk. “That is enough to say that, for all practical purposes, there is a causal connection between smoking cigarettes and lung cancer and it is the same with climate change,” Mann said. Other senior scientists agree the link is clear. Serious climate change is “unfolding before our eyes”, said Prof Rowan Sutton, at the University of Reading. “No one should be in the slightest surprised that we are seeing very serious heatwaves and associated impacts in many parts of the world.” It is not too late to make the significant cuts needed in greenhouse gas emissions, said Mann, because the impacts progressively worsen as global warming increases.  “It is not going off a cliff, it is like walking out into a minefield,” he said. “So the argument it is too late to do something would be like saying: ‘I’m just going to keep walking’. That would be absurd – you reverse course and get off that minefield as quick as you can. It is really a question of how bad it is going to get.”"
"Just like this year’s, the heatwave in 1976 arrived as Britain seemed to be approaching an economic and political abyss. During the spring and early summer, as the sun began to hammer down and the usual rain failed to fall, and the reservoirs began to shrink, the pound was lurching downwards on the markets. For almost three years, under Tory and Labour governments, the economy had been shrivelling alarmingly. Just as since the Brexit vote, a conviction had been building like a thundercloud among financial traders and business leaders, economists and commentators, in Britain and beyond, that the country was about to slip to a lower, less elite level, and stay there. “Goodbye, Great Britain,” said a much-read editorial in the Wall Street Journal in 1975, “it was nice knowing you.” If you remember the British summer of 1976 we'd like to hear from you.

To some pessimists about Britain’s prospects, the drought the following summer, which brought forest fires, crop failures, hosepipe bans enforced by policemen and vigilantes, and standpipes on street corners instead of mains water, was a further sign of crisis. In 1976, with impeccable timing, the American writer Paul Theroux published The Family Arsenal, a bleakly satirical novel about terrorists on the loose in a sweaty, rundown mid-70s London, its “decay pushing towards ruin”. Some sort of apocalypse, predicted one of the characters, was “certainly coming”. But the Labour chancellor, Denis Healey, was not one of the worriers. In the summer of 1976, after several exhausting months trying to defend his economic policies and the value of the pound, he went on holiday for most of August. He left sticky London behind and drove unhurriedly through England and Wales and up to north-west Scotland. “Not a drop of rain,” he wrote in his memoirs, “even in the Highlands.” In the hidden away lochside town of Ullapool, Healey checked into a hotel on the quayside and began to relax. That night, he was repeatedly woken by phone calls from Whitehall. In the US currency markets, the pound was collapsing again. The hotel had only one phone, so the chancellor stood in a hallway with a coat over his pyjamas, authorising the Bank of England to spend “up to $150m” (about £750m now) to buy sterling. The intervention worked: the pound stopped falling. Healey went back to bed, and then continued with his holiday. Hot weather does contradictory things to British politics. In parliament, with its stuffy rooms and sweaty dress codes, it traditionally sparks revolts, plots, panics and flashes of temper – a sense that things are coming to a head – as it has this summer. Yet away from Westminster, a heatwave can make politicians, and even more so voters, worry less than usual about the state of the nation. In an overcast country, sunshine often means contentment and escapism – and procrastination. During July and August 1976, despite the state of the economy and a widespread disillusionment with centre-left politics (which had been deepening since the late 60s), the Labour government pulled level with the Conservatives in the polls. Healey was generally seen as a tough, capable chancellor. The prime minister, Jim Callaghan, had an avuncular, calming manner that seemed appropriate to the summer lull. Voters called him Sunny Jim. Theresa May has none of Callaghan’s sly charm. But her situation this summer is similar in some ways. As in 1976, a divided government in a weak parliamentary position, wedded to increasingly contested ideas – for Callaghan, postwar social democracy, for May, austerity and the free market – has somehow made it to the welcome shade of the recess, despite many predictions to the contrary. The main opposition party remains ominously strong, but it has an intensely divisive leader whom many voters see as odd and extremist: in this sense, Margaret Thatcher was the Jeremy Corbyn of the mid-70s. And, just as Callaghan did, May has managed to put off the most difficult political question of her government until the autumn. In 1976, this was whether Britain could afford to continue with its postwar levels of state spending; now it is how to do Brexit. Yet during what might be a once-in-a-generation summer – as the sun keeps shining, day after day, and the parks are full of impromptu skivers, the pubs are full of workers having cheeky afternoon lagers, and even supposedly earnest protest marches feel more like carnivals – such national dilemmas can feel very distant. In the summer of 1976, the sense of ease was not a total delusion. Twenty-eight years later, the respected New Economics Foundation created a measure for overall economic, social and environmental wellbeing, and concluded that 1976 was the best year in modern British history. For those invested in the idea that the 70s were a nadir for Britain – pro-Thatcher historians, and hipper archivists of the punk rebellion against the mid-70s status quo – the summer of 1976 has always been an awkward piece of counter-evidence. Yet as Jon Savage pointed out in his 1991 book England’s Dreaming, still the best, most nuanced study of punk and its political and social context, the heatwave actually helped the movement. After dark, the rare warmth gave the first British punks a sense of possibility, and a freedom, as they roamed between squats and nightclubs. In a normal British summer, it would have been hard to stay out all night in punk outfits full of holes. The summer of 2018 feels less carefree. We know more about climate change and skin cancer now. This week, forecast to be the hottest of the season, the Met Office is advising people to stay out of the sun. And the world beyond Britain feels more genuinely apocalyptic, and harder to ignore. We face Trump and a Europe increasingly controlled by far-right populists; in the summer of 1976, the continent was dominated by centrists, and the insurgent shaking up US politics was a mild, almost meek Democrat, Jimmy Carter. Even the cold war seemed to be abating, thanks to the disarmament treaties and subtle diplomacy of detente. But we shouldn’t idealise the summer of 1976 too much. Away from its unexpected pleasures, pressures were still building in Britain. In August the guitarist Eric Clapton near the peak of his fame, used a concert in Birmingham to make a speech defending the anti-immigrant prejudices of Enoch Powell. At the end of the month, the Notting Hill carnival in London turned into a battle between the police and black youths, a prefiguring of the many riots in the decade to come. Also in late August the heatwave finally disintegrated in a mess of thunderstorms. A soaking, grey autumn followed. The pound resumed its decline, the government’s finances deteriorated further, Whitehall panicked – or, some say, exploited the situation – and the government ended up drastically cutting its spending, and accepting a loan from the IMF. The reputations of Healey and Callaghan, their government, and postwar social democracy, never quite recovered. Once the summer interlude of 1976 was over, Britain changed very fast – and in many ways not for the good. Perhaps that’s something for Theresa May, and the rest of us, to ponder while we enjoy the sun. • Andy Beckett is a feature writer for the Guardian"
"A new report by Richard Jones and James Wilsdon invites us to question the biomedical bubble - the slow but steady concentration of research and development (R&D) resources in the hands of biomedical science. A provocative case, it’s already generated some discussion. Here, I want to pick up a point that might be easily missed amongst fights over the role of biomedicine: the all-too-small amount of resource being put towards decarbonising energy.  As the Nesta report points out, we’ve seen changing priorities for UK research over the last 25 years. Defence-related R&D fell by more than half between 1995 and 2015, to 16%. Health-related research was a key beneficiary of this ‘peace dividend’, now accounting for just under a quarter of total expenditure. In contrast, research into energy received only 2.5% of the pot in 2015. Like Jones and Wilsdon, I don’t want to argue against health R&D. It’s clearly a major priority. But decarbonising our energy system must also be another, especially in the rapidly-closing window of opportunity we have to avoid catastrophic global warming. Tackling climate change is, in all seriousness, the fight of our lives (the word “moonshot” doesn’t cover the half of it). Of course, dealing with climate change isn’t just about R&D. Indeed, it can feel silly to be talking about how the UK should invest more in low carbon innovation when there is currently a ban on something as basic as onshore wind (a British innovation of the 1880s). There were, for example, some wonderfully warm words from energy minister Claire Perry about the Q-Bot insulation robot at the Parliamentary Sustainable Energy Group conference last week. But it did also feel like a distraction from last month’s Committee on Climate Change report, which criticised the government’s “shocking” lack of action when it comes to simple and low cost options like onshore wind, home insulation and planting trees. We also need to invest in infrastructure and public engagement with low carbon technology if we’re going to make the transition to those technologies happen, and happen fairly. We should be wary of assuming the private sector is going to be sufficient here, just as we should be wary of assuming it can pick up the bill for innovation, or regulate itself (or that crowdfunding or community energy - though powerful levers for change - are enough).  The rise of electric cars is a good example. Like many low carbon technologies, these may well prove to be unstoppable - to use a term favoured by climate action evangelists - but it’s hard to see how the market acting alone will be anywhere near fast enough, or evenly distributed. Elon Musk fans might be one part of the puzzle, but the shiny innovation fairy - powerful as she is - shouldn’t distract us from any of the other vital work required.  It’s a good time to start worrying about UK R&D though. As Jones and Wilsdon’s timely report emphasises, how we fund UK R&D is about to shift, and with that comes opportunities. Earlier this year, the PM announced the government aims to invest 2.4% of GDP in R&D by 2027, up from its current level of 1.7%. We’ve also seen our cohort of research councils - currently split loosely by discipline into medicine, physics, earth science etc - brought together with Innovate UK into a new larger body, UK Research and Innovation, with a combined budget of more than £6.5 bn. It’s a shift that many people working in universities seem obsessed with - complete with its own parody twitter account - but few people outside the research bubble seem to have noticed. If you’re interested in UK politics, you should be interested in what we spend on R&D. 2.4% of our economy is no small change. There’s a hackneyed old CP Snow line about scientists having the future in their bones, but the future is far too important to leave to such a small (and, let’s admit it, rather closed) community. So it surprises me that there isn’t more complaint from the climate movement when it comes to issues like the makeup of the UKRI board. Not only is it dominated by biomedicine, but two of its 16 members - Alice Gast and John Browne - have direct links to the fossil fuel industry. There are some impressive names on that board, but if we’re talking about people with “future in their bones”, I’m not convinced the future they are brewing is a low carbon one. Maybe in time for the government’s “Green Great Britain” week in October we might hope to see some climate leadership coming out of UKRI?

"In a tragicomic photograph to be found on the internet, a hydrogen balloon lies sideways on the sea ice, somewhere north of Svalbard. Still inflated, it clings to its spherical dignity, while the ropes that connect it to its upended basket describe elegant catenaries. It is a dark silhouette against a horizonless surround, in which the white ice of the foreground grades into a lightly greying sky. The two men posing by the basket and the one behind the camera don’t have long to live. They will make it across the ice back to land but, with inadequate provisions and equipment, will die there. It will take some decades before their remains and their camera are found. Such was the fate of the 1897 expedition, brave to the point of idiocy, in which the Swede SA Andrée tried to fly to the north pole. He used a steering system that was almost certain not to work, and he set off in his newly made balloon without final checks for leaks.  Andrée was driven by national pride, a desire to prove the virility of Sweden. In this he was not alone. In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, urged on by excitable press coverage, explorers risked their lives to prove their own and their nations’ superiority. Two different Americans, Frederick Cook in 1908 and Robert Peary in 1909, said they were the first to reach the pole, and in 1926 another, Richard Byrd, claimed he was the first to fly there. All their claims have since been cast in doubt. In the 1920s Mussolini used the airship exploits of the Italian Umberto Nobile to promote his regime. When Nobile went missing in 1928 the great Norwegian Roald Amundsen, although he didn’t care for fascism, would die in the internationally publicised race to find him. The Arctic can have this effect on people: its function in the imagination of the world is as a place to test or define, to look for some truth about existence by viewing it from its limit. The challenge of its otherness might explain why Mary Shelley chose to open Frankenstein in the Arctic wastes, and why the Soviets built the showcase coalmining town of Pyramiden more grandly and formally than its function required. Now the significance of the Arctic is above all about climate change, its effects there being particularly visible, significant and dangerous. The belief that the Arctic has something to tell us motivates the Arctic Circle residency, a programme whereby artists, scientists and writers can, for half the actual cost, take part in expeditions aboard a tall sailing ship, around the coasts and islands of Svalbard. Feeling the need for new perspectives on life, I applied – and in early June joined 28 other participants, plus guides and crew, on the three-masted barquentine Antigua. Two weeks without night or internet, ignorant of World Cup results and the latest Trump eruptions, voyaging between 78 and 81 degrees north, going where the wind suggested, marvelling at glaciers in shades of blue beyond the power of words or cameras to capture – cobalt? cerulean? sapphire? “Are you going to find yourself,” teased a friend, “under an iceberg?” There is an element of the mythical about Svalbard. Its mention can draw blank looks, except from readers of Philip Pullman who know it as the land of armoured bears but who still don’t know much about the nonfictional version. It is better known as Spitsbergen, the name given by the Dutch navigator Willem Barents when he discovered it in 1596, more than a century after Columbus reached America. Norwegian patriotism led to its renaming in the 20th century: through the optimistic reading of an ambiguous medieval account, it was decided that the Vikings had got there first and called it Svalbard. It is, in any case, an archipelago far north of Norway, a bit smaller than Scotland, the last bit of Europe before the north pole. The name Spitsbergen is still applied to its largest island. Svalbard’s shape on a map, a splat of kelp upon a rock, may be the least familiar in Europe. It occupies the zone where Mercator’s and other projections dissolve into absurdity, with Svalbard becoming either nonsensically big or weirdly distorted, sometimes getting left out altogether. On globes it can disappear beneath the black plastic cap that holds the object in place. An azimuthal projection, the kind that puts the north pole at the centre of concentric circles of latitude, reveals it to have more to do with the cold family of Arctic lands – Greenland, the islands of north Russia and Canada – than with the European mainland. Human history has a shallow grip on Svalbard. Before Barents (or those Vikings) arrived, there were no indigenous populations, no equivalent of Inuit in north America, nobody at all. It wasn’t until the 20th century that people started living there permanently, and such life has been extreme, framed by tales of endurance and danger: explorers stuck in the ice through long winters, stranded travellers surviving in snow holes for months, whalers taking insane risks in pursuit of profit, the appalling working conditions and mortality rates of miners. Animal and plant life, too, looks like something that could easily be scraped off the surface of the land. Springy moss, purple and yellow saxifrage, and a type of buttercup stay within centimetres of the ground. There are no trees, except for low, flat willow and birch that take decades to reach the size of dinner plates. There are no butterflies or bees. Whereas the polar sea is abundant in life, vertebrate species on land are few, if memorable: polar bears, arctic fox, reindeer, ptarmigan. Instead there is naked geology, exemplary sedimentary mountains whose layers were formed by hundreds of millions of years of shifting land and sea, back to a time when what is now Svalbard was located south of the equator. On one edge, where plate movements pressed it against what is now Greenland, they twist and buckle. Elsewhere equally exemplary igneous rocks, formed in intense heat and pressure in the earlier history of the planet, create the hard, spiky skylines that gave Spitsbergen (“pointed mountains”) its name. Formations that in other lands would be worth a journey by themselves are here commonplace. They are unforgiving, even tedious, in their sterile magnificence. Animation comes from the clarity, luminosity and subtle alterations of the famous Arctic light. Because the light reflects in all directions off snow and ice, and because sunshine comes (especially around midnight) at a low angle, you are suspended in it. At the same hour, when the shadows deepen and when a light meter would register a lowering of levels but all still looks dazzling, there is a bright-dark quality comparable to that of a solar eclipse. Along with rock and light, the landscape is made of four other elements – ice, snow, cloud and water – all, of course, variants of the same substance. Their changes and interactions are infinite. You know them underfoot, hard or collapsing, as well as by sight. Above all, there are the glaciers, one after another, covering much of Svalbard, crackling and growling with their internal forces, crumbling into pillars and pinnacles with the unsteady and unlikely beauty of the about-to-collapse. One in particular, the currently surging glacier of Wahlenbergbreen, resembles an army of orks, ranks of ugly upright giants marching to their collapse into the sea, where they will turn into glistening floating ornaments, whose cute technical name is “bergy bits”. You see clearly that everything is in inorganic motion, if at different speeds – waves, ice, strata, continental plates, weather. There are similarities of patterns: a field of moss looks like a mountain range, ice floes drift like clouds, glacier ice behaves like rock, only speeded up. All landscapes are temporary, as the architect Cedric Price said of buildings, but some are more temporary than others. The Arctic’s absence of measures like trees and houses makes it hard to read the scale of a glacier – 100ft high? 400ft? More? Dry haze-less air makes distance inscrutable, removing the aerial perspective that helps us read depth. The sun’s 24-hour, 360-degree path messes with time and orientation. It is otherworldly. It is a sketch of another planet. It is not greatly bothered about human presence, even though human presence has the potential to be devastating: whatever the poltroons who deny it might say, this ice is indeed retreating and, quite apart from its effects when it turns up in melted form in a town or field near you, a world of beauty will be destroyed. So there we were, a group of strangers collectively categorised as creative, industriously trying to make sense of it all. We were mostly from the anglosphere – Canadians, Americans, British, Australians – with a Peruvian and a Norwegian. The guides and crew, some of them artists and writers themselves, some former participants in the residency who liked Svalbard so much that they came back, were part of the collective exploratory society. “Don’t get eaten by a polar bear” was common advice before I left, but Other People were scarier. What if we couldn’t stand each other, on this vessel alone on icy seas? Agatha Christie would have loved the scenario: a confined space, multiple personal histories, several ways to die. It didn’t seem auspicious that my allocated cabin-mate greeted me with a box of earplugs and the warning that he snores. But I slept, partly by imagining that his occasional rumblings were the sounds of glaciers or walruses. Collectively we participants got along well, not only because it was clearly dumb not to, but also because this was a group of likable and dedicated people. There were irritations, to be sure, and occasional outbreaks of what might be considered madness, but the overwhelming experience was the pleasure of encountering people we wouldn’t have met otherwise, and making lasting friendships. We were conscious of a precedent – in 2005 a group called Cape Farewell organised a residency in Svalbard that included Ian McEwan and Antony Gormley, that formed the basis of McEwan’s novel Solar. We were a less starry bunch but possibly we had a better time, not least because they went in the harsh month of March. It helped that we were lucky with wildlife – two blue whales within an hour of leaving port, six bears in three sightings, an extended viewing of an ugly of walruses, plus seals, arctic fox, reindeer and an array of birds. (And, yes, according to some contested sources an “ugly” is a collective noun for those large brown sea beasts.) If it would be nice to tell daring tales of narrow escapes but the truth is that dangerous places have to be highly managed. On land, you can’t leave the protection of the guides, who are armed with rifles as a last resort against polar bears (although there was a mildly alarming moment involving a grounded boat and a curious bear). You could swim in the extremely cold water or go up the ship’s foremast in a safety harness, but these are hardly epic adventures. Rather, we busied ourselves with our personal attempts to respond to the Arctic. Two artists, Adam Kuby from Portland Oregon and Shohei Katayama from Pittsburg, collaborated on filling a crack in ice with gold-coloured fabric and photographed it. Emma Hoette, one of the crew, who is currently studying at the Laban centre in London, reprised a performance where she sits on a cold rock, naked but for a woollen neck warmer that she slowly unravels. Philip Kanwischer, from Calgary, made a digitally altered photograph of our anxieties: that curious bear multiplied several times over. All had to observe the same rule: you may leave nothing behind on the islands and beaches and take nothing away. Any manmade objects that might be older than 1946 – barrel hoops, shoes, broken bottles — are designated as cultural artefacts and must not be touched. Writers took notes for future poems and essays. I read an account of the 1873 expedition of the explorer Benjamin Leigh Smith, who happens to have been my great-great-great uncle, and traced the intersections of his routes with ours. In Mosselbukta, where he found a Swedish expedition that had spent the Arctic winter trapped by ice, I saw the ruins of a flatpacked house these pre-Ikea Swedes had built. It later collapsed; its timbers are miraculously preserved by the dry, cold air. As a writer on architecture, I had imagined that the appeal of the Arctic would include its lack of my usual subject matter, but there are buildings there too, all the more poignant for their survival in hostile places. There are the structures of coalmining, mineheads perched on near-cliffs and long-legged conveyor systems that recall the inventions of HG Wells or the Walking Cities of the 1960s architectural group Archigram. There are trappers’ huts, researchers’ cabins and tiny refuges for travellers, all solitary specks in the vast landscape. There is the steel mast from which in 1926 Raoul Amundsen and Umberto Nobile, at that point collaborating with each other, flew in an airship to the north pole. These structures are to the point. They waste no energy. They combine flimsy-looking tarpaper with oversized driftwood because that is what is to hand. It would be lost effort to cut up the wood into more proportionate pieces. Decorated at most with reindeer antlers or a bear’s jawbone, they have the striking aesthetic of buildings that don’t have time for aesthetics, their unusual asymmetries of lightness and mass being responses to unusual conditions. The same cannot be said of Pyramiden, a piece of the Soviet Union on foreign soil, made possible by international treaty that gives certain countries additional to Norway rights to Svalbard. It is now a frigid modern Pompeii, where guided tours can visit the dead 1990s house plants, the idle kitchen equipment, the northernmost grand piano and the increasingly quaint office machines that were left behind when, following the collapse of the Soviet Union and with it the withdrawal of the town’s state support, Pyramiden was abandoned. The black coal fields, striking after all that pure ice, are apocalyptic. In its 1970s heyday it was an exhibition town, a sought-after posting for Soviet citizens, with model apartment buildings and the world’s northernmost bust of Lenin gazing down an avenue nicknamed the Champs Élysées. It has the only turf in Svalbard, imported from the Ukraine, on which the only dandelions sometimes flower. It has a shed where strawberries were grown. Its buildings are higher than anywhere else in the archipelago, and its mining structures more elaborate and massive – as much to make them impressive as out of necessity. As an exercise in pitting man against nature, with the associated effects of hubris, it has something in common with the Swedish balloon. Svalbard architecture exposes with special lucidity the heroism and foibles of human life, which is what the Arctic does more generally. It doesn’t give a damn about us. If it could have a preference, it would want us dead. But its very implacability makes us want to read ourselves in it and enables us to do so. The message of those sedimentary mountains is that, over a scale of tens of millions of years, nature will probably shrug off whatever monstrosities we inflict on it, as it has previous catastrophes like meteorites and volcanic explosions, but that will be much too late for us. This realisation makes climate change more urgent, not less. We made this problem and it is down to us to fix it. There is no one and nothing else to help us. It’s a little preposterous to seek the meaning of the Arctic, but if it has one it’s in what it reflects. One of the strangest sights was, after 10 days’ sailing, of a man we hadn’t met before. Wonders included the rediscovery, over a return via Oslo airport to Britain, of crowds, summer warmth, trees, trucks, streetlamps, passwords, football results and new Trump eruptions much like the old ones, of a snail trail and a mulberry bush in the garden. Some of these things seemed inconsequential, some repulsive, some precious. A possibly obvious truth was vividly reinforced, which is that there is no fundamental reason why any of them are here. We’d miss them, some of them, if they weren’t. This article was amended on 29 July 2018 to add the name of an artist."
"Burlington in Vermont has already given the world Ben & Jerry’s ice cream and provided the political launchpad for Bernie Sanders. Now the city’s successful switch to 100% renewable electricity is spurring US mayors to fill the gaping void on climate change action left by the Trump administration. Burlington didn’t make a fuss when it switched on a new hydropower plant in late 2014 and became the first US city to run entirely on clean power. “We didn’t have parades. I don’t know why in retrospect we didn’t make more of it,” says Miro Weinberger, the wire-haired mayor of Burlington.  The achievement has since been thrown into sharp relief by the election of Donald Trump, who has attempted to squash any sort of national response to climate change. The Paris climate agreement has been disavowed, policies to lower emissions from coal plants and vehicles have been wound back, adaption to the rising seas has been binned. Amid this national crisis, dozens of US cities, states and businesses have strained to ameliorate the president’s agenda. More than 60 cities have now pledged to shift their electricity generation from fossil fuels to cleaner sources such as solar, wind and hydro. Burlington, a progressive bastion of 42,000 people an hour’s drive to the Canadian border, represents the vanguard. “The job of every elected official in this country changed the day Donald Trump was elected,” says Weinberger, a liberal Democrat who has held the office since 2012. Weinberger drives an electric car – a Nissan Leaf – but is fresh from a bike ride when we meet.  “It’s not acceptable that America has completely retreated from the climate change conversation,” he says. “I think leaders realised that we are going to have to make progress on this even when the federal government has checked out.” Burlington keeps the lights on thanks to: the McNeil Generating Station, a hulking woodchip processor and furnace; a hydro plant situated next to an old wool factory that has its turbines spun by the Winooski River; a small array of wind turbines perched on nearby Georgia Mountain; and a bank of solar panels at Burlington airport.  The city managed the transition to fossil fuel-free electricity within just a decade, but the roots of its transformation go back further. A coal plant that now lies derelict was shuttered in 1986 amid local concerns over pollution and its reputation as an eyesore on the shoreline of Lake Champlain.  The McNeil plant was opened two years before – a plaque marking the occasion bears the name of one Bernard Sanders, the then mayor. It has since carried much of the burden, supplying around half of Burlington’s electricity needs by burning around 400,000 tonnes of waste wood a year that’s purchased from businesses in the region.  Burlingtonians also bring their own unwanted crates, pallets and tree branches to the plant, where they are diced, stored in huge piles of woodchips, placed on conveyor belts and fed into a Hades-like furnace that reaches around 2,000C. The resulting steam turns a huge turbine that generates the electricity.  “We have to shift the woodchip piles around so they don’t get overheated and self combust,” says Dave MacDonnell, power generation manager of the plant. “There was a small fire on one of the piles when we first opened. That was a PR nightmare.” The path to 100% renewable energy was smoothed by an engaged, progressive populace concerned about diminishing snow on nearby ski runs and heatwaves triggering algal blooms on Lake Champlain. Crucially, the city owns the local utility – the Burlington Electric Department, whose logo looks like it belongs on a 1950s-themed diner – and has managed to keep rates steady over the past decade for bill-payers. “Bernie started getting more people involved and out of the woodwork came ideas,” says Will Raap, who moved to Burlington from California in the 1980s and set up a not-for-profit organization that facilitates local food growing.  “The city council began to shift to reflect a progressive point of view and they brought along the private sector. Now Burlington is the most sustainable city around and the national government has got its head up its butt. Cities are where it is happening.” Other, larger cities are also looking to push ahead. Last year Atlanta became the largest city in the south to pledge 100% renewable energy by 2035. San Francisco hopes to achieve this feat five years before that. The skiing playground of Aspen, Colorado, has already got there. Some Republican-led cities such as San Diego have also thrown their weight behind the goal. Carmel, in Indiana, has installed 116 roundabouts, a rarity in the US, in recent years in order to improve safety and also cut emissions from cars idling at traffic light intersections. “We had to have a lot of public education at the start – some people complained,” says James Brainard, a Republican who has been Carmel’s mayor since 1996. “But now people are proud and we have fights over where we are going to have the next one. Climate is a big part of that.” Cities can make major progress in cutting emissions, according to Stanford academic Mark Jacobson, who has devised a roadmap for US cities to go 100% renewable. “The only obstacle really is knowledge,” he says,. But even if the political will and resources are there, the contours of ambition are still influenced by states and the federal government. Recent research suggests the US is struggling to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to the level it promised in the Paris agreement, at precisely a time when it and other countries would have to accelerate cuts in order to avoid punishing sea level rises, storms, heatwaves and societal unrest. Cities can only do so much to quicken the pace.  “When you can only set policy within a 15 sq mile area, it’s much harder to move the needle,” says Weinberger.  “It takes leadership and political will in thousands of jurisdictions when the federal government isn’t doing its job. It can be frustrating but I think it’s still worth doing. It’s a lot better than doing nothing.” In Burlington, the next stage of the masterplan to become fully carbon-free is to electrify its transport, a trickier proposition as the city doesn’t fully control this area. The regional transport authority will run four electric buses by the end of the year, while the city is offering rebates of up to $1,800 (£1,363) for anyone wishing to buy an electric car. So far, 44 residents have done so. “The irony is for many years we were inviting people to leave the grid because it wasn’t clean,” says Jennifer Green, Burlington’s sustainability chief. “Now that it’s clean we want people back.” Follow Guardian Cities on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram to join the discussion, and explore our archive here"
"A 100-metre (330ft) high iceberg has drifted close to a tiny settlement on Greenland’s west coast, prompting fears of a tsunami if it breaks up. Authorities have told residents of the Innaarsuit island settlement living near the shore to move to higher ground. “We fear the iceberg could calve [break apart] and send a flood towards the village,” said Lina Davidsen of Greenland police. Susanne Eliassen, a member of Innaarsuit’s council, said it was not unusual for large icebergs to be seen close to the community. “But this iceberg is the biggest we have seen ... and there are cracks and holes that make us fear it can calve anytime,” she said. “Nobody is staying unnecessarily close to the beach and all children have been told to stay in areas that are high up.”  The village’s power station and fuel tanks are located close to the shore.  Police have moved a search-and-rescue helicopter closer to the remote community, which has a population of about 170.  The incidence of icebergs breaking free from glaciers is likely to become more common, said William Colgan, a Geological Survey of Denmark and Greenland researcher. “Iceberg production in Greenland has been increasing in the past 100 years as climate change has become stronger,” he said, while the rising number of icebergs were in turn “increasing the tsunami hazards”. Last year, four people died and 11 were injured after a landslide caused a tsunami off another island settlement called Nuugaatsiaq, sending several houses crashing into the sea. The latest incident comes after scientists at New York University released a time-lapse video of a massive iceberg breaking free from a glacier in eastern Greenland last month. Denise Holland, of NYU’s environmental fluid dynamics laboratory, and David Holland, an expert in atmospheric and ocean science, had camped by the Helheim glacier for weeks to collect data to better project sea level changes due to global warming. David Holland said it was “the largest event we’ve seen in over a decade in Greenland”.  The video, which is 20 times faster than real time, shows 3% of the annual ice loss of Greenland occuring in 30 minutes. “It sounded like rockets going off,” David Holland said, describing it as “a very complex, chaotic, noisy event”. While the couple is studying Greenland, he said that “the real concern is in Antarctica, where everything is so big the stakes are much higher”."
