"In a recent article in the Guardian Jeremy Farrar, director of the Wellcome Trust, suggests that engaging with fossil fuel companies is a more constructive strategy than divesting from them. Farrar explains that if after engaging with these companies, they do not “meet their environmental responsibilities” and “support a transition to a low carbon economy” then Wellcome would be prepared to divest. But what are Wellcome’s investment criteria and would any of the top 200 fossil fuel companies meet them? The “environmental responsibility” of fossil fuel companies is simple: they must commit to leaving 80% of their coal, oil and gas in the ground. To date, not a single company on the top 200 list has made such a commitment. In fact, the vast majority are going full speed in the opposite direction. When it comes to the fate of the planet, “trust me, Shell is secretly a good guy” is not going to cut it. Over the last decade, fossil fuel companies have expanded dangerous, extreme energy extraction, opening up huge new carbon bombs like the Canadian tar sands. In the meantime, they have spent millions blocking clean energy legislation and defeating politicians who support climate action. Not exactly the “impact” Farrar was hoping for, we assume. Shareholder engagement can – and does – work well to convince companies to pay their staff a living wage or to convince Starbucks to use recycled paper in their coffee cups. But it is not going to convince Starbucks to stop selling coffee – and it is certainly not going to convince Shell to leave their oil in the ground. Wellcome suggest that divestment from a list of companies based on their reserve size is not an effective way to proceed and that we should rather look at their approach to climate issues. Mr Farrar writes: We consider individual companies on their merits, including the extent to which they meet their environmental responsibilities, when we decide whether or not to invest or stay invested. This is exactly the point, however. For major fossil fuel companies the “environmental responsibility” that really matters is whether they are willing to keep it in the ground or not. The rest is just window dressing. Packaging your cigarettes in a green container does not make them any less lethal.  We know that Wellcome invests in fossil fuel companies that have expressly committed and restated their current business models and continue to explore for more fossil fuels. Shell for example have made it quite clear that they have no intention to leave their reserves in the ground. On the contrary, they are leading the charge for Arctic drilling now that the ice is melting. Yet, Wellcome continues to invest in Shell.  It is unclear what institutional investors such as the Wellcome Trust are using their access to the boardroom for. Mr Farrar suggests that some fossil fuel companies are playing an important role in the low-carbon transition by investing “heavily in natural gas and carbon capture and storage”, neither of which are solutions to keeping global warming below 2C. While there is a short-term role for natural gas, this role must be kept short and must not distract from the implementation of real solutions in the form of renewables. Natural gas remains a significant contributor to climate change and half of the existing gas reserves are unburnable according to recent research by University College London. Even if carbon capture and storage was deployed under a best-case scenario, it would only extend the carbon budget by 12-14% and therefore have little effect. Mr Farrar also argues that fossil fuels in low and middle-income countries drive growth and therefore public health. This ignores the fact that climate change will hit the poorest and most vulnerable people hardest. It also does not account for the health externalities of fossil fuels that in fact hamper growth. The International Monetary Fund estimates that air pollution costs China 4% of its GDP for instance. Finally, Wellcome argues that fossil fuels will remain a part of the energy mix for years to come. Divestment campaigners are not arguing for an immediate end to all fossil fuel use. However, to keep the vast majority of fossil fuels in the ground, we need public investors like the Wellcome Trust to show leadership and take a stance. Instead of funding fossil fuels, public investors like Wellcome should drive a just transition to a low-carbon economy"
"In the UK, Archbishop Desmond Tutu has demanded that his alma mater – King’s College London – sell off its fossil fuel shares and Oxford’s former finance director threw his weight behind calls for divestment by helping to take over a university administration building.  In the US, Harvard alumni – including Star Wars actress Natalie Portman – have backed student calls for civil disobedience later this month. At historic Swarthmore College near Philadelphia, 44 students have been occupying the president’s office since mid-March.  And in Australia, on 22 April, students, staff and faculty will rally at universities across the country to say the time has come to step away from investments in yesterday’s technology.  The fossil fuel divestment movement – which one study found to be the fastest growing such anti-corporate campaigns in history – has won over dozens of cities across the world. Last week the Paris City Council voted to divest, just as news came that wind turbines were being installed on the Eiffel Tower.  Philanthropies and charities around the world are doing the right thing too. Arguably the most symbolic moment of the whole campaign came when the Rockefeller Brothers Fund, the family that is heir to the world’s original fossil fuel fortune, decided last September that it was neither prudent nor moral to own coal, oil and gas shares and voted to divest. Religious communities ranging from the Uniting Church in Australia and America’s United Church of Christ to the World Council of Churches have divested. In March, Anglican bishops from around the world joined the call. The divestment fight has been made easier by the fact that fossil fuel investments are increasingly risky: in fact, fossil-free portfolios have handily outperformed market indexes over the last years.  But even with all that, the battle has been hard fought at universities around the world. Many major colleges joined in quickly – world-leading schools from Stanford to Sydney to Scotland to Stockholm are somewhere in the process of divesting, and often their calls have been loud and powerful. The University of Dayton, in the US state of Ohio, for instance, divested its $600m endowment last summer when the university’s president said:  We cannot ignore the negative consequences of climate change, which disproportionately impact the world’s most vulnerable people. It’s never easy, though, because so many of the richest and most powerful university donors and trustees come from the fossil fuel or finance industries, and they are working hard to stop the campaign. That’s because they know it’s effective – nothing has done as much to spread the essential truth about our climate change predicament, which is that the world’s fossil fuel companies have four times as much carbon in their reserves as scientists say we can safely burn. These aren’t normal companies – if they carry out their business plan, the planet tanks.  You can tell how important this fight is when you look at reactions to divestment efforts: when the Australian National University divested some of its shares from seven resource companies, Australia’s mining elite – and even the prime minister, Tony Abbott, and treasurer Joe Hockey – did all they could to undermine their effort and scare off any would-be divestors: there were dozens of articles in the Australian Financial Review attacking the move as a threat to the future of the richest people in the country. That’s why it’s so important that universities lead in this fight. Because they understand where the real threats to our future lie. It’s in their labs that we learned the facts about global warming, and it’s their engineers who have helped lower the costs of solar panels by 90% in the last decade, to the point where they can replace the burning of coal on which we once depended. Not only that, but our universities are crowded with young people who are learning for the lifetime ahead of them. A lifetime that will be increasingly impossible as the temperature warms. Look at what’s happened to Australia with 1 degree of global warming; now imagine a further 3 or 4 degrees in the lifetimes of those currently studying for their degrees. The normal order of things at a university is that the young learn from the old. This is time-honoured and appropriate; elders have learned things in the course of their lives that are worth passing on. The physics of climate change upends that traditional order – in this case, the moral and practical claims of the young must take precedence.  Knowledge – maybe even wisdom – are the theoretical stock-in-trade of a university. It’s time for their leaders to prove that they understand the science, the economics and the ethics at play in this greatest of human crises. Divestment is the test of our time."

"The next president of the African Development Bank (AfDB) must improve the livelihoods of the continent’s poorest people, address huge energy shortages and fill infrastructure funding gaps, according to the bank’s outgoing president, Donald Kaberuka. “For the next leader of the bank … inclusion and broad-based growth is absolutely the number one [item on the] agenda,” says Kaberuka, who steps down in May after presiding over the bank for a decade.  With worsening levels of inequality and soaring population growth across Africa, Kaberuka calls on the biggest lenders to African countries to refocus their efforts on providing services and opportunities for the poor.  “How do you ensure that everything [financing institutions do] asks the question: does this reach the ordinary citizen in our countries? Not simply, Senegal [has] 10% GDP growth – and a taxi driver says, ‘Well, I can’t eat the GDP’,” he says. For Kaberuka, a Rwandan who served as his country’s finance minister from 1997 to 2003, navigating the bank through the 2008 financial crisis and helping it to keep its credit rating intact are among his proudest achievements. But plenty of challenges remain for the bank and for the continent. “Each time I land in a rich African country, I count the number of private jets and I think, what could be the origin of this wealth? It’s unlikely to be enterprise or innovation,” says Kaberuka.  “The test of a nation is not how many millionaires you have, it is how many millions of people you [lift] from poverty into the middle class.” Kaberuka also warns that Africa’s economic development is being choked by chronic energy shortages: “Today, in every single African country, from South Africa to the north, the biggest impediment to economic growth is energy,” he says. He adds that the continent must find an extra $92bn every year to fill its infrastructure funding gap – to build new roads, schools, hospitals and airports. Kaberuka has said climate change is one of the “greatest calamities” Africa faces, but he is encouraged by successful solar projects in Morocco and windfarms in Kenya. The AfDB has an investment policy to finance renewable and non-renewable energy projects in equal measure. Kaberuka defends African countries using non-renewable energy sources. “It is hypocritical for western governments, who have funded their industrialisation using fossil fuels … to say to African countries: ‘You cannot develop dams, you cannot develop coal, just rely on these very expensive renewables,’” he says. With oil, gas and mineral production at the forefront of Africa’s economic growth, Kaberuka has called for better management of the continent’s natural resources. China, the main buyer of Africa’s oil and minerals, has taken a prominent role in financing infrastructure projects, leading some to question the AfDB’s place in Africa’s funding ecosystem.  Last year, the bank announced a $2bn partnership with the People’s Bank of China, known as the Africa Growing Together Fund, which will use AfDB’s policies, procedures and safeguards to help African governments strike better deals with Chinese investors. But Kaberuka stands by the progress the bank has made under his stewardship, and shrugs off the suggestion that he could have done more for Africa’s poor. “Infrastructure is now 60% of everything we do, and we backed the mission of the bank, which was creating the single market in Africa,” he says. Regional integration has been an AfDB priority since its founding in 1964. Despite a number of false starts, Kaberuka is “very confident” that regional blocs such as the East African Community (EAC) and the Economic Community of West African States (Ecowas) will realise long-held ambitions to tighten political unions and merge into a single market. But last week the Tanzania president, Jakaya Kikwete, said the “slow progress” towards the EAC’s common market was “discouraging” to citizens of Kenya, Rwanda, Tanzania, Uganda and Burundi, which make up the bloc. Kaberuka bemoans the minimal role African governments have played in the Ebola crisis. The early stages of the response saw “thousands of NGOs with all these huge vehicles with radio antennas, but there was no involvement of communities or governments”, he says, adding that the AfDB’s priority has been to channel funds to governments dealing with the crisis. So far, the bank has given$230m to Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone, he says. The final cost of the Ebola crisis will be about $3.2bn, according to Kaberuka. He applauds the international response to Ebola, describing it as “people putting their politics on the side, dealing with the problem”. But he criticises African governments for “failing to explain to the communities how Ebola could be contained”. The AfDB will elect its next president in May. Eight candidates – from Nigeria, Ethiopia, Tunisia, Chad, Cape Verde, Sierra Leone, Zimbabwe and Mali – have been named. The next president will be judged by their ability to spread Africa’s economic growth and lift people out of poverty, says Kaberuka. “Think of a citizen looking at power lines going above them, and they live in darkness because they can’t afford [electricity].” "
"Australia has a lot at stake in international climate negotiations. We are highly exposed to adverse impacts from climate change, so effective global action is a national priority. Since emissions-intensive industries form a relatively high share of our economy, we have a vital interest in influencing the way in which the global economy reduces its dependence on those industries.   The climate-friendly economy will take shape in and around the negotiations, so we must do all we can to advance our national interests. In a paper published by the Lowy Institute, we examine those interests and suggest the means of ensuring that Australia is in the driver’s seat. Previous Australian governments have engaged vigorously in international climate negotiations, including under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), and worked hard to advance Australia’s interests. The Abbott government, after its election in 2013, was slow to acknowledge the importance of the climate negotiating task. The resultant differences with other G20 members and regional partners were widely publicised in 2014.  While sometimes derided as just a talk fest, the UNFCCC is the hub of global action on climate change. Its formal meetings spur national commitments to reduce emissions; its institutions provide technical and financial assistance to developing countries; and its rules make national and global progress – or lack of progress – more transparent.  It also provides a global political focus for climate action. This year’s COP21 meeting in Paris is mandated to deliver a new agreement, likely to be the most important step towards a global solution since the Kyoto Protocol was agreed in 1997. Informally, UNFCCC meetings bring together thousands of non-government representatives whose exchanges influence investment and other developments in businesses and communities around the world. Many have a direct bearing on Australia’s economy. The development of new financial instruments that encourage investment, including by Australian firms, in low-carbon technologies in the developing world is an example.  The still limited but growing push for institutions to “divest” their fossil fuel assets, especially coal, is another. An influential Australian presence can help leverage these changes and the myriad opportunities they will bring to advantage the interests of Australian enterprise. So for Australia there is a real-world benefit in maximising its influence over what goes on in and around the UNFCCC. Our paper identifies three key elements which could help.  First, ministerial leadership. The key decisions in the negotiations are political, not technical. A minister’s authority is essential to ensure the Australian delegation is always at the table and can represent Australia’s position as strongly as possible. Second, a strong negotiating team. Australia has some of the most skilful and respected negotiators in the business but there are not enough of them. With a year’s work crammed into a few negotiating weeks, Australia needs a team about twice as large as the one it took to last year’s meeting in Lima. Third, active engagement in preparations for Paris. Australia recently hosted countries of the region at a workshop to assist with preparing national commitments. We should do more of this. We have the technical capacity and action of this sort will boost the prospects for an effective agreement in Paris that stimulates action from all countries. Julie Bishop, the foreign minister, attended the UNFCCC meeting in Lima last December, which suggests that the federal government acknowledges the negotiations merit high priority attention. This was an important move that if built upon along the lines we suggest, could deliver strong results for Australia in Paris. "
"65 researchers from provinces across Canada have published a report, Acting on Climate Change, that details how the country can successfully decarbonize its electric grid to slow global warming.  The team unanimously endorsed putting a price on carbon pollution as a key strategy. Without a carbon fee, the price of electricity on the market doesn’t reflect its true costs to society. This is a market failure that economists call an “externality,” where the costs associated with a product (in this case, damages incurred via climate change) aren’t captured in its market price. Instead they’re paid by taxpayers in what could be considered a massive subsidy to the fossil fuel industry.  Most economists support putting a price on carbon pollution in order to correct this market failure. Acting on Climate Change notes that this could be accomplished with either a carbon tax or cap and trade system. So far, the province of British Columbia has implemented a highly popular and successful revenue-neutral carbon tax, while the province of Québec has adopted a cap and trade system in coordination with California as part of the Western Climate Initiative, and Ontario has just announced that it will also implement a carbon cap and trade system. In addition to carbon pricing, some other key policies suggested in the report include, For example, the report notes that Canada has substantial renewable energy resources at its disposal. To date, 10.8% of its energy is supplied by hydroelectricity, 5.8% from renewables, and 9.1% from nuclear power. From the fossil fuel sector, 30.8% is supplied by natural gas, 36.4% from oil, and 7.1% from coal. It says: With vast, already installed hydropower capacity and rich potential in undeveloped renewable energy sources that could be harnessed to produce electricity, Canada could rapidly move away from fossil fuels in the electricity sector. This transformation, which would put Canada at the forefront of green electricity internationally, could also provide significant cost-savings and give leverage to a num­ber of Canadian industrial sectors. However, by exploiting its renewable energy resources, Canada could shift to a more low-carbon energy mix relatively quickly. Along with the other policy suggestions made in Acting on Climate Change, Canada could keep up with the carbon pollution cuts and pledges made by its neighbor to the south. Because renewable energy resources are plentiful, we believe that Canada could reach 100% reliance on low carbon electricity by 2035. This makes it possible, in turn, to adopt a long-term target of at least 80% reduction in emissions by the middle of the century, consistent with Canada’s international climate mitigation responsibility. In the short-term, we think Canada, in keeping with its historical position of aligning with United States’ targets, could adopt a 2025 target of 26-28% GES reductions relative to our 2005 levels. Thus far Canada has been unsuccessful in meeting its pledges to cut carbon pollution. The country was on track to miss its target under the Kyoto Protocol before withdrawing from the pledge, and is now expected to miss its target under the Copenhagen Accords. Since the report focuses on the electricity grid, it doesn’t discuss the Alberta tar sands. Expanding crude oil production from the tar sands has seemed to be a higher priority to the Canadian government than slowing global warming, and in fact the two goals seem incompatible. By shifting its focus away from the tar sands and instead following the Acting on Climate Change roadmap, Canada could get back on track to meet its pledges to address the growing threats posed by global warming."
"It began in 2012 with Unity College in Maine. Then Stanford joined in, followed by Syracuse. Now, more than 20 US colleges have divested from fossil fuel companies. A month ago, Swarthmore students stepped up pressure for their administration to divest by occupying a campus building, a move mirrored by students at University of Mary Washington, Harvard and Yale. Why? As the divestment advocate Go Fossil Fuel Free puts it: “If it is wrong to wreck the climate, then it is wrong to profit from that wreckage.” But once an institution has divested, the question arises: what to do with the money? When the Rockefellers, The Gates Foundation, Warren Buffett and George Soros all sold Exxon, you know they didn’t just put the proceeds under the mattress. Whether they ultimately divest or not, colleges have a great option: they can invest in themselves. Last year, Swarthmore’s board of managers rejected divestment, for example, but committed millions of dollars to enhancing energy efficiency at the college. This January, Swarthmore asked a group of experts – including myself; environmental educator David Orr; former JP Morgan managing director John Fullerton; Nikki Silvestri, executive director at nonprofit Green for All; and green building experts Bill Browning, Kevin Hydes and Greg Kats – to help the college figure out the best way to move forward. We advised it on which boilers to use, ways to embed sustainability into its curriculum, better investment strategies, and how to engage with underserved members of the local community. One campus publication asserted that the college was nearing the limit of energy efficiency. We disabused college officials of that notion. One building on campus had leaded glass windows. Beautiful, but leaky, single panes squandered the heat rising from the registers immediately below them. Many campus buildings had enough little cracks around their windows to amount to leaving a window open all year long.  One potential solution comes from companies like Aether, which will now come to a university or corporate campus and implement comprehensive efficiency measures at no cost to the institution, taking their pay by splitting the savings that result.  Numerous studies have found that green buildings can deliver better productivity, higher student performance and guaranteed returns. Swarthmore’s commitment to improving its efficiency is smart business, and will likely earn enough returns to pay several faculty salaries, garnering a far more secure return than a stock portfolio. The US Green Building Council reports that owners of existing buildings enjoyed a 19.2% return on investment for efficiency improvements. One conservative report calculated that investing $400,000 on efficiency in a 100,000 square-foot building would deliver $1.50 per square foot in reduced energy costs over a similar building without the efficiency. That $150,000 per year savings would pay back the extra costs in little over two and a half years. Thereafter, the savings stay with the college. The University of Hawaii at Manoa spends $24.5m each year on energy. Facing a $34m shortfall in 2016 and 2017 from rising energy costs, it plans to spend $66m on energy efficiency and renewable generation projects. Its projected return will be $7.7m per year, doubling the $3.4m it saved in 2014 from the efficiency measures it has already put in place. These are big numbers, but research by Gregory Kats, president of clean energy consultant and venture capital firm Capital-E, found a 3.3% increase in occupant productivity after energy efficiency improvements that also boost indoor air quality; 5.5% from efficiency that improves temperature control; and 3.2% from the installation of high-performance lighting systems. Given that worker salaries cost roughly 100 times the energy bill, this makes efficiency worthwhile even if you don’t care about saving on your utility bill or the impact on the climate. Years ago, Swarthmore students began raising money so the college could buy wind power. By 2007, the school was 40% powered by wind.  But the administration has preferred to buy renewable energy credits to offset the school’s use of fossil fuels, which is noble but costly. Such offsets pay to build renewable energy somewhere on the planet, but not necessarily near campus.  Meanwhile, companies like Sun Edison will, for no money down, install solar at a school or business, charging a monthly fee that’s usually less than the amount the customer was previously paying in utility bills. A school such as Swarthmore, with an almost $2bn endowment, could also just buy its own system. Butte College became the first “grid positive” campus, generating more than 100% of the energy it needs after investing $27.3m in solar energy on campus roofs, walkways and parking lots. That may sound like a lot, but the college expects to save between $50m and $75m over the next 15 years by eliminating its electricity bill, getting paid for excess electricity production, and avoiding future electricity rate increases. It hopes to use the savings to improve student offerings and increase enrollment. Investments in renewables grew 12% globally last year, according to a report released in January by the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis. “Globally, 2014 was the year of the renewable energy installation juggernaut,” said Tim Buckley, director of energy finance at the institute. “With the notable exception of Australia, where policy uncertainty served as an effective hand-brake, wherever you look around the globe, be it China, India, Europe or the US, the trend of a rapidly-expanding renewable energy industry is the same. 2015 will inevitably see this gather pace.”  A study by Cambridge and PricewaterhouseCoopers, conducted for the National Bank of Abu Dhabi, found that solar energy is on track to achieve grid parity in 80% of countries within next two years. Students with Swarthmore Mountain Justice appreciate the school’s interest in good housekeeping, but are continuing their sit-in at the administration’s building. I agree that divestment is a good idea.  As I told Swarthmore administration members attending a workshop: “Even if you create savings with infrastructure investments, your portfolio will remain at risk as long as it continues to invest in fossil fuels. We’re watching you. You think your fossil-laden portfolios are a good investment. When that becomes clear that they are not, you will have to explain your lapse of fiduciary responsibility.” Pax World Management, a socially responsible fund, argues against the belief that fossil investments are necessary to underwrite education, saying that: “Several studies over the past three years, since the beginning of the Divest Fossil Fuel campaign, that have found that fossil fuel-free or low-carbon portfolios either outperformed or performed similarly to benchmarks on a risk-adjusted basis.”  FTSE’s North American fossil fuel-free index has consistently outperformed the conventional benchmark index. In an analysis earlier this month, stock market index company MSCI found that fossil-free funds have earned a higher return than conventional ones in the last five years.  Conversely, coal stocks are an increasingly risky investment. Bloomberg New Energy Finance estimates that coal stocks have lost 50-90% of their value since 2005. Peabody, one of the worlds biggest coal companies, lost $787m in 2014, and its shares plunged 84% in five years. Oil has done little better. A Financial Times article from 2013 described the performance of international oil and gas companies as “lamentable from a shareholder perspective” over the last decade. Since June 2014, big oil has lost $200bn. There’s no question finance is a potent force. College divestment from South African companies, after all, played a role in ending apartheid. (Swarthmore divested in 1990, decades after students began calling for divestment in 1965.) In 1990, on Nelson Mandela’s first trip to the US after being released from prison, he spoke at the Oakland Coliseum, acknowledging the Campaign Against Apartheid ­– one of the leading campus divestment organizations – and thanking the American students who had held firm in the divestment campaign.  As John Fullerton puts it, how money is invested – whether by companies, by colleges or by you – influences whether we trash the planet or save it. His description of the risk of carbon bubbles and stranded assets sets forth fundamentals that should guide investors in the age of climate crisis. The activism has only begun. Divestment does matter. Oxford’s Stranded Assets Programme report concluded that “divestment outflows, even when relatively meagre in the first wave of divestment, can significantly and permanently depress stock price of a target firm if they trigger a change in market norms”. Peabody Coal, in its 27 January filing with the SEC, warned: “Divestment could significantly affect demand for our product.”  This comes on the tail of an International Energy Agency report which found that the world’s efforts to limit carbon emissions is working. For the first time in 40 years, global carbon emissions from the energy sector stalled and began to decline. We can save the planet from the scourge of climate chaos, but only if we act.

"“There will be roughly 1 billion more people living in cities by 2030,” said Buenos Aires mayor Mauricio Macri at the C40 Latin American Mayors Forum in the Argentinian capital last week. “Which is equivalent to creating a Buenos Aires-sized city every three weeks for the next 15 years.” The big question, as Macri and other mayors agreed at the forum, is: how do cities accommodate this high population expansion in a sustainable way?  We often hear the looming figure that 70% of the world’s population will be living in cities by 2050 – yet that’s a milestone Latin America has already reached. It is the most urbanised region in the world. Do its cities champion ideas that are up to the task of cutting greenhouse gas emissions and enhancing climate change resilience? Judge for yourself.  “It’s a false dilemma,” Felipe Calderón, the former president of Mexico, told the gathering. While many governments shy away from cutting greenhouse gas emissions for economic reasons, Calderón argued that renewable, low-carbon options can actually generate far greater economic growth in the long run. And they’re not as costly as they once were. “The cost of solar energy has reduced by around 90% since the 1990s,” he pointed out. “Renewables are now highly competitive.” Committing to increasing sustainability is not enough: cities need to act quickly. “We need to be faster in the implementation of climate resilience strategies,” argued the mayor of Mexico City, Miguel Mancera. His city recently kicked off a 2014-2020 climate action programme, which promises to reduce pollutant emissions in the metropolitan area by 30% over six years. Since the programme started in June 2014, he claimed CO2 has already been cut by 1m tonnes.  Of course, investment is a critical part of this, and many mayors called on national governments to support them in funding renewable energies and low-carbon infrastructure. Rio de Janeiro’s mayor, Eduardo Paes, argued that incentives were needed for the private sector to invest in sustainable, climate-resilient cities.  Mexico City is one of the most polluted cities in the world – and 56% of its emissions are from transport. As we look to mature beyond the dominance of the private car, rethinking our urban transport is a clear focus for climate resilience – in both Latin American cities and around the world. As Felipe Calderón outlined, the benefits of cleaner and collective transport go beyond decelerating climate change: there are huge economic and health costs of polluting traffic in cities. “It is critical to reduce car use,” he urged. “No big city in the world is complying with air pollution limits.” Efficient public transport is one part of this transport evolution; safe cycling infrastructure, pedestrianisation and electric vehicles are also critical. Latin America is well known for the widespread use of Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) systems, which originated in the Brazilian city of Curitiba. Curitiba continues to innovate with micro electric cars, as well as electric taxis and buses – in addition to expanding their BRT and improving cycling infrastructure. Mexico City is currently expanding their Metrobus network as well as their metro system.  In 2013, Buenos Aires transformed its car-dominated 20-lane wide Avenida 9 de Julio in the city centre by giving over the 4 central lanes to a Metrobus system, which – according to the city government – saves the equivalent of 5,612 tons of C02 emissions annually. The Argentinian capital’s protected bicycle lanes (“bicisendas”), introduced in 2009, now span 138km and the city’s bike-share scheme, the first in Argentina when it began in 2010, currently has over 140,000 registered users. By improving cycle provision and infrastructure, the city has seen bicycle use increase greatly.  Encouraging walking is another part of curbing car use. “We need to instil a greater respect for the pedestrian,” urged the mayor of Quito, who is pedestrianising areas of the city in addition to expanding its network of bike lanes and adding electric bikes to their bike share programme. Latin American cities including Quito, Buenos Aires, Rio de Janeiro and Mexico City also joined C40 cities around the world to sign the Clean Bus Declaration of Intent, expressing a commitment to reduce emissions and improve air quality through the introduction of low- and zero-emission buses in their city fleets. Landfills contribute to greenhouse gas emissions – and transporting waste to these landfills contributes further to pollution. As populations and resultant consumption grows, efficient waste management was agreed to be a vital part of more sustainable cities. The Climate and Clean Air Coalition to Reduce Short-Lived Climate Pollutants (CCAC) is working with cities including Rio de Janeiro and São Paulo on the Municipal Solid Waste (MSW) initiative which aims to reduce methane and air pollution through the dissemination and implementation of best practice waste management policies and strategies such as closing open dumps and capturing landfill gas. São Paulo’s creation of a solid waste management plan has been a participatory process, promoting a practice of “shared responsibility” as well as maximum recovery of waste. The city now has two recycling plants receiving 250 tonnes of waste per day; there is also a recycling fund for 1200 cooperatives and organic waste management is incentivised. Impressive stuff – though São Paulo certainly has other pressing issues that need addressing.  “The traditional model of urban expansion is no longer sustainable,” Felipe Calderón announced. While a contentious topic in the London housing crisis debate, the UK capital’s green belt was praised by Latin American leaders as a positive strategy for curbing the risk of limitless urban expansion. Compact cities, it was argued, increase energy efficiency, maximise land use, reduce travelling distances within the city (then reducing the need for individual car use if public transport is in place) - as well as preserving nature.  Of course with the anticipated rate of urbanisation and population expansion, compact cities mean much denser cities. While compact (and relatively low population) European cities like Copenhagen were praised as a positive model, it was admitted that extremely dense cities like Hong Kong were not good examples.  The question remains, of course, of how you can have a metropolitan region as big as, for instance, that of Mexico’s capital – home to 21 million people – and make it feel and function like Copenhagen’s, home to 2 million. For now, in Latin America as in many other parts of the world, the jury’s out."
"The system isn’t going to change things for us because for the system, things are working. Exxon don’t need a revolution. The systems are set up to prevent genuine true change happening. The good news as far as all of us are concerned is that change ultimately comes about through the will of the people.” This was the call by Russell Brand to more than 1,000 people who came together in London on Saturday to “break down silos and join up diverse struggles, by showing the links between climate and social justice.” Most of those who attended came from social and environmental groups across the UK and Europe. The event was called This Changes Everything in a nod to the book by Naomi Klein, who spoke via Skype. Other speakers who attended were Natalie Bennett, leader of the Green Party, journalist Paul Mason and the poet and environmental activist Nnimmo Bassey. Comedian and author Francesca Martinez shared the personal story of her political awakening: I went through a period of feeling very abnormal. The world made me feel I was faulty; a freak. One day I woke up and realised I had never met a normal person – and it was a profoundly political awakening. My insecurities had everything to do with living in a culture that breeds dissatisfaction. These disgusting ideals are a clear ploy to depoliticise people because the first step to creating a better world is to believe in one and if you’re too busy worrying about your thigh gap or that you’re balding you’re not going to put that energy into things that matter.” Asad Rehman, who leads the international climate campaign at Friends of the Earth, said: People power defeated apartheid – only people power can stop the climate crisis. This Changes Everything is a clarion call for a set of demands that unite the social, economic and climate justice movements. People’s demands on energy, food, housing and justice that speak to the needs of ordinary people and provide a positive vision of a cleaner, safer and more just society.  Were you at the event on Saturday or are you part of a social or environmental group? Tell us what you think and we’ll share a selection above the line: what does the environmental movement need to do next?"

"In Rancho Mirage, southern California, lush private gardens flourish in absurd contrast to the parched surrounding landscape. But green lawns like these are under threat, as the drought that has plagued the state since 2012 refuses to let up.  In January last year, when rainfall figures for the preceding 12 months slumped to the lowest levels since records began in 1885, governor Jerry Brown declared a state of emergency. He is now enforcing residential water restrictions after another snowless winter. Public lawns will be replaced with “drought tolerant landscaping” and enforced cuts to water-usage of 25% will be mandatory for California’s 38 million residents. Meanwhile, farmers, who use the majority of the state’s water supply, face further unemployment and low yield as more fields are left fallow. Overpopulation, intensive agriculture and climate change have all been suggested as possible factors exacerbating the situation but, whatever their role, California may no longer be the infinitely fertile oasis it once seemed."

"I and many other students and staff at King’s College London do all we can to cut down our carbon footprints. We cycle in all weather, recycle neurotically, shop at farmers’ markets, have successfully lobbied our housemates to switch to renewable energy providers, and we can’t think of a dish that is complete without lentils. We are far from perfect, but continue to try to improve. At the same time, until recently I owned shares in some of the most polluting companies in the world. My discovery of the fossil fuel divestment campaign made it clear that my cognitive dissonance on this issue was far from an isolated case. The realisation that your individual efforts to be a greener citizen have little impact on a global problem invites apathy and cynicism. Inspired by the campaign, I divested my shares and put the profit into a campaign to resolve the same dissonance that exists in our university.  King’s, to its credit, has recently focused more heavily on its campus sustainability, hiring an excellent team that is focused on cutting down the university’s carbon footprint. At the same time, however, it invests more than £8m in companies that are the biggest drivers of climate change. If our university is truly committed to sustainability and educating students to help shape the future, then surely it should be investing in a way that positively impacts on that future. Our campaign for King’s to divest from fossil fuel companies has garnered widespread support among students and staff: in part because such a simple and effective strategy provides an antidote to futility. This widespread sense of despair arises from the disheartening chasm between climate science and political action, which cannot be bridged alone by switching off lights. We expected that our campaign, with the support it has received, would be addressed earnestly by the administration. Instead we were surprised at the near absence of response, and the rather peculiar form it took when it came. The university administration sent vice-principal Chris Mottershead, who spent 30 years of his career at BP, to deal with our campaign. For part of that time he was their global adviser on energy security and climate change, and now chairs the government’s transport energy task force. Since handing in our petition six months ago, Mottershead has been keen to engage us in discussions on the role of fossil fuel companies, and has even debated with us in a public forum. His view is that society needs to forge closer relationships with fossil fuel companies, and our campaign risks alienating them. Meanwhile, our university administration has taken no tangible steps to consider the prospect of fossil fuel divestment. The single formal response we have received consisted of a vague statement of investment principles, indicating that the university is happy to invest in companies “as long as they are open about any harm they might do, and that they are taking action to minimise this harm”, a statement broad enough to mean nothing. Our interaction with the administration seems to point to a more fundamental issue: that of a democratic deficit within the university. At one point we were told that we “were talking into a void”, given the lack of formal structure concerning ethical investment. It is surely this absence of attention, rather than any malicious intent, that explains an ethical investment policy sorely out of date (referring only to “direct” investments, of which the university has none) and the continued investment in tobacco companies by a renowned medical research institution. For a university energetically committed to enhancing its standing academically, this neglect of ethical issues is stark. There is no opportunity for students or staff to have an input on such decisions. This issue has motivated the recent occupation of King’s by students feeling disenfranchised. The occupiers’ demands includes a request for the university to conduct a review of fossil fuel divestment, as many other universities have. We feel at this late hour that the softly softly approach is indistinguishable from complacency. Indeed this stance reflects that of the fossil fuel companies themselves and, in the context of increasingly volatile weather, seems certain to end in disaster. We hope that with growing interest in the fossil-free campaign around the world, and intervention by a global symbol of justice in the form of Archbishop Desmond Tutu, our administration takes the issue of fossil fuel divestment seriously and lives up to its aspirations to be a “force for good”."
"The Wellcome Trust is the second biggest health charity in the world and accepts climate change as one of the greatest, if not the greatest, threats to health this century. It has done extraordinary good in the world with its £18bn endowment, but that fund contains large investments in fossil fuels. Last month, the Guardian launched a campaign to persuade the highly influential health charity to show leadership on climate change and to divest from fossil fuels. So far the Trust, chaired by a former senior director of oil company BP, has declined to do so. You can read why in this article by Wellcome’s director Jeremy Farrar.  Farrar’s response, and Wellcome’s investment policy, raise a number of questions, which the Guardian put to the Trust. The trust declined to answer them, with a spokeswoman replying: “Our director, Jeremy Farrar, has already explained our position at length in the Guardian. We have no additional comment.” You can read the questions below: 1. Transparency Farrar said the Wellcome Trust says it is an unusually “transparent” investor. Question: What is the total value of the Wellcome Trust’s fossil fuel holdings? Can Wellcome name all the fossil fuel companies it is invested in?  2. Engagement Farrar said the Wellcome Trust practices “active engagement with the companies in which we invest”. He added: “We would not be able to have the frank discussions we require if we published details, but we are confident that our engagement has impact.” Question: A number of people, including the philanthropist Valerie Rockefeller Wayne (ExxonMobil) and British environmentalist Jonathon Porritt (BP, Shell), have stated recently that engagement does not work. Without giving specific details, can Wellcome outline any examples of successful engagement on climate issues, such as changes of company policy?  3. Selling investments if companies refuse to engage Farrar said: “We consider individual companies on their merits, including the extent to which they meet their environmental responsibilities, when we decide whether or not to invest or stay invested.” He added: “But when we are not satisfied that a company is engaging with our concerns, we are perfectly prepared to sell.”Question: Can you give any examples of companies that Wellcome has sold after the company failed to respond to engagement? There cannot be any harm in being transparent about this if Wellcome is no longer invested in the company. 4. ExxonMobil The Guardian revealed that The Wellcome Trust recently sold a £94m investment in ExxonMobil. Question: Was this investment sold because of failed engagement and/or a failure of ExxonMobil to meet its environmental responsibilities? 5. Climate-responsible fossil fuel companies Farrar said: “We do not agree that the strongest contribution the trust can make to a decarbonised economy is a commitment to avoid investing in a list of 200 fossil-fuel companies, compiled according to the size of their reserves rather than the position they take on climate issues.” Question: Can Wellcome give any examples from those 200 of companies with responsible positions on climate issues, given that all are committed to finding and exploiting more fossil fuels, when we already have several times more than can be safely burned? 6. Fossil fuel company support for carbon pricing Farrar said: “Some fossil fuel companies – though by no means all of them – are playing important roles in this transition ... Some champion carbon pricing, and already use carbon prices internally in assessing investment projects.” Question: BP champions carbon pricing, but also funds US climate denier senator Jim Inhofe. Shell uses internal carbon prices, but also funds the US climate denier lobby group Alec. Why are companies that fund climate deniers suitable investments for Wellcome, which requires environmental responsibility? 7. Tar sands Farrar said: “We have had no [direct coal for energy] investments for many years. The Rockefeller Brothers Fund pledged to reduce its investments in coal and tar sands to less than 1% of its portfolio. Again, [Wellcome’s] investments meet this benchmark.” Question: This benchmark would allow up to £180m invested in tar sands, the continued exploration of which is considered by scientists to be incompatible with a stable climate. How much does Wellcome have invested in tar sands and in which companies?8. Clean energy investment Farrar said: “We also invest in alternative energy technologies, from novel and sustainable biofuels to nuclear fusion.” Question: How much is invested in these sectors and how does that compare to investments in fossil fuels? 9. Reputational damage Section 2.1.4 of the Wellcome Trust’s investment policy states: “It will not invest in structures or assets which create ... significant adverse operational, reputational or legal liability.” Question: Do investments in fossil fuel companies, for example those funding climate change deniers or extracting tar sands, damage Wellcome’s reputation? 10. The “carbon bubble” Section 5.12 of the Wellcome Trust’s investment policy states: “Scenario tests are used to examine the potential impact of extreme market conditions.” Question: Has the Wellcome Trust tested its investments against a scenario in which rapid cuts to global carbon emissions are made in order to keep warming below the internationally agreed limit of 2C? This scenario has been dubbed the “carbon bubble” and warnings about the large risk posed have been given by the World Bank, the Bank of England and economist Lord Nicholas Stern. "
"Are we tipping the right way? One of the great environmental stories is of how catastrophe can creep up and be noticed only when it is too late to act. Examples range from the sudden, inexplicable collapse of bee colonies, to ice cores revealing the potential for dramatic climatic upheavals that happen not in millennia or centuries, but the time it takes to pass through a coalition government or two. It is hard enough to identify tipping or “inflection” points when you are consciously looking, like monitoring the so-called known unknowns of future forest die-back, deep-sea methane release, ice melt and sea level rise. Worse, in complex systems, are the unknown unknowns. All you have is nebulous worry. It’s why we are supposed to obey the precautionary principle relating to any activity which at scale is capable of altering whole systems.  But this is only half the story, because when something tips, it might well fall to the floor and smash but it might also fall comfortably into your lap. It’s possible we have become so hypnotised by real and serious negative tipping points, that we’ve forgotten that things can turn out unexpectedly well too. While fish populations and financial markets might suddenly collapse around their complacent human overseers, iron curtains and regimes can fall with just as little warning. Societies can dramatically change course to take collective responsibility, cancel each others’ debts, care for each other and pull together in the face of great challenges. All the political parties in the UK election are fighting over the future of the NHS. It emerged dramatically as a bold new social commitment to mutual care in the immediate shadow of financial market failure and years of brutal conflict. At its weakest point the UK took its boldest step. Beneath the surface, the experience of those years had changed people, making big change possible, acceptable and desirable. Now, in spite of everything, are we approaching just such a positive inflection point in the face of climate change? The latest figures on renewable energy trends from the UN Environment Programme (Unep) reveal a striking turnaround after a period in which low oil prices and policy uncertainty pushed investment down, threatening the sector. Even though oil prices remain low, world investment, largely in solar and wind, went up by 17% to $270bn (£180bn) last year, reversing a two-year dip. The new generating capacity that represents is about the same as the total output of the current US nuclear system. One reason the sector is defying a normally brutal, simple market logic around price is because bigger shifts are happening in the investment world. “There’s a quiet revolution going on,” says Nick Robins, co-director of the Unep Inquiry into a Sustainable Financial System (pdf), “with central banks and financial regulators starting to incorporate sustainability into their core activities”. For example, “In China, there’s growing momentum for building a ‘green financial system’ to tackle the country’s serious environmental problems,” he says. It explains the confidence with which China, already the world’s largest wind power user, plans within five years to have more than double the capacity of the whole of Europe. It also colours the new, upbeat China-US climate diplomacy and is far from an isolated example. Costa Rica may have relied on its very particular topography to have its energy system powered 100% by renewable energy in 2015, but it is symbolically powerful and Costa Ricans are enjoying falling energy prices. Also, the best energy systems should always be locally tailored. Under very different circumstances, the district of Rhein-Hunsrück in the industrial giant of Germany achieved 100% renewable status and exports surplus clean energy to the grid. The €290m (£213m) it used to spend on importing energy is being turned into value for the local community by an energy system based on efficiency and local, renewable sources. Solar entrepreneur Jeremy Leggett argues in his forthcoming book, The Winning of the Carbon War, that three mostly independent dynamics are at play driving the change. Firstly, the numbers no longer add up in the old fossil fuel model. The costs of new acquisitions become unmanageable in a system that feasts on debt. Secondly, costs in solar and the vital link of a green energy system, battery storage, are plummeting while the sector offers attractive, reliable rates of return to investors. The Swiss bank UBS famously predicted the rapid “extinction” of the old fossil fuel system as battery costs as much as halve over the next five years. And, finally, there is movement internationally on climate policy. “We are now in danger of winning the carbon war,” says Leggett. ”Would I like to be running an oil company now? Defending their case is becoming untenable.” Some politicians seem timid, however, and reluctant to let go of the sector to turn over a clean sheet. As momentum for divestment from fossil fuels gathers pace, Chris Smith, the Labour peer, former chief of the Environment Agency and now chair of a task force on shale gas, recently said that “leaving all fossil fuels in the ground is for the fairies”. As ever in politics it is the signal here that matters. Campaigners argue that what should be left in the ground is the amount which science suggests is unsafe to burn. But his “slow down, hold on a moment” message was echoed by the shadow secretary of state for energy, Caroline Flint, who did “not support divestment” from fossil fuels, merely investing more in clean energy. It comes with the familiar cry of needing to live in the real world, in which living in the real world actually requires ignoring what it takes to maintain the real world’s life support mechanisms. But these are people being dragged, reluctantly along by larger forces over which they have ultimately little control. One in four UK homes now benefits from wind power, a rise of 15% on last year, and Scotland is generating enough clean energy to be used in 98% of its homes. There is an area of the southern African Cape that for large parts of the year is arid and grey. Then when the rains fall on the scrub of the western Cape the earth erupts with life in an extravagant flowering that is one of the world’s great natural wonders. Progress and beauty can hide just beneath the surface of events, and be just as socially contagious as the darker side of humanity. What tips us one way or the other is how we choose to act. The great change today may be as simple as the shift from asking what we can do for the environment, to seeing what the environment can do for all of us."

"The news that polar bears were consuming more land-based foods, such as bird eggs, geese and caribou – the results of a study from the American Museum of Natural History in New York last year – was exactly the sort of optimism people had been looking for in the polar bear’s sad story. Despite the fact that various scientists came out saying it was unclear whether this new foraging strategy would help polar bears survive, what the media heard was essentially: “Polar bears are adapting, hooray!” Headlines perpetuated this perception. “Stuck on land? Polar bears find ways to grab dinner,” proclaimed Daily Climate News. “As Sea Ice Shrinks, Can Polar Bears Survive on Land?” National Geographic asked optimistically. And study author, ecologist Linda J Gormezano, calculated that polar bears may be able to survive for six months on land-based foods.  Karyn Rode, lead author of a study out today from the US Geological Services (USGS), provides a bit of a reality check. “I can see why people would get excited about the news that polar bears are eating land-based foods,” Rode said. “Why wouldn’t we hope for polar bears to find a way to cope with sea ice loss?” The USGS study, however, points out that while some polar bears may eat terrestrial foods, there is no evidence that the behavior is widespread. In addition to the fact that only a small percentage of polar bears — fewer than 30 individual polar bears out of populations that typically number 900 to 1200 — are actually consuming land-based foods, Rode and her colleagues found that in the regions where terrestrial feeding by polar bears has been documented, polar bears’ health and rate of survival have declined.  The study also points out that polar bears will be competing for any land-based foods with existing populations of grizzly bears. And those grizzlies are among the smallest and most malnourished of the species because there’s so little to eat. “The smaller size and low population density of grizzly bears in the Arctic,” Rode said, “provides a clear indication of the nutritional limitations of onshore habitats for supporting large-bodied polar bears in meaningful numbers.” Polar bears are the largest bear species, largely due to the fact that they consume the highest fat diet of any mammal (consisting primarily of seals and other marine mammals). Replacing lost ice-based hunting opportunities with foods available on land means switching from high-fat foods to primarily carbohydrate and protein-based foods. Moreover, the study points out that foraging has a cost associated with it. Polar bears foraging on low quality, dispersed resources, such as berries, will burn more calories.  “The exception to low-quality foods onshore, are bird eggs,” Rode said. “But there are limited numbers of bird eggs when considered as a food source for an entire population of 900 or more bears.” According to Rode, a lot more research needs to be done before we get a clear understanding of how, or whether, polar bears will adapt to a changing arctic landscape. Other less intrusive studies could also help us understand if polar bears are increasingly using terrestrial foods, according to Rode. “Previous studies found that polar bears in western Hudson Bay spent 80-85% of their time resting while onshore,” Rode said. “That is not suggestive that terrestrial foods could be a substantial part of their diet.” "
"Climate change is making drought conditions in south-west and south-east Australia worse, with serious ramifications for people’s health and the agriculture industry, a new paper has warned. The Climate Council report states that since the mid-1990s, south-east Australia has experienced a 15% drop in rainfall during late autumn and early winter, with a 25% slump in average rainfall in April and May.  A drought that has gripped western Queensland and northern New South Wales since 2012 has put pressure on farmers and forced wildlife into starvation. Projected decreases in average rainfall in winter and spring mean it will “likely be increasingly difficult to erase such rainfall deficits in the future” according to the Climate Council report, which cites data from the CSIRO and Bureau of Meteorology. Average annual stream flow into Perth’s dams has fallen by 80% since the 1970s, according to the paper, while Sydney dams such as Warragamba and Shoalhaven could experience a 25% drop in water inflows by 2070 if greenhouse gases are not curbed. Melbourne’s four main reservoirs could suffer an 18% decrease in annual stream flows by 2050.  The Climate Council said that increasingly severe droughts were linked to a drop in agricultural productivity and a 15% increase in suicide risk for rural males aged between 30 and 49. The report’s author, Professor Will Steffen, said a much clearer picture of climate change’s influence on drought was emerging through recent research. “There is stronger evidence that the front that brings rain in from the Southern Ocean has shifted south by about a degree in latitude, while the subtropical ridge, which is a belt of high pressure in central Australia, has intensified,” he said.  “We are seeing this kind of thing consistently around the planet. This is being driven very strongly by climate change, through the models and supported by observations.” Steffen said future rainfall decreases of even 10% would have “pretty serious” implications for urban water supplies due to the reduced flow of water into catchments. “Droughts have obviously been an important issue for Australia for a long time, but the question is ‘how far can we adapt?’ ” he said. “If you look at wheat yields, for example, yes, you can adapt, but there are limits to that. It’s a bit of false hope that you can adapt infinitely,” he said."
"Nobel prize winners in the US and Australia have joined calls for the world’s two largest health charities to sell their stocks in leading fossil fuel companies. The eminent medical researchers argue that the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation and the Wellcome Trust should end their investments in major coal, oil and gas firms because they conflict with the charities’ aims of improving public health. “It is clear that while some coal producers may be in denial, the large oil companies understand exactly what is happening with anthropogenic climate change. It is also clear that the rush to find more oil and dig more coal continues unabated,” said Professor Peter Doherty, a scientist at the University of Melbourne who won the Nobel prize for his work on the immune system. “Is it likely that anything other than placing a real price on carbon and withdrawing investment will influence either industry?” he said. Last month, the Guardian launched a campaign to encourage the two charities to divest from fossil fuel companies with the largest reserves on the grounds that they undermine the charities’ aims. Proven fossil fuel reserves are already three to five times larger than the amount of carbon that can be burned by mid-century with a realistic chance of keeping the global temperature rise below 2C, a widely agreed threshold for dangerous climate change impacts.  The World Health Organisation has warned that climate change will kill a quarter of a million people a year between 2030 and 2050, mostly through more cases of malaria, diarrhoeal diseases, heat exposure and inadequate nutrition. Professor Anne Glover, who was chief scientific adviser to the European commission until last year, and Lord May, the UK government’s former chief scientist, have backed the Guardian campaign, along with over 175,000 others. “These are leaders. These are people that others look to. So they have enormous responsibility. That’s why for me it is important that they react to this,” Prof Glover said. But the Wellcome Trust has dismissed divestment as a “grand gesture”, and argues that as an investor it wields more influence over the sustainable policies adopted by fossil fuel companies. It said it was not able to divulge details of the conversations it had with the industry. Writing in the Guardian in March, Jeremy Farrar, the director of the Wellcome Trust, argued that divestment was a gesture that could only be made once. “By maintaining our positions, we meet boards again and again, supporting their best environmental initiatives and challenging their worst. We would not be able to have the frank discussions we require if we published details, but we are confident that our engagement has impact.” Several Nobel laureates, including one of the Wellcome Trust’s most senior former employees, called for proof that holding stocks in fossil fuel companies was an effective strategy for reducing carbon emissions. Sir John Sulston, a Nobel laureate and founding director of the Wellcome Trust’s Sanger Centre in Cambridge, called on the Trust to prove that its discussions with fossil fuel companies had had an impact.  Writing in the Guardian , Sulston praised the Trust but urged them to release examples of the progress they have made. “Can the Trust show us the evidence that its negotiations as a stockholder of Shell, BP and the other fossil fuel companies are the best route towards the rapid reduction of carbon emissions? If so, we shall be delighted and relieved to learn that doubts are misplaced and that there is a well signposted way forward.  “Otherwise, we must conclude that the Wellcome Trust is not part of the solution to the problem. In this matter the earth and its inhabitants cannot wait for polite business exchanges,” he says.  “The Trust’s statements seem to underrate its influence in the business and political landscape, and the effect that reinvestment will have on reducing the costs of renewable energy. Divestment, far from being simply a grand gesture, can be a switch onto a high speed track,” he adds. Sir Richard Roberts, a Nobel prize winner at New England Biolabs in Massachusetts, echoed the call for evidence: “The idea that you can have insider talks and achieve some action, I don’t think that works. It’s an excuse to keep investing in something that’s profitable for the foundation, but there are many other investments that would be equally profitable.” “If they have done something behind the scenes, let them give us an example. If they can’t, they should divest,” he added. For others though, the call for divestment seemed impractical. “Global climate change is certainly a very serious issue. But while it would be nice for the Gates Foundation and Wellcome Trust to divest their investments, I do not feel that we hold ourselves to the same standard,” said Peter Agre, a Nobel laureate and director of Johns Hopkins Malaria Research Institute in Maryland. “At age 66 I no longer ride my bicycle to work. I accept business class air tickets for intercontinental travel to give lectures abroad. We heat our house in winter and use an air conditioner in summer. And like everyone, our house is filled with items made in China – a nation with a huge environmental problem. Unfortunately my generation is running out the clock and our children and grandchildren will inherit a mess,” he said. Professor Doherty said that the Wellcome Trust and Gates Foundation were both hugely impressive organisations, but through divestment could have an important impact on efforts to reduce carbon emissions.  “Those who, like me, work in biomedical research, have the greatest respect the Wellcome Trust and the Gates Foundation, but wonder if anything other than the bluntest of signals will influence the political dynamic that is needed for real change,” he said. The global divestment movement, which encourages investors to sell their stocks in fossil fuel companies, is growing rapidly with over 200 organisations worth over £33bn signed up. Jonah Goldman, a spokeman for Bill Gates, said: “Bill and Melinda Gates wrote in their recent annual letter that “the long term threat [of climate change] is so serious that the world needs to move much more aggressively - right now - to develop energy sources that are cheaper, can deliver on demand, and emit zero carbon dioxide. Bill is privately investing considerable time and resources in this effort and the breakthrough innovations needed and will continue to speak out about it. We respect the passion of advocates for action on climate change, and recognize that there are many views on how best to address it.” A Wellcome Trust spokesperson said: “We use our access to boards to encourage companies that produce or consume fossil fuels to adopt more transparent and sustainable policies that support transition towards a low-carbon economy. We would not be able to have the frank discussions we require if we published details.”"

"For the first time, scientists have detected a ‘hole’ in the ozone layer over the Arctic and northern Europe. Ozone, a form of oxygen, acts as a high-altitude atmospheric screen against cancer-causing ultraviolet light. But at some altitudes this spring, levels have been 50 per cent below any previously observed.  Ozone, under assault from man-made chlorofluorocarbon compounds (CFCs), is destroyed steadily but undramatically all year. But the latest research - the Second European Stratospheric Arctic and Mid Latitude Experiment, or Sesame - has focused on a winter weather phenomenon known as the Arctic vortex. This is a wind system which traps a ‘cauldron’ of atmosphere through the polar night. Inside the cauldron, chlorine-based CFCs build up. Although the chemistry of the ozone destruction is complicated, its ingredients are intense cold, ice particles, chlorine and sunlight. Hence a polar vortex that survives into the spring supplies all of these things. In the Antarctic vortex the springtime destruction of ozone is on a huge scale, and its consequences have changed life dramatically for Australians and New Zealanders, who now get warnings about exposure to the sun during normal weather forecasts. The estimate is that two out of three Australians are likely to develop some form of skin cancer in the course of their lives. For several years, meteorologists and atmospheric chemists have watched in alarm as a similarly explosive mixture to the Antarctic vortex has been assembled in the Arctic. But in previous years the wind patterns have changed and the vortex has broken up before wholesale destruction could begin. This spring it happened. Although the destruction is considerably less than that in the Antarctic, Dr John Pyle, a Cambridge scientist involved in co-ordinating European research, says: ‘There is definitely a region where there is a big bite out of the ozone. There ought to be, in some layers of the atmosphere, half as much ozone again. So it’s a pretty significant signal.’ CFCs have been used as refrigerants, to inflate foams, and as cleansers in computer component manufacturing. In the stratosphere a molecule of CFCs can survive for long periods and destroy thousands of molecules of ozone. However, in the 1980s an international agreement began limiting the production of CFCs. At present, Dr Pyle believes people in northern Europe and Scandinavia are at no particular risk from the extra ultraviolet radiation getting through the damaged ozone screen. ‘I don’t want to underplay the dangers of skin cancer, but I don’t think this in itself is going to cause lots of extra harm. What it does show is that had we continued to put these CFC compounds into the atmosphere at the rate we were doing, and had there been no international agreement to control them, then it’s abundantly clear things in the north could have got as bad as the south,’ he said. ‘It’s a damn good job we have put something in place.’"
"The Green party manifesto, launched on Tuesday, outlined ambitious climate change targets that would see the UK running a zero carbon economy by 2050. But energy analysts have told the Guardian that while laudable, elements of the Greens’ climate agenda may be impossible to implement even if the funding floodgates are opened. The Green party’s platform improves on the UK’s current carbon reductions plan, which would see cuts of 80% by the middle of the century. Total decarbonisation would be achieved by doing the heavy lifting in the next 15 years, via a 90% reduction in emissions by 2030 based on 1990 levels. This policy requires the UK to make double the cuts required by EU legislation in the next 15 years.  The UK’s current carbon targets are not enough, the manifesto said, to keep the world within the agreed safe level of warming of 2C. The rich, carbon-intensive UK economy must take on a larger share of the burden of emissions reductions than developing nations, it said. To achieve the targets, the Greens would spend £80bn to foster an energy transformation of unprecedented scope. Solar capacity would increase from just over 5GW to 25GW by 2020. To do this it would need to grow faster than in Germany in 2014 during the massive boom inspired by the country’s energiewende transition to renewable power. Offshore wind energy would grow enormously from 8GW to 42GW by 2020 and 60GW by 2030. The Greens said the parameters for this expansion were set in consultation with renewable energy industry professionals. But Rob Gross, the director of Imperial College’s Centre for Energy Policy and Technology, said the Greens’ timeframes may be too ambitious. “I wouldn’t say they are impossible, but you’d really have to be able to put things on a war footing to get to those levels of roll-out in such a short space of time. It would be unprecedented, for offshore wind in particular,” he said. Gross said current pipeline projects have the UK reaching around 10GW of offshore wind by 2020. Jim Watson, the director of the UK Energy Research Centre said increasing this to more than 40GW was likely to be unattainable. “It seems extremely ambitious, just because of the lead times of getting those project up and running. Even were you to throw a lot of money at it now you’d struggle to meet those targets,” said Watson. Solar energy has proven more scaleable, said Gross, but with any such large scale, disruptive push for a certain energy type there is the risk it will increase prices and drive the industry offshore. “Trying to go too far too fast can drive up costs. There’s also a danger that if you want to do this to build UK skills, you can’t actually get those skills quickly enough, so the only way you can hit those targets is by bringing in people from other countries. I’m not against that, but if what you are trying to do is create jobs for people in this country then you need to give those people enough time to get trained,” he said. There was also a question, said Gross, about whether distribution networks could cope with such high levels of decentralised renewable energy - as opposed to the highly-centralised power from coal, gas and nuclear. Gross said the grid in Germany was already experiencing some problems coping with the increasingly fragmented supply driven by the energiewende. “In some respects one would welcome that and in the longer term that might be exactly what we would like to happen. But there’s an adjustment period that’s needed. Building energy infrastructure does tend to take time,” said Gross. The UK’s Committee on Climate Change (CCC) is responsible for drafting legally binding advice on how the UK can meet its carbon targets. John Gummer, a Tory member of the House of Lords and the chair of the CCC, said the Greens’ manifesto raised important questions about the UK’s climate ambitions, but their timeframes for implementation were fundamentally flawed. “This has to be an evolutionary process, building stage upon stage,” he said. “The Green party is helpful in stretching our ambition but its dogmatic and doom-laden approach will simply not gain enough public support till it’s too late and disaster is upon us. They also carry a good deal of political baggage which distracts from their core environmental message. I admire their tenacity, share their concerns, but doubt their tactics and question their solutions.” Along with their expansion of renewables, the Greens said they would implement a policy of stopping any new nuclear renewable developments (including scrapping the already approved plans for the Hinkley Point C station) and ban fracking for shale gas. Both of these are seen by their advocates as energy sources required for the transition away from coal and eventual decarbonisation. Gross said the Greens position on these energy sources was defensible. “We could do it without nuclear, I don’t see nuclear as being essential to decarbonisation and I think fracking is an irrelevance,” he said. But if their emissions reduction targets were to remain feasible, Gross said the £24bn billpayers are set to pay for Hinkley would have to be redirected towards carbon capture and storage technology (CCS) or developing ways to store energy from the fluctuating supply from renewable sources. Both technologies are currently in their infancy. Watson agreed: “In principle, if you look at modelling and analysis that’s been done you could meet the climate targets that we have now without nuclear. This does place more emphasis on other options like CCS, or a breakthrough in energy storage, but there are uncertainties about these.” Note: the statistics for onshore wind and solar capacity were changed to reflect the latest statistics. The article originally said solar was at 1GW and wind at 1.6GW."
"The Abbott government’s Direct Action climate policy has been “neutered” and cannot guarantee greenhouse gas reductions, according to the independent senator Nick Xenophon, who says the government has reneged on undertakings it gave to secure his vote for the scheme.  Xenophon provided one of the six votes the government needed to get Direct Action through the Senate last July, in return for assurances that its so-called “safeguards mechanism” would impose real limitations on greenhouse emissions from industry.  The mechanism is supposed to stop increases in emissions from heavy industry or electricity generators from cancelling out the emissions reductions that the government intends to buy from other sources with its $2.55bn emissions reduction fund. But a discussion paper released two weeks ago describes a safeguards mechanism that will at best mean major polluters continue business as usual and at worst could lead to significant increases in their greenhouse gas emissions, according to experts. Elaine Prior, a senior analyst at the global investment bank Citigroup said: “It appears to us that the mechanism, as described in the consultation paper, is unlikely to impose any significant costs or constraints on companies … it also appears unlikely to make any significant positive contribution to Australia’s emissions reduction efforts.”  The carbon and environment daily newsletter has calculated that BlueScope steel could be able to double its greenhouse emissions before it breaches its “safeguard” baseline, because of the effect of closing one of the blast furnaces at its Point Kembla plant. An angry Xenophon said what was described in the discussion paper “neuters the whole purpose of Direct Action”. “Direct Action has no point if it does not have an effective safeguards mechanism and what the government has released seems like a try-on,” he said. “It goes against what they promised me in the discussions before the vote. I was assured this safeguards mechanism would have real teeth. “There is no point in the government spending $2.55bn if there is no requirement to cap or reduce emissions from industry.” The issues paper said baselines for emissions would “reflect the highest level of reported emissions for a facility over the historical period 2009-10 to 2013-14”. If companies exceeded the baseline calculated that way, they could have their emissions averaged out of the next three years, or apply for a baseline “expansion”, or apply for an exemption, for example after a natural disaster. Only if that all failed would they be required to buy emission reductions. Xenophon had believed the baselines would be far tougher, which would have meant more companies had to buy permits from those who had managed to reduce their emissions – something that would have quickly turned the system into a baseline and credit emissions trading scheme. The safeguards mechanism will apply to about 140 facilities with emissions of more than 100,000 tonnes of CO2 – electricity generators, mines, manufacturers – and will be administered by the clean energy regulator set up by the previous government. The government has given stakeholders a month to respond. According to the paper, the government will also allow some mines to have baselines higher than their historical average if the “historical high point does not fully reflect expected business-as-usual emissions”. “These are operations where there is a natural resource or reserve associated with the operation of a facility; the grade or depth of the resource or reserve will have a direct effect on the emissions performance of a facility; the facility has limited ability to control for such emissions; and facility emissions are expected to exceed their historical baseline and the change in natural resource grade or depth is the primary reason for this.” The Direct Action scheme passed with support from Xenophon, the Palmer United party – which at the time had three senators, two of whom have since left the party – and the crossbench senators Ricky Muir and John Madigan. At the time Xenophon said he had “worked for several months” with the environment minister, Greg Hunt, and climate experts to secure amendments to “introduce a safeguard mechanism which will see large emitters stay within baseline levels of emissions”. He said the “significant” amendments would strengthen the Direct Action package so that Australia was in a good position to negotiate an even better emissions reduction target in Paris next year."

"Britain’s next government will face a tougher time than expected reducing Whitehall’s annual spending deficit, according to the International Monetary Fund, which said lower tax receipts and uncertainty surrounding the election would undermine growth forecasts. The Washington-based organisation said the current prediction of a £7bn surplus in the last year of the next parliament would instead be a £7bn deficit. The forecast blows a hole in George Osborne’s hopes that keeping to strict public spending limits for the next five years will deliver a surplus. The Office for Budget Responsibility, which uses Treasury figures to make its forecasts of the public finances, says the UK is due to reach a surplus by 2019 under current plans.  High public debt levels pose headwinds to growth But the IMF warned that its officials took a gloomier view of the UK’s growth prospects over the next five years. Government spending may also need to be higher on welfare and tax credits than predicted by the OBR while the country gets back on track. “On the expenditure side, given uncertainties pertaining to the May elections, a slightly slower pace of consolidation than that in the [2015] budget is assumed for 2015/16 and beyond,” it said. Earlier this week the IMF warned that the UK’s stellar growth was due to slow from 2.7% this year to 2.3% in 2016. A judgment on the likelihood of a messy outcome to the election was behind that forecast, which it said would have knock-on effects for several years to come. The warning came as the IMF urged developed nations to capitalise on low oil prices by raising energy taxes and using the windfall to cut income taxes. It said the collapse in the oil price since last summer provided a chance to shift the burden of tax away from wages to help poorer workers left behind in the recovery. In its six-monthly monitor of government finances across member countries, the IMF said finance ministers should “seize the opportunity created by falling oil prices” to support initiatives that combat climate change and “provide breathing room for rebalancing the tax burden, for example, by lowering taxes on labour to boost employment”. In addition, developing economies should reduce energy subsidies that keep the cost of petrol artificially low “to provide space for productive spending on education, health and infrastructure, as well as for programmes to benefit the poor”, the report said. The call from the IMF reflects growing concerns at an expected rise in greenhouse gas emissions now that energy consumption is cheaper. In the past five years the UK has seen falling emissions, largely as a result of a decline in economic activity brought on by high oil prices.  Adding to the improving environmental picture, the AA has documented a sharp drop in road miles travelled by car drivers since the financial crash. Until recently that was thought to be a “new normal” as motorists changed their habits, but campaigners fear that the 50% decline in oil prices will spark a return to old ways. The IMF has long been concerned about stagnation in wages across Europe, the US and much of the developing world. It sees the switch in taxes away from wages to energy as killing two birds with one stone. Unfortunately for green campaigners, recent experience in the UK, where the coalition government has frozen the duty on petrol in successive budgets, has shown the popularity of holding down the cost of fuel for transport. Low-income groups have also benefited from lower heating bills, while businesses have used lower fuel bills to cut transport costs. The promise of lower income taxes at the expense of a return to energy bills nearer the levels seen before the collapse in oil is likely to be met with voter scepticism. With most governments under pressure to reduce outstanding debts, there will be concern that the money will be diverted to support government spending before it is used cut income taxes. The IMF’s warnings about the negative effects of the falling oil price could heighten these fears after it said the contribution of lower energy bills to inflation made it more difficult for governments to reduce debt levels. Vitor Gaspar, the IMF’s head of fiscal policy, said that while the recovery was supported by lower oil prices, looser monetary policy and a relaxation of austerity measures in most countries, risks to government finances had grown since last year. Inflation reduces the value of outstanding debt and makes it easier for governments to finance. With inflation at zero across much of Europe, including the UK, debt levels remain stuck unless ministers can agree a budget surplus. The former Portuguese finance minister said: “High public debt levels pose headwinds to growth. They also raise concerns about debt sustainability in some advanced economies. Furthermore, inflation is below target by a large margin in many countries. This makes the task of reducing high public debt levels more difficult.”"
"The Queensland government is investigating mining firm Adani over whether it removed material from a quarry without permission, it has emerged on the first day of a legal bid to stop the $16.5bn Carmichael coalmine. Llewellyn Lezar, head of mining operations at Adani, told Queensland’s land court that the company has “communicated” with the state government over its actions in the Red Hill quarry.  Lezar said Adani had taken minerals from the same quarry in 2013, only for it to emerge that “we didn’t have a permit for the actual use of the material”. No fine was paid but Adani had to pay for the material and the cost of the investigation. A spokesman for Queensland’s Department of Agriculture and Fisheries (Daf) said it was currently “gathering information” about the removal of 5,580 tonnes of state-owned quarry material. “Daf is presently in the initial stages of an investigation to determine whether or not Adani was authorised to remove and use this quarry material,” he said. “This quarry material is low-grade road construction type material.” The spokesman said that if the allegations are proven, Adani could be fined or prosecuted, but it was “unlikely that a breach of this nature and extent would adversely affect Adani’s future ability to obtain authorisation to remove state-owned quarry material”. Adani has been taken to court by environment group Coast and Country, which wants to halt the construction of the Carmichael mine in central Queensland. The mine, which has already been approved by the federal government, would extract up to 60m tonnes of coal a year and spread over an area of 280sq km, making it Australia’s largest coal project. Coast and Country claim the mine would adversely impact underground water flows, harm local flora and fauna and contribute significantly towards climate change through its emissions. Derec Davies, spokesman for Coast and Country, said: “These breaches are troubling. I’m concerned about the future of the million-year-old underground springs. It raises concern about Adani’s ability to protect the springs. “This mine is clearly too risky and too dangerous.” The first day of legal argument on Tuesday saw Coast and Country’s lawyer Saul Holt claim that the mine would cause “species-threatening harm” to the endangered black-throated finch, and may dry up the nearby Doongmabulla Springs. However, Peter Ambrose, for Adani, said the company had a range of offset and management plans to deal with these impacts, adding an extra 30,999ha of habitat to compensate for the loss caused by the mine. Ambrose added that the mine could produce net economic benefits of up to $22.8bn.  Adani would not comment further on the issue of the quarry material. The hearing will continue in the Queensland land court for the next four weeks."
"German energy companies say that construction of over half the country’s planned power plants could be scuppered if the country goes ahead with a leaked plan to set emissions budgets for the country’s biggest polluters. The proposed law would impose stiff financial penalties for the oldest and most inefficient coal and lignite plants, to be paid in the form of emissions trading certificates.  Clean energy industries and environmentalists see the plan, which would be phased in from 2017, as an essential step to meeting the government’s energiewende blueprint for a 40% cut in carbon output by 2020. But a German energy industry association survey found that 53% of investors in power plants scheduled to come online in the next decade had frozen their involvement in the projects because of political uncertainty.  “If politicians carry on as they do now then there will be no new, modern power stations. There are no incentives whatsoever for investments, despite politicians emphasising all the time that they aim to change this,” BDEW’s managing director said in a statement on Monday. “It is also likely that further closures will follow.” The issue is fast becoming a test of the German government’s commitment to decarbonise its economy, with German trades unions threatening mass mobilisations against a measure that they say would put 100,000 jobs at risk.  A spokesman for the European Trades Union Confederation told the Guardian that they would support unions wanting to ensure that climate action was taken in a way that preserved workers’ jobs and communities.  “We call for a just transition to a low carbon economy,” Julian Scola said. “This means that the energy revolution has got to be fair and workers and communities cannot simply be left behind. There have to be negotiations with trades unions and plans must be put in place to assist workers to upgrade their skills and move from high carbon to low carbon industries.” Opposition to the plan has been concentrated in the east German regions of North Rhine Westphalia and Saxony, which would be most affected. Many politicians from Angela Merkel’s governing coalition of Christian Democrats (CDU) and Social Democrats (SPD) have protested the new carbon limits. But the German SPD MEP, Jo Leinen told the Guardian: “If this proposal is abandoned, I think we will miss our climate goal. We would drive quite modern but more expensive gas power stations out of the market to continue with cheap coal and that’s not the idea behind the energiewende at all. This is about restructuring the German energy industry and phasing out coal.” He accepted though that existing schemes to retrain workers and offer them alternative jobs might be difficult to implement in areas such as Saxony.  Hard coal and lignite are responsible for a third of Germany’s greenhouse gas emissions, and make up 44% of the country’s electricity mix. They would be the prime target of the government plan to cut 22 million tonnes of CO2 equivalent (Mtce) by 2020, which is due to be debated in the Bundestag in the summer. Although the proposed measures would only affect the top 10% of the most CO2 intensive plants, BDEW spokesmen point to figures on the German energy regulator’s website which list 50 planned power plant closures.  The energy firms association calls for a renewed focus on combined heat and power, building renovations and electrified transport as alternative means of meeting Germany’s energiewende commitments. But clean energy experts say the figures cited by both employers and unions in Germany are alarmist and unrealistic. In 2013, the German utility RWE produced 125.7 (Mtce), Vattenfall emitted 70MtCO2e, and E.On generated 35MtCO2e. Sabrina Schulz, the head of the E3G environmental think tank in Berlin, said there was no evidence that the new emissions standard would cause job losses or electricity price hikes and the real risk lay elsewhere.  “If the government gives in now, an important window of opportunity will close and not open again for a long time,” she told the Guardian. “This would send the wrong message to the power sector and to investors. The transition needs to happen at any rate if Germany is serious about its climate goals. It will be way more painful and more expensive to start the transition process at a later stage.” Absent an emissions cutting plan, Germany would also lose credibility in international climate talks, at a time when Angela Merkel was stewarding German leadership of the G7, she added.

"US efforts to cut greenhouse gas emissions look set for a huge boost this year, with carbon pollution from the power sector set to fall to its lowest level since 1994. Record numbers of US coal-fired power plants are set to close this year, and analysts at Bloomberg New Energy Finance (BNEF) say this will likely see power sector emissions drop 15.4% below 2005 levels. Research published today indicates 23GW, 7% of US coal capacity, will come offline due to a combination of low gas prices, new mercury emission standards and the age of closing power plants. “On an emissions rate basis (t/MWh), 2015 will be the cleanest year in over 60 years for which we have historical data,” says the report. At the same time investment in renewables is rising fast, with a new 18 gigawatts (GW) of clean energy due to starting feeding into the US grid this year. BNEF says new solar installations will hit an “all-time high” of 9.1GW, led by California, while new wind build will hit 8.8GW, with a third of new projects in Texas. “More interesting than the single-year drop in emissions are the ‘structural’ impacts that will live on for decades,” said BNEF’s William Nelson, head of north american analysis. “Emissions can rise or fall year-to-year based on weather anomalies and volatile fuel prices – but in 2015, we’ll take a giant, permanent step towards decarbonizing our entire fleet of power plants.” Cutting its use of coal is a one of the main strategies in the Obama administration’s domestic and international efforts to address climate change. The US has a 2020 goal of curbing greenhouse gas emissions 17% on 2005 levels, and a 2030 target recently submitted to the UN of 28% cuts on 2005 levels. According to the US Energy Information Administration (EIA), in 2014 38% of US energy-related CO2 emissions came from the power generation sector. Of that 76% of emissions were from coal, with 22% from gas. The US coal power sector is set to face further restrictions once the Environmental Protection Agency’s clean power plan is finalized later this year. The EPA says it will help cut CO2 emissions from the power sector 30% on 2005 levels. The law is set to rule out the use of all but the most efficient coal plants. Critics in the Republican party say they will try and block the new legislation, which is being enforced under the existing Clean Air Act. Lead Republican Senator Mitch McConnell, who represents a staunch coal-mining constituency, has written to federal states suggesting they refuse to comply with the rules. Meanwhile, the two Republicans to have declared they will run for the 2016 presidency – Ted Cruz and Rand Paul – have both expressed doubts over the veracity of climate science. Separately, the charitable arm of ex New York mayor Michael Bloomberg’s business holdings has announced it will invest an extra $30m in efforts to replace half the US coal fleet with clean energy alternatives by 2017. The funds, which will be directed into the Sierra Club’s Beyond Coal Campaign, aim to back what Michael Bloomberg says is US leadership among industrialised countries in ditching fossil fuels. “Thanks to the community leaders who have spearheaded this work, the U.S. led every industrialized nation in reducing carbon emissions last year,” he said. “But much more work remains, and today we are doubling down on what has proven to be an incredibly successful strategy for improving public health and fighting climate change.” According to the Sierra Club, every 50GW of coal power removed from the grid prevents more than 3,600 deaths and 60,000 asthma attacks, saving $2.3 billion in health care costs every year. Earlier this week the White House launched its own health and climate drive, warning that rising temperatures would lead to more smog, allergies and deaths among vulnerable members of the community. It argued the new clean power plan would offer US$55-93 billion in “annual net benefits” from reducing pollution levels."

"It’s 16 March and the Guardian has launched an international climate change campaign calling on the world’s two largest charitable foundations to move their money out of fossil fuels. Slick, black oil drips down the front page and covers the news headlines on the website. So how does a team of journalists, used to doing journalism, go about campaigning? The biggest story in the world is the audio documentary that goes behind the scenes of the Guardian’s Keep it in the Ground campaign. You can download it every week here. In this week’s episode, the campaign goes live. The team gathers after the launch. It’s time to talk about the risks. Once the general election campaign is in full swing, Keep it in the Ground could get left behind. The Gates Foundation and the Wellcome Trust have responded and the ball is back in our court. Ricken Patel, founder of the global campaigning organisation Avaaz tells the team why his organisation haven’t campaigned on divestment.  Alan raises what is perhaps the biggest risk of all: what if the Guardian Media Group (GMG) doesn’t divest its own funds? What if readers decide to start their own campaign against the business? Where would that leave the journalists? The editor-in-chief is getting mixed messages from the commercial board. Finally, he is able to meet Neil Berkett and hear the news of their decision – will the company that owns the Guardian move out of fossil fuels? If you haven’t been following the inside story of the campaign, as told on the podcast, it’s not too late to start from the beginning. Episode one starts at Christmas with an email from the editor-in-chief. The team gathers in the new year and reaches a consensus: fossil fuels must be kept in the ground. In episode two, tensions appear. In the red corner, environmental columnist George Monbiot says we should we focus on the global climate change summit in Paris at the end of the year. In the blue corner, news editor James Randerson believes in the power of a campaign targeting corporations. In episode three, the Guardian became a campaigning organisation. The campaign will be on fossil fuel divestment. We pick our targets: the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation and the Wellcome Trust. In the latest episode published today, we finally go public. Follow all the campaign updates here."

"Last month Dutch MP Jan Vos told Europe’s largest pension fund ABP and hundreds of its members that he was disappointed at the fund’s lack of ambition to take on climate change, complaining that “there wasn’t enough urgency.” It’s a proclamation we can expect to be repeated in every corner of the globe over the coming months and years.   A clear trend is emerging across the world’s seven largest pension markets as governments actively look to pension funds for leadership and guidance. These owners of nearly $40 trillion in assets have been thrust into the spotlight thanks to climate change. Partly because of the obvious failings of their advisers and fund managers over the sub-prime crisis, and the new accountability generated by the divestment movement and the Asset Owners Disclosure Project, pension funds have started to take influence back from those whom they previously outsourced their functions to. UK secretary of state for energy and climate change Ed Davey’s understanding of their potential to address climate change is now being revealed as regular commentary, although picking carbon losers such as coal could quickly backfire if he doesn’t broaden the message into a risk-based one. For pension funds not used to the sophisticated public relations strategies of politicians there is only one choice and that is to respond positively. The lines meted out for more than a decade have not worked, and investors, politicians and increasingly the media are demanding accountability.   Indeed a major part of portfolio risk is the slow pace of government response and there is nothing in the fiduciary duty that removes the obligation to hedge a portfolio against political intransigence. The prize now is to see which type of democracy will come out on top. At the ABP meeting last month, vice chair Jose Meijer was confronted by hundreds of investors and questioned for more than an hour and a half over divestment, carbon risk and its engagement with Royal Dutch Shell.  The new financial democracy is now in play and while Meijer pointed out that the audience may not have been completely representative, the onus on pension funds will be to disclose and defend their risk strategies to members on a vast scale.  Maybe we can hire Wembley stadium and invite members from one of the UK’s largest pension funds, the Universities Superannuation Scheme, for a new carbon-risk vote? I suspect technology will have an important role to play, as accommodating its 2.8 million members would require a Wembley sellout for a month. Whatever the accountability process, the problem for the funds is that the real underlying risk analysis hasn’t been done properly. While ABP is indeed a leader in the climate risk area and Meijer defended ABP’s advisers and analysts, the judgement and homework required to look forward on risk rather than backwards has still not yet been completed.  The rear-facing allocation models of their advisers and the short-term trading orientation of their fund managers is simply not fit for purpose. Politicians are starting to realise this weakness too and are going in for the kill. We could yet see the solution to climate change without a single carbon price shot being fired. • This article was amended on 7 April 2015, an earlier version incorrectly named Dutch MP Jan Vos as Jan Bos.

"Changes to the climate have had major impacts on the oceans and the biological systems that live there. A new study sheds more light on how fast these systems respond to changes. What the authors find is that short term climate changes can require 1,000 years for recovery. This means the current harm caused to the deep oceans by the changing climate will last for many centuries to come.  The new study, published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences by Dr. Sarah Moffitt and her colleagues is novel for a number of reasons. The researchers took core samples from ocean floor regions off the coast of California. The location was chosen in part because of the exceptional synchrony between sediment archives from offshore California and ice core records from the Greenland Ice sheet.  The authors’ method was novel because they sampled many different types of creatures, not merely the single-celled organisms that are most commonly studied. In fact, the authors included Mollusca, Echinodermata, Arthropods, and Annelida samples (approximately 5,000 fossils). There was major “turnover” in these animals with only small changes to oxygen levels.  Using the ocean sediment core, the authors were able to travel back in time to the last deglaciation. They connected cooling and warming events to increases and decreases in the oxygen contained within the waters. Past events of abrupt warming, which occurred in decades to centuries and were accompanied by subsurface oxygen loss, significantly impacted the types and numbers of animals found within the sediments. Recovery from this abrupt, climate-forced disturbance can take 1,000 years. Among the changes documented are expansions and intensification of oxygen poor regions. These regions, called “Oxygen Minimum Zones” get larger when the oceans warm. As these oxygen poor zones get larger, there is a predominance of animals that thrive in low-oxygen environments. Animals that need higher levels of oxygen suffer and die off. It isn’t just that one ecosystem replaces another. Rather, a rich diversity of oxygen-loving biology is replaced by a much smaller diversity of low-population low-oxygen biology, and in particular single-celled organisms. In short, the ocean floor changes from a rainforest to a desert. I asked Dr. Moffitt about her research and she said, Past events of climate warming are informative laboratories to understand the ecological consequences of abrupt changes in ocean circulation and temperature. We demonstrated that marine ecosystems can be disrupted by climate events on the timescales of multiple decades, but a subsequent recovery can take a thousand years to be complete. Fundamentally, what you can take away from this research is the vulnerability of the deep sea – truly an enormous biome on the planet – to abrupt warming. This research is important for us today because we are causing rapid changes to the environment of the ocean and the ocean floor. We can expect these changes to impact biodiversity of the open ocean and seafloor. We now know that it will take a very long time for those biological systems to recover, basically the changes will be permanent from our standpoint. All of this makes more clear the need to take action to preserve the quality of the ocean habitat for animals and plants that live there."
"The extraction of coal from Australia’s biggest mine would not directly affect the Great Barrier Reef but burning it would help push the climate to a dangerous state, a Queensland court has heard.  The conservation group Coast and Country is objecting to Adani’s plans to build the $16.5bn Carmichael mine in the Galilee basin. The Indian mining giant intends to export at least 50m tonnes of coal a year from the Abbot Point terminal, north of Bowen.  Coast and Country says the project would contribute to climate change when the coal is burned overseas, and carbon emissions would damage the reef through ocean acidification.  The Queensland land court heard on Tuesday that a UN agreement between 200 countries dictates global warming should be kept under 2C. That threshold would be reached after the emission of roughly 850 gigatonnes of C02, the University of Queensland’s Ove Hoegh-Guldberg told the court. The marine sciences professor said the Carmichael project could contribute 4.5 gigatonnes of emissions. “We’re talking about 0.5% of the total emissions left … before we push the climate into a very dangerous state,” he said. “That’s an enormous amount of C02 over the life of the mine.” Adani argues the need for coal is driven by demand, not supply, and if the project did not go ahead coal-fired power stations would simply find other sources.  Peter Ambrose, a lawyer for Adani, said the situation was similar to when a motorist drove a car emitting C02: the car manufacturer was not directly responsible for the subsequent damage. “It’s not possible that the mere extraction could damage the Great Barrier Reef,” he put to Hoegh-Guldberg.  The professor agreed: “The mere extraction, digging up the coal and putting it into a boat, doesn’t have an impact.”  The case is expected to run until the end of April."

"In its 6 April issue the most stylish American general magazine of politics and culture, the New Yorker, published an essay on climate change by perhaps the most celebrated American novelist, Jonathan Franzen. As Franzen is incapable of mounting an argument, his formal case is barely worth refuting. However, what Franzen feels about the question of climate change and, even more, what he is willing to admit about what he feels, illuminates something about the sensibility of contemporary liberal America that seems to me to matter a great deal. “Artists”, Ezra Pound once proclaimed “are the antennae of the race”. If so, the signal Franzen has received and then sent out is very bad news indeed. First the formal case. Franzen likens those who fear the impending catastrophe of climate change to guilt-ridden Puritans waiting for the coming of the Apocalyse. He regards those who care in the present about the wellbeing of living creatures, like himself in the case of birds, as belonging to the tradition of St Francis of Assisi. According to Franzen, there is a cultural conflict between the Apocalyptic Puritan climate activists and the humble and gentle Franciscan conservationists. Most troubling for him, climate change is such an overwhelming and overbearing issue that it has forced conservationists into retreat.   What then is the evidence for this conflict? Apart from a comment of an obscure blogger in an obscure American newspaper, none is presented. This is no accident. To me, Franzen’s case is absurd. Every climate activist I know believes in the struggle to save the whale. Politically speaking, for them, the Sea Shepherd and the Rainbow Warrior sail together.  Or take the instance of Australia. At present the most important conservation battle is for the future of the Great Barrier Reef. The most committed and effective groups engaged in this struggle are those central to the fight against climate change – like Greenpeace and the Australian Youth Climate Coalition. Throughout rural Queensland the fight to preserve the natural environment from the fracking corporations, and throughout the Hunter Valley in New South Wales, the fight to save rich farmlands from the ever-expanding coal mining corporations, have created unlikely alliances of farming communities defending their country and climate change activists. Franzen’s claim about a conflict between conservation and climate activism is psychologically-driven, a product of his private prejudices, irritations and resentments. It seems to me that Franzen’s core argument not only lacks anything that looks like evidence but is obviously pursued without any real interest in the politics of climate change. Franzen tells us that at Copenhagen Barack Obama “was frank about how much action the American political system could deliver on climate change action: none. Without the United States … a global agreement isn’t global, and other countries have little incentive to sign it. Basically, America has veto power, and we’ve exercised it again and again.” The clear implication of this passage is that the US under Obama has made no commitments to emissions reductions. Does Franzen not know that on 12 November 2014, in a historic agreement with China, Obama pledged a US reduction of carbon emissions of 26-28% below 2005 levels by 2025?  Does the New Yorker discard its small army of fact checkers when publishing the work of the Great American Novelist? Without blushing, he tells us that in general he doesn’t read books about climate change. Recently however a friend recommended Dale Jamieson’s Reason in Dark Times. Franzen tells us he couldn’t put it down. Why Jamieson’s far from original book appealed to Franzen is apparent from its subtitle: “Why the Struggle Against Climate Change Failed – And What It Means for Our Future.” What Franzen admires about Jamieson’s book is not merely the argument that the struggle against climate change is already lost. He is excited by the cool academic, angst-free, disinterested tone in which the conclusion – that human beings have already decided to allow the Earth to be destroyed for future generations and other species – is reached.  Franzen tells us that he once imagined he would find a book that arrived at the view that the Earth is destined for disaster “depressing”. But if anything, Jamieson’s conclusion seems to have cheered him up. Even though, he tells us, he is acutely aware of his carbon footprint and, as a residual Puritan himself, has always felt vaguely guilty about it, his reason now convinces him that individual action is entirely useless when it comes to contributing to the solution of the impending climate change catastrophe.  Franzen asks: “Shouldn’t our responsibility to other people, both living and not yet born, compel us to take radical action on climate change?” As his personal emissions amount to 0.0000001% of the total, he understands however “that it makes no difference to the climate whether any individual, myself included, drives to work or rides a bike”. What then is to be done? His answer is basically to give up.  Absence any indication of direct harm, what makes intuitive moral sense is to live the life I was given, be a good citizen, be kind to people near me, and conserve as well as I can. Franzen’s logic is flawed. No one would abandon the fight against racism on the ground that the problem could not be solved by individual acts of kindness to African Americans. But the logic is also revealing. Embedded in the hyper-individualist liberal consumer society, it apparently has not occurred to Franzen that commitment to the struggle against the climate change catastrophe is not about private lifestyle choices but collective political activity, or that rather than arguing that we have no alternative to abandoning hope, an author with his kind of public authority might lend his voice to the cause to which individuals like Al Gore, James Hansen, Bill McKibben and Naomi Klein have devoted their lives.  At this point in his essay, it appears to me that Franzen reveals one of the elements that is really driving him – his hostility to the climate change movement. Given that a destroyed planet is a “done deal”, he argues that our only real choice is between the “palliation and sympathy” for the Earth shown by the conservationists or the “disfiguring aggression” of the climate activists, revealed in their willingness to force hideous windfarms on the landscape for no better reason than to briefly delay the inevitable arrival of climate catastrophe.  Franzen has coined an unpleasant term for those who accept the implications of the scientists. They are called “climatists”, as dismissive a term as “warmists” used by those who, unlike Franzen, do not accept the conclusions of the climate scientists.  “Like globalism’’, Franzen tells us, “climatism alienates”. And not only that. Climatists even threaten the natural world.  As long as mitigating climate change trumps all other environmental concerns, no landscape on earth is safe … Only an appreciation of nature as a collection of specific threatened habitats, rather than as an abstract thing that is ‘dying,’ can avert the complete denaturing of the world. By now in the topsy-turvy Franzen worldview, the disfiguringly aggressive climatists have become the enemies of the earth. Only the gentle Franciscans like himself, who know there is nothing to be done about climate change, and who offer palliative help to what they love, are its true friends. In his wonderful essay on Henry Miller, Inside the Whale, George Orwell tells of how he encountered Miller on his way to fighting against fascism in the Spanish civil war. Miller told Orwell he was a fool, unless he was travelling to Spain for some aesthetic purpose. Orwell thought Miller was an important novelist but he also was perplexed by his indifference to the coming totalitarian world. Miller was, like Jonah, inside the whale, “allowing himself to be swallowed, remaining passive, accepting.”  For Orwell, this was impossible. Jonathan Franzen is the Henry Miller of our age. Except that his irresponsibility is worse because, unlike Miller, he pretends it is occasioned by something admirable, his Franciscan-conservationist love of nature. Franzen describes climate change as not only a tragedy but also as a “weird comedy”. (For my part, I’m afraid, the comedic element contained in the suffering that will be occasioned by a four or six degree increase in the temperature of the earth escapes me.) Is Franzen really asking us to accept, without fuss, our generation’s willingness to look on passively, even cheerfully, as eyes wide open and with a nonchalant shrug of the shoulders, we watch as our consumer society destroys the material conditions that have allowed human civilisation to flourish over the millennia? In the end what Franzen seems to be saying is this: The prospect will be grim for humans and other species, but the worst is in the future, there is nothing we can do about it, and anyhow – and this is what I fear his cultural antennae have picked up and are signalling back to his audience – if we are honest with ourselves, who really in their hearts gives a damn about the destruction of a once human-friendly Earth?  So far as I am aware, no one of his cultural stature has expressed such a “daring” thought before. This is why Franzen’s New Yorker article might tell us something rather unpleasant that we nonetheless need to know. "

"Vast areas of forest in Canada and Russia were lost to fire in 2013, according to new satellite data. But there were encouraging signs from Indonesia, where the loss of forest cover fell to the lowest level in a decade. Scientists from Global Forest Watch collated 400,000 images of the Earth’s surface to map the world’s forests down to a resolution of 30 metres. Their findings showed that overall the world lost 18m hectares of forest in 2013.   Between 2011 and 2013 fires in the boreal forests of Canada and Russia accounted for almost a quarter of global forest losses. Some of this will return, but northern forests are particularly slow to recover after fire. Boreal forests are one of the world’s great carbon sinks. But scientists predict that climate change will cause them to burn more often and with greater intensity, unlocking the carbon stored in the wood and soil. Already they are burning more than at any point in the past 10,000 years. Dr Nigel Sizer, study co-author and director of the forests programme for the World Resources Institute (WRI), said the increase of fires in northern forests had worrying implications for the climate. “If global warming is leading to more fires in boreal forests, which in turn leads to more emissions from those forests, which in turn leads to more climate change. This is one of those positive feedback loops that should be of great concern to policy makers.” Dimitry Aksenov, the director of Russian NGO Transparent World said: “In Russia, according to official statistics and to experts, the dominant amount of fires are caused by humans.” As many as 90-95% of fires in Russia are ignited by human interventions, he said. “This is very different to North America.” Forestry and oil and gas exploration have driven roads through previously inaccessible forests, increasing the risk of fires. Olga Gershenzon, founder of Russian commercial satellite imagery company ScanEx who contributed to the data, said forest management and fire prevention in Russia and Canada was in need of improvement. “This should be a clear call to action to look closely at forest management in Russia and Canada in the face of climate change. The massive tree cover loss shows there is much to be improved in terms of monitoring and understanding the causes and types of forest fires.” Around 70% of the Russian and Canadian losses could be attributed to fire. The researchers said logging and pests could also account for the increased loss of northern forests. Brazil, the US and Indonesia rounded out the five largest contributors to tree-cover loss between 2011 and 2013. But in a sign that recent efforts to tackle deforestation may be working, Indonesian forest losses bucked their recent trend by falling to their lowest level in a decade in 2013. WRI scientists said it was too early to know whether the destruction of the country’s rainforest was coming under control. Recent forest preservation efforts have been bolstered by mercurial market effects, such as a drop in palm oil prices, which have almost halved since 2012. Additionally, many of Indonesia’s accessible forest have already been cleared. Because of the massive loss of its forests and peatlands, Indonesia has become the world’s third largest emitter of carbon dioxide. The new government of Joko Widodo has made stemming deforestation a major commitment. Indonesia’s minister of environment and forests Siti Nurbaya said the news was positive but didn’t amount to a turnaround. “It is too early to say this is a definitive trend, and the ministry is now examining how our numbers compare with this finding. If it holds true, this could be a powerful indicator that Indonesia’s significant investments in forest protection are paying off. We intend to take additional steps to ensure these positive trends continue.” Agustin Teras Narang, the governor of Central Kalimantan province in Borneo said his region had seen its forests protected through cooperation between local communities, regional and national government and the UN’s REDD+ programme, which offers financial incentives for forest protection."
"A research vessel is adrift in the Arctic to study why sea ice is retreating faster than expected. Ice cover across the northern ocean fell to a new low last month, reaching just over 14.5m sq km at its winter peak, according to the National Snow and Ice Data Centre, in Colorado.  That was 130,000 sq km smaller than the previous winter low set in 2011 – confounding scientific predictions about the decline of sea ice under climate change. “We are obviously missing something,” said Harald Steen, a biologist from the Norwegian Polar Institute, and the leader of the international expedition. “We are underestimating the rate of ice disappearance in the north.” The RV Lance set out on 11 January with 30 scientists and crew, who planned to spend an entire season on the sea ice, from winter freeze to break-up in early summer. A separate expedition to the high Arctic, using a hovercraft, has spent six months crossing the Lomonosov ridge, a submarine mountain range near the north pole with peaks as high as the Alps. The researchers on the RV Lance are trying to understand how snow, sea water, wind and ocean currents drive the formation and break-up of younger, thinner sea ice. For the first six weeks, the RV Lance crew operated in the absolute darkness of the polar night, venturing out at temperatures approaching minus 40C to explore surrounding ice floes on foot, skis or snowmobiles. “You have an environment that is pitch dark and it is cold – minus 35, minus 37 – and there is a little bit of wind and it is rather hostile,” Steen said. The ship has got stuck in pack ice on at least two occasions and had to be towed out by the Norwegian coast guard. There were a few close encounters with polar bears. The scientists rotate through on six-week shifts. The RV Lance will make only occasional use of its engines, Steen said. Otherwise, the ship will just go with the ice floes drifting in a clockwise direction across the ocean at a speed of 0.2 knots: about the pace of a very lazy stroll. Much remains unknown about the Arctic, about what causes ice to form and break up, and about how the changes in the sea ice affect wider climate system. Those process have changed over the past three decades as the Arctic experiences warmer temperatures. Researchers have suggested the decline in sea ice has disrupted the jet stream, and could be responsible for the ferociously cold winters in North America. The researchers aim to drift at the edge of the ice, tracking the gulf stream and the east Greenland current as they empty into the Arctic, and lowering buoys from the ship to measure ice mass balance, snow and sea water seeping up through cracks in the ice."
"You Talk, They Listen is a series of events we’re hosting at universities around the UK – each focussing on the topics you care about most in the run-up to the election. From climate change, to freedom of speech and immigration – young people talk and politicians listen. Rick Edwards, TV presenter and writer, will host each night – so you may get the chance to quiz him on his new book, None of the Above, on why young people aren’t voting and why they should be. What should politicians and the media be doing to save the world from climate change?  University of Sussex, 15 April 2015 Ivor Gaber, professor of journalism at the University of Sussex Paul MacInnes, Guardian journalist and editor of the GuideLucy Siegle, Observer journalist on environmental issuesAdam Vaughan, editor of the Guardian’s environment siteJim Watson, professor of energy policy at the University of Sussex 1) Divest from fossil fuels. Sussex student union president Abe Baldry kicked off the evening praising the national student-led campaign for university divestment from fossil fuels. Adam Vaughn said the call for divestment is relevant to everyone from universities, to the church, politicians and the media. And Lucy Siegle said the Guardian’s Keep it in the ground campaign is reinvigorating passions about the environment.  2) Modernise how we talk about climate change. “Climate change denial is so five years ago,” said Vivek Rajcoomar, 26, a Sussex student running to be a Green councillor in a Brighton and Hove ward next month. Young people all know how climate change works. So let’s stop rehashing old arguments. The journalists on the panel agreed that the media’s coverage is often doom-mongering and off-putting – to engage readers you need to give them something positive to aim for. And young people must find ways to get their own stories about the environment across. “With social media, we could be doing more ourselves to share environmental stories and evidence of climate change,” said one student, “using apps like Meerkat and Periscope.” 3) Take lifestyle choices seriously. Alternative lifestyles are not to be scoffed at. Young members of the audience spoke with passion about their quest to reduce carbon emissions by becoming vegan, cycling everywhere and boycotting flying. “We need to build a better picture of what a zero-carbon lifestyle looks like,” said Green MP Caroline Lucas from the floor. People might be more encouraged to reduce their carbon emissions if wearable devices, along the lines of Fitbits, existed to gamify the process, said Paul MacInnes. We need to stop tinkering around the edges and be more radical. 4) Our current climate change targets aren’t robust or ambitious enough. The key target of the 2008 Climate Change Act – reducing UK emissions by at least 80% by 2050 from 1990 levels – is still risky in terms of holding back global warming. It doesn’t go far enough, said Lucas. Panellists pointed to the cursory mention of climate change in the parties’ latest manifestos and in the election campaign so far. We need to hold the parties to account, they said. Apart from the Greens, the parties all want to build more roads, expand airports, support fracking and continue fossil fuel subsidies. 5) Don’t let austerity take the focus off the environment. Use environmental initiatives to help us out of the economic crisis. MacInnes highlighted a community solar panel project in Hackney giving people control over their energy supply. Lucas said investing in home insulation would create green jobs that could benefit young people and those out of work, while reducing our fuel bills and emissions and addressing fuel poverty. “This is just straightforward common sense,” she said."

"A Labour government would push for even tougher climate change targets to stop the world’s temperature warming to a dangerous level, Caroline Flint has told the Guardian. With 250 days to go until the end of the Paris climate summit, Flint – who was shadow energy secretary in the last parliament – has raised concerns that current plans submitted by countries do not go far enough to stop a 2C rise in global temperature. Labour will champion a goal of zero net global emissions in the second half of this century and push for stricter targets in Europe than the current goal of a 40% cut by 2030, she said. Asked what new level she wanted, she said: “Because of Ed Miliband’s Climate Change Act of 2008, we’ve already got a 60% target by 2030 in the UK so I think there is scope to do more in the EU. We’re already on track to meet our 2020 target so I think with the right leadership we can do a lot more and only Labour can provide that leadership.” She said David Cameron was a “guy who put a wind turbine on his house and now backs a moratorium on wind and a guy who was hugging a husky but now talks about ‘cutting the green crap’”. “He just hasn’t got the leadership or influence to craft a more ambitious proposal. He plans to spend two years should he be re-elected renegotiating our membership of the EU or sleepwalking out of it. It’s not going to help us get a deal in Paris in December.” Flint made the comments in the week that countries had a deadline for submitting their pledges for managing their greenhouse gas emissions. So far only 32 developed countries have submitted their plans and these only cover 29% of global emissions. Labour said analysis of the plans submitted so far reveals they would lead to about 3C of warming, not the 2C above pre-industrial levels needed to avoid unmanageable consequences. Staying below 2C was an obligation undertaken by the world’s governments at the global climate summit in Cancún in 2010.  Labour has previously said it will commit to a legally binding target to take the carbon out of the UK’s electricity supply by 2030 and bring in a new climate change adaptation plan, including a thorough assessment of the financial risks of global warming."

"Five years ago this week, the European Space Agency’s CryoSat mission reached orbit, on its second attempt. CryoSat measures the thickness of polar ice, a key parameter in studies of climate change. Approved in 1999, the 750kg satellite was built during the opening years of the millennium and sent to Russia for launch. On 8 October 2005, CryoSat took to the skies, but minutes into the ascent a bug in the flight control system meant the rocket did not shut down properly and the whole lot fell back to Earth, plunging into the Arctic Sea it was supposed to monitor.  ESA rebuilt the mission and tried again. This time, they chose a Dnepr rocket, which is a conversion of Russia’s most power intercontinental ballistic missile, the SS-18 Satan. The launch took place on 8 April 2010, and CryoSat-2 entered low Earth orbit to begin mapping the ice sheets using radar. Flying at an altitude of 700km, CryoSat measures the height of ice sheets to an accuracy of less than a centimetre. It has shown that the average ice volume has been relatively stable over the last five years, but with large variations from year-to-year. Comparison with previous ice missions suggests that ice volume is shrinking. It is therefore important to continue monitoring to understand what is the accurate long-term trend. CryoSat can also measure sea level. In December 2013, it registered a tsunami-like storm surge caused by high water eating through the Kattegat sea between Denmark and Sweden. This proved valuable for testing computer models of such storm surges."

"Polar bears face starvation as their frozen habitat shrinks because they will not adapt to land-based foods, according to new research. As the sea ice around the Arctic declines, scientists have theorised that the great bears may adapt to forage and hunt on land. But in a report published in the journal Frontiers in Ecology on Wednesday, scientists from the US Geological Survey (USGS) said it was doubtful polar bears could find salvation in the caribou, goose eggs and berries of the north.  “Current evidence suggests it is unlikely terrestrial foods can make up for the calories polar bears lose out on in places where they are staying onshore longer than they have in the past,” said study author Karyn Rode, a wildlife biologist at the USGS. “In western Hudson Bay, during years when polar bears spend more time onshore and the ice-free period is longest, survival rates are lowest despite observed terrestrial feeding.” Polar bears have evolved to survive on the energy-rich, fatty flesh of seals. In the regions around the ice edges, they naturally spend the summer months on land. Because the species of seal they target don’t haul out on land, polar bears survive the winter mostly on their stored fat. With the shrinking ice – which reached a record low winter extent this year – these onshore stints have been getting longer. While polar bears have been observed feeding on land since the 1400s, some observations suggest the behaviour is becoming more common.  Scientists have been uncertain whether land-based food could act as a substitute for their rich winter diet. But Rode says there is little evidence to show they can adapt. Polar bears forced off the ice have to compete with their cousins, the brown bears. Polar bears are often twice the size of brown bears and therefore need more energy to survive. In a region of sparse resources, already inhabited by a direct competitor, the study said, polar bears will struggle. The study also looks at the devastating knock-on effect the bears onshore migration could have on other species. It notes that all the goose eggs in Canada’s Hudson Bay, could maintain the 900 local polar bears for just a day and a half. This would have a “catastrophic effect on bird populations”, said the authors. Steven Amstrup, chief scientist at Polar Bears International, said the research supported his previous findings that “as the sea ice goes, so goes the polar bear”. “We generally expect to lose two-thirds of the world’s bears by midcentury and possibly the rest by the end of the century if we don’t mitigate the rise in greenhouse gases.” Amstrup said increasing sightings of polar bears eating food on land did not prove they were successfully adapting to an iceless north. “There is a big difference between the fact of eating something and the nutritional value of that eating. Think, for example of the difference between you eating a head of lettuce and a steak. Both may fill you up, but the energy density and overall nutritional contributions are very different,” he said.  “If substantial numbers of polar bears were actually benefiting from terrestrial foods, we would expect to see these declining trends reverse or at least stabilise. But we are not.”"

"Today a group of eminent jurists accuse governments and enterprises of being in clear and flagrant breach of their legal obligations on climate change – under human rights law, international law, environmental law, and tort law. Human ravaging of our planet and climate through relentless fossil fuel extraction and greenhouse gas emissions is undoubtedly the defining existential challenge of our time. Our collective failure to commit to meaningful reductions in emissions is a political and moral travesty, with catastrophic implications, particularly for the poorest and most marginalised, domestically and globally.  The dismal pace of international negotiations – and the prospect of yet more disappointment at the UN Paris conference in December – is why the Guardian has thrown its weight behind a divestment campaign, pressurising moral investors to take a stand against those responsible for the greatest emissions. After all, two-thirds of all greenhouse emissions come from just 90 coal, oil and gas companies. But in the Oslo Principles on Global Climate Change Obligations – launching in London today – a working group of current and ex-judges, advocates and professors, drawn from each region of the world, argue that any new international agreement will just be a coda to obligations already present, pressing and unavoidable in existing law. What the Oslo principles offer is a solution to our infuriating impasse in which governments – especially those from developed nations, responsible for 70% of the world’s emissions between 1890 and 2007 – are in effect saying: “We all agree that something needs to be done, but we cannot agree on who has to do what and how much. In the absence of any such agreement, we have no obligation to do anything.” The Oslo principles bring a battery of legal arguments to dispute and disarm that second claim. In essence, the working group asserts that governments are violating their legal duties if they each act in a way that, collectively, is known to lead to grave harms. Governments will retort that they cannot know their obligations to reduce emissions in the absence of an international agreement. The working group’s response is that they can know this, already, and with sufficient precision. There is a clear answer to the question of each country’s reasonable share, based on a permissible quantum of emissions per capita that never threatens the perilous 2C mean temperature increase that would profoundly and irreversibly affect all life on earth. This reasonable share is what nations owe on the basis of their common but differentiated responsibilities for contributing to climate change. The Oslo principles duly incorporate mechanisms to accommodate the differential impacts and demands on nations and enterprises, particularly in the least developed countries. Backed by distinguished international lawyers, professors and judges, the principles are a template for courts, advocates and lawmakers to act swiftly, embodying the urgency, conviction and black-letter reasoning required if humanity is to turn the corner before it is too late. The document is the product of an independent, rigorous, multi-year effort led by Yale University’s Professor Thomas Pogge, and Jaap Spier, the advocate-general of the Netherlands supreme court. It is championed by, among others, Antonio Benjamin, the Brazilian high court justice; Michael Kirby, a former Australian high court justice; Dinah Shelton, a former president of the inter-American commission on human rights; and Elisabeth Steiner, a judge at the European court of human rights. These principles deserve detailed consideration by lawyers, scientists, advocates and – critically – the policymakers engaged in last-ditch negotiations in Paris in December to divert us from the path towards climate catastrophe. They provide some opinio juris that allows judges to prohibit conduct that, practised by many or all states, will cause enormous damage to people and the planet. But the working group’s core message is that we simply cannot wait in the pious hope that short-term-minded governments and enterprises will save us; and that when we act it must be on the basis of equity and justice, according to law. Every year that we miss increases the challenge and risk. We’ve squandered decades already, and our window for action is closing. We must act now."

"If you try hard enough – and sometimes you don’t have to try hard at all – you can find all sorts of crazyballs evidence-free misleading gumph out there on the intertubes. Many of the proponents are so blinded by their own ideology and beliefs that they can perform all manner of logical gymnastics to tell themselves that they’re right and the experts are wrong.  Some are utterly convinced that dude absolutely was abducted by a single-toed space alien, Elvis totally used to work at the local chip shop, humans didn’t evolve but were “designed” and there’s no evidence that extra carbon dioxide causes climate change. But none of this should mean those views deserve to get a run in a national newspaper. Occasionally though, they do. So here are a few things you could have learned from the opinion page of the Australian newspaper this week about the Great Barrier Reef and ocean acidification – the phenomenon where extra carbon dioxide in the atmosphere from burning fossil fuels makes the oceans more acidic. There are two things to know about these points. The first is that they were all made by Canadian climate science denier Patrick Moore, who has not written a single peer-reviewed scientific paper on the subject of ocean acidification (or on anything else in the recent past, as far as I can tell. He got his ecology Ph.D in 1974).  The second thing to know (not surprising when you know the first thing) is that all Moore’s statements are wrong, irrelevant or misleading. How do I know?  Because I asked some actual experts to review Moore’s column - well respected scientists at universities who have researched and published papers on ocean acidification in the world’s leading journals. Professor Malcolm McCulloch, of the University of Western Australia, said Moore’s column was “ill-informed and highly misleading”. Professor Ove Hoegh-Guldberg, of the University of Queensland, said it was “all very wrong”. Other scientists told me Moore’s article was “nonsense”, “BS” and displayed “ignorance and misunderstanding”.  The Australian described Patrick Moore as a “co-founder and former leader of Greenpeace” and “chair of ecology, energy and prosperity with Canada’s Frontier Centre for Public Policy”. Moore left Greenpeace almost 30 years ago. Greenpeace says he wasn’t a founder, but he was around in the early days. Moore took his job at the Frontier Centre – a Canadian “free market” think tank that doesn’t reveal its funders – in late 2014.  In the substantial gap between, Moore has spent his time as an adviser or advocate for industries including mining, forestry and pulp and paper. He has been a vocal supporter of the nuclear energy and GM foods industries. In an interview earlier this year, Moore defended the herbicide glyphosate, a “probable carcinogen” according to the World Heath Organisation. Moore claimed that you could “drink a whole quart” and it would not harm you. When the interviewer offered a glass of it to drink, Moore refused, saying “I’m not an idiot”. In recent years, Moore has continually claimed that carbon dioxide from burning fossil fuels will be good for the planet. With support from a climate science denial group, Moore toured Australia last year telling people climate science was largely a scam.  Just because Moore has no genuine expertise in ocean acidification, that doesn’t necessarily make him wrong. So let’s dive in to the murky waters of Moore’s unique and twisted take on the science of ocean acidification. Moore tells the Australian’s readers that around the year 2005 “ocean acidification was invented to provide yet another apocalyptic scenario” because, according to Moore, global warming had stopped (it hasn’t). It’s a conspiracy, you see. Professor Christopher Langdon, of the Rosenstiel School of Marine and Atmospheric Science at the University of Miami, has been working on ocean acidification and its impacts on marine life since the late 1990s. Was the science he was working on in the late 90s really invented half a decade later?  The research on the effects of Ocean Acidification on corals and coral reefs began much earlier (than 2005). Kleypas et al 1999 Science, Langdon et al 2000 Global Biogeochem Cycles, Marubini et al 2001 Marine Ecol Prog Ser.  There was an explosion of research in 2005 because the US funding agencies NSF and NOAA won approval from Congress (Federal Ocean Acidification Research and Monitoring Act) to increase funding into this important issue because it was threatening commercial aquaculture operations on the west coast. No big conspiracy, just clearly considered decisions by a lot of very conservative policy makers and scientists. That’s one myth dissolved then. Next? Moore told readers that because CO2 levels had been higher during periods hundreds of millions of years ago and that corals and shellfish had “evolved early and obviously managed to survive through eras of much higher CO2” that this disproved predictions that species would become extinct.  Dr Matthew Clarkson, of Otago University in New Zealand, was the lead author of a paper published in Science earlier this month finding that acidifying oceans were to blame for a mass extinction event 250m years ago that killed 90% of all marine species. Clarkson told me: Moore’s point represents a common misunderstanding of a very complex subject. Moore is referring to equilibrium steady states that represent a balanced and stable world on million year timescales. In geological history it is only when the system is perturbed rapidly that life on Earth is detrimentally affected, and pushed to a mass extinction. This happens when the rate of change exceeds the evolutionary ability to cope. The high CO2 levels we see today (and will see in the future form anthropogenic emissions) are extreme compared to the equilibrium state of the modern climate system; thus represent a large and rapid perturbation. Even in past states of high steady-state CO2, such as the Late Permian that might have had two to three times present atmospheric levels of CO2, a rapid input of more CO2 caused a perturbation to the system that manifested as acidification and mass extinction. Eventually the system will balance and equilibrium is restored, but this is can take tens of thousands of years.  Clarkson added that it took five million years after the mass extinction around 250m years ago for modern corals to appear, which only happened “when the ocean conditions were perfect”. Professor Philip Munday, of James Cook Univeristy in Queensland, told me:  All life on Earth can trace its origins back through periods of deep geological time when the environmental conditions were very different from today. That does not mean that modern species, living in the present-day, must also be tolerant to those ancient conditions – that premise is clearly absurd. A tropical reef fish could no more survive in the southern ocean as an Antarctic ice fish could survive on a coral reef, yet both have evolved from a common ancestor in their evolutionary past. Importantly, species alive today have adapted to the environmental conditions experienced in their recent evolutionary history. Yet, in a period of just a few hundred years, humans have pushed atmospheric CO2 levels beyond levels seen in at least 800,000 years, and we are on a trajectory to CO2 levels not seen for tens of millions of years by the end of this century. This extraordinarily rapid rate of change will challenge the ability of many species to adapt. Next! Moore claimed that because oceans had a “high concentration of basic elements such as calcium and magnesium” that this acted to buffer any large swings in pH and so corals would be fine. Professor Malcolm McCulloch’s response was, erm, “no”. He said measurements made off Hawaii and Bermuda “show the pH of the open ocean is declining – this is real and the cause is rising levels of atmospheric CO2. As a whole the oceans have limited buffering especially on short-time scales - tens to hundreds of years.” Next. Moore states in his column, which by now has already amassed an impressive array of wrongness, that there are clams and mussels that grow their own shells in freshwater that’s acidic, and that this somehow means that species producing their own shells in oceans will be fine if things get worse. Munday says: The vast majority of mollusc species, such as clams and mussels, live in the ocean. A few have adapted to freshwater, and some have even adapted to live on land (e.g. garden snails), but this evolution took millions of years and special adaptations. The fact that some molluscs have adapted to low-pH freshwater environments over millions of years is not evidence that molluscs currently living in the ocean will be able to tolerate acidification occurring over a few decades. Next. Moore makes an entirely misleading point that when water gets warmer “the gases dissolved tend to outgas” meaning that if the oceans are warming, which they are, this will mean they’ll expel more CO2 and all will be good in the world. He even provides a nifty kitchen test, when he writes: “It’s the same phenomenon that happens in a glass of cold water taken from the fridge and placed on a counter at room temperature. The bubbles that form on the ­inside of the glass as it warms are the gases that were dissolved in the colder water.”  This is right, but is it even relevant? McCulloch said: The increased uptake of CO2 from higher atmospheric concentrations is more than compensated by the reduced solubility of CO2 in seawater due to ocean warming. Because the oceans are cooler at the poles this is where the greatest uptake of CO2 generally occurs. Atmospheric concentrations of CO2 have gone up by about 120 parts per million since the start of the industrial revolution.  McCulloch said the warmer ocean waters “roughly speaking” had effectively reduced this ocean uptake to 100 ppm, rather than 120ppm. Next. Moore tries to concoct another household example for readers, by saying that “people who have saltwater aquariums sometimes add CO2 to the water in order to increase coral growth and to increase plant growth” and that this means that CO2 is therefore great for marine life. McCulloch says: “Wrong again”. Aquarists only rarely add CO2 – generally calcium carbonate is added to increase alkalinity as well as calcium, or for alkalinity alone sodium bicarbonate is often added. The chemical reality is that addition of CO2 reduces carbonate ion concentrations essential for calcification – so if you want the oceans to be algae dominated continue adding CO2 and nutrients. Corals however generally prefer low CO2, low nutrient waters.  Munday adds:  Additional CO2 can increase the competitive ability of algae, potentially allowing the fast growing algae to overgrow and smother corals. Coral reefs under stress can shift into algal dominated states, especially in places where herbivores are overfished. So in other words, if you want a Great Barrier Reef that’s covered in slime, then follow Patrick Moore’s advice (tourism operators should consider how to market slime tours to the international tourism market). Next. Finally (because this is getting tedious, or has been tedious for a few hundred words already ... but I’ve started so I’ll finish), Moore moves on to coral bleaching – a phenomenon where corals loose their vivid colours as a stress reaction to high ocean temperatures.  The fact that incidents of coral bleaching have nothing to do with ocean acidification seems, in Moore’s mind, to be irrelevant. Moore cherry-picks the case of the remote Scott Reef, off the northwest of Australia, which was heavily bleached in 1998 but recovered after about 15 years. One study into what the future might hold for coral reefs if emissions continue to rise was published in the journal Nature Climate Change in 2013. The study found that even if emissions were cut drastically, it was likely that reefs around the world would experience coral bleaching annually from about the year 2047. Some areas, including the location of Scott Reef, would likely experience annual bleaching between five and 15 years earlier than this. When you are a reef that needs 15 years to recover from bleaching, how do you recover when the conditions are ripe for you to bleach every year? Probably the world’s leading expert on coral bleaching is Professor Ove Hoegh-Guldberg, of the University of Queensland. He said Moore was guilty of “cherry-picking” the case of Scott Reef in order to make a point.  Moore has got this all very wrong. Yes there are examples where reefs recovered after that 1998 bleaching event. But a large number of reefs have not. Moore is not giving the full story. Acidifying oceans means that corals put down calcium carbonate at lower rates. This affects the ability of corals to grow back. We are weakening the ability of reefs to recover and tipping the balance between construction and destruction. This is no really about mortality – it’s about the failure of the whole system. Next. What really surprised Hoegh-Guldberg was how Moore “feels experienced enough to comment on these matters” when he had no record of studying them in the academic literature. He said: If I wanted to know about matters of medicine then I’d go to a medical doctor, not a spin doctor. This is exactly what’s happening here. The Australian newspaper, owned by climate science “sceptic” Rupert Murdoch, has a track record of providing a forum to non-experts on climate science. Moore’s effort was an embarrassing and barely plausible mix of half-truths, misinterpretations and errors from a non-expert. Perfect, it seems, for the Australian’s opinion pages."

"The Conservative energy and climate change minister, Matthew Hancock, has taken £18,000 from a key backer of the UK’s leading climate sceptic lobby group, the Guardian can disclose.  According to official records, Hancock has accepted five donations over the years from City currency manager Neil Record, who has given money to the Global Warming Policy Foundation and is on the board of its campaigning arm.  The most recent donation to the MP was £4,000 in November last year – after Hancock became a minister with responsibility for energy.  Record has separately given more than £300,000 to the Conservative party but Hancock is the only individual MP that he has backed, according to the Electoral Commission. The Global Warming Policy Foundation, chaired by former Conservative chancellor Lord Nigel Lawson, is well known for casting doubt on established climate change science.  In September, Record and Lord Nigel Vinson were the first two backers of the organisation to confirm their contributions after years of speculation about who was financing the outfit.  When the Global Warming Policy Foundation was found to have breached Charity Commission rules on impartiality, Record was made a board member of its new non-charitable campaigning arm, the Global Warming Policy Forum. The link between Record and Hancock was uncovered by Greenpeace, whose director John Sauven said it further undermined the government’s record on climate change. “It says something that we have an energy and climate change minster who hates wind, loves fracking and accepts large sums of cash from a central figure in a climate sceptic lobby group,” he said. Asked whether Hancock had ever discussed energy policy with Record and declared the link to the Department for Energy and Climate Change, a spokeswoman for the minister said: “All donations are declared publicly and proper process followed.” Record said he never discussed energy policy with Hancock but confirmed his view that the science of climate change is not “settled” was well-known. “Over the past several years, I have provided some research support for Matthew Hancock, in my view an impressive 2010-entry MP,” he said.  “I resolved to do this when Matthew was a backbencher and, since then, Matthew has had several ministerial responsibilities and only recently has energy become part of his portfolio.  “I have never discussed energy policy or climate change with Matthew. Our discussions tend to centre round our mutual interest in economics; we both started our careers as economists at the Bank of England.” He said his views on climate change were on public record. “I believe that the important scientific enquiry required for us to understand man’s effect on the climate is being hampered by a monolithic ‘establishment’ view that the science is settled,” Record said. Record added that he believed some of the “current popular political choices for carbon reduction [wind; solar in high latitudes] are woefully inefficient and unsustainable [because they require subsidies]”. Labour’s Caroline Flint said the donation showed “why the Tories can’t tackle climate change and have zero credibility on this issue”. “Matt Hancock, the minister for energy and climate change, has reportedly taken money from someone linked to the country’s biggest propagandists of climate change scepticism,” the shadow energy and climate change secretary said.  “The Tory party all the way to the top are not the right people to negotiate a better deal for the world to tackle climate change.” Hancock was last week criticised by green campaigners for hiring a private jet to fly himself back to London from Aberdeen after signing a climate change deal with the Mexican president. The Guardian revealed that the Tory MP for West Suffolk chartered an aircraft along with two Foreign Office diplomats for the 100-minute flight even though there were 16 scheduled services from Aberdeen to four London airports that day."

"Where is climate change in the election? Apart from occasional mentions by Green Party leader Natalie Bennett - who else? - our greatest collective threat has not appeared in any of the painfully stiff and staged political interviews. Climate change is not so much the elephant in the room, it’s the elephant in the cellar, stuffed as far away as possible from the debate and ignored by the politicians and the pundits who follow their every feeble soundbite. Both are taking their lead from a wider public silence. In no poll does climate change, or even the wider issue of ‘environment’, make it into the public’s top 10 electoral concerns. The Climate Coalition, which brings together over 100 civil society organisations, is challenging this silence, inviting activists to raise “the Climate Question” with their candidates. When directly prompted to talk about climate change, though, most people will freely admit to deep concern. However there is also a deep and dangerous political split on this issue: whereas two-thirds of Labour Party voters believe that we are changing the climate, two-thirds of Conservative party voters believe that it is down to natural causes, or not happening at all.  In this painfully tight election, the main parties are playing a defensive strategy, avoiding issues that might create divisions within the critical centre-ground. Neither cares much about the concerns of left-leaning environmentalists. The more outspoken we become, the more convinced they will become that this issue is irrelevant to the frontline electoral battle.  And this is why, for all of who are concerned about this issue, the overarching campaign priority must be engaging and mobilising centre-right voters. Politicians need to be hearing about climate change from them - not us - on doorsteps, in hustings, and especially in their focus groups and polls.  But how do we reach them? Drawing on extensive academic research, the Oxford based charity, the Climate Outreach Information Network,  argues that centre-right voters can only be engaged effectively around their own values. In its new Election Guide to Talking to the Centre Right it tells communicators to drop “the eco-talk” and the distancing language that frames climate change as a future problem, impacting other countries and species or a crisis of capitalism. Instead, it says, concentrate on the positive benefits of energy transition, the immediate threats to property, landscapes and health, and the longer-term opportunity to restore our national pride and identity.  There are also powerful arguments for centre-right candidates about why they should become more vocal. 69% of Tory voters want to see their party adopt a strong policy to tackle climate change – substantially more than say they are concerned about climate change itself! Research from the US explains this seeming paradox by arguing that climate change could have an “aura effect”, improving the overall perception of a candidate or party as worthy of holding power. Testing during the last US presidential election found that “pro-climate” positions significantly increased support from independent/floating voters without losing support from conservatives.  And nowhere is this more important than for winning the support of young voters who want clear evidence that the political process is relevant to their interests. A fifth of first time voters rate environment as a major issue in their voting intentions. This concern crosses political boundaries and  a quarter of young Conservative voters are “very concerned” about climate change - more than twice as many as middle-aged voters.  Climate change is never straightforward. It is based on scientific facts but transmitted though social stories.  People who remain unconvinced about the threat still see it as a proxy for trustworthiness and fitness to rule. People expect political action but do not demand it. And, below the public silence are deep currents of concern, especially among young people.  What is missing is the glue that holds this together - the narrative of combined national purpose that can bring this into the political arena. And this will require the mobilisation of the entire political spectrum."

"Barack Obama on Tuesday highlighted the impact of climate change on public health, hours after the White House unveiled an initiative targeting adverse health effects caused by extreme weather and greenhouse gas emissions. “There are a whole host of public health impacts that are going to hit home,” Obama said at a roundtable discussion with health professionals at Howard University in Washington DC, citing rising asthma rates and the prospects of nontraditional insect-borne diseases soon moving to North America. “Ultimately ... all of our families are going to be vulnerable. You can’t cordon yourself off from air or from climate.”  The event marked the latest effort by the president to raise the spectre of climate change and use the bully pulpit to defend steps his administration has taken to curb greenhouse gas emissions. As part of its campaign linking climate change to public health, the administration will bring together the medical and scientific community for a series of meetings at the White House – including a climate change and health summit with US surgeon general Dr Vivek Murthy this spring. Both Murthy and Gina McCarthy, the head of the Environmental Protection Agency, joined Obama at the meeting, which the White House timed with National Public Health Week. Much of the discussion focused on the worsening of asthma due to pollution and ozone exposure, an issue that has been attributed to climate change by the American Thoracic Society. Murthy said the issue was “personal” for him, since he once lost an uncle to a severe asthma attack. “We have more people exposed to triggers that can cause asthma attacks, and more asthma attacks mean more days of school missed. They mean more days of work missed. They mean more costly trips to the doctor,” Murthy said. “And they most importantly mean more scary moments for parents and for children.” In a background call with reporters ahead of the event, administration officials identified the elderly, children, minorities, the sick and low-income individuals as being at particularly high risk levels for injuries caused by extreme weather. “The president has been consistently focused on the fact that no challenge poses a greater threat to future generations than climate change,” said Brian Deese, a top Obama adviser. “This is not just a future threat – this is a present threat ... Climate change is posing a threat to more people, in more places, to their public health.” In recent months, Obama has shown more aggression in his environmental policy – appeasing activists who have long criticized the president for not enacting climate change policies sooner. In November, Obama announced a $3bn commitment by the US to an international fund that seeks to help developing countries address climate change. He also reached a historic bilateral climate agreement with China, under which the US will cut its emissions by 26-28% by 2025. Several medical groups applauded Obama’s public health activities, including the American Lung Association.“Too many people think climate change is something that will happen far into the future, but we are already seeing impacts on our health today,” Harold Wimmer, the group’s national president and CEO, said in a statement. “Now is the time for bold action to protect our health and our communities from the dangerous impacts of carbon pollution and climate change – especially the health of our most vulnerable populations, children, seniors, people with chronic diseases like asthma.” Republicans vehemently oppose Obama’s climate agenda, which has been taken to court by Peabody Energy, the nation’s largest coal company. In an unexpected turn of events, Laurence Tribe – the liberal constitutional law professor whom Obama worked for at Harvard Law School – has agreed to argue on behalf of Peabody against the legality of the administration’s climate actions. The overwhelming majority of Americans believe in global warming, according to most polling, and broadly support strategies to address climate change, including increased regulation and limits on coal-fired power plants."

"Charities that work on solving problems connected to climate change should not invest in fossil fuel companies that are “out of kilter” with their charitable aims, according to top environmentalist Jonathon Porritt.  He spent years working on green energy projects with BP and Shell but now believes that engagement with fossil fuel companies is pointless.  Porritt, who is the founding director of the sustainability non-profit Forum for the Future (FFF), said fossil fuel companies had passed by “limitless opportunities to put their houses in order” and transition to a more sustainable economy.  “[They’re] all smart, are paid god knows how much money to steer through these complex areas, are betraying shareholders in terms of securing long-term value creation and risking the destruction of massive value inside the company.  There comes a point when you say this isn’t going anywhere and we have to try something else.” In March, the Guardian launched its Keep it in the Ground campaign calling on the world’s largest charitable foundations – the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation and the Wellcome Trust – to divest their endowments from fossil fuels companies.  More than 220 institutions – including pension funds, universities and faith organisations – around the world have now made the commitment to divest from fossil fuels in a fast-growing campaign started by the environmental organisation 350.org. According to a series of scientific analyses, between two-thirds and four-fifths of the world’s proven fossil fuels must be left in the ground if global warming is to avoid surpassing the 2C limit for dangerous climate change agreed at international negotiations.  The Wellcome Trust, which funds medical research including ground-breaking work on malaria and ebola, has refused to divest, arguing that their holdings allow them to actively engage with fossil fuel companies, which they say is a more effective strategy for environmental progress. You either go along with the [fossil fuel] company’s reassurances or you say ‘that’s not good enough' Writing in the Guardian, director Jeremy Farrar said: “We understand the attraction of the grand gesture for which the Guardian is calling, but such a gesture can be made only once. By maintaining our positions, we meet boards again and again, supporting their best environmental initiatives and challenging their worst.” He added: “when we are not satisfied that a company is engaging with our concerns, we are perfectly prepared to sell.” Porritt described the medical charity’s position as “probably tosh”, arguing: “both [the Wellcome Trust and the Gates Foundation] are in a seriously hard place: both pursue public good objectives and have been extremely outspoken about the impact of climate change. You cannot persist with a set of investment principles that are totally out of kilter with the mission of your charity.” He continued: “if you’re sitting in Wellcome you’ve got a choice – you either go along with the [fossil fuel] company’s reassurances or you say ‘that’s not good enough: give us some evidence that you’ve done the hard work – show us what your company is going to do in a 2C world. Show us how you’re going to diversify your portfolio and protect shareholder value over the next 15 years, not over the next two years. Do all of that work in the public domain and maybe then we will think about maintaining our holding in your company.’” The foundations should pursue a “progressive” divestment strategy said Porritt, by first removing their endowments from exclusive to integrated coal companies, followed by gas then oil corporations. Founded in 1996, FFF previously had sustainability partnerships working with four of the big six energy companies; one of their founding projects was working with BP Solar to investigate the upcoming solar market. However, Porritt said he ended the partnerships when it became clear that: “us and others had not succeeded in persuading enough people inside the company to begin to reduce the degree to which the extraction of fossil fuels contributes to their profits.” Porritt was prominent in the early rise of the Green Party – then called the Ecology Party – in the 1970s and was its chair for several years. He went on to become director of Friends of the Earth in the UK. He has advised the Prince of Wales, Marks & Spencer and government, leading the Sustainable Development Commission.  Porritt said that fossil fuel companies had made “a genuine attempt” to work through the issues of climate change: “We persevered working with Shell and BP for a long period of time. There was a genuine opportunity to reduce dependence on fossil fuels and ramp up the annual investments in everything else – efficiency, renewables, better understanding of how energy is used in society, and possibly even carbon capture and storage. They looked at it hard and moved away.” Porritt said it is “difficult” to know if shareholders could make more of an impact by divesting from or engaging with fossil fuel companies but said he would be “hard put” to find an example of where shareholder engagement on its own had led to change.  He said: “It depends very much on the nature of the organisation looking to divest and the degree to which their investment strategy is judged to be compatible with their core mission.”     "
"Investors who have dumped holdings in fossil fuel companies have outperformed those that remain invested in coal, oil and gas over the past five years according to analysis by the world’s leading stock market index company,  MSCI, which runs global indices used by more than 6,000 pension and hedge funds, found that investors who divested from fossil fuel companies would have earned an average return of 13% a year since 2010, compared to the 11.8%-a-year return earned by conventional investors.   The figures indicate that if a major charitable institution or foundation with £100m in funds had divested from fossil fuels in November 2010 they would be around £7m better off today than if they had maintained their holdings in coal, oil and gas companies. In total, a portfolio of shares with fossil fuel companies included has grown in value by 62.2% since 2010, but this compares to the 69.9% growth of a fund without fossil fuel investments.  The data will challenge the widespread belief among asset managers that divestment hurts the financial performance of investment funds.  One reason why funds without fossil fuel companies have outperformed is that the precipitous fall in the oil price that began in June last year has driven down the share price of companies such as BP and Shell. But the MSCI data reveals that its ‘All Companies ex Fossil Fuels Index’ outperformed throughout 2012 and 2013, before the fall in the oil price.  Matt Davis, director of Share Action, a charity campaigning for responsible investment, said: “The conventional wisdom amongst financial experts is that ‘you have to have fossil fuels in your portfolio in order to get good returns’, but these figures call that into question.  “Not everyone wants to divest because some believe that engagement with fossil fuel companies is the best way to get them to change their ways, and we do believe the two approaches can exist side-by-side. But whereas the industry belief seems to be that there is little demand for fossil-free savings products, these figures do give added weight to our ‘I want to break fossil free’ campaign, which says that regular savers should be offered low-cost ways to save fossil free, if they choose to.” MSCI launched the index late last year amid growing pressure from both climate-focused campaign groups such as 350.org and demands from major charitable groups and foundations with large endowments for investment funds that are free of fossil fuel companies. It analysed the 9,500 biggest stock market-quoted companies around the world, worth $37.5tn in total, and tracked their performance over the last five years. It found that eliminating fossil fuel companies reduced the ‘investable universe’ by 7%, to $34.9tn, but improved returns for investors.  However, it added that before the financial crisis struck in 2007, investors who included fossil fuel companies in their portfolios would have outperformed those that excluded them. Before 2007, most resources companies enjoyed a long boom in sales and profits, driven by ravenous demand from China’s industrialisation.  The indices run by MSCI, similar to those such as the FTSE 100 in the UK, are hugely influential among institutional investors. Around $7.5tn in funds globally are benchmarked against MSCI world indices, and apart from the Ex-Fossil Fuel Index, the company (which originated from Wall Street investment bank Morgan Stanley) has also launched “low carbon” indices that eliminate 70%-90% of major carbon emitters.  It is understood that several major foundations and charitable institutions are in negotiation to switch their benchmark from the standard MSCI World Index to the ex-fossil fuel or low-carbon world indices, with announcements expected later this year. By switching benchmarks, institutions effectively divest from fossil fuels. The indices will also provide a stepping stone for pension funds to offer individual members a route to personally divest from fossil fuels.  In Britain, major institutions that look after billions in pension savings from small investors have also begun assessing the long-term financial risk that coal, oil and gas companies will become ‘stranded assets’ worth much less than their book value today.  In November, Standard Life, which manages £250bn on behalf of five million savers, undertook research into stranded assets which concluded that the greatest risk for investors was holding shares in coal companies.  It said: “The research has stimulated a frank discussion between investors and fossil fuel companies about the likelihood of a carbon-constrained world and its financial implications. In our view, thermal coal is the fossil fuel most vulnerable to climate regulation.” HSBC and Aviva have also funded a four-year research programme at Oxford University into the risks posed by stranded assets.

"BP pumped billions of pounds into low-carbon technology and green energy over a number of decades but gradually retired the programme to focus almost exclusively on its fossil fuel business, the Guardian has established. At one stage the company, whose annual general meeting is in London on Thursday, was spending in-house around $450m (£300m) a year on research alone - the equivalent of $830m today.  The energy efficiency programme employed 4,400 research scientists and R&D support staff at bases in Sunbury, Berkshire, and Cleveland, Ohio, among other locations, while $8bn was directly invested over five years in zero- or low-carbon energy.  But almost all of the technology was sold off and much of the research locked away in a private corporate archive. Facing shareholders at its AGM, company executives will insist they are playing a responsible role in a world facing dangerous climate change, not least by supporting arguments for a global carbon price. But the company, which once promised to go “beyond petroleum” will come under fire both inside the meeting and outside from some shareholders and campaigners who argue BP is playing fast and loose with the environment by not making meaningful moves away from fossil fuels. In 2015, BP will spend $20bn on projects worldwide but only a fraction will go into activities other than fossil fuel extraction. An investigation by the Guardian has established that the British oil company is doing far less now on developing low-carbon technologies than it was in the 1980s and early 1990s. Back then it was engaged in a massive internal research and development (R&D) programme into energy efficiency and alternative energy.  Even before the then Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher had put climate change on the international political map with a landmark speech in 1988, the company was doing ground-breaking work into photovoltaic solar panels, wave power and domestic energy efficiency as part of a wider drive to understand how greenhouse gas emissions could be curbed. Two houses on the site at Sunbury were used in experiments. One was retrofitted with special insulation, ground source heat pumps and other systems which have now become mainstream. “All the reports that we produced were filed away and contain a huge mass of information. We had been researching alternative energies for years going back to the early 1980s,” said one senior scientist involved in the BP programme who did not want to be named. A major cost-cutting drive in 1993 forced the end of R&D as a standalone department. It was reduced in scale, merged with the engineering department and told to concentrate on oil and chemical research. Much of the renewable energy research is now kept in a formal BP archive based at the Modern Records Centre, a part of the main library at Warwick University, which describes itself as “a history of the modern world”. The oil company employs its own librarians at the site who insist that only pre-1976 material on issues such as solar power are available to journalists and the public. A spokesman for BP insisted that the company was now spending $660m on research, half of that in-house at locations such as Sunbury and he denied that any energy efficiency drive was being wound down. 20% of R&D is still said to be going towards “a low-carbon transition” .  But he accepted that the company had retreated from renewable energy which had once had its own separate headquarters and chief executive, saying it was up to others to do that work. Greenpeace said it was time that BP handed over all the research it had gained from its decades of work. “By keeping this wealth of research under lock and key BP is putting narrow corporate interests before humanity’s hopes to tackle one of its greatest challenges, said a spokesman. “BP could score a PR victory by releasing this information, in the same way that Tesla released some of their energy patents to boost innovation in the sector. Not pursuing its clean energy project might have been a missed opportunity for BP, but the rest of us can’t afford to make the same mistake.” As recently as 2003 the then-chief executive John Browne appeared to see a bright future for a low-carbon energy group, bringing in Ogilvy & Mather to launch a $200m rebranding campaign. BP introduced its new slogan “Beyond Petroleum” and changed its 70-year-old, shield-style logo to a more upbeat and eco-friendly green and yellow sunburst. Six years earlier Browne had differentiated himself from his rivals by leaving the main industry body campaigning against carbon controls, the Global Climate Coalition, instead talking openly of the threat caused by global warming. By 2007 Browne had left the company to his successor Tony Hayward who closed down BP Solar in 2011, on the grounds that it did not make money. “The continuing global economic challenges have significantly impacted the solar industry, making it difficult to sustain long-term returns for the company, despite our best efforts,” BP said in an internal letter to staff at the time. Two years earlier, in 2009, Hayward had scrapped BP Alternative Energy as a stand-alone business, slashed its budget and said goodbye to its boss Vivienne Cox. In 2013, under an even newer chief executive, Bob Dudley, all the wind farms which at one stage were located in nine different American states and produced 2,600 megawatts were put up for sale. BP failed to find a buyer and continues to hang on to them. The company also retains a Brazilian biofuels business but has halted all work on carbon capture and storage. BP continues to invest in carbon-heavy tar sands operations as well as its traditional oil and gas fields and yet it accepts that some reserves will have to remain in the ground to beat global warming. “We agree that burning all known (fossil fuel reserves) would raise global temperature by more than 2C and that potential greenhouse gas regulation to prevent this from happening could reduce the value of some reserves and the companies that own them,” said the spokesman. But it says that 56% of its exploration and development activities are now based on gas as opposed to oil. BP also argues that it is working hard to promote and develop biofuels, has an intensive energy efficiency programme in place and factors in a carbon price of $40 to all its projects. It says it addresses potential climate impacts at the design phase. A major group of shareholders have called on the company to address climate change more robustly through a resolution to be heard at the AGM. BP management says it supports the resolution but ultimately believes that politicians must take primary responsibility for tackling global warming and hastening in a low-carbon future. “It is clear that it is the role of governments and regulators to set the boundary conditions for the policy framework which is needed to bring about this transition. BP’s role is to develop its business within that framework,” the spokesman added. Suzanne Dhaliwal from the UK Tar Sands Network said support for the AGM resolution looked hollow when the company was still engaged in carbon-heavy extraction activities. “It looks like a stalling mechanism to get large shareholders on board but from a grass roots level commitments to tackling climate change and continuing with tar sands are incompatible.”  Many leading environmentalists such as Jonathan Porritt and Bill McKibben believe fossil fuel companies will never play a leading role in any move to a low-carbon economy. McKibben says: “BP’s ‘beyond petroleum’ shtick was one of the great PR moves of all time, but it never amounted to anything – nor will the pious purring noises they’re making now,” he argues. “If they want to lead they’ll pledge to stop looking for new hydrocarbons. I’m guessing they won’t, and that we will need to fight them every step of the way.”"
"It’s been 23 years since investor activists first tried to get the oil business to face up to the risks of climate change. Progress has been painfully slow and gains have been few. Now many campaigners have concluded that engagement is not delivering anywhere near fast enough: it is time to sever ties with fossil fuel companies. “Engagement is useless,” said Bevis Longstreth, a securities and exchange commissioner during the Reagan administration, who has signed on to the divestment campaign by Harvard alumni who are calling on that university to shift its investments from fossil fuels. Oil and gas companies were never going to give up their core business because of shareholder proposals, he argues. “The engagement process has had some effectiveness with issues that don’t go to the heart and soul and pocketbook of directors and officers.” When it comes to the massive changes required of fossil fuel companies he reaches for a tobacco analogy. “When you ask Philip Morris to stop making cigarettes, you are really barking up a different tree and they are not going to do that.” The experiences over the past two decades of working with BP, ConocoPhillips, ExxonMobil, Shell and other companies led Shelley Alpern, advocacy director for Clean Yield Asset Management to a similar conclusion: investor pressure was painfully slow in pushing companies to reform. “For years they equally ignored both the very small investor who was filing resolutions with token shares and the very large investor coming in with hundreds of thousands of shares,” she said. With the gathering urgency of climate change, time is running out. “My job description is to be a shareholder activist but we are just at this critical moment with fossil fuel companies, and it really is all hands on deck to deliver the strongest political message that the world’s governments have to enact meaningful carbon constraints,” Alpern said. Investors have made headway in pushing companies to disclose their carbon footprint and their potential liabilities – in terms of fossil fuel holdings that could be stranded in a carbon-constrained world, or facilities at risk from sea-level rise or the other effects of climate change. That’s no longer enough, said Alpern, whose firm manages $275m (£186m) in assets. “The resolutions are too soft. It’s been a lot about further transparency or setting goals to reduce operational emissions. At this point we think it needs to be filing shareholder proposals – like one that I am aware of with ExxonMobil – asking the company to reduce capital expenditures on high-cost risky development such as the tar sands and return that capital to shareholders.” It’s an even bigger ask to press energy companies to put out a plan for their managed decline, she said. “What they need to do is unprecedented. They need to change their core business model in almost no time flat. They need to acknowledge that 80% of proven reserves is dangerous to bring to production,” she said. “It flies in the face of any precedent for an industry to just say: ‘yes, the times are changing, and we are going to basically almost put ourselves out of business or radically reform’.” The frustration at the lack of real progress has driven the growing fossil fuel divestment movement. Over 200 organisations including universities, colleges, churches and philanthropic funds worth over $50bn (£33bn) have now committed shift their investments from coal, oil and gas. Last month, Guardian launched its Keep it in the Ground campaign which calls on two of the world’s largest charitable funds, the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation and the Wellcome Trust, to withdraw their holdings in coal, oil and gas companies. In his response to the campaign, the head of the Wellcome Trust Jeremy Farrar argued that engagement was a better way to effect change: “Our view is that it is more constructive and effective to take a case-by-case approach to investments in the energy sector ... with active engagement with the companies in which we invest. We use our access to boards to encourage them to adopt more transparent and sustainable policies that support transition towards a low-carbon economy.” Many activists agree. In the past two decades, shareholder activists have brought more than 150 climate proposals to fossil fuel companies and more than 650 similar proposals to other businesses, according to the Interfaith Center on Corporate Responsibility. But Ellen Dorsey, head of the Wallace Global Fund, which began divesting six years ago and has mobilised philanthropies to pull their funds out of fossil fuels, says progress has been too slow.  “It’s not working in a time-frame that is commensurate with the science,” she said. An effective engagement strategy needs clear goals, Dorsey said. Companies must be held to account if they don’t hit defined benchmarks.  She argues that divestment delivers a much bigger bang for the buck than shareholder engagement, by putting pressure on companies while motivating the public. “I thought it could be very effective for changing the debate about climate change, and to put a sharp point on the industry itself,” she said. “Everyone was trying to figure out how to move the needle ... Effort after effort to move policy, but at a certain point the system isn’t responding.” In a very significant move, the United Nations agency guiding negotiations for a global climate change agreement next December recently came out in favour of divestment – as a means of sending a message to coal companies that “the age of ‘burn what you like, when you like’ cannot continue”. But not everyone agrees. The Ceres green business network, the Interfaith Center for Corporate Responsibility and the Carbon Tracker Initiative argue divestment should be left as a last step – to be used only when all other points of pressure are exhausted. And they argue that point has not yet arrived. Industry is now more susceptible than ever to investor pressure as the reality sinks in of a carbon-constrained future. The World Bank chief, Jim Yong Kim, who is adamant that the world must leave most of the world’s fossil fuels in the ground and has asked the bank to review its own holdings in coal, oil and gas, endorses this view. The divestment campaign has re-energised the debate about climate change, he told divestment activists at a speech in Georgetown University in March. “The conversation in the last year has changed dramatically, I think. What you guys have done to change the public conversation is a very good thing,” he told campaigners. “I just say: ‘don’t put all of your eggs in one basket’.” Investor activists have not given up either. Activists have put up at least 76 climate proposals ahead of the coming season of annual general meetings, asking fossil fuel companies about their climate plans, the high cost of fossil fuel extraction, and the risks of transporting oil by rail. Energy companies are also being pressed on their plans to protect their assets from sea level rise and other climate-fuelled disasters, according to a list compiled last month by Proxy Preview. The fall in oil prices has also strengthened the financial argument for getting out of fossil fuels, campaign groups said. Over the past several months, Shell and Statoil have dropped plans to drill for oil in the Alberta tar sands, and Chevron has given up on exploration in the Canadian Arctic. The industry has cancelled some $170bn (£114bn) in new projects, according to Jeremy Leggett of Carbon Tracker. “The writing is very clear for those with the eyes to see that this is a bubble in the process of going pop,” he said. “There are multiple examples of places you can go in the world where it makes no economic sense to bring the stuff up out of the ground, never mind about climate change,” he said. Andrew Logan, who oversees the oil and gas programme at Ceres, argued there was still time to persuade oil and gas companies to give up on drilling for new oil – especially with the high costs of deepwater drilling, tar sands extraction and Arctic exploration – and manage an orderly transition to cleaner future. It was too late for coal, but he said he saw a business future for oil and gas companies even in a carbon-constrained world. “The industry is still generating a fair amount of cash flow from older, low-cost projects,” he said. “We think there is a strategy for the Exxons and Chevrons of this world to milk those projects as long as they can and go out of business in a very profitable and long-term way, or put those profits into something that is more sustainable in a carbon-constrained world.” He argued that managed decline could even help mobilise the trillions of investment needed for the transition to clean sources of energy if, for example, oil companies diverted their enormous capital expenditure budgets into clean energy. “Divestment in it and of itself is not going to have the impact that we need. It is not going to move massive industries,” Logan said. “The simple truth is that if something isn’t done about how the oil industry invests its capital it’s just not going to be possible for the world to meet its climate change goals.” Longstreth countered that engagement at this point is giving oil and gas companies an easy out – helping them to postpone the day when governments impose stricter emissions cuts. His old university, Harvard, has given those oil companies additional cover by refusing to divest, he argued. The only worthy point of engagement now, he said, was to persuade fossil fuel companies to themselves lobby for the elimination of industry subsidies or stronger regulation. Alpern, despite her frustrations, was not going that far. “I haven’t given up entirely on filing shareholder resolutions,” she said. But she thought it would be more effective for investors to divest the bulk of their fossil fuel holdings, retaining a nominal amount to maintain a communications channel as shareholders. “Engagement without divestment is like having laws on the books with no police to enforcement them,” she said. “Let’s get some teeth.”          "
"Major economies would boost their prosperity, employment levels and health prospects if they took actions that limited global warming to 2c, according to the first analysis of emissions pledges made before the UN climate summit in Paris later this year.    Europe has promised a 40% emissions cut by 2030, compared to 1990 levels – and the report says this will bring real benefits, including 70,000 full-time jobs, the prevention of around 6,000 pollution-related deaths, and a €33bn cut in fossil fuel imports. But if emissions were slashed by around 55% – the study’s proposed route for holding global warming to two degrees – those benefits would multiply to $173bn fuel savings, 420,000 full-time clean energy jobs and 46,000 lives saved, its authors say. 31 March is the deadline for developed countries to submit their climate pledges for the conference (so called Intended Nationally Determined Contributions, INDCs), but few have yet done so and nations such as Canada and Japan are expected to miss the bell.  “This report adds to the growing body of evidence that greater climate ambition means better health,” said Anne Stauffer, the deputy director of the Health and Environment Alliance.  “The massive health benefits expected from mitigation action not only include premature deaths avoided but also reduced healthcare costs and increased productivity. This should be welcome news for European decision-makers.” In other parts of the world, the effects of increased climate ambition would be even more dramatic, according to the New Climate Institute’s (NCI) analysis which uses data from the International Energy Agency. Putting China on course for a world warmed only by two degrees would save over a million lives and create almost 2m jobs – compared to the 100,000 lives and 500,000 jobs set out in its climate deal with the US. Comparable figures in the US for a 2C pathway would see 650,000 new jobs created and 27,000 deaths avoided. “Despite the major achievements of the INDCs, this study has shown that the potential co-benefits of strengthening INDCs to meet a 2C compatible trajectory are many times higher than those already achieved,” the paper says. Global temperatures have already risen by 0.85 degrees since 1880, according to the UN’s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). As the warming effect of CO2 emissions is thought to take a decade to materialise, we may already be committed to over one degree of warming. In the long term, that is likely to risk the future of coastal cities such as New York, Shanghai and Calcutta, according to scientists at the Potsdam Institute of Climate Impact Research. If the planet warms by 2C by 2100, the Royal Society expects to see a third of the world’s currently-cultivated agricultural land disappear, the bleaching of all coral reefs, and an increase in water stress for 410m people. At a rise of 4C, the limits for human and environmental adaptation are likely to be exceeded in many parts of the world, a 2010 paper by the Society said. It envisaged around half of the world’s current agricultural land becoming unusable, sea level rises of up to two metres, and the extinction of about 40% of the world’s species, as droughts and wildfires ravaged the globe.  “The ecosystem services upon which human livelihoods depend would not be preserved,” the study found.  “Our industries must face the challenge of massive decarbonisation,” said Sharan Burrow, the International Trade Union Confederation’s secretary-general.  “We have the technology and there are millions of jobs possible from the necessary investment and millions more saved if we avoid the devastation of extreme climate change. There are no jobs on a dead planet.”"
"It is both unethical and untenable for universities around the world to continue to invest in fossil fuel companies whose plans to prospect for more oil, coal and gas endanger future global prosperity, according to an influential group of academics. That statement from, Academics Stand Against Poverty (Asap) – a global group of about 2,000 researchers who study poverty and development– urges universities to follow the lead of institutions like Stanford, Syracuse and Glasgow that have all committed to divest from fossil fuel holdings. They write: “At this moment in history, it is paradoxical for universities to remain invested in fossil fuel companies. What does it mean for universities to seek to educate youth and produce leading research in order to better the future, while simultaneously investing in and profiting from the destruction of said future? This position is neither tenable nor ethical.” It went on, “As academics, we are in the privileged position to understand the risks posed by climate change and to make powerful statements in support of action.” The statement also explicitly backs the Guardian’s “Keep it in the Ground” campaign which launched last month. It is urging the world’s two largest charitable funds, the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation and the Wellcome Trust, to withdraw their investments from fossil fuels.  The campaign has attracted over 176,000 signatures as well as support from the former chief scientific advisors to the UK government and European commission, the UK Climate Change and energy secretary Ed Davey, actor Tilda Swinton, chef Yotam Ottolenghi and activist Bianca Jagger. Last week, the Guardian Media Group announced it will divest from fossil fuel companies.  The Asap statement argues that these investments are “inimical to their efforts to advance global development and health”. Signatories include David Hulme, the director of the Brooks World Poverty Centre at the University of Manchester, Peter Singer, professor of bioethics at Princeton University and Raymond W Baker, founder of Global Financial Integrity.   Thomas Pogge, president of Asap and director of the Global Justice Program and professor of philosophy and international affairs at Yale University, said the fossil fuel divestment movement can add to political pressure in the run-up to the international climate change conference (COP) in Paris in December: “It doesn’t matter how much money it is – others will buy the stocks – but when institutions like the Guardian or Stanford University make such public statements, they have enormous political significance. It shows that the [fossil fuel divestment] issue is not one where reasonable people can be on one political side or another – it shows it is beyond reasonable debate. This then undermines the political support that governments are willing to give the fossil fuel industry.” As a staff member at Columbia University in the 1980s, Pogge supported students in the anti-apartheid movement who successfully persuaded the university to divest. He drew parallels with the fossil fuel divestment campaign: “The apartheid movement showed the enormous impact that a few prominent institutions can make by divesting. The anti-apartheid campaign was not a fringe movement – it became a very large movement of mainstream institutions – so the government took notice and said their position was no longer sustainable.”  Asap members voted unanimously on 1 April to support the global divestment movement.  More than 220 institutions, including universities, pension funds and foundations, have now committed to move their money out of fossil fuels. The movement started by 350.org has been described by Oxford University as “the fastest growing divestment campaign in history”. Pogge said that the energy needs of developing countries does not justify institutions maintaining fossil fuel investments: “Of course, developing countries need energy to grow and that can come from fossil fuels, but it doesn’t have to. The world needs to think about how to meet their development needs that are not based on fossil fuels. At the moment what is happening is almost the opposite.”  The Wellcome Trust, which funds medical research, has a minimum of £450m invested in Shell, BP, Rio Tinto and BHP Billiton alone. In a response to the Guardian’s campaign, Director Jeremy Farrar said their strategy of engaging with fossil fuel companies “recognises the unavoidable fact that fossil fuels are essential to the economy, life and health, and will remain so for decades under any conceivable scenario.” “This is especially true in low- and middle-income countries, where growth is the best guarantor of better health,” said Farrar.  The statement from Asap says: “climate change will wipe out crucial gains in development and poverty reduction in the global South, and will trigger food shortages, conflict, epidemic disease, and mass displacement. The current response by the international community is inadequate to prevent this from happening.” It cites a report by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) which says these trends will “exacerbate multidimensional poverty” and “create new poverty pockets” in low- and middle-income countries.  The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, which currently has more than $1.4bn (£1bn) invested in oil, coal and gas companies, declined to comment on fossil fuel divestment. However a spokesman for Bill Gates’s private office said: “We respect the passion of advocates for action on climate change, and recognise that there are many views on how best to address it. Bill is privately investing considerable time and resources in the effort [to develop clean energy].” "

" Brevik, a small coastal town two hours west of Oslo, has found itself on the front line of a global battle over a technology that is hailed in some quarters as the solution to climate change, but denigrated in others as a reckless and potentially fatal gamble. Environmentalists are mobilising to protest against plans to fit a cement factory with carbon capture and storage (CCS) technology to remove most of its emissions and bury them underground. But some in the green movement are on the other side of the fault line. Pushing emissions underground where they can’t change the climate is a seductive proposition and in the face of desperate global warming projections, the global CCS dream still unites unusual allies – Canadian tar sands rollers, the UN’s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), oil majors such as Shell and some environmentalists are all behind it. When combined with biomass, CCS gives us the option of going carbon negative   But progress has been slow. At least 10 CCS-fitted power plants in Europe were supposed to begin piping their carbon emissions into underground tombs this year, rather than letting them twirl into the sky. But none has done so.  The European commission too was supposed to publish plans for improving the CCS outlook last month, but did not.   Missed deadlines, squandered opportunities, spiralling costs and green protests have plagued the development of CCS technology since Statoil proposed the concept more than two decades ago.  The concept behind it is disarmingly simple. Instead of venting CO2 directly into the atmosphere, you scrub it from flue gasses and pipe it – usually in a liquefied form – for storage in an underground repository where it can’t affect the climate.   Fossil fuel companies argue that it is a green way to carry on with business as usual while supplying rising global energy demand. It could also potentially allow developing nations such as India and China to build many more coal-fired power stations without devastating consequences for the climate.  “With CCS in the mix, we can decarbonise in a cost-effective manner and still continue to produce, to some extent, our fossil fuels,” Tim Bertels, Shell’s Glocal CCS portfolio manager told the Guardian. “You don’t need to divest from fossil fuels, you need to decarbonise them.”    “If you take climate change seriously, it is extremely dangerous not to enable this technology for use in refineries, steel, cement, gas and coal plants,” said Frederic Hauge, the founder of the Bellona Foundation, a high-profile mover in Norway’s CCS project. “When combined with biomass, CCS gives us the option of going carbon negative (reducing more emissions than are created) which we need because we don’t have a Plan B – or Planet B.” Despite the promise, globally, just 13 large-scale CCS plants are operating in places such as Boundary Dam in Canada and Century Plant in Texas, often using the compressed CO2 to prise away tar sands and eek out the dregs of depleted oil wells.  Since the early 1990s, Europe’s only working CCS technology has been in Norway – at Statoil’s Snøhvit and Sleipner offshore gas plants.  Two large projects are planned in the UK – ‘White Rose’ at the Drax coal-fired power station which has received €300m from an EU ETS funding pot, and at Alstom’s Peterhead gas plant. The projects won ‘preferred bidders’ status in a government £1bn competition for such projects. But an early 2015 deadline for final investment decisions was not met. Work on the only other significant project in Europe – the ROAD coal-fired CCS plant in Rotterdam – is also yet to begin.   Despite the billions that Shell says it has invested in CCS, the technology is complex, experimental, and unprofitable, without a carbon price that reflects the cost of carbon emissions to society.   The first financial analysis of Boundary Dam last month found that it generated losses of over $1bn (£0.7bn), which would be paid by local electricity consumers – even though its principal beneficiary was an Albertan oil company.   Current carbon prices in the EU are too low to make CCS attractive to investors. So CCS advocates are pushing for ‘parity of policy’ with renewables and energy efficiency in public funding.   In Norway – the world’s third largest exporter of oil and natural gas – over £1bn has already been ploughed into a CCS project at Mongstad, compared by the then-prime minister Jens Stoltenberg to a “national moon landing”.  But the recipient, Statoil, was never enthusiastic about the project and after technology costs quintupled in a matter of years, sources say that they demanded exorbitant prices from the government for use of steam that their installations were freely venting.  The result was the construction of Norway’s highest-emitting gas plant, with an annual CO2 output of 1.2m tonnes.  But in Brevik, unlike Mongstad, the plant can utilise waste heat from the cement factory. “So we don’t have to add additional heat,” said Oscar Graff, the chief technology officer for Aker Solutions Clean Carbon. “We get it almost for free.”  If all goes to plan, the plant will become Norway’s third operational CCS project in five years time, catching up to 400,000 tonnes of CO2 which could then be piped for storage in an underwater continental shelf. Another 50,000 tonnes would be blended with sulphuric acid and fly ash in a solid waste, which Norcem sources confirm could be stored in various onland cavities, including an underground mine that collapsed in the 1970s.  That in turn has sparked local anger. “A minor CO2 capture seems to be just one partial reason for the new development,” said Øystein Dalland, an environmental professor who lives close to the plant. “This is also about achieving an increased bottom line by the synergy of handling fly ash in the cement production process. But even the idea of CO2 capture and waste handling must be subordinate to basic human rights.”  Carbon capture technology is often more advanced than its transport and storage elements, where there are myriad possibilities for accidents and disputes.  “We can’t take responsibility for transport and storage,” said Per Brevik, a manager of the Aker Clean Carbon CCS project in the Norcem plant. “It is not our core business. Storage is definitely a national task because you have to guarantee that it won’t leak and I don’t think that Norcem would like to have that responsibility.”  A nearly two-mile fracture has already been found close to the Sleipner carbon repository. But the CO2 there will have to be kept underground for many centuries, and not just to prevent climate change. CCS is basically about catching a problem and stuffing it away under the carpet  Some 1,700 people died in 1986, when a Cameroonian volcano erupted, releasing hundreds of thousands of tonnes of CO2 that had accumulated at the bottom of Lake Nyos, over a 16-mile range.  The CCS issue opens a pandora’s box for environmentalists. Many argue that it displaces crucial investment in renewables and energy efficiency for a technology that will reduce CO2 emissions by too little, and too late. Truls Gulowsen, the director of Greenpeace Norway describes carbon capture as a “painful” issue that “absolutely divided the environmental movement” in the Scandinavian country.  Hauge a flambuoyant celebrity in Norway who has been arrested more than 30 times for daring environmental actions compares the green schism to university rows among Marxist-Leninists in the 1980s.  “There is no black and white in the environmental discussion anymore,” he said. To fight climate change, “we need to go with whatever we can and I can’t manage to do that without CCS, even if it means that our former enemies start to become our best allies.” Rasmus Hansson, the leader of the Norwegian Green Party, believes the issue is more stark. “CCS is basically about catching a problem and stuffing it away under the carpet,” he told the Guardian. “We will then live with the statistical risk of some gigantic underground burp. The problem is the same as with the Gulf of Mexico oil disaster. Things that absolutely cannot happen have a tendency of finally happening.”"
"The glaciers of western Canada, one of the world’s most picturesque mountain regions, are likely to largely melt away over just three generations, scientists have warned. By 2100, the glaciers of Alberta and British Columbia are set to shrink by 75% in area compared to 2005 levels, and by 70% in volume, according to their predictions. But in two out of the three regions that were studied, the decline could be even more dramatic – over 90%. The loss will hit many sectors, from agriculture, forestry and tourism to ecosystems and water quality, the investigators warned. The study, published in the journal Nature Geoscience, was headed by Garry Clarke, a professor at the University of British Columbia in Vancouver. “The disappearance of (the) glaciers... will be a sad loss for those who are touched by the beauty of Canada’s mountain landscapes,” Clarke told AFP. “When the glaciers have gone, we lose the important services they provide: a buffer against hot, dry spells in late summer that keeps headwater streams flowing and cool, and sustains cool-water aquatic species.” The team used a computer model that combined four well-known scenarios for global warming this century, with data about three glacier-covered regions and dynamics of ice melt. Even at the lowest projected warming, most of the glaciers are essentially doomed, according to their forecast. “Few glaciers will remain in the Interior and Rockies regions, but maritime glaciers, in particular those in northwestern British Columbia, will survive in a diminished state,” the investigators said. The study’s four warming scenarios, called Representative Concentration Pathways (RCP), are those used by the UN’s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). Under RCP 2.6, the lowest scenario, global average temperatures over this century are likely to rise by 0.3-1.7 C.  Under RCP 8.5, the highest scenario, which is based on current trends in carbon emissions, warming would be in the approximate range of 2.6-4.8 C. For the Interior and Rockies regions, glaciers would lose more than 90% of their volume and area compared to 2005 levels, in all scenarios except for RCP 2.6. The Coast region, more resistant, would see 75% area loss and 70% volume loss, with a margin of error of 10%. The regions studied by Clarke’s team cover 26,700 sq km (10,308 sq miles ) – an area almost the size of Belgium and bigger than the glacial Himalayas, and with an ice volume of 2,980 cubic km (715 cubic miles). Climate scientists say they have a good overall view of how glaciers respond to global warming, but the picture at regional level is far more prone to error. One concern is that computer models at this scale are usually based on very broad assumptions – they presume, for instance, that above a certain altitude, a glacier will be stable, whereas local topography and the physics of ice dynamics could mean it is in fact vulnerable. The new model seeks to overcome this, using 3D simulation to a resolution of just 200 metres (660 ft) and taking into account factors that delay or accelerate glacier melt. Runoff from the melting ice will peak between 2020 and 2040, the study said, pointing to another risk. Mountain glaciers currently contribute about 0.7mm (0.03 of an inch) in sea level rise each year, roughly equivalent to the combined runoff from the ice sheets of Greenland and Antarctica, according to the IPCC. By 2100, the IPCC says, mountain glaciers could raise sea levels by 39cm (15.6 inches). UN members have set a goal of limiting warming to 2C over pre-industrial levels, and have set a conference in Paris in December as the place to seal a pact to achieve this. The RCP scenarios do not include warming up to the start of the 20th century from the beginning of the Industrial Revolution – about 0.7C. “Glaciers respond to climate, not weather, and their shrinkage signals that climate change is real and its consequences are serious,” said Clarke. “It is not too late for good behaviour to be rewarded, but the longer we delay the worse things get.”"
"The University of Edinburgh is expected to divest its £292m endowment from coal and tar sands companies following a recommendation from senior management on Tuesday.  Student representatives were informed of the response from the Central Management Group ahead of the final decision, which will be announced in May.  In October, Glasgow University became the first academic institution in Europe to commit to divest from the fossil fuel industry. The University of Bedfordshire followed suit in January.  In total, more than 220 institutions – from pension funds to faith organisations to foundations – have now made similar commitments to divest as part of a global campaign started by 350.org.  Activists who have been pressuring the University of Edinburgh for three years expressed disappointment that the recommendation did not go further. Kirsty Haigh, student campaigner and the vice president, communities for NUS Scotland said:  “It would be very rare for the court to reject a recommendation from the central management board so this is very significant. It’s absolutely crucial that the university does not give in to big fossil fuel companies and flout their moral obligations. Full divestment from fossil fuels is the only responsible action. Our futures are too important to be gambled away for university profit.” According to a freedom of information request by NUS Scotland, the university currently has a minimum of £8.6m of direct investments in fossil fuel companies including Shell, BHP Billiton, Rio Tinto and an additional £5.9m in fossil fuel services such as Petrobras and the Weir Group. Professor Charlie Jeffery, senior vice principal said: “The University of Edinburgh was the first university in Europe to commit to the United Nations Principles of Responsible Investment. Since then, we have carried out a consultation process involving students, staff and alumni to help determine how we should best take forward our commitment to responsible investment.” The recommendation comes as divestment campaigners at Harvard university engage in a week of direct action on campus. Syracuse university recently became the biggest in the world to commit to full divestment from fossil fuel companies with Stanford pulling out of coal.  Similar campaigns are underway at universities across the UK, including King’s College London, the London School of Oriental and African Studies (SOAS) and Oxford, where the university recently deferred its decision. In March, the Guardian launched a campaign calling on the world’s largest charitable foundations – the Wellcome Trust and the Gates Foundation – to remove their investments from fossil fuel companies. The Guardian Media Group – the company that owns the Guardian – has since committed to divest its own £800m fund."
"When we embarked on our research into how trade groups are lobbying on EU climate policy, we knew trade associations were likely to be influential. However, we were surprised at just how important they are to companies, and how ferociously opposed some have been to recent progressive European Union climate policies. These EU policies include attempts to strengthen the EU Emissions Trading Scheme, and targets on energy efficiency and renewable power.  The policies and regulations put in place in Brussels matter to businesses. Some companies see the transition to a low-carbon society as a business opportunity, while others see it as a threat to their bottom line. It’s no surprise then that companies want to have a voice in the making of EU policy on climate change.  What has been surprising is the extent to which companies rely on trade associations to do their lobbying in the EU, and how ferociously some of these associations have opposed progressive EU climate policy. In our report we investigated how eight big, influential trade associations – which either represent particular industrial sectors or claim to represent all business interests in the EU – lobby on EU climate policy. These included BusinessEurope, which has argued that EU climate targets undermine industrial competitiveness. Another example is the European Chemical Industry Council (Cefic), which stated that strengthening the EU Emissions Trading System would cause “carbon leakage” – where businesses move overseas because of high energy costs in Europe – “without any environmental need”. Trade associations are clearly a key way multinational companies influence policymakers. An independent NGO, the Carbon Disclosure Project (CDP), surveyed thousands of companies, and found that 77% of Global 500 companies used trade associations to lobby on climate policy. That’s a huge percentage and is even higher than the percentage of companies that said they lobbied policymakers directly. Trade associations are influential. As part of our study, we conducted anonymous interviews with people working for prominent trade associations. Some were frank about their impact with one saying that in environmental policy “there’s about 25 [MEPs] who really matter – these are the coordinators, the chairmen, the national delegation heads … I would personally consider myself a pretty crappy lobbyist if I didn’t have the mobile phone numbers of all those MEPs, if I didn’t know exactly where their offices were, and if I wasn’t in email contact with them on a pretty regular basis”. Another trade association employee claimed they had helped to shape the new EU 2030 targets.  These trade groups are well resourced; Cefic self-reported through the EU transparency register thatit has 75 lobbyists in Europe, 14 of whom have access to the European Parliament. It reported that it spends €6m a year on lobbying. We were also surprised by how forthright some of the trade groups were in their opposition to reforms to the EU Emissions Trading Scheme, or to targets on renewable power or energy efficiency. Many of the trade associations have member companies that have made strong statements on sustainability, and I question how well the positions of these companies align with the activities of their trade associations. A full list of the trade association membership (where available) can be found in the annexes to our report.  One major industry lobby group in Brussels recently said that since the arrival of the Juncker Commission it was “happy to see that growth and jobs are no longer overshadowed by environment and climate change” in the EU. But should companies be celebrating? These lobby groups are winning short-term victories at the expense of the long-term interests of the economy and our climate. Companies with ambitious goals on climate change need to ensure their trade associations aren’t undermining their long-term interests. I would argue that they and their trade associations need to sing from the same hymn sheet on climate policy. Many investors and civil-society groups are concerned about the “misalignment” between companies with strong sustainability statements and the actions of their trade associations. An NGO called ShareAction, as part of its Green Light campaign to highlight pension investments, is launching a campaign targeting companies on their lobbying activities in the run-up to the UN climate change conference, Cop21, in Paris in December. Companies need to go beyond “alignment”, and make sure that the EU is putting in place policy that protects the long-term interests of the climate and the economy. As Steve Howard, chief sustainability officer for Ikea, said in 2013: “There is an old expression which is that winners go to market and losers go to Washington. But we now need the winners to go to Washington and Brussels and Beijing to help unlock business innovation and investment to get this problem solved.   “We have seen there is a silent majority of businesses that want to see effective leadership from government on climate change, but they have not known what to advocate for, or may have felt it is not their responsibility to do something about. The key is now for business to find its voice. We cannot defend the status quo and at the same time build a sustainable future at pace and scale,” said Howard. The leadership hub is funded by Xyntéo.

"The science broadcaster Karl Kruszelnicki has distanced himself from the Abbott government’s intergenerational report, insisting he had been able to read only extracts of the document before appearing in the associated advertising campaign. Kruszelnicki – well known simply as Dr Karl – expressed regrets about participating in the campaign, saying he should have demanded a greater focus on climate change and blaming himself for “not realising the nature of the beast” with which he was involved.  But he indicated he had not asked for the advertising campaign to end early. The treasurer, Joe Hockey, in March released the intergenerational report focusing on the demographic and budget challenges facing Australia over the next 40 years. The document attracted criticism based on its limited focus on the risks posed by climate change. The government also seized on comparisons of three long-term budget scenarios to criticise Labor, which disputed the underlying assumptions. Kruszelnicki said he had received hate emails and angry social media messages after appearing in the government’s advertising campaign. He said he had participated because of his passion about planning for the future, but some people believed he was endorsing a vote “for this political party or that one, which I am not doing at all”. “I did it [participating in the advertising campaign] on the grounds that it would be not for any political party but for the government of Australia as a non-political, bipartisan, independent report,” he told the ABC’s AM program on Wednesday. “I should have insisted that there be climate change in it and, yes, I did not and that was a mistake on my part.” Kruszelnicki explained his mistake by reference to a fable. “The scorpion says to the frog: ‘Can you take me across the flooded river?’ And the frog says: ‘No, you’ll stab me and kill me’.” “And the scorpion says, ‘No, I won’t do that because I’ll drown myself’. And the frog says: ‘Yes, you’ll drown.’ So the frog says: ‘Hop on my back’, takes him half way across the river and the scorpion stabs him. “And the frog says: ‘Hey, you stabbed me, I’m going to die! And so are you! Why’d you do that? Are you crazy?’ And the scorpion said: ‘I can’t help it. It’s my nature.’ “It was my fault for not realising the nature of the beast that I was involved with. I really thought that it would be an independent, bipartisan, non-political document.” The advertisements have run in a variety of media including television. The ads star Kruszelnicki giving a lecture about Australian innovation and future challenges. They direct people to a website to see his “full presentation”."

" The first public hearings will take place in the Hague on Tuesday in the first case in the world to use existing human rights and tort law to hold a government responsible for failing to reduce carbon emissions fast enough.  The 886 citizens involved in the class action against the Dutch government aim to force it to take more robust action to reduce emissions. They also hope to offer a legal solution to the political impasse on international climate change action. They will ask the judiciary to declare that the Dutch government must implement policies to reduce its emissions by between 25% and 40% below 1990 levels by 2020. This was the target for developed nations – established by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) – as necessary to create a 50% chance of avoiding a dangerous 2C rise in global temperatures.  The European Union recently set a target of reducing emissions by 40% by 2030, ahead of a crunch conference in Paris at the end of the year.  The lawsuit has been brought by the sustainability foundation Urgenda with 886 Dutch citizens acting as co-plaintiffs including teachers, entrepreneurs, artists and children legally represented by their elders.  Dennis van Berkel, who works for Urgenda, said: “We wanted to show that this is not just one organisation that had an idea but it’s a broad movement of people who are very concerned about climate change and believe it’s necessary to sue the state over it.”  Hundreds are expected to pack out the court on Tuesday, with the hearing due to be live streamed for those who cannot fit in the building. Many others from around the world submitted ideas for the case. Joos Ockels is among the plaintiffs. Her late husband, Wubbo Ockels, who was the first Dutch citizen in space, had dedicated much of his later years to environmental work, founding the renewable energy foundation Happy Energy and declaring that citizens must care for the planet as “astronauts of spaceship Earth”. In a speech from his bedside days before his death last year Ockels pleaded to camera: “What is wrong with our mindset? Our earth has cancer. I have cancer too. If I could take you to space you would see that this is your only planet, you have no spare.” The national weatherman, Reinier van de Berg, and the prolific Dutch DJ, Gregor Salto, are acting as plaintiffs, with the Nasa climate scientist Prof James Hansen also supporting the campaign.  Salto, who is an ambassador for WWF, said: “Everybody is waiting for the government to take action but the government has done so little. If the case succeeds, they will be forced to take action. If you look at Denmark, they’ve managed [to reduce emissions], so why can’t we? I want the Dutch to lead the way in this.”   In the 1990s the Netherlands was hailed as one of the first countries to take climate change seriously, but the country now lags a long way behind its targets on renewables. A low-lying country, it is at higher risk from rising sea levels and storm surges in comparison to other developed nations. The campaigners hailed a breakthrough with the launch of the Oslo Principles on Global Climate Change Obligations in London two weeks ago. Created by a group of prolific judges, advocates and professors, they argue that in failing to introduce adequate policy to tackle climate change, governments have already broken existing human rights, environmental and tort laws, regardless of agreements brokered at the international level. The case is now nearing its end with a verdict expected within six months. Urgenda first took action in 2012 when they sent a letter to the Dutch government asking them to introduce new measures to cut emissions, without which they would proceed to court. Urgenda hopes it will set a precedent and inspire others around the world to take up similar cases. Lawyers in Belgium – supported by 8,000 citizens – are currently preparing for court proceedings against their own government. Urgenda and Ockels were inspired to take action by ideas set out in a book written by Roger Cox, the lawyer now leading the case. Five years in the making, Revolution Justified argues – alongside other legal experts – that the judiciary can play a fundamental role in tackling climate change. Cox said: “We’re now 23 years down the road of the climate change treaty and it’s obvious that international politics has not brought much good to the world. The power of politics, fossil fuel companies and the banks are so large but there is one other powerful system with a lot of wisdom and that is the law.” He continued: “There is a parallel here with the situation in the 1950s in the United States. It was the courts that decided that segregation in schools was not constitutional. It wasn’t a big issue in society and it wasn’t political but it was a few people fighting and the courts following up that created a huge change in American society.”"
"Republican presidential candidate Marco Rubio says he has noticed the climate is changing dramatically but says he can’t explain why because he’s “not a scientist”. He has concluded, however, that humans do not have anything to do with it.  Taking large-scale action will destroy the economy, the Florida senator says. But in his home state, the effects of climate change are set to be among the most alarming in the US.  Florida state officials might not be allowed to talk about it, but scientists in the state have been warning politicians for years that human-fueled climate change is here and, without action, its advance is going to be catastrophic for the state. “Admitting you are ignorant is no excuse,” Peter Harlem, a geoscientist at Florida International University’s south-eastern environmental research center, told the Guardian.  Here are the five threats to Florida from climate change that might force Marco Rubio to take action. Miami drowns. And it’ll take the Florida Keys, the Everglades and Cape Canaveral with it. In parts of Florida, rising ocean levels already mean that streets built high and dry 50 years ago now flood with seawater every month, Harlem said. “I can drive Senator Rubio to a spot on Biscayne Bay under a full moon and he can watch the high tide come in over the road.” Expensive pumping systems (for example in Miami Beach) and sea walls are futile in the long term. Climate change is forecast to push sea levels in southern Florida three to six feet higher this century, perhaps more. Some 5.5 million people in Miami live just six feet above sea level. Extreme heat and more diseases. Rising temperatures and the spread of tropical illnesses hit older people hard – that puts Florida’s large retiree population at great risk. Dengue fever is being kept at bay in the Florida Keys only by the sustained efforts of health officials. It re-established itself around 2009 after being eliminated decades ago. Warming temperatures boost mosquito populations and increase the incidence of West Nile virus and chikungunya, while bringing the threat of malaria ever closer to the Florida swamps. The Natural Resources Defense Council predicts Florida will suffer the most dramatic increase in the summer heat index (temperature plus humidity) in the country. That may prove deadly. Coral-free reefs, sand-less beaches.  The magical coral reefs of the Florida Keys have been dying since the 70s due to overfishing and pollution. But some coral is better than no coral – which climate change may lead to because of rising sea temperatures – for the state’s $50bn tourist industry. And before rising seas inundate the sparkling white beaches, a lot of their sand will be raked away by advancing waves and tidal erosion, already a big problem in the Gulf-facing south-west. Shriveled oranges, rotten tomatoes. More heat and rain might seem like a boon to Florida’s fruit bounty, but the longer-term outlook is sour. Volatile rainfall patterns and temperature fluctuations wreck fruit yields. Early growth is followed by destructive frosts, fierce rainstorms by long dry spells. More heat brings more pests (and pesticide run-off is already poisoning the water table and ocean). The University of Florida Institute of Food and Agricultural Science warns that global warming is “potentially catastrophic” to the state’s farming industry, which provides work for two million and is the state’s second biggest employer behind tourism. Salt in drinking water, sewage and irrigation. Three quarters of Florida’s population of 14 million lives in a coastal county and they expect fresh water when they turn on the taps, and the toilet to flush nicely every time they go. And why not, with up to 60in of rain a year? Salt water is already seeping up, however, especially in south Florida where the limestone bedrock is as holey as Swiss cheese. Higher tides and rising oceans don’t just threaten flooding on the coast but a gradual infiltration into the groundwater for household use, irrigation canals and sewage systems. And what Floridians don’t need for quenching their thirst, and salt water doesn’t contaminate, the fierce sun is already evaporating from the state’s lush landscape at a dangerous rate.  That’s the bad news for Rubio. But there is some good news. Scientists can’t agree on whether climate change will lead to more hurricanes, though it is expected to increase the intensity of those that do occur."

"The White House pledged to cut carbon pollution by up to 28% on Tuesday, boosting the prospects for an international agreement on climate change at the end of the year. With the US pledge, the countries accounting for nearly 60% of greenhouse gas emissions from energy have outlined their plans for fighting climate change in the 2020s and beyond, the White House said in a conference call with reporters.  “That’s a big deal,” Brian Deese, the White House climate adviser wrote in a blog post announcing the pledge. “The United States’ target is ambitious and achievable, and we have the tools we need to reach it.” Deese told the conference call the US expected to achieve emissions cuts of 26% to 28% by 2025 relative to 2005 levels and was on track for an 80% cut in emissions by 2050. The climate commitments would be “locked in” by the time Barack Obama leaves, and could not easily be reversed by a Republican president or Republicans in Congress, officials told the conference call.  “The undoing of the kind of regulations that we are putting in place is something that is very tough to do,” Todd Stern, the state department climate envoy, said. “The kind of regulation we are putting in place does not get easily undone.”  Some 33 countries have now committed to specific goals for fighting climate change, according to the United Nations agency overseeing the negotiations. In addition to the US, the European Union, Mexico, Norway and Switzerland have outlined their plans to fight climate change after 2020, when the current commitments expire.  Those plans, and those of other countries offered over the next few months, will serve as the building blocks of an international agreement at Paris that is intended to limit warming to 2C, the threshold for dangerous climate change, Stern told the call. Deese said the Obama Administration was on track to achieve those emissions cuts using existing legal authority, and that the US was on track to achieve emissions cuts of 80% by 2050, based on steps already set in motion by Barack Obama. “We have the tools we need to meet this goal and take action on climate pollution,” Deese told the call. However, Republicans in Congress said Obama would be unable to deliver on his commitment to the UN. “The Obama Administration’s pledge to the United Nations today will not see the light of day,” Jim Inhofe, the Oklahoma Republican who heads the Senate’s environment and public works committee, and denies the existence of man-made climate change.  Most countries missed the Tuesday deadline for submitting climate change plans, agreed at the United Nations negotiations at Lima last December. A number of the biggest carbon polluters, such as Brazil, India, Indonesia, Japan , are not expected to announce their commitments until October.  Russia has offered to cut emissions 25% on 1990 levels by 2030.  Campaigners welcomed the US pledge - which had been widely anticipated - but said the Obama Administration needed to move decisively to finalise new rules cutting carbon pollution on power plants to keep up the momentum before Paris. The power plant rule is the centerpiece of Obama’s climate change plan. “The United States is signaling that countries should have confidence it can deliver. To maintain that confidence, a strong final rule this summer to cut carbon pollution from new and existing power plants will be critical,” the World Wildlife Fund said in a statement.  Oxfam said the US needed to make deeper emissions cuts to help keep warming below 2C. “While this contribution does move us closer to the 2C pathway, it does not represent the level of ambition needed to avoid catastrophic climate change.”  Among those countries that have come forward, the EU has agreed to cut its emissions by 40% by 2030, compared with 1990 levels. China has promised its emissions will peak by 2030 but it has not officially submitted a pledge to the UN. Mexico, the first developing country to make a climate commitment, said it will cut emissions by at least 22% - and as much as 40% if certain conditions are met. Norway offered a 40% cut in greenhouse gas emissions by 2030, from 1990 levels, and said it sought to be carbon neutral by 2050. For the rest of the world, developed countries are expected to submit plans outlining substantial cuts in greenhouse gases after 2020, while most developing nations are likely to agree only to curb the growth of their emissions compared with “business-as-usual”, rather than make absolute cuts. But the aggregate level of emissions targets proposed will be bitterly fought over by countries, experts and civil society. Based on the early submissions from the three biggest emitting blocs, global emissions would rise to a level that would see temperatures soar by at least 3.5C, according to some analyses, way beyond the 2C of warming that is widely regarded by scientists as the limit of safety, beyond which the effects of climate change are likely to become catastrophic and irreversible. Birgit van Munster, of the Homo Sapiens Foundation, which has been analysing the pledges as they have come in, said: “If all humanity follows the example [of the first countries to submit pledges] we will be more than 700% over the likely emissions limit [needed] to limit global warming to less than 2C, and if this trend continues humanity will proceed to go beyond 5C, the end of human life on earth as we know it.” Bob Ward, policy and communications director at the Grantham Research Institute on Climate Change at the London School of Economics, said: “We can already see that the pledges for 2030 are likely to be significantly lower than a “business-as-usual” emissions pathway, but far in excess of 36bn tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent, which the UN Environment Programme concluded last year was the level required for a pathway that offers a 50% to 66% chance of avoiding warming of more than 2C.” It is unlikely that the pledges made in advance of the Paris talks will be enough to lower global emissions to a level consistent with scientific advice on 2C, as many participants acknowledge. However, many are hoping that Paris will provide a mechanism for the pledges to be upwardly reviewed in future years, according to each country’s ability.  “It is very important that the agreement in Paris includes the creation of a post-2015 process that raises the ambitions of countries’ planned emissions cuts,” Ward said.  Doug Parr, policy director at Greenpeace UK, told the Guardian: “Meeting the end of March deadline is an opportunity for major countries to demonstrate both urgency and leadership in the battle against climate change. But thus far we haven’t seen enough of either. Millions of people around the world are waiting for a signal that their political leaders are taking climate change seriously. They [the leaders] are still in time not to let us down.” Once submitted, the 196 “Intended Nationally Determined Contributions”, as the plans are known, will be examined by the UN and other countries to decide whether they are fair and adequate. That process is likely to take until autumn, when the final preparations for the Paris talks will be put in place."
"Australia appears to be developing a curious blind spot as it begins the process of deciding how little it intends to do about climate change after the year 2020. Earlier this week Australia released a bunch of documents designed to kick-start the process of developing its target to cut greenhouse gas emissions that it will take to the major Paris climate talks in December.  At the last major talks in Lima, Australia joined other countries in signing an agreement to develop what’s known as Intended Nationally Determined Contributions – or INDCs. These INDCs are to be submitted to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) well before October this year. In November, just weeks before the Paris talks begin, the UNFCCC will publish an assessment of all the INDCs to see how close they are to achieving the target of keeping global warming below 2C. And therein lies Australia’s blind spot.  In the key issues paper released by the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet earlier this week, the government seems reluctant to acknowledge the 2C target – even though this has been a stated aim of the signatories to the UNFCCC ever since the ill-fated Copenhagen meeting in 2009. At that meeting, Australia signed the Copenhagen Accord, as have 140 other countries, agreeing on that 2C goal (the latest agreement signed in Lima also notes a more ambitious 1.5C goal which some scientists now say is the only acceptable target to save the poorest countries from unmanageable impacts). The fact sheet accompanying Australia’s issues paper also ignores the 2C goal, referring instead to the original UNFCCC convention text which says the aim is to “stabilize greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere at a level that would prevent dangerous anthropogenic interference with the climate system.” Australia won’t be submitting its INDC until the middle of this year, but some nations have already handed theirs over to the secretariat at the UN. The US, Russia, Mexico, Norway, the European Union and Switzerland have all submitted their INDCs and all of them mention the 2C target range. So far, it appears there’s likely going to be a substantial gap between the level of cuts that countries are prepared to commit to and the kind of ambition that might keep global warming below 2C. A1.5C target seems entirely out of reach. One group monitoring the commitments from countries is Climate Action Tracker. So far, none of the submissions are consistent with the world staying below 2C, the group says. But the 2C goal isn’t Australia’s only blind spot on international climate change policy. Checking the statements in the issues paper, Australia looks as though it is betting that the rest of the world won’t agree to do very much. A section outlining the country’s “national circumstances” can be read as a list of excuses as to why Australia might not be as ambitious as other countries.  For example, the issues paper points out that “coal accounts for nearly 60 per cent of our total primary energy supply” and that “95 per cent of Australia’s energy consumption comes from fossil fuel sources”. This, the paper says, is primarily the result of Australia’s abundant energy and mineral resources and limited scope to harness hydroelectricity. While Australia does not have a similarly “limited scope” to harness solar or wind energy, this section of the issues paper doesn’t point this out. The paper adds:  For the foreseeable future, Australia will continue to be a major supplier of crucial energy and raw materials to the rest of the world, especially Asian countries. So in summary, Australia gets almost all its energy from fossil fuels and it wants to keep selling those fossil fuels. So please go easy on us (even though we have one of the highest GDP per capita rates in the world). Australia seems to be ignoring the risk of maintaining business as usual while other major economies start to power down a road to developing more and more renewable energy.  A new report from the United Nations Environment Programme says that investment in renewable energy went up 17 per cent last year to $270 billion. And what of those Asian countries that Australia touted in its issues paper? China’s investment in renewables went up by 39 per cent.  In total, developing countries including China, India and Indonesia invested $131 billion in renewable energy – a 36 per cent rise from 2013. When countries signed the agreement in Lima to develop their INDCs, they also agreed that those targets would “represent a progression” from their current policies. So Australians could presume that if a deal is struck in Paris, then countries might be less inclined to burn as many fossil fuels as they were before. Perhaps if Australia’s government stopped touting phrases like “coal is good for humanity” it might be able to remove its blind spots just in time."
"In Jonathan Franzen’s 2010 novel Freedom, lauded for its biting critique of the US environmental movement, a conservationist enters a Faustian pact with a coal miner. He cuts a deal in which a community of 200 families are to be relocated and a mountain denuded in return for the creation of a sanctuary for warblers. In this week’s New Yorker, Franzen flirts with his own protagonist’s folly by proposing to protect birds by giving up on the fight to slow down climate change. A suggestion that has angered and confused bird conservationists across the world. Franzen begins his essay with an expression of deep and admirable love for birds, for which he has been a long-time advocate. He “cares more about birds than the next man”, he says. His typically brilliant opening double entendre works as an ode to birds, but also reveals an apathy for his fellow humans. They are beyond help from climate change and thus beyond caring about it. Birds on the other hand have a future. It’s a modern, nihilistic rendition of Byron’s declaration: “I love not man the less, but Nature more.”  “The Earth as we now know it resembles a patient whose terminal cancer we can choose to treat either with disfiguring aggression or with palliation and sympathy. We can dam every river and blight every landscape with biofuel agriculture, solar farms, and wind turbines, to buy some extra years of moderated warming. Or we can settle for a shorter life of higher quality, protecting the areas where wild animals and plants are hanging on, at the cost of slightly hastening the human catastrophe,” says Franzen. Climate change has the conservation movement in a vampiric embrace, argues Franzen. Renewable energy systems are not only futile, they actively destroy habitat and birds. The world is going to warm and humans should focus on bolstering the species that might survive the cataclysm. “As long as mitigating climate change trumps all other environmental concerns, no landscape on earth is safe,” he writes. “To prevent extinctions in the future. It’s not enough to curb our carbon emissions. We also have to keep a whole lot of wild birds alive right now.” Franzen takes particular aim at bird conservation group Audubon. In particular a 2014 report that found half of North America’s bird species are threatened by climate change. Their modelling, he says, is flawed. In fact, under climate change “North America’s avifauna may well become more diverse”. But worse, he says, by campaigning on climate change Audubon have subjugated the immediate conservation interests of birds. Audubon’s CEO David Yarnold said Franzen’s essay “read like some angst-ridden, Woody Allen-esque lament”. “The whole piece is a pretty confused piece of thinking. He seems to be saying that people aren’t capable of holding two ideas in their heads at once. That they’re not capable of preserving the places that birds need now, while mitigating the threat of climate change in the future. And there’s absolutely nothing in our experience at Audubon that would lead us to believe that’s true,” he said. Yarnold said the climate change report had been a rallying cry for their supporters. “It energised them in unprecedented ways,” he said. Ariel Brunner, head of EU policy at BirdLife, says the Franzen’s demonisation of renewable energy infrastructure does not bear scrutiny.  “Comparing the impact of climate change and the effect of renewable infrastructure on birds is like comparing a tornado to a hairdryer. Renewables are not counterproductive to bird conservation if done properly. The bulk of the mortality is due to windows, buildings and power lines. Climate action and nature conservation must go hand in hand.” “I think he’s talking nonsense,” says former director of conservation at the RSPB Mark Avery. “All the evidence suggests that climate change will be very harmful to birds.” A spokesman for the RSPB says enthusiasm for bird conservation and membership was at an all time high. He says the organisation wants “massive growth in renewables”, to counteract the effects of climate change and the majority of projects, if well planned, do not threaten birds. Despite his premise that climate change is foregone, Franzen toys with the language of climate denial more than once in his essay. He refers to the response to the climate crisis as “climatism”, in other words a belief system rather than a rational response to a problem. In calling renewable energy plants a “blight” on the landscape he echoes right wing politicians from England and Australia. “It was so stupid,” said John Gummer, chairman of the UK government’s Committee on Climate Change. “Down the ages people who’ve said ‘eat drink and be merry for tomorrow we die’ have always been wrong and this is another example of it. It’s straightforward hedonism actually. It is the most immoral approach. We are perfectly able to stop the growth in climate change by sensible measures that won’t in any way disfigure the world. The picture he draws is entirely wrong.” Franzen also echoes climate deniers by refuting scientific modelling. It can be useful for predicting what will happen to bird species under climate change, he says, “but it’s fraught with uncertainties”. Despite his suspicion of modelling and his employment of denialist tropes, Franzen seems convinced by climate science. “We’re taking carbon that used to be sequestered and putting it in the atmosphere, and unless we stop we’re fucked,” he says. And yet we’ve done little. “Even in the nations most threatened by flooding or drought, even in the countries most virtuously committed to alternative energy sources, no head of state has ever made a commitment to leaving any carbon in the ground.” Frantzen writes that climate change has achieved what none of the madnesses of the 20th century could, the final defeat of human reason. “The great hope of the Enlightenment – that human rationality would enable us to transcend our evolutionary limitations – has taken a beating from wars and genocides, but only now, on the problem of climate change, has it foundered altogether,” he says. But to give up, as Franzen has, is to truly abdicate sanity, says Bob Ward, policy and communications director of the Grantham Research Institute on Climate Change and the Environment at the London School of Economics. Franzen’s justice for birds dooms other members of his own species. It also fails to recognise that climate change happens by gradations, each level of which is increasingly bad for humans and birds alike.  “Mr Frantzen is entitled to his point of view but I think few thoughtful people will share it,” says Ward. “As a 55-year-old writer, he may feel he can live out the remaining years of his life in comfort, while ignoring the risks that climate change will pose to those who are poorer or younger than him. “But sane people will disagree with him because they will be aware of the evidence that the risks of climate change can be managed through the creation of a cleaner and more energy efficient world powered by alternatives to dirty fossil fuel plants.” There is relief in giving up. “I’d expected to be depressed,” says Franzen after reading Dale Jamieson’s Reason in a Dark Time, in which he finds the justification for his belief that humans are incapable of a response to climate change. “But I wasn’t.” "

"Poor countries are feeling “the boot of climate change on their neck”, the president of the World Bank has said, as he called for a carbon tax and the immediate scrapping of subsidies for fossil fuels to hold back global warming. Jim Yong Kim said awareness of the impact of extreme weather events that have been linked to rising temperatures was more marked in developing nations than in rich western countries, and backed for the adoption of a five-point plan to deliver low-carbon growth. Speaking to the Guardian ahead of this week’s half-yearly meeting of the World Bank in Washington DC, Kim said he had been impressed by the energy of the divestment campaigns on university campuses in the US, aimed at persuading investors to remove their funds from fossil fuel companies. “We have a whole new generation that is interested in climate change”, he said as he predicted that putting taxes on the use of carbon would trigger a wave of clean technology which would lift people out of poverty in the developing world while preventing the global temperature from rising by more than 2C above pre-industrial levels. Kim said it was crazy that governments increased the use of coal, oil and gas by providing subsidies for consumers. He said that in low and middle-income countries, the richest 20% received six times as much from fossil fuel subsidies as the poorest 20%. He added: “We need to get rid of fossil fuel subsidies now.” Kim insisted that the recent fall in energy prices meant there had never been a better time to reduce the payments made by governments to help people with their fuel bills. Politicians around the globe currently spend around $1tn (£680bn) a year subsidising fossil fuels, but Kim said: “Fossil fuel subsidies send out a terrible signal: burn more carbon.” Some countries, such as South Korea, have recently announced carbon taxes as a way of making the use of fossil fuels more expensive. Kim said: “You can have growth that will protect the planet and decouple carbon emissions from growth. We can get it now, but it would be much easier if we put a price on carbon.” He said that, in addition to scrapping fossil fuel subsidies and introducing a carbon tax, the World Bank’s plan involved spending more on energy efficiency, measures to make agriculture greener and changes to help cities become less polluted and more liveable. The World Bank president said the Chinese and Indian governments were coming under pressure from their populations due to heavily-polluted cities, and that appreciation of the dangers of climate change was greater in developing countries. “They can feel the boot of climate change on their neck, more so than people in the developed world”, Kim said. “The results of the increased frequency and intensity of extreme weather-related events are having a much bigger impact in poor countries than in the US or Europe.” Kim said it was important the Guardian’s Keep it in the Ground campaign had published figures showing that between two-thirds and four-fifths of known fossil fuel reserves would have to remain unburned to keep temperatures below the 2C ceiling. He said: “Putting the figures out there is important. Now we can have the debate and see how others respond. When I meet business leaders from the very carbon-intensive industries, their openness to a carbon price is striking. They say, ‘let’s do it’.” Although the World Bank has been criticised in the past for financing the building of dams in developing countries, Kim said Africa had to explore hydroelectric power as an alternative to fossil fuels. Noting that Africa exploited just 1% of its hydroelectric potential, Kim added: “There is plenty of coal in Africa. If we step back, if we don’t move forward on hydro, then the natural progression is to more coal.” While solar and wind were going to be an important part of the energy mix for Africa, they would not be capable of providing power to consistently meet a minimum level of demand, he said. The World Bank will be involved in the meeting in Paris in December when the UN is seeking a global pact to deal with the threat of climate change. Kim said he wanted to see the talks result in a collective agreement binding the international community to a zero-carbon world by the end of the century; individual countries coming up with their own plans; a financing package that by 2020 would provide poor countries with $100bn (£68bn) to help them adapt to climate change and mitigate its effects and a stronger role for the private sector to use its innovative skills to find ways of reducing emissions. “New technology is going to be spurred on by putting a price on carbon”, Kim said. “It will be an extremely important incentive for innovation.”"
"The Green party has launched an ambitious election manifesto based around ending economic austerity and highlighting the environmental crisis, insisting its plans are practical and fair, despite costing an extra £200bn a year. The party’s leader, Natalie Bennett, announcing the manifesto alongside its sole MP, Caroline Lucas, said voters could transform British politics by voting Green in sufficient numbers on 7 May. “This is a new kind of politics, the end of politics as usual, the business-as-usual politics that accepts politics and society being run for the benefit of the few, not the many,” she said. Key elements of the Greens’ plans were connected to social justice, she said. “No one in this, the world’s sixth-richest economy, should fear not being able to put food on the table or not being able to keep a roof over their head. This is a politics that is founded in humanity.” While Bennett and Lucas stressed what they see as the increasingly mainstream position of the Greens in a possible post-election coalition, the 84-page manifesto remains avowedly radical in many areas, with promises including a combined £85bn of spending on home insulation, renewable energy and flood defences, a significant increase in pensions and welfare benefits, renationalising the railways and a £10 an hour minimum wage by 2020. More fundamentally, the party said, the UK should abandon an economic policy based on growth at all costs, and rebuild society around equality.  Other more specific promises include fully free social care, half a million new homes by 2020, and animal welfare policies such as bans on foie gras, fur imports and the use of whips in horse racing, and CCTV in every slaughterhouse. The new policies would cost a total of £198bn a year in additional public spending by the end of the next parliament, according to calculations at the end of the manifesto. The party said this would be funded by savings, such as cancelling the replacement for Trident, and new taxes, mainly aimed at the wealthy. The calculations include an ambitious £30bn a year by 2019 from crackdowns on tax avoidance and evasion, and £25bn from a 2% annual wealth tax on those whose assets are worth a combined £3m or more. Introducing the plans at the Arcola theatre in east London – chosen because it runs a parallel fuel cell business and aims to become carbon neutral – Bennett said her party wanted to end “the disastrous policy of austerity”. This was “making the poor, the disadvantaged and the young pay for the greed and the fraud of the bankers”. For too long, Bennett argued, the first-past-the-post electoral system had given voters a choice of the lesser of two evils with Labour and the Conservatives. “You have two barely separable parties jostling for the votes of a few swing voters in swing seats. That’s the kind of politics we have now. A kind of politics that has left so many people disappointed, even depressed.” Bennett said that during this month’s seven-way party leaders’ TV debate she had been the only person to talk about climate change.  Lucas spoke in greater detail about the party’s environmental pledges, saying such ideas were vital and had been neglected amid the austerity drive. “It’s not something that can be discarded when times are tough, like that extra cappuccino on the way to work,” she said. The party pledged £45bn to give householders a £5,000 grant to insulate their properties, concentrating on the most deprived areas. Lucas said about 9,000 people a year died prematurely in Britain because of cold homes, many more than on the roads, so the Greens’ policy was not only fair but practical, as it would permanently lower energy use and create 100,000 jobs. Luca said the Greens would support any Labour government on a case-by-case basis, giving the party a good opportunity to push its priorities. But she and Bennett refused to say whether Labour’s renewed commitment to austerity could raise problems. “It’s very difficult at this point in time, with a great deal of uncertainty, to talk through any negotiations on 8 May,” Bennett said. The manifesto contains several radical ideas, including the proposal that all new homes should be built using the Passivhaus system, a German-devised standard which aims to make properties efficient in heating and cooling. On rented housing the Greens would said they would introduce controlled rents and five-year tenancies. Significant spending is aimed at pensions and welfare, with a planned new citizens’ pension of £310 a week for a couple and £180 for single people. On education, the compulsory school age would rise to seven, but with free, voluntary provision before then. The party will expect significant scrutiny of its financial calculations, especially whether measures like a “Robin Hood tax” on financial transactions and the wealth tax – the latter of which, the party admits, has an “uncertain” yield – will finance the extra spending. Asked how the party planned to pay for the more generous welfare and pensions provisions, Bennett referred the questioner to the tables in the manifesto. “It’s all set out there, going through the details at this point isn’t a very useful thing.”"
"Last September 40,000 people attended London’s largest ever climate march. This was a big achievement for an issue that struggles to catch people’s attention. After all, as psychologists point out, it is notoriously hard to mobilise people around issues that are invisible, uncertain, set in the future and require them to make sacrifices. Or is it? This Easter, more than 2 million people will attend church in Britain to celebrate the Christian resurrection. They will agree to constrain their most primal drives in return for long-term rewards that are not just uncertain but fundamentally unknowable.  Put this way it seems obvious that the climate movement might learn some important lessons from religions – the world’s oldest and, in many countries, fastest growing movements. But to say so is anathema and contravenes two rigidly policed boundaries: one between science and faith, and the other between liberal environmentalism and conservative religions. Climate scientists are particularly keen to keep well away from the language of belief. Australia’s chief scientist, Ian Chubb, complains: “I am asked every day ‘do you believe in climate change?’ But it’s not a belief. It’s an understanding and interpretation of the evidence.” Evidence, though, comes in many forms. Social research shows clearly that the scientific data of climate change has proven unable to galvanise action. Cognitive psychology, supported in recent years by brain neuro-imaging, provides plentiful evidence that our analytic reasoning may accept the data but that we are only compelled to act by emotional triggers based on our values and core identity. “Belief” is a poisoned word, mocked by sceptical pundits like Nigel Lawson who calls climate change a “new religion” Comparing empirical science with spiritual revelation is absurd and denigrates both sides. Climate change is not a belief. But it is a conviction: a condition of strongly held opinion, attained through a process of evaluation, leading to a commitment. We know virtually nothing about how people achieve their climate conviction because scientists and activists always assume that it is absorbed, as though through osmosis, by reading a book or watching a documentary. If Christianity were promoted like climate change, all it would need would be a few Gideon’s Bibles and a website. However, religions understand the process of conviction very well. They have to. The world’s great religions are the winners from thousands of competing religions that managed to find the formulae for moving, exciting and persuading people. Few have continued the experiments more consistently than the evangelical preachers who compete every day in the cultural marketplace for new converts and donors. Among them is Joel Hunter, the charismatic pastor of Northland church, the 30th largest “megachurch” in the USA. Hunter preaches often, over the objections of his conservative church members, that climate change is a threat to God’s creation, which he shares with them as a personal “epiphany”. Hunter is an exceptionally skilled social organiser – having built his own congregation to over 15,000 – and enthusiastically accepted my invitation to draw out some key lessons for the climate movement. For Hunter conviction needs to be carefully nurtured. The creation of a supportive community is essential. Only with this can people openly express their doubts and be offered help to “walk through it together”. He then brings people to a moment of choice and invites them to make a public commitment. In evangelical crusades people are called upon to step forward to accept a change in their life – what Billy Graham called the “altar call”. Finally, Hunter says, demonstrating this commitment to the unconvinced should then become a central part of people’s activism. John Houghton is the founding co-chair of Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change and a Methodist lay preacher. In 2002 he created an “altar call” for US evangelical leaders – many of them deeply sceptical about climate change – following a week of scientific study and prayer at Oxford University. Among those attendingwas Richard Cizik,then the lead political spokesperson for the National Association of Evangelicals, and one of the most powerful figures in the Christian right. To the horror of his colleagues, when Cizik returned he began talking about his “road to Damascus conversion to climate change” all over the US media. Like Houghton, Professor Brian Hoskins, the director of the Grantham Institute for Climate Change, argues that scientific information needs this transformative moment. “Often what we do is provide the landscape in which Saint Paul can have his moment. We are creating the ether in which people can have that illumination.” Illumination? Conversion? Witness? Epiphany? These words never appear in the discussions of how we might engage people with climate change. Campaigners adopt some of the components – attending a march is a form of public commitment – but without understanding the entire package. Our websites and blogs proliferate, but we invest little in building a real-life community. We talk incessantly with each other but avoid looking beyond our own tribe. Because environmentalists do not recognise conviction, we do not recognise despair or grief. We have contempt for doubt and no one is ever at hand to “walk through it together”. We expect people to deal with their hopes and fears in isolation, constrained by a socially policed silence and given no encouragement other than a few energy-saving consumer choices and the odd petition. Nor is there any discussion of forgiveness for ourselves or our forebears. As Hunter pointed out to me, we give people a heavy moral load of guilt, responsibility and blame, but no way out. The critics are right in this regard – if climate change really were a religion, it would be a wretched one, offering guilt, blame and fear but with no recourse to salvation or forgiveness. Our understanding of climate change is built on scientific evidence, not faith. The faith displayed in the churches, mosques, and temples on every street is built on a deep understanding of human drives and emotions. Only when we put these different parts of our psyche together can we achieve change; to say to anyone who will listen: “I’ve heard the science, I’ve weighed up the evidence. Now I’m convinced. Join me.”"

"When clean technology incubator Greentown Labs moved from South Boston, Massachusetts, to the neighboring city of Somerville in 2013, the sprawling new facility was a little daunting, said chief executive Emily Reichert. With 18 member companies – all small startups – the organization filled less than half the 33,000 square feet in the building. “At that time, it seemed like an incredibly big space,” she said.  Less than two years later, Greentown Labs has expanded into every corner of the former envelope factory. With 44 member companies employing 285 people, Greentown Labs has become the largest clean tech incubator in the US, Reichert said. Member startups are working on everything from data-collecting sailboats to floating wind turbines. “It’s become a cultural center of forward thinking entrepreneurial activity,” said Gabe Blanchet, co-founder of Grove Labs, a Greentown tenant that is developing residential-scale aquaponic systems that allow tenants to grow vegetables indoors.  The Boston area has long been known as a hub of innovation and entrepreneurial activity, from the computer technology corridor that boomed along Route 128 in the 1980s to today’s flourishing biosciences sector. Greentown Labs aims to join this tradition, giving innovative sustainability-focused startups the traction they need to turn their bold ideas into game-changing realities. But until one of its growing startups makes it big – something that has not happened yet – its model of collaboration and resource sharing remains unproven.  Greentown Labs began in late 2010, when four clean energy startups, all with ties to the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, came together to split the rent on a rundown warehouse space in East Cambridge. There, they could tinker, tweak, and try out their intended products. When the warehouse was demolished in 2011, the four companies moved to a space in South Boston, expanding and bringing in more young enterprises. After just two years, the incubator had outgrown its new space and decided to move again.  When Somerville mayor Joseph Curtatone heard Greentown was looking for a new home, he decided to woo the group to his city, offering $300,000 in tax incentives. “They bring us everything we hope for in the type of companies we need to build our locally-sustainable economy,” said Curtatone, who also ordered one of Grove Labs’ first home aquaponics system.  Framed by lime green and teal blue walls, Greentown’s Somerville office is a tightly-packed collection of desks where employees study product designs, cluster together around laptops, and share ideas and advice over cups of coffee. Workshop space runs along the back and side of the building, where 3D printers whirr, plants grow under LED lights, and prototypes are assembled and honed.  Neither traditional incubators nor shared work spaces are new ideas. Greentown Labs, however, is carving out a distinctive space for itself somewhere between the two models.  Unlike most incubators, Greentown does not take equity in member companies, nor seats on their boards. Accepted companies pay $425 per month for each desk they need and $3.20 per month for each square foot of lab space.  Greentown does, however, shape the workplace environment with a careful member selection process. Successful applicants intend to produce manufactured products rather than software or services, and generally have existing investments from outside sources, Reichert said. To nurture collaboration, Greentown Labs will not accept any companies that are direct competitors with existing members.  Perhaps most importantly, all members must have an interest in cleantech and in building businesses that solve global problems, Reichert said. The result of these policies is a group of companies that easily and eagerly trade expertise and advice, according to those involved.  “Whenever we have a question or a problem, the first thing we do is throw it out to the Greentown email list,” said Ben Glass, CEO of high altitude wind turbine producer Altaeros Energies, another Greentown founder. Someone is almost always able to help immediately, he said.  Greentown also forms partnerships with corporate sponsors, including Shell, Chevron, American Airlines and Microsoft. These sponsorships, which provide about 20% of Greentown’s revenue, according to Reichert, also connect member startups with major companies that in search of new technology. In addition, the incubator hosts networking events and job fairs to help member companies make business connections and find new employees and interns.  Greentown is also hiring a manager who will help the young businesses contact and communicate with manufacturing partners. Often, Reichert said, new entrepreneurs have big ideas, but little practical knowledge about how to make the leap from prototype to production. She hopes the new manager will help bridge that gap.  With the current facility at 100% occupancy, Greentown’s directors are considering what comes next. They are looking at ways to expand within Somerville and exploring partnerships elsewhere in Massachusetts, Reichert said. The group has already started consulting with organizations looking to build their own technology incubators.  Jeff Anthony, director of the Energy Innovation Center at the Mid-West Energy Research Consortium in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, said Greentown’s advice has been crucial in developing plans for an innovation center. He point specifically to the idea of “maximizing collisions”: creating a space that generates encounters between occupants and their ideas.  “They’ve been a proven success and we’re hoping to learn even more from them,” Anthony said.  Meanwhile, many will continue watching Greentown to see if a physical space that increases collisions will ultimately end up sparking big wins – or not.

"We live in an era of great contrasts. Never before have we faced catastrophic environmental risks on a planetary level, and seldom has there been such potential for innovation to allow us to avert serious risks and transform the world. Decisions made now will have profound impacts on the Earth for centuries to come. This calls for a new logic; abundance within planetary boundaries.  Despite its obvious contradiction, we assume infinite material growth on a finite planet. This persistent “frontiers” worldview originates from the assumption that we are a relatively small world evolving on a relatively large planet. It’s easy to see why this was true up until the late 1980s, and Earth had the resilience to take whatever we threw at it.  Not any more. Since the early 90s the world has entered a new state. We have reached a saturation point in terms of human pressures on the planet. The planet is starting to send invoices back to the economy. We have a mountain of evidence to show that Earth has entered a new geological epoch, the anthropocene, where we, humanity, constitute the largest force of change on the planet. The drama is that Earth responds in surprising ways to our exponential rise in pressure. Instead of incremental change, it can cross tipping points where we can expect abrupt and often irreversible change. This applies to the collapse of fish stocks, the desertification of land, and accelerated melting of ice sheets. Pushing the planet too far may cause a feedback loop just like when a loud speaker situated too near to a microphone causes the volume to rise uncontrollably. If Earth enters such a loop we could lurch dramatically away from the extraordinarily stable environmental conditions we have been blessed with over the past 10,000 years. This would seem unwise.  We need to locate a safe operating space for humanity to thrive, and now we have a framework for this operating space: planetary boundaries. Since its publication in 2009, the planetary boundaries framework, which identified nine boundaries we should remain within, has faced intense scientific scrutiny and triggered widespread interest from organisations like WWF and Oxfam as well as business and policy. In January we confirmed the original analysis of the stability and resilience of our life-support systems on Earth. Unfortunately, the latest update indicates that humanity has transgressed four of the nine boundaries – climate, biodiversity, deforestation and the linked nitrogen and phosphorus cycles. The world is listening. The UN, World Bank, OECD, World Economic Forum and the IMF all conclude that global sustainability is now a prerequisite to alleviating poverty and securing economic development. The World Business Council for Sustainable Development (WBCSD) has adopted the planetary boundaries research and translated its Vision 2050 to an Action 2020 strategy, where planetary boundaries are transformed to an actionable roadmap for business. We have an opportunity for exponential transformation. In September this year, nations will agree the universal sustainable development goals (SDG), to replace the millennium development goals that end this year. It is the first attempt to set global goals for people and the planet – the new development paradigm. These are very promising signs. In fact, the planetary boundaries framework may be one of the most optimistic. It suggests we can now define a safe operating space for world development. These insights arise at the take-off point for potentially dramatic improvements in human wellbeing as we enter the new era of exponential technologies, from the digital revolution to harvesting benefits from nano-technology and molecular biology. What can create better incentives for fundamental breakthroughs than bounding innovation with planetary boundaries? We can now, for the first time, integrate two grand concepts: attaining abundance and honouring everyone’s right to development in the second machine age, while safeguarding a stable and resilient home.  Transformation must start within the next five to ten years to avoid potentially unmanageable risks. This makes 2015 a uniquely important year. Not once, not twice, but three times, will world leaders meet to chart the course for sustainable development; first in Addis Ababa in July on finance for development, then in New York in September on the SDGs, and finally in Paris in December on a global climate deal. It is not likely to happen again for maybe ten years. This is an opportunity we cannot afford to miss. The leadership hub is funded by Xyntéo.
