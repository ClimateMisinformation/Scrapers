"How much greenhouse gas is emitted by any individual country? With global emissions of carbon dioxide hitting a record of 36.8 billion tonnes this year, and delegates gathering in Madrid for the latest UN climate talks, it’s a pressing question. One might assume that we know precisely how much is emitted by any given country, and that such figures are rigorously cross-checked and scrutinised. And in some respects, this is true – countries are required to report their emissions to the UN, based on exhaustive guidelines and with reams of supporting data.  Yet these reports are based on what are known as inventory (or “bottom-up”) methods. To simplify, this means that governments figure out how much greenhouse gas is emitted by a typical car, cow, or coal plant, and then add up all the cows, cars and so on to get an overall emissions figure. While this method is essential to understand the make-up of a country’s emissions, it is ultimately reliant on accurate and comprehensive information on economic activity, some compromises to allow standardisation across countries, and some element of trust.  And such reporting can go awry. In 2018 and again earlier this year, colleagues and I made headlines when we first identified mystery emissions of a banned ozone-depleting substance and greenhouse gas and then later tracked its source down to factories in eastern China.

      How we traced 'mystery emissions' of CFCs back to eastern China


 The problem is that these “bottom-up” emissions reports do not generally include what some might consider key information: measurements that can indicate the actual amount of greenhouse gas in the atmosphere. So could new data help us better understand how much we are emitting? The UK, Switzerland and Australia have pioneered a measurement-based approach to add credibility and transparency to their emissions reports. In 2012, a network of measurement stations was established on telecommunications towers across the UK to sniff out greenhouse gases emitted from around the country.  To interpret these measurements, we use sophisticated computer models that simulate how gases are transported from the surface, through the atmosphere, to the points where they are observed. By comparing the modelled and measured concentrations, we can determine the national emission rate. These “top-down” estimates, which now form a key part of the UK’s National Inventory Report to the UN, have yielded some surprising insights. Sceptics may suspect that governments would be keen to “hide” emissions from the rest of the world, but in at least one case atmospheric data suggests that the UK has for years actually over-estimated, by around 100%, emissions of a potent greenhouse gas used in car air conditioners (HFC-134a). In contrast, for the major greenhouse gases methane and nitrous oxide, the data in recent years corroborates the UK inventory reports remarkably well. Naturally, once this measurement data is available, new questions emerge. For example, the UK inventory suggests that methane emissions have gradually declined since 1990 but the atmospheric data suggests little trend, if any. This is important, because the UK benchmarks its emissions reductions against the year 1990.  Could this suggest that the country has not been as successful as it thought at reducing methane leaked from landfills, for example? Or have such emissions reductions been offset by some other source? Unfortunately, such questions are difficult to answer using “standard” atmospheric measurement techniques – a molecule of methane emitted from a landfill looks very similar to one from a cow. Very similar, that is, but not identical. I am involved in a new £3m project called DARE-UK (Detection and Attribution of Regional Emissions in the UK), which looks for tell-tale features that can help us identify where carbon dioxide, methane and nitrous oxide in the atmosphere came from.  One type of signal that we are looking for is a tiny perturbation to the ratio of heavy and light isotopes of methane and carbon dioxide in the air. Isotopes are almost identical to one another but differ in their molecular mass. It turns out that cow burps, for example, emit methane with less of the heavy isotope than similar amounts of methane from a leaky gas boiler. So, we hope that this type of data may help the UK’s inventory team identify which sectors of the bottom-up reports may require re-examination. While these measurements are proving a valuable aid for inventory compilers, their main utility is likely to be in ensuring trust and transparency in the international reporting process. Atmospheric measurements do not suffer from the confidentiality issues that can prevent interested parties from peeking behind the scenes of national inventories.  Could governments still hide their emissions? It’s unlikely, provided top-down methods are used with open and transparent protocols and data sharing. This should avoid accusations of foul play that could threaten to derail initiatives like the international climate accord, the Paris Agreement.  The UK example shows this type of emissions evaluation is now ready for the international stage. Institutions such as the World Meteorological Organization are working with governments and sub-national stakeholders to try to make it happen. Hopefully policymakers will see the value of finding out what’s really being released into their air"
"It is getting closer to midnight. On Thursday, the group of scientists who orchestrate the Doomsday Clock, a symbolic instrument informing the public when the earth is facing imminent disaster, moved its minute hand from three to two and a half minutes before the final hour. It was the closest the clock had been to midnight since 1953, the year after the United States and the Soviet Union conducted competing tests of the hydrogen bomb. Though scientists decide on the clock’s position, it is not a scientific instrument, or even a physical one. The movement of its symbolic hands is decided upon by the Science and Security Board of the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists. The organization introduced the clock on the cover of its June 1947 edition, placing it at seven minutes to midnight. Since then, it has moved closer to midnight and farther away, depending on the board’s conclusions. Thursday’s announcement was made by Rachel Bronson, the executive director and publisher of the bulletin. She was assisted by the theoretical physicist Lawrence Krauss, the climate scientist and meteorologist David Titley, and the former United States ambassador Thomas Pickering. Dr. Bronson, in a   interview, explained why the board had included the   mark in the measurement. She said that it was an   signal that was meant to acknowledge “what a dangerous moment we’re in, and how important it is for people to take note. ” “We’re so concerned about the rhetoric, and the lack of respect for expertise, that we moved it 30 seconds,” she said. “Rather than create panic, we’re hoping that this drives action. ” In an   for The New York Times, Dr. Titley and Dr. Krauss elaborated on their concerns, citing the increasing threats of nuclear weapons and climate change, as well as President Trump’s pledges to impede what they see as progress on both fronts, as reasons for moving the clock closer to midnight. “Never before has the Bulletin decided to advance the clock largely because of the statements of a single person,” they wrote. “But when that person is the new president of the United States, his words matter. ” The board has held the responsibility for the clock’s movements since 1973, when the bulletin’s editor, Eugene Rabinowitch, died. Composed of scientists, and nuclear and climate experts, the board meets biannually to discuss where the clock’s hands should fall in light of world events. In the 1950s, the scientists feared nuclear annihilation, and since then, the board has begun to consider other existential threats, including climate change, compromised biosecurity and artificial intelligence. There were crises that the clock was not quick enough to take into account. The Cuban Missile Crisis, for instance, in 1962, did not change the hands of the clock, which at the time stood at seven minutes to midnight. An explanation on the Bulletin’s website accounts for this seeming lapse in timekeeping: “The Cuban Missile Crisis, for all its potential and ultimate destruction, only lasted a few weeks,” it says. “However, the lessons were quickly apparent when the United States and the Soviet Union installed the first hotline between the two capitals to improve communications, and, of course, negotiated the 1963 test ban treaty, ending all atmospheric nuclear testing. ” The end of the Cold War came as a relief to those who had lived in fear of nuclear annihilation for decades, and the minute hand slowly moved away from danger. In 1990, it was at 10 minutes to midnight. The next year, it was a full 17 minutes away, at the relatively undisturbing time of 11:43. “The illusion that tens of thousands of nuclear weapons are a guarantor of national security has been stripped away,” the Bulletin said at the time. But over the next two decades the clock slowly ticked back. Conflict between India and Pakistan, both of whom staged nuclear weapons tests three weeks apart, had the clock at nine minutes to midnight in 1998. By 2007, fears about Iranian and North Korean nuclear capacity had pushed it to 11:55. By 2015, the scientists were back in a state of unmitigated concern, with the clock at three minutes to midnight, the closest it had been since 1984. “Unchecked climate change, global nuclear weapons modernizations, and outsized nuclear weapons arsenals pose extraordinary and undeniable threats to the continued existence of humanity,” the bulletin said. “World leaders have failed to act with the speed or on the scale required to protect citizens from potential catastrophe. ” “These failures of political leadership endanger every person on Earth,” it added."

 **[B]e it resolved that [our school] is a Heterodox University**   
  
  
We make the following specific requests to the faculty and administration:   
  
  
**1) Adopt the Chicago Principles on Freedom of Expression**   
  
  
A clear way for the university to show commitment to viewpoint diversity is by adopting the University of Chicago’s Principles on Freedom of Expression, which state in part:   
  
  
The University’s fundamental commitment is to the principle that debate or deliberation may not be suppressed because the ideas put forth are thought by some or even by most members of the University community to be offensive, unwise, immoral, or wrong‐​headed. It is for the individual members of the University community, not for the University as an institution, to make those judgments for themselves, and to act on those judgments not by seeking to suppress speech, but by openly and vigorously contesting the ideas that they oppose. Indeed, fostering the ability of members of the University community to engage in such debate and deliberation in an effective and responsible manner is an essential part of the University’s educational mission.   
  
  
We request that the Faculty Senate endorse the “Chicago Principles” as official university policy.   
  
  
**2) Implement a non‐​obstruction policy for protests**   
  
  
We support the right of all students to protest against speakers and writers with whom they disagree, but we ask that protests be done in a way that does not deprive other students of their rights to speak and hear. When members of our community shout down a speaker, or take other actions intended to make it more difficult for a speaker to speak or for an audience to hear, they are practicing obstruction, censorship, and sometimes intimidation, not free speech. Such practices have no place in any academic community. We request that the university formulate and enforce a non‐​obstruction policy. As stated in the Chicago Principles: “The University has a solemn responsibility not only to promote a lively and fearless freedom of debate and deliberation, but also to protect that freedom when others attempt to restrict it.”   
  
  
**3) Improve viewpoint diversity**   
  
  
We request that the university include viewpoint diversity, and particularly political diversity, in its diversity policies and in its efforts to diversify the faculty and the curriculum. We want to encounter a range of viewpoints in the classroom, just as we will after we graduate.



Adoption of these resolutions will mark a school as a “Heterodox University” – a safe space for intellectual diversity and uncensored speech. Heterodox Academy stands ready to help tailor these resolutions to specific universities and to help support students who wish to promote these principles. For more information, click here.

"It’s becoming a familiar scene on the news: sodden British people wading through streets up to their knees in flood water. From Stirling to Sheffield, many parts of the UK in 2019 felt the impact of severe surface water flooding – often referred to as flash flooding – that followed torrential rain. As the climate changes and the UK experiences more intense summer storms, this is becoming an increasingly important issue.  Surface water flooding is what happens in built-up areas when heavy rainfall has nowhere to go. Unable to enter a watercourse or drainage system, the water instead flows over the ground causing flash flooding. Increased development means more areas are paved over, leaving fewer places for rainfall to drain away. And more frequent heavy rains overload the sewer and drainage network, which makes flash flooding more likely.  James Bevan, chief executive of the England and Wales Environment Agency, said this kind of flooding “threatens more people and properties than any other form of flood risk”. In 2016, the UK government included surface water flooding on the national risk register. Unlike river and coastal flooding, which can be widespread (as was seen in November 2019 across parts of northern England), surface water flooding presents unique challenges because it’s difficult to predict the location, timing and impact of what are typically localised events. As the climate changes and urban populations grow, the number of people at risk of surface water flooding increases. This risk is particularly high in Scotland with over 100,000 properties identified at risk from flash floods. And for many people, even if their home or business is not at risk, there’s a good chance the roads or railway lines they use are.  Although Scotland’s river and coastal flooding warning systems are well established, surface water alerting is still in its infancy. To address this gap, the Scottish Environment Protection Agency (SEPA) is continually developing its flood forecasting service with the Flood Warning Development Framework for 2017-21, which aims to explore and test innovative ways to warn people about flash floods. Developing an effective forecasting system requires hydrological models that represent surface run-off, inundation and water movement, showing how water travels via surface and urban sewerage and drainage networks. Prediction models are also needed to quantify uncertainty in forecasting the rainfall that causes surface water flooding. The uncertain nature of intense storms means that heavy rainfall can happen without much warning. This coupled with the pressure that excess natural run-off puts on man-made drainage networks when there are fewer places for water to go, makes surface water flooding forecasting a real challenge.  It’s a particularly acute problem in Scotland where the climate and geography contribute to the high uncertainties around predicting the location and timing of flooding. A 2016 study found the most dangerous flash floods in the UK include those that resulted from rapidly developing thunderstorm systems. Such storms can result in sudden and dangerous flooding in urban areas – yet these are the most challenging weather systems for flood forecasters to predict. In the past five years, there has been a rapid development of thunderstorm numerical weather prediction computer models and advances in what is called probabilistic ensemble forecasting. This means instead of making a single forecast of the most likely weather, a set (or ensemble) of forecasts is produced, giving an indication of the range of possible weather ahead. Combined with an increase in computing power and skill, it is now becoming feasible to develop flash flood forecasting systems for urban areas.  Earlier this year, we were commissioned by SEPA to review the state of the science behind surface water flood forecasting in Scotland. Based on an extensive review of published research and reports, coupled with discussions with industry experts, we show that recent advances in computing, thunderstorm models, ensemble forecasting and surface water modelling mean that it is possible for SEPA to explore and build on the accumulated global knowledge about flash flood forecasting. The risk of surface water flooding in Scotland is communicated through SEPA’s Flood Guidance Statement and Flood Alerts, where assessment is based on predetermined rainfall amount and duration thresholds and local expert knowledge. This helped to provide the UK’s first surface water flood risk forecasts for each of the big sporting events at the 2014 Commonwealth Games in Glasgow. This information is useful to emergency services and the public, but the ability to provide detailed information on the location and timing of flash flooding remains limited. SEPA’s review highlights the growing need to provide more focused forecasts to help those concerned make the right decisions. It also identifies opportunities to learn how other countries respond to similar flooding that could be applied to Scotland. The review provides several examples of initiatives that could improve the monitoring of flash flood impacts, including better use of crowdsourced data, as happens in the Netherlands, and better weather forecast visualisation tools (such as 3-D interactive displays and animations) as demonstrated in Spain. It may never be possible to prevent flash flooding, but reliable and early forecasting can help improve the capacity to prepare, respond and recover. The recent introduction of thunderstorm models and ensemble forecasting has resulted in significant advances in forecasting rainfall. This means it may now be possible to forecast flash flooding in urban areas, as well as make forecasts and warnings more focused and easier to understand, which in turn will help people make better, more informed decisions. Producing flood forecasts for any particular location is likely to remain challenging beyond a few hours in advance – there will always be limits to the predictability of extreme rainfall. But our capacity to predict extreme weather is constantly improving, which SEPA may be able to apply to surface water flood forecasting. Solutions for communicating uncertainty of heavy rainfall forecasts continue to develop. Our work means that a step-change in flash flood forecasting that builds on the experience of SEPA, the rest of the UK and other countries, is now possible. Making the best use of all available data – including social media and crowdsourced data – will increase awareness of flash flooding and help communities prepare and respond more effectively.

"**Hong Kong stocks have fallen again as another day of anti-government protests cast a shadow over the city and rattled investors.**
The Hang Seng index lost 2.2%, outpacing falls across Asia, continuing a downward path since Monday.
It comes amid more clashes between protesters and police, and the partial closure of the transport network.
Unrest has gripped the Asian financial hub for nearly five months, knocking the economy and business confidence.
This week has seen a marked escalation in violence with intense street battles, violent clashes at universities and flashmob lunchtime protests in the financial heart of Hong Kong.
""The situation in Hong Kong has taken a decidedly dark turn this week with the violence and economic disruption seemingly gathering pace,"" Oanda analyst Jeff Halley said.
He said worries about intervention by Beijing have ""ratcheted materially higher"" keeping Asian markets ""cautious at best"".
The protests have dealt a blow to the local economy and Hong Kong recently tipped into recession. Tourism and retail businesses have been among those hardest hit as travellers stay away.
""Social unrest, coupled with uncertainty from the US-China trade tensions, have dampened overall business sentiment in Hong Kong,"" IHS Markit analyst Maojun Ye said.
At the Chinese University of Hong Kong police fired tear gas and rubber bullets as protesters started fires and threw petrol bombs.
Fresh lunchtime protests in the financial district saw crowds gather to chant slogans. Some black-clad protesters also vandalised a branch of the mainland Bank of Communications.
Hong Kong is part of China, but as a former British colony it has some autonomy and people have more rights.
The protests started in June against plans to allow extradition to the mainland - which many feared would erode the city's freedoms.
The bill was withdrawn in September but demonstrations continued and now call for full democracy and an inquiry into police behaviour.
Clashes between police and activists have become increasingly violent and in October the city banned all face masks."

Politicians hide behind enquiries – their magic answer to all problems, especially bushfires.



Announcing enquiries give the impression of decisive action, they generate fees for armies of barristers, lawyers and bureaucrats, and provide momentary excitement for the media.



The proposed 2020 Australian Bushfires corrobboree will provide a grandstand for the Climate Rebellion Mob who will get starring roles on ABC/Fairfax. Big business will probably propose a carbon tax to fight bushfires while foresters and land owners will hardly be heard.



When the final report is ultimately delivered, the media will be off trumpeting some new climate “emergency” to scare the public. The expensive new report will be quietly filed with all the others.



We’ve had at least 57 bushfire enquiries since 1939 – about one every two years. Anyone who bothers to read them will soon deduce what should be done. Nothing much has changed except there are more people living in fire prone zones with no protection, and more forest and private land was locked up with heavy fuel loads.



The current bushfire tragedy has occurred after 30 years of unprecedented government control of environmental policy at all levels of government. Many of these destructive policies have been imported under so-called “international agreements”. As a result, ordinary Australians have been dragged into court for constructing firebreaks or removing dangerous trees on their own land. Governments and Green advisers have assumed total stewardship of the environment and they own the results – massive destruction of lives, homes, property, animals and vegetation – over five million hectares and 2,000 homes burnt.



Here is a five point plan which should come from Bushfire Enquiry number 58.



Firstly, reduce the fuel load especially in national parks and forests by cool season burning, grazing, timber harvesting, slashing/mulching and collecting dead fire-wood. Appoint trained and experienced foresters to maintain safe and healthy public forests. Private landowners should also be enabled and obliged to become fire safe. Green-tinged politicians and bureaucrats have prevented or hampered all of these reforms.



Secondly, create and maintain wide clear trafficable roads, tracks and firebreaks through the forests and around towns and private properties. In fire seasons, these patrolled fire-barriers will help to confine any fire to one sector and provide a prepared line from which to back burn if there is an approaching fire.



Thirdly, build more dams and weirs to provide water for fire-fighting and to provide fire havens for humans, animals and vegetation. Increase penalties for arson in times of high fire danger.



Fourthly, abolish all restrictions on responsible management of “protected” vegetation reserves on private land – especially the private land sterilised to fulfil foolish government Kyoto Protocol promises or under government-enforced vegetation protection orders. Governments have created these fire hazards by trying to wrap vast areas of vegetation in cotton wool and green tape (both of which are flammable). Government “protection” of flora and fauna has proved to be the fiery kiss of death.



Fifthly, decentralise fuel and forest management out of the cities and into the regions.



City-based politicians and bureaucrats have done enormous harm by locking up land and opposing fuel load reduction.



Decisions on vegetation risk management should be handed to property owners, park rangers, forest managers and rural fire wardens.



There is no useful role for the Commonwealth unless asked by States or regions for logistic support or to help fund bushfire training and fuels management. Otherwise, it is better if Canberra politicians keep out of the way – send them all for a holiday in Hawaii.



 _Viv Forbes has been an explorer, pastoralist and weather-watcher in Queensland and NT for most of his long life. He has lit fires (accidentally and deliberately), and he and his wife have fought fires and had their camps, fences and pastures wiped out by fires.

"A total of 28 trillion tonnes of ice have disappeared from the surface of the Earth since 1994. That is stunning conclusion of UK scientists who have analysed satellite surveys of the planet’s poles, mountains and glaciers to measure how much ice coverage lost because of global heating triggered by rising greenhouse gas emissions. The scientists – based at Leeds and Edinburgh universities and University College London – describe the level of ice loss as “staggering” and warn that their analysis indicates that sea level rises, triggered by melting glaciers and ice sheets, could reach a metre by the end of the century. “To put that in context, every centimetre of sea level rise means about a million people will be displaced from their low-lying homelands,” said Professor Andy Shepherd, director of Leeds University’s Centre for Polar Observation and Modelling. The scientists also warn that the melting of ice in these quantities is now seriously reducing the planet’s ability to reflect solar radiation back into space. White ice is disappearing and the dark sea or soil exposed beneath it is absorbing more and more heat, further increasing the warming of the planet. In addition, cold fresh water pouring from melting glaciers and ice sheets is causing major disruptions to the biological health of Arctic and Antarctic waters, while loss of glaciers in mountain ranges threatens to wipe out sources of fresh water on which local communities depend. “In the past researchers have studied individual areas – such as the Antarctic or Greenland – where ice is melting. But this is the first time anyone has looked at all the ice that is disappearing from the entire planet,” said Shepherd. “What we have found has stunned us.” The level of ice loss revealed by the group matches the worst-case-scenario predictions outlined by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), he added. The group studied satellite surveys of glaciers in South America, Asia, Canada and other regions; sea ice in the Arctic and Antarctic; ice sheets that cover the ground in Antarctica and Greenland; and ice shelves thatprotrude from the Antarctic mainland into the sea. The study covered the years 1994 to 2017. The researchers’ conclusion is that all the regions have suffered devastating reductions in ice cover in the past three decades and these losses are continuing.  “To put the losses we’ve already experienced into context, 28 trillion tonnes of ice would cover the entire surface of the UK with a sheet of frozen water that is 100 metres thick,” added group member Tom Slater from Leeds University. “It’s just mind-blowing.” As to the cause of these staggering losses, the group is adamant: “There can be little doubt that the vast majority of Earth’s ice loss is a direct consequence of climate warming,” they state in their review paper, which is published in the online journal Cryosphere Discussions. “On average, the planetary surface temperature has risen by 0.85C since 1880, and this signal has been amplified in the polar regions,” they state. Both sea and atmospheric temperatures have risen as a result and the resulting double whammy has triggered the catastrophic ice losses uncovered by the group. In the case of the melting ice sheet in Antarctica, rising sea temperatures have been the main driver while increasing atmospheric temperatures have been the cause of ice loss from inland glaciers such as those in the Himalayas. In Greenland, ice loss has been triggered by a combination of both sea and atmospheric temperatures increasing. The team stressed that not all the ice that was lost over that period would have contributed to sea level rises. “A total of 54% of the lost ice was from sea ice and from ice shelves,” said Leeds University researcher Isobel Lawrence. “These float on water and their melting would not have contributed to sea level rises. The other 46% of meltwater came from glaciers and ice sheets on the ground, and they would have added to sea level rise.” The group’s results were published 30 years after the first assessment report of the IPCC was published, at the end of August 1990. This outlined, in stark terms, that global warming was real and was being triggered by increasing emissions of greenhouse gases from the burning of fossil fuels. Despite warnings from scientists, these emissions have continued to rise as global temperatures continued to soar. According to figures released by the Met Office last week, there was a 0.14C increase in global temperatures between the decade 1980-89 and the decade 1990-1999, then a 0.2C increase between each of the following decades. This rate of increase is expected to rise, possibly to around 0.3C a decade, as carbon emissions continue on their upward trajectory."

There’s a very disturbing tendency among academics — though many people in policy fights do it — to dodge substantive debate by declaring, basically, “the other side is full of garbage so just ignore them.” You probably see it most glaringly about climate change — no one credible disagrees with Al Gore! — but I see it far too frequently regarding the possibility that government student aid, the bulk of which comes from Washington, is a significant factor behind college price inflation.   
  
  
Today, we are treated to this lame dodge in a letter to the _Washington Post_ from Terry Hartle, Senior Vice President at the American Council on Education, arguably the most powerful of Ivory Tower advocacy groups. He writes: 



Second, we must do away with one of the most persistent and pernicious myths of higher education: that increases in federal aid drive up the cost of college. Several studies, including two by the Education Department, show there is no link between federal student aid and tuition increases. But there are still those who would have people believe that modest increases in student aid programs are the driving force behind institutions’ decisions about tuition and fees.



I would love to put this “myth” myth to rest. Yes, as I discuss in my recent policy analysis, there are serious challenges in trying to _prove_ that aid fuels price inflation. Lots of variables affect what colleges charge; you need to study long time frames encompassing several business cycles; and you have to account for the fact that aid automatically rises when prices do. So while there is tremendous logical reason to think aid has enabled price inflation — former college presidents acknowledge as much, basic economics says subsidies drive up demand, etc. — like any social science there is no definitive proof.   
  
  
That sure as heck doesn’t mean, though, that there isn’t any research showing government aid driving price inflation, even if it doesn’t prove it. In addition to the incredibly powerful rational reasons to strongly suspect aid plays a big role in out‐​of‐​control college pricing, there is, indeed, empirical evidence. For the benefit of the whole debate I offer a smattering of it below, hopefully putting an end to the disturbing denial tactic employed by Hartle and others. Hopefully, but not likely.…

The arse-covering and blame-shifting in the wake of Australia’s catastrophic summer continues with unseemly haste. It goes without saying that the odious Greens were first out the gate, trying to exploit the fires for grubby political advantage, even as forests, houses, wildlife and people were burning. Now, politicians and bureaucrats on all sides of the political fence are busily engaged in their own, desperate political backburning.



Two senior NSW government ministers have accused their own environmental agencies of not conducting enough hazard reduction burning in the lead-up to the bushfire season, with Deputy Premier **John Barilaro** blaming green ideology for allowing forest fuel loads to build up.



Mr Barilaro said the NSW ­National Parks and Wildlife Service was “ideologically opposed” to hazard reductions.



In a separate interview, NSW Water Minister **Melinda Pavey** suggested it was wrong to blame climate change for the recent devastating bushfires when there were more practical solutions that could be deployed.



But state governments in Australia are responsible for managing national parks, so, in a real sense, Barilaro as Deputy Premier shares at least some responsibility. Still, he is almost certainly right in most respects. Governments come and go, but bureaucracies fossilise in place and zealously guard their little fiefdoms against interference by mere elected representatives.



“I genuinely do believe we have agencies within government that, over decades, haven’t actually honoured their commitments for fuel reduction because of ideological positions, especially in national parks. We just lock them up.”



Pavey is also absolutely right: climate change almost certainly had sod-all to do with these fires.



But, someone with even more direct responsibility for national parks is NSW Environment Minister **Matt Kean**. Guess who’s desperate to pin the blame on climate change?



The comments of Mr Barilaro and Ms Pavey — both Nationals — are at odds with that of their cabinet colleague, NSW Environment Minister Matt Kean, who is advocating for a greater focus on renewable technologies to bring down the state’s carbon emissions. He has not ruled out increasing hazard reduction burning.



Mr Kean sparked a furore this week after he alleged some senior federal government MPs were uncomfortable with Scott Morrison’s stance on climate change, and that they wanted more drastic action to be taken, prompting a backlash from fellow party members.



Still, while it has lagged behind hazard reduction targets for years, NSW at least made the effort to reach its targets last year. Not so Victoria, which has never once met its targets – even though its targets are far below what the Black Saturday royal commission recommended.



So it’s no surprise to see who’s getting all defensive, and trying to blame climate change.



Victorian Environment Minister **Lily D’Ambrosio** , also from Labor, would not say whether she supported Mr Morrison’s proposal but did defend the state’s record on hazard reduction…



Queensland’s Acting Minister for Fire and Emergency Services, **Di Farmer** , criticised the Prime Minister’s call for a national standard for bushfire hazard-­reduction burns, saying his lack of action on climate change was “an international embarrassment”.



Queensland: also a Labor state, just like Victoria.



Fancy that. Surely it’s not like they’ve got any reason to shift blame…?

"Christmas and mistletoe: have you ever simply asked yourself … why? I have studied plant parasites like mistletoe for almost ten years, and I’m here to tell you that the answer is absolutely fascinating. In Norse mythology, Baldur (younger brother to magic-hammer-wielding Thor), was the subject of a premonition from his mother Frigg, who could see the future: he would be killed. Frigg tackled this head on, extracting an oath from every object on Earth, to avoid harming her son. This was agreeable to all … except mistletoe, which was overlooked.  Loki, the god of mischief, exploited this loophole and used mistletoe to create a toxin-laced dart, giving it to Hod (blind brother of Baldur), who he tricked into killing Baldur. It turns out that Baldur was practically invincible at this stage, and got his kicks by letting the other gods shoot arrows and darts at him. Of course, he hadn’t factored mistletoe into his thinking.  The mythology scatters after Baldur’s death, but in many versions of the story, Frigg’s tears became the pearlescent berries of mistletoe, which were hung over doors as a reminder and mark of respect.  Other versions recount that the gods were able to negotiate Baldur’s release from Hel, the goddess of death. Frigg, keen to sweep her mistletoe faux pas right under the carpet, declared the plant to be a symbol of love rather than scorn, and vowed to kiss everyone that passed underneath.  It is thought that the Baldur incident, and later adoption of mistletoe as a symbol of fertility by Celtic druids, were responsible for the cultural collision of mistletoe with the modern day Christmas period, and its association with the act of kissing. In the 1800s, the author Washington Irving wrote that “young men have the privilege of kissing the girls under [mistletoe], plucking each time a berry from the bush. When the berries are all plucked the privilege ceases.” The symbolism and act of privilege has become more nuanced since then, but the association remains. As fascinating as the mythology and folklore around mistletoe might be, I’m actually much more intrigued by the biology.  Mistletoe is a parasite – it steals water and nutrients from trees. Technically, it is a “hemiparasite”, which means that it can generate some of its own resources through photosynthesis – it just needs that energetic kick from the sun to fuel the biological siege and subsequent invasion of the tree. It must breach the tree’s defences in order to complete its life-cycle. Once inside the host, the vast majority of the mistletoe’s energy requirements are met by resources stolen from the host tree. Most mistletoe seeds are spread by birds, which eat the berries and defecate on tree branches. If attached to a new host tree, the parasitic seed releases a compound called “viscin”, which dries to form a stiff biological cement. Many mistletoes will wait until the following spring before they germinate, and the viscin cement ensures that the seed is in it for the long haul. Some species of mistletoe spread their seed by wind, and some are even able to disperse them explosively. Water accumulates in the viscin cells of dwarf mistletoe varieties, building pressure on the inside of the berry until it reaches a threshold point, splitting the berry and blasting the seeds up to 15 metres away, at a velocity of 50km/hour – rapid!  Whereas most plants grow towards the light, and use gravity to inform their growth patterns, mistletoe does its own thing, and grows away from the light (towards the tree). It also ignores gravity so that it can infect the tree in any direction. The parasitic mistletoe also responds positively to mechanical stimulation (touch), and will develop a special invasive organ called a “haustorium”, which it will use to invade the tree branch. Once the parasite is inside, it will manipulate the host tree, and steal all the resources that it needs to grow, flower and reproduce.  Although parasites are by nature extremely selfish in their actions, mistletoe also provides some useful ecosystem services by attracting and providing food for birds during the winter.  Few parasites enjoy the cultural celebration of mistletoe. But beware of any claims of its value as an alternative medicine – you should never consider self-medication with it, or any other “medicinal plant”. Always seek professional advice from your doctor. Mistletoe does, however, contain compounds called “lectins”, which are being tested in clinical trials for cancer treatment. Even if the trials are successful, it could be some time before a safe form of therapy is developed. The berries are poisonous, so don’t eat them. Great for birds – not so great for humans. Mistletoe was also used as a symbol of fertility by the druids, almost certainly because it is an evergreen plant, which can blossom in mid-winter. As it lives on deciduous trees, the contrast of its fertility and growth relative to the defoliated and barren host tree during mid-winter is quite stark.  So there you have it. Christmas and mistletoe, a bizarre pairing of holiday and parasite, which emerged from a melting pot of traditions and worldviews. Merry Christmas, indeed!"

You Ought to Have a Look _is a feature from the Center for the Study of Science posted by Patrick J. Michaels and Paul C. (“Chip”) Knappenberger. While this section will feature all of the areas of interest that we are emphasizing, the prominence of the climate issue is driving a tremendous amount of web traffic. Here we post a few of the best in recent days, along with our color commentary._   
  
\---   
  
As you may have guessed from the title of this post, this week we call attention to a few articles around the web examining the common sense behind a tax on carbon. It turns out there is none.   
  
From time to time, there is a pitch made to conservatives that a “revenue neutral” carbon tax would be a win-win for everyone. It would help mitigate climate change while at the same time spur economic activity. Even if you don’t care about the former, you’re bound to like the latter. Or vice versa.   
  
To try to win some new carbon tax recruits in the incoming Republican-led Congress, two recent high profile articles—one in the _Washington Post_ by one-time Obama economic adviser Larry Summer and the other on _National Review Online_ by the Hudson Institute’s Irwin Stelzer—make that argument, with embellishments.   
  
If a carbon tax sounds too good to be true, then your intuition is correct.   
  
Robert Murphy, an economist for the Institute for Energy Research, provides the technical details, collected from the economic literature, as to why the economic gains don’t actually come along with a carbon tax as they are being promised. In his _National Review Online_ article “Taxing Carbon Won’t Help the Economy,” Murphy rebuts many of Stelzer’s claims. Ultimately, he delivers this sage advice:   




Far from offering something for everyone, a revenue-neutral carbon tax advances the policy agenda of the environmental Left at the expense of the American people. The economic theory of a carbon tax is unmoored from political reality. In practice, carbon-tax supporters have shown that they would rather spend the revenue on pet projects than reduce taxes, thereby hindering economic growth. Conservatives should resist the temptation to give central planners in Washington more money to waste and more control over our economic affairs.



Another take on the carbon tax is offered by our good friend, the always insightful Marlo Lewis, from the Competitive Enterprise Institute. Marlo takes on Summers’ “Oil Swoon Creates the Opening for a Carbon Tax” with his own “Oil ‘Swoon’ Is Not an Argument for Carbon Taxes” over at the blog for Globalwarming.org.   
  
Marlo leads off with this bit of depressing (yet predictable) news,   




It was inevitable. As soon as consumers and the economy start to enjoy significant relief from a decade of pain at the pump, the political class clamors for higher gas taxes and new carbon taxes.



Marlo then takes us through the long list of supposed “benefits” of a carbon tax, tearing each one down along the way. From “Is carbon energy a tax haven?” to “Do we overuse fossil fuels?” to “Would a carbon tax make energy markets more efficient?” Marlo’s answer is always the same, “No.” He summarizes:   




Summers makes a clear, concise, but unpersuasive case for a carbon tax. The holes in the argument are not his doing but rather arise from the thesis he propounds. The case for a carbon tax fails because:   






Also adding to the anti-carbon tax sentiment is Heritage Foundation economist Nicolas Loris. Loris highlights the results of an economic analysis of a carbon tax that the Heritage Foundation recently conducted. According to Loris:   




Using the same model as the Energy Information Administration, we modeled what a carbon tax equivalent to the federal government’s social cost of carbon estimate would do to the economy between 2015 and 2030 and found:   






Loris has this most useful suggestion:   




Here’s a better deal: Let’s cut the taxes we don’t like and in turn everyone will get more economic growth, more jobs with higher wages and a better standard of living for all Americans. Such a policy will provide the world with more wealth and resources to tackle the problems of the future, whether they’re climate-related or not.



These are three good counters to arguments for a carbon tax that everyone should be familiar with. So, to stay in the know, you ought to have a look!


"
"The election of Donald Trump and the accompanying rehabilitation of fossil fuels should have been, by all rights, devastating for Tesla Motors. Tesla is the top maker of   autos, and it completed its merger with SolarCity, a leading manufacturer of solar energy panels, days after the presidential election. Elon Musk, the visionary founder of both companies, openly criticized Mr. Trump’s candidacy, saying on CNBC just before the vote that he was “not the right guy” for the job. Mr. Musk has pressed for a carbon tax to combat global warming, which Mr. Trump once dismissed as a Chinese hoax. The mere mention of a carbon tax inflames the old guard of the energy industry. Moreover, both Tesla and SolarCity benefit from federal subsidies. Robert E. Murray, a coal executive and Trump supporter, has called Mr. Musk “a fraud” for accepting $2 billion in government handouts. So why have Tesla shares surged since Mr. Trump’s election, closing this week within striking distance of a record high? Adam Jonas, a prominent automotive analyst at Morgan Stanley, upgraded Tesla stock to overweight last week, with a target price of $305 a share. (It was trading this week at about $255.) “When you look at the businesses Tesla is in, you see many areas of overlapping interest” with the Trump administration, Mr. Jonas told me. “To the extent the new administration prioritizes the creation of valuable, innovative high tech and manufacturing jobs, Tesla stands at the epicenter of that. ” Shares in pure solar energy companies haven’t fared as well, but even they have now regained nearly all the ground they lost immediately after Mr. Trump’s victory. Solar investors “aren’t nearly as negative as they were the day after the election,” said Andrew Hughes, an alternative energy analyst for Credit Suisse. One reason for that shift seems to be a budding bromance between Mr. Trump and Mr. Musk. The   invited Mr. Musk to Trump Tower in December as part of a group of technology executives and named him to his strategic and policy forum of business leaders. And Mr. Musk was with a group of manufacturing executives at a White House meeting this week at which, according to a participant, he broached the subject of a carbon tax. Surprisingly, Mr. Trump didn’t reject it out of hand. For his part, Mr. Musk this week endorsed Rex W. Tillerson, a pillar of the fossil fuel establishment as chief executive of Exxon Mobil, for secretary of state. Mr. Jonas said that the “strategic relationship between Tesla leadership and the new administration is an important development” in his decision to upgrade Tesla stock. “That Trump would be relying on Musk as an adviser has come as quite a surprise to many people,” Mr. Jonas said. A major fear of investors in solar power was that a Trump administration would end the federal subsidies so reviled by fossil fuel proponents. While that remains a concern, the most recent jobs data suggests that the subsidies have led to a surge in new   jobs, exactly what the president has advocated. This month, the Energy Department noted in its annual energy and jobs report that “solar technologies, both photovoltaic and concentrated, employ almost 374, 000 workers, or 43 percent of the electric power generation work force. ” (Coal, by contrast, accounts for about 86, 000 workers.) “The jobs data is a compelling argument in favor of the tax credits,” Mr. Hughes said. He noted that federal solar subsidies were set to expire anyway in a few years, a result of rare bipartisan cooperation in Congress. Mr. Musk has stressed that solar energy is close to reaching a scale where federal subsidies will no longer be needed. And Tesla is also expanding rapidly. Tesla employs 25, 000 workers in the United States and could easily double that as it ramps up production for its new Model 3 and expands its Gigafactory, a lithium ion battery manufacturing operation in Nevada. “I don’t know what kind of multiplier you put on that, but it’s a significant boost to the economy,” Mr. Jonas said. Federal subsidies for electric vehicles will also end once a manufacturer hits 200, 000 vehicles, a level Tesla may soon reach. Mr. Trump and Mr. Musk appear to have other areas of overlapping interest as well. Mr. Musk has broached the subject of the nation’s aging electricity transmission grid in conversations with Mr. Trump, according to an insider with knowledge of the discussions. Mr. Musk has advocated a   smart grid and has said that eventually Tesla will offer grid services, such as batteries that can be added to the grid and paired with solar and wind farms. This is the kind of   infrastructure project that Mr. Trump has supported. And Tesla’s success could help fend off Chinese efforts to compete or even dominate in what could be an important piece of the car industry’s future. But the ultimate bond between the two may simply be that they both like to think big. As Joel Achenbach has reported in The Washington Post, Mr. Musk seems to have captured the new president’s imagination with his SpaceX project  —   which designs, manufactures and launches advanced rockets and spacecraft  —   and his fascination with transporting human life to other planets. A manned mission to Mars (a joint venture between NASA and SpaceX that would reduce the costs and risks to taxpayers) might well become Mr. Trump’s version of “landing a man on the moon and returning him safely to the Earth” within a decade, the challenge that President John F. Kennedy set before Congress in 1961. It’s still early in the Trump administration, and some (or all) of this may turn out to be wishful thinking by fans of Mr. Musk, Tesla investors, environmentalists and hopeful space colonists. “I want to believe that Trump won’t kill solar,” Mr. Hughes said. “But there’s still a lot of uncertainty. The big question: Will he take away the tax credits?” Still, there’s a growing sense that Mr. Trump and Tesla can not only coexist, but even thrive together. “You don’t have to be   to be   fuel,” Mr. Jonas said."
"What exactly are the nature of the changes needed to address the climate emergency, and who is responsible for making it happen? An emergency is a situation where we need to act fast in order to prevent catastrophic consequences – like rushing to stop a child running in front of a bus, mobilising fire fighters to put out a forest fire, or intercepting a lorry smuggling explosives for a planned attack. Most would agree these are all examples of emergencies, but the timescales for action are different: seconds for the child, hours for the fire, and perhaps days or even months for the lorry. So while emergencies demand urgent, coordinated and effective responses, the exact timescale depends on the nature of emergency. The weather can change from moment to moment, but climate is long term concept. It takes years for us even to collect enough data to notice that the climate is changing. Here, the emergency moves in years, not minutes. And the problem with things that change over many years is that there is always something else that appears to need more urgent attention.  For most of the last 30 years we have known that we need to do something about climate change, but other things have been perceived to be more important, and so it has been repeatedly pushed to the back of the queue. After all, the impact of climate change won’t hit until 2050 or 2100, and that is just too far away to worry about – isn’t it? In fact, most people on this planet will still be alive in 2050, when life for many of us is projected to be looking pretty uncomfortable. And greenhouse gases linger in the atmosphere so long that our children will still be living with the environmental consequences of our carbon emissions of 2019 in 2100. So who should act? It’s easy to say that governments should do something – and perhaps they should. But the reality is that politicians generally do the things that they believe we want. So if we think it’s the job of government to sort this mess out, we should be telling our politicians just that. We should be urging them to think long term not short term, and not to oppose measures like fuel duty escalators (a rising tax on fossil fuels to encourage alternatives) and carbon taxes (a tax on burning fossil fuels as a way of pricing in the environmental damage they cause) just because they will hurt in the short term.  It’s going to take some pretty radical measures to wean us off our addiction to energy and the carbon emissions energy generation creates. Governments essentially have two main options: to reduce consumption by banning things, or by making them expensive so we use less. Of course, governments can also invest in new technology and new initiatives, but that is a longer term solution and doesn’t really help address the need for urgent action now. If we want governments to do this, we must tell them so, and be prepared for the consequences.

Send your questions – along with your first name, age and the area where you live – to ineedtoknow@theconversation.com, or find out more ways to get in touch at the end of this article. You could of course argue that governments don’t generally run the most polluting industries such as power stations, cement works and factories. Industrialists are often pointed to as the real villains. But, again, they’re really just making the furniture, clothing, toiletries and luxury goods that we demand, or that they think we’ll want. It is consumption that drives markets, at home or abroad. If there was no demand for the colossal quantity of stuff that we consume every year, they would stop making it.  Some people argue that their consumption is small compared to others (the average Briton has a much lower carbon footprint than the average American, for example). But that becomes a playground game – “I’m not going to decarbonise if you’re not going to decarbonise” – where we all want our share of the right to pollute. The reality is that our allowance of the cumulative emissions our planet, individually and as developed societies in the west,  can withstand have already been used up. It is long past the time that we should create and consume less: less meat, less petrol, less disposable nappies, toys, mobile phones, clothing, furniture – less everything. But what will we use in the future? That’s where researchers, scientists and engineers come in. In thousands of universities worldwide there are scientists working on how to manufacture new materials, engineers devising technologies that do more with less, and social scientists making sure that the changes being proposed actually make sense in respect of people’s lives in the real world. For example, ensuring low-carbon heating systems deliver the heating needed in older, draughty homes.  By bringing together the work of industry, policymakers, scientists and engineers, we can support the transition to a sustainable lifestyle where we consume less stuff, emit less carbon, and start becoming part of the solution – not the problem. So, who needs to act? Everyone does. Governments, industry and us. We can be part of the solution by taking action in our own lives, by telling our politicians that we want them to act (even though we know it might make life hard), and perhaps even by working in scientific research or industrial engineering. Ultimately, the planet is on a kamikaze pathway that is being driven by us, and we all have a responsibility to do what we can to help pull it back onto a different track."

Share this...FacebookTwitterScience journalist and geologist Axel Bojanowski at the online German Spiegel news weekly comments on the drive by activists to proclaim an “Anthropocene” age because they claim that man has so much altered the planet and is adding a new geological layer in doing so.
It all stems from accusations that man has altered the surface of the earth, its biodiversity, the oceans and atmosphere through its activity, and that this is becoming visible in the earth’s most recent geological layer.
But Bojanowski writes that a number of leading experts are calling such claims erroneous. In the subheading he writes:
Activists, artists and scientists are calling for the heralding of a new age – man has profoundly altered the planet. They’re wrong.” 
He writes that these experts view the newly proposed geological designation as “a momentous error and unacceptable influence on research by political activists. It’s the story of a large misunderstanding.”
Already policymakers and leaders are scrambling to adopt the new designation and thus enact laws accordingly, he reports. And why not? A number of scientists and everywhere the media are already using the term.
Even the Scientific Advisory Council to the German government, WBGU — headed by PIK alarmist Hans-Joachim Schellnhuber —  liberally uses the term. There is a push to officiailly declare the “Anthropocene” as a geological age. Bojanowski reports that seven years ago 37 scientists began a working group charged with searching out geological evidence to support adopting the “Anthropocene” age: the Anthropocene Commission.
According to the Spiegel journalist, the commission, headed by Jan Zalasiewicz of the University of Leicester, will attempt to convince three geological commissions to adopt the age, which supposedly started at about 1950. Journal “Science” has already presented the first results, the Spiegel journalist writes.

But Bojanwski adds that a large number of experts are calling the move “bad science” because it does not meet any of the strict geological scientific standards one typically uses for establishing geological periods.
“Sloganeering in science “
Bojanowski cites James Scourse, ocean geologist at Bangor University in Wales, who says the term is “misleading and useless” and that Earth is shaped by factors well beyond the control of man. Other experts like Whitney Autin of Suny-College in New York and John Holbrook of Texas Christian University call the discussion an esoteric debate, claiming, Bojanowski reports, that today there’s a “tendency towards sloganeering in science” which lead to “dubious terminology” like “Anthropocene“.
“Career promoter”
Spiegel journalist Bojanowski writes:
From the perspective of critics, the Anthropocene concept violates almost every scientific rule.
He then quotes geologist Sven Egenhoff of Colorado State University:
The Anthropocene mode has only been able to emerge because scientists from other fields have been piling on behind the term. To the contrary, the real experts, i.e. those who specialize in earth layers, see nothing there. The Anthropocene serves as a career promoter for scientists in outside fields.”

From the “everything is robust” department.
We’ve long noted at WUWT that the word “robust” has seen a significant rise in usage in climate science papers, becoming a favorite word to use when statistical Spackle has been applied to climate data. Now there’s evidence from a new study suggesting that observation is spot-on.
From Nature:
‘Novel, amazing, innovative’: positive words on the rise in science papers

Analysis suggests an increasing tendency to exaggerate and polarize results.

Philip Ball
Scientists have become more upbeat in describing their research, an analysis of papers in the PubMed database suggests.
Researchers at the University Medical Center Utrecht in the Netherlands say that the frequency of positive-sounding words such as ‘novel’, ‘amazing’, ‘innovative’ and ‘unprecedented’ has increased almost nine-fold in the titles and abstracts of papers published between 1974 and 2014. There has also been a smaller — yet still statistically significant — rise in the frequency of negative words, such as ‘disappointing’ and ‘pessimistic’.


Source: Ref. 1
Expand


Psychiatrist Christiaan Vinkers and his colleagues searched papers on PubMed for 25 ‘positive’ words and 25 ‘negative’ words (which the authors selected by manually analysing papers and consulting thesaurus listings). The number of papers containing any of the positive words in their title or abstract rose from an average of 2% in 1974–80 to 17.5% in 2014. Use of the 25 negative words rose from 1.3% to 2.4% over the same period, according to the study, published in the British Medical Journal on 14 December1.
Rising hype
The most obvious interpretation of the results is that they reflect an increase in hype and exaggeration, rather than a real improvement in the incidence or quality of discoveries, says Vinkers. The findings “fit our own observations that in order to get published, you need to emphasize what is special and unique about your study,” he says. Researchers may be tempted to make their findings stand out from thousands of others — a tendency that might also explain the more modest rise in usage of negative words.

The word ‘novel’ now appears in more than 7% of PubMed paper titles and abstracts, and the researchers jokingly extrapolate that, on the basis of its past rise, it is set to appear in every paper by the year 2123.
…
But Vinkers and his colleagues think that the trend highlights a problem. “If everything is ‘robust’ and ‘novel’”, says Vinkers, then there is no distinction between the qualities of findings. “In that case, words used to describe scientific results are no longer driven by the content but by marketability.”

A BBC story here says the use of the word “robust” has gone up 15000% They write:
Despite working with facts, figures and empirical evidence, the world of science appears to have a growing addiction to hyperbole. Researchers at the University of Utrecht in the Netherlands looked at four decades worth of medical and scientific publications, and found a significant upwards trend of positive words. We’ve all heard of those ”ground-breaking” studies or ”innovative” research projects. Dr Christiaan Vinkers – a psychiatrist at the Rudolf Magnus brain centre – was the main author of another ”very robust” report.
This tool used to analyse words, when selected for academic use, shows that indeed, “robust” is a favorite word of science:

And, this Ngram suggests that at least through 2008, the word “robust” has become vastly more popular in books. It’s almost like a hockey stick of robustness:

Most people think of scientists as disinterested nerds, doggedly pursuing truth while ignoring the world around them. Many of their spouses likely concur.



Being involved in the grimy political process seems especially divorced from the milieu of science, but not in the highly charged atmosphere of climate science. In fact, my lobby, the American Meteorological Society (AMS), actively recruits scientists to influence policymakers.



While this may appear unseemly, it’s a logical extension of human behavior. If many of us want access to the political process in order to get what we want, why can’t scientists?





In return for the largess of big government, higher education supports big government.



The AMS is now advertising for this year’s “Summer Policy Colloquium”, with an announcement that’s breathtakingly candid. Among other things, participants will “build skills, experience, and contacts they can use throughout their careers to understand and influence the atmospheric policy process”. And who is this pitched to? Here’s a direct cut from this year’s invitation:



Who can attend?



• mid‐​level federal managers and scientists



• mid‐​level private‐​sector executives



• university faculty



• selected graduate students of demonstrated scientific and leadership potential



• (under exceptional circumstances) undergraduate applications will be considered.



Apparently, AMS sees nothing unseemly about federal employees lobbying for their own interests, nor does it have a problem with university scientists, almost all of whom are on the federal dole for a million or so per year, doing the same.



This is a logical extension of what Nobel‐​Prize winner (and Cato Institute scholar) James Buchanan calls “Public Choice”, a theory elucidated in his landmark 1962 book, _The Calculus of Consent_.



Simply put, public choice theory explains how special interests are incentivized to influence the policy process, with much to gain for a few (like atmospheric scientists) at relatively little cost to the rest of us.



Unfortunately, it’s not just the AMS. On February 23, the American Geophysical Union, which covers atmospheric, oceanic and geologic science, transmitted the 14,000-member AMS announcement to its 50,000. And where is the AMS colloquium to be held? At the headquarters of the American Association for The Advancement of Sciences, in downtown Washington. AAAS is the world’s largest scientific society.



The American Geophysical Union is quite candid about the purpose of the colloquium, announcing that participants will “ build a network of contacts and resources that will help them going forward in science policy.”



Does anyone really expect graduates of the AMS program will go to Capitol Hill and argue against spending even more money on the biggest cash cow in the history of the atmospheric sciences, global climate change?



Our “independent” universities are in fact wards of the federal government, and their aspiring faculty are the chattel. Any professor who goes to Washington imperils his future if he lobbies that climate change isn’t the end of the world.



Like it or not, this is the way of our society. In return for the largess of big government, higher education supports big government.



Americans, who are increasingly restive about the cost‐​benefit ratio of college, are quite aware of what is going on, particularly with respect to the issue of climate change. In 2010, Gallup asked people what they thought about news accounts of global warming, with the following question:



 _Thinking about what is said in the news, in your view is the seriousness of global warming generally exaggerated, generally correct, or is it generally underestimated?_



The triplicate nature of the question means that the random expectation would be that one‐​third of us should feel that coverage is exaggerated, correct, or underestimated. In fact, a whopping 48% of respondents say the issue is exaggerated.



Most news stories about global warming are “pegged” to some new scientific publication or federal regulation. Exaggeration is the overhead that we pay for the unseemly marriage between government‐​sponsored science and federal policy that is being encouraged and fostered by our most prestigious scientific societies.

While this section will feature all of the areas of interest that we are emphasizing, the prominence of the climate issue is driving a tremendous amount of web traffic. Here we post a few of the best in recent days, along with our color commentary._   




Climate change denial in public discourse may encourage climate scientists to over-emphasize scientific uncertainty and is also affecting how they themselves speak -- and perhaps even think -- about their own research.



Lewandowsky and Oreskes fret:   




The idea that 'global warming has stopped' has been promoted in contrarian blogs and media articles for many years, and ultimately the idea of a 'pause' or 'hiatus' has become ensconced in the scientific literature, including in the latest assessment report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC).



The _Science Daily_ article continues:   




Recent warming has been slower than the long term trend, but this fluctuation differs little from past fluctuations in warming rate, including past periods of more rapid than average warming. Crucially, on previous occasions when decadal warming was particularly rapid, the scientific community did not give short-term climate variability the attention it has now received, when decadal warming was slower. During earlier rapid warming there was no additional research effort directed at explaining 'catastrophic' warming. By contrast, the recent modest decrease in the rate of warming has elicited numerous articles and special issues of leading journals.   
  
This asymmetry in response to fluctuations in the decadal warming trend likely reflects what the study's authors call the 'seepage' of contrarian claims into scientific work.



And according the Lewandowsky, this is a problem because:   




""It seems reasonable to conclude that the pressure of climate contrarians has contributed, at least to some degree, to scientists re-examining their own theory, data and models, even though all of them permit -- indeed, expect -- changes in the rate of warming over any arbitrarily chosen period.""   
  
So why might scientists be affected by contrarian public discourse? The study argues that three recognised psychological mechanisms are at work: 'stereotype threat', 'pluralistic ignorance' and the 'third-person effect'.   
  
'Stereotype threat' refers to the emotional and behaviour responses when a person is reminded of an adverse stereotype against a group to which they belong. Thus, when scientists are stereotyped as 'alarmists', a predicted response would be for them to try to avoid seeming alarmist by downplaying the degree of threat. Several studies have indeed shown that scientists tend to avoid highlighting risks, lest they be seen as 'alarmist'.   
  
'Pluralistic ignorance' describes the phenomenon which arises when a minority opinion is given disproportionate prominence in public debate, resulting in the majority of people incorrectly assuming their opinion is marginalised. Thus, a public discourse that asserts that the IPCC has exaggerated the threat of climate change may cause scientists who disagree to think their views are in the minority, and they may therefore feel inhibited from speaking out in public.   
  
Research shows that people generally believe that persuasive communications exert a stronger effect on others than on themselves: this is known as the 'third-person effect'. However, in actual fact, people tend to be more affected by persuasive messages than they think. This suggests the scientific community may be susceptible to arguments against climate change even when they know them to be false.



We humbly assert that Lewandowsky, Oreskes, and colleagues have this completely backwards.   
  
When global warming was occurring faster than climate models expected during the 1990s, there was little effort by the mainstream climate science community to look into why, despite plenty of skeptic voices (such as our own) pointing to the influence of natural variability. Instead, headlines proclaimed “Global warming worse than expected,” which fueled the human-caused climate change hysteria (favored by the 1990s White House) and helped build the push for calls to regulate greenhouse gas emissions from fossil fuels. But since the late 1990s, there has been no statistically significant warming trend in the highly-cited HadCRU4 temperature record, and both the RSS and UAH satellite records are now in their 21st consecutive year without a significant trend. This behavior contrasted with, and called into question, the veracity of climate model projections. And it was these projections upon which rested the case for a dangerous human influence on the climate. Again, skeptic voices were raised in objection to the mainstream view of climate change and the need for government intervention. But this time, the skeptic voices were accompanied by data that clearly showed that rather than “worse than expected,” climate change was actually proceeding at a quite modest pace.   
  
It was only then, with the threat of losing support for actions to mitigate climate change—actions that a top U.N. climate official, Christine Figueres, described as an effort “to intentionally transform the economic development model, for the first time in human history” —that the mainstream climate community started to pay attention and began investigating the “hiatus” or “pause”—the words so despised by Lewandowsky and Oreskes.   
  
Through these research efforts, we have learned a lot about the role of natural variability in the broader climate system and how such variability impacts of projections of human-caused climate change (such as through a better understanding of the equilibrium climate sensitivity—how much warming results from a doubling of atmospheric carbon dioxide concentration).   
  
In other words, science has been moved forward, propelled by folks who didn’t take the mainstream climate science at face value, and instead questioned it—i.e., Lewandowsky’s and Oreskes’ “deniers.”   
  
The outcome of all of this is, in fact, the opposite of what Lewandowsky and Oreskes assert has occurred. Rather than “skeptic” ideas “seeping” into science and leading to a false narrative, skeptic ideas instead have spurred new research and therefore new knowledge. Such was not the case when skeptics were being shut out. The only thing different now vs. 20 years ago, is that this time around, the existence of a profoundly inconvenient truth (a “hiatus” in global warming) gave public credence to the skeptics which forced them to be taken seriously by the scientific consensus-keepers. Incontrovertible evidence that threatened to tear down the meme of climate alarmism clearly required some sort of response.   
  
Science is biased not by the inclusion of skeptical voices, but rather the exclusion of them.   
  
In fact, this week, we announced the framework for an investigation into the existence of such bias.   
  
We teamed with Dr. David Wojick to produce a Cato Working Paper titled “Is the Government Buying Science or Support? A Framework Analysis of Federal Funding-induced Biases” we describe:   




The purpose of this report is to provide a framework for doing research on the problem of bias in science, especially bias induced by Federal funding of research. In recent years the issue of bias in science has come under increasing scrutiny, including within the scientific community. Much of this scrutiny is focused on the potential for bias induced by the commercial funding of research. However, relatively little attention has been given to the potential role of Federal funding in fostering bias. The research question is clear: does biased funding skew research in a preferred direction, one that supports an agency mission, policy or paradigm?



An interested reader may want to review the fifteen bias-inducing scientific practices that we identify and compare them with the “three recognised psychological mechanisms” that Lewandowsky and Oreskes assert are at work to see which seem to make the most sense.   
  
Essentially, our project seeks to determine if the dog is wagging the tail. Lewandowsky and Oreskes propose the tail is wagging the dog.   
  
Hopefully, in the not too distant future, we’ll be able to report back what we find in our investigations. We’ll be surprised if we find that exclusionary practices drive science forward more efficiently than inclusive ones!

"The conservative radio host Glenn Beck called the Women’s March in Washington an “AstroTurf” rally funded by the liberal billionaire George Soros. He complained that the news media refused to acknowledge this fact. But there’s one news organization he praised as an exception: The New York Times. As evidence, he pointed to a piece by Asra Q. Nomani, a   liberal feminist and Trump voter, who claimed to document the extensive financial ties Soros had to march partners. The conservative website Breitbart News tied the piece to The Times in a prominent headline. And the   site The Daily Stormer wrote about the piece under a headline that referred to Soros as an “International Jew. ” Suddenly, The Times was a   crowd pleaser. Only it wasn’t The Times that ran this article. It was published on a site affiliated with The Times  —   but completely distinct from the paper  —   called Women in the World. The site is part of an events organization founded by Tina Brown (of The Daily Beast and The New Yorker fame). The Times is a business investor in Women in the World and provides the website’s digital platform, but the two have separate editorial operations. None of that was apparent to many readers who wrote in, confused about whether the story was the work of The Times. Here’s one from Susan Kruglinski of New York: It’s easy to be confused. I was. At the top left corner of the website, for example, there is the familiar “T” logo of The New York Times, and the URL has “nytimes” in it. Click the stylized “T” and you’ll be taken to The Times’s website. If you scroll to the very bottom of the Women in the World home page, squint to find the “About Us” link, and click, you’ll be taken to a page that, in the fourth paragraph, explains the relationship between The Times and Women in the World. For the most part, the site publishes news and features about women that don’t seem particularly controversial. This one, which was labeled Opinion, was more ideologically charged and made The Times the perfect foil for conservative news sites. Adam Bryant, who oversees the newsroom’s role in conferences, was sympathetic to the idea that something more might need to be done to make evident the degree to which the two organizations are separate. “As part of the The New York Times’s business relationship with Women in the World, we currently provide the digital platform for them, but we have separate editorial operations,” he said. “We strive to avoid any confusion on the part of our readers, so we are going to look again to see if there is more we can do to explain our relationship to Women in the World in their articles. ” Glad to hear it. Updated 12:12 p. m. January 27, to clarify Soros’s connection to the march."

Share this...FacebookTwitterBack in the early 1970s, when there was a scientific consensus that the Earth was cooling and that cooling was not good for the biosphere, scientists were ranking human-generated pollutants in terms of their potential to do harm to the planet. At that time, CO2 was regarded as “the least objectionable or only beneficial addition to the atmosphere from industrial sources.”

Libby, 1970
FIFTY ENVIRONMENTAL PROBLEMS OF TIMELY IMPORTANCE
WEATHER MODIFICATION BY CHANGING CO2 CONTENT OF ATMOSPHERE [p. 48]
American Scientist, January-February 1970, p. 18, “‘Though dire effects on climate of an increase in CO2 have been predicted, they are far from being established. The cycle is not really understood; carbon dioxide may well prove to be the least objectionable or the only beneficial addition to the atmosphere from industrial sources‘”
Then, 40-some years later, Scientific American writers have changed their minds, claiming that the worst human-generated pollution (of all the possible polluting emissions) is carbon dioxide.


Back in the 1970s, a warming planet was good, and a cooling climate was bad.    Now, it’s the opposite.   Warmth is bad, and cooling is good.   And carbon dioxide, instead of being thought of as beneficial, is now considered a pollutant.
Fortunately, though, many modern scientists do not agree that warming and elevated CO2 are the scourge of the biosphere.  In fact, there is a growing body of scientific evidence that humans, plants, and animals are much more likely to adapt to and thrive in a warming climate than a cooling one.   For casual observers, this may seem obvious.   But for those who are convinced that it is essential to alarm the public about lurking climate catastrophes, good news about warming and elevated CO2 levels are not welcome, let alone worth considering.  It may be characterized as “anti-science” to even mention that (a) Gasparrini et al., 2015 “Cold weather kills 20 times as many people as hot weather, according to an international study analyzing over 74 million deaths in 384 locations across 13 countries”, or (b) Donohue et al., 2013  “[T]he 14% increase in atmospheric CO2 (1982–2010) led to a 5 to 10% increase in green foliage cover in warm, arid environments.”   Dramatically reduced mortality rates due to warming, or a greener planet with enhanced crop yields and longer growing seasons due to CO2 rise…do not advance the humans-are-causing-climate-catastrophe agenda.  So instead of reporting on them, tendentious journalists and activists for the cause largely ignore the “good news” about global warming and elevated CO2.
So let’s uncover some of these recently published “good news” papers.  The below list of 20 new (2016) peer-reviewed scientific papers conclude that:
(a) modern mortality rates are lower with warmth they are in cooler environments;
(b) elevated CO2 ‘dramatically’ increases crop yields;
(c) elevated CO2 ameliorates the effects of drought and heat waves;
(d) elevated CO2 greens the Earth;
(e) elevated CO2 and warming lead to weaker hurricanes and storms and stabilize the climate;
(f) there is no significant evidence linking extreme weather events (hurricanes, floods, droughts fires, tornadoes)… to CO2 changes, but there is…
(g) evidence that cooling temperatures lead to a more unstable climate.

Mortality Rates Lower With Warmth, Higher With Cold

Shaposhnikov and Revich, 2016
“Highlights: Cold spells seem to be more hazardous to human health than heat waves.
Heat waves and cold spells were identified during 1999–2007. Statistical analysis of mortality from all non-traumatic, cardiovascular, respiratory and all external causes among age groups 30–64 and ⩾65 allowed to obtain site-specific and then pooled estimates of relative increases in mortality separately for heat and cold waves. The evidence of impacts of cold on mortality was more robust than the same for heat.”

Arbuthnott et al., 2016
“Five studies examined the risk of cold. In contrast to the changes in heat related mortality observed, only one found a significant decrease in cold related mortality in later time periods. … There is evidence that across a number of different settings, population susceptibility to heat and heatwaves has been decreasing. These changes in heat related susceptibility have important implications for health impact assessments of future heat related risk. A similar decrease in cold related mortality was not shown.”

Elevated CO2 ‘Dramatically’ Increases Crop Yields

Fitzgerald et al., 2016
Elevated atmospheric [CO2] can dramatically increase wheat yields in semi-arid environments and buffer against heat waves
“Wheat production will be impacted by increasing concentration of atmospheric CO2 [CO2], which is expected to rise from about 400 μmol mol−1 in 2015 to 550 μmol mol−1 by 2050. … The Australian Grains Free Air CO2 Enrichment (AGFACE) facility was established to compare wheat (Triticum aestivum) growth and yield under ambient (~370 μmol−1 in 2007) and e[CO2] (550 μmol−1) in semi-arid environments. Experiments were undertaken at two dryland sites (Horsham and Walpeup) across three years with two cultivars, two sowing times and two irrigation treatments. Mean yield stimulation due to e[CO2] was 24% at Horsham and 53% at Walpeup, with some treatment responses greater than 70%, depending on environment. Under supplemental irrigation, e[CO2] stimulated yields at Horsham by 37% compared to 13% under rainfed conditions, showing that water limited growth and yield response to e[CO2]. Heat wave effects were ameliorated under e[CO2] as shown by reductions of 31 and 54% in screenings and 10 and 12% larger kernels (Horsham and Walpeup).”

Abebe et al., 2016
Highlights

Effect of elevated CO2 and temperature on maize was studied using open top chamber.
Grain yield and yield attributes increased with elevated CO2 in north–west India. 
 Elevated temperature decreased yield but improved grain nutrient contents. 
 Elevated CO2 reduced the negative effects of elevated temperature on maize yield.

“Elevated CO2 increased grain yield of maize by 53.7% and harvest index (HI) by 2.9% compared to ambient CO2. Stover yield and yield attributes such as cob length, cob diameter, grain weight cob−1, number of grains cob−1 and 100 grain weight also increased with elevated CO2.”

Elevated CO2 Ameliorates Effects Of Droughts, Heat Waves

Roy et al., 2016
“Extreme climatic events (ECEs) such as droughts and heat waves are predicted to increase in intensity and frequency and impact the terrestrial carbon balance. However, we lack direct experimental evidence of how the net carbon uptake of ecosystems is affected by ECEs under future elevated atmospheric CO2concentrations (eCO2). … Our results indicate that eCO2 [elevated CO2] not only slows down the decline of ecosystem carbon uptake during the ECE [extreme climate events] but also enhances its recovery after the ECE , as mediated by increases of root growth and plant nitrogen uptake induced by the ECE. These findings indicate that, in the predicted near future climate, eCO2 could mitigate the effects of extreme droughts and heat waves on ecosystem net carbon uptake.”

van der Kooi et al., 2016
“Exposure of plants to elevated CO2 (eCO2) has a number of physiological effects, including increased photosynthetic carbon fixation and decreased stomatal conductance, resulting in greater growth and yield and also improved water use efficiency. Therefore, eCO2 [elevated CO2] is considered to ameliorate the adverse effects of drought. … Our results suggest that crops grown in areas with limited water availability will benefit from future eCO2 [elevated CO2], regardless of their metabolism. Drought leads to stomatal limitation of photosynthesis in both C3 and C4 crops, which is alleviated when the plants are grown under eCO2.”

Elevated CO2 Greens The Earth, Especially In Dry Areas

Lu et al., 2016
Elevated CO2 as a driver of global dryland greening
“While recent findings based on satellite records indicate a positive trend in vegetation greenness over global drylands, the reasons remain elusive. … Based on 1705 field measurements from 21 distinct sites, a consistent and statistically significant increase in the availability of soil water (11%) was observed under elevated CO2 treatments in both drylands and non-drylands, with a statistically stronger response over drylands (17% vs. 9%). Given the inherent water limitation in drylands, it is suggested that the additional soil water availability is a likely driver of observed increases in vegetation greenness.”

Zhu et al., 2016
“Global environmental change is rapidly altering the dynamics of terrestrial vegetation, with consequences for the functioning of the Earth system and provision of ecosystem services.  Yet how global vegetation is responding to the changing environment is not well established. Here we use three long-term satellite leaf area index (LAI) records and ten global ecosystem models to investigate four key drivers of LAI trends during 1982–2009. We show a persistent and widespread increase of growing season integrated LAI (greening) over 25% to 50% of the global vegetated area, whereas less than 4% of the globe shows decreasing LAI (browning). Factorial simulations with multiple global ecosystem models suggest that CO2 fertilization effects explain 70% of the observed greening trend, followed by nitrogen deposition (9%), climate change (8%) and land cover change (LCC) (4%). CO2 fertilization effects explain most of the greening trends in the tropics, whereas climate change resulted in greening of the high latitudes and the Tibetan Plateau.”

Thomas et al., 2016
“Observations show an increasing amplitude in the seasonal cycle of CO2 (ASC) north of 45° N of 56 ± 9.8% over the last 50 years and an increase in vegetation greenness of 7.5-15% in high northern latitudes since the 1980’s.  Modelled increases in greenness are primarily driven by warming whereas ASC changes are primarily driven by increasing CO2.”

Mao et al., 2016
“Significant land greening in the northern extratropical latitudes (NEL) has been documented through satellite observations during the past three decades. Our findings reveal that the observed greening record is consistent with an assumption of anthropogenic forcings, where greenhouse gases play a dominant role, but is not consistent with simulations that include only natural forcings and internal climate variability. These results provide the first clear evidence of a discernible human fingerprint on physiological vegetation changes other than phenology and range shifts.”

Vejpustková et al., 2016
“Trees growing in a pure aspen stand were selected according to the CO-gas regime within their  rooting zone. Five high [CO2] trees (10–25% CO2 in the soil) and five low [CO2] trees (up to 3% CO2 in the
soil) were sampled. Stem growth analysis of each trunk was carried out to study growth pattern in detail.  High and low [CO2] trees significantly differed in a growth rate. At the age of 25 years, the basal area of high [CO2] trees exceeded low [CO2] trees by 39 %. The positive effect of CO2 on annual increment was pronounced particularly in the years with optimal growing conditions. Results suggest that trees can be fertilized not only by elevated atmospheric CO2 but also when fed with CO2 via the roots.”

Elevated CO2, Warming Weakens Hurricanes, Stabilizes The Climate

Chang et al., 2016
“Extratropical cyclones cause much of the high impact weather over the mid-latitudes. With increasing greenhouse gases, enhanced high-latitude warming will lead to weaker cyclone activity. Here we show that between 1979 and 2014, the number of strong cyclones in Northern Hemisphere in summer has decreased at a rate of 4% per decade, with even larger decrease found near northeastern North America. Climate models project a decrease in summer cyclone activity, but the observed decreasing rate is near the fastest projected.”

Gaucherel and Moron, 2016
“‘Tipping points’ (TPs) are thresholds of potentially disproportionate changes in the Earth’s climate system associated with future global warming and are considered today as a ‘hot’ topic in environmental sciences. In this study, TP interactions are analysed from an integrated and conceptual point of view using two qualitative Boolean models built on graph grammars. They allow an accurate study of the node TP interactions previously identified by expert elicitation and take into account a range of various large-scale climate processes potentially able to trigger, alone or jointly, instability in the global climate. Our findings show that, contrary to commonly held beliefs, far from causing runaway changes in the Earth’s climate, such as self-acceleration due to additive positive feedbacks, successive perturbations [associated with ‘global warming’] might actually lead to its stabilization.”

Kelly, 2016
“It is widely promulgated and believed that human-caused global warming comes with increases in both the intensity and frequency of extreme weather events. A survey of official weather sites and the scientific literature provides strong evidence that the first half of the 20th century had more extreme weather than the second half, when anthropogenic global warming is claimed to have been mainly responsible for observed climate change.”

No Significant Evidence That Elevated CO2, Warming Lead To More Hurricanes, Floods, Droughts, Fires, Tornadoes

Boos and Sterelvmo, 2016
“Neither a physically correct theoretical model nor a comprehensive climate model support the idea that seasonal mean monsoons will undergo abrupt, nonlinear shifts in response to changes in greenhouse gas concentrations, aerosol emissions, or land surface albedo.”

van der Wiel et al., 2016
“[T]he observed record and historical model experiments were used to investigate changes in the recent past. In part because of large intrinsic variability, no evidence was found for changes in extreme precipitation attributable to climate change in the available observed record.”

Hoerling et al, 2016
“Time series of US daily heavy precipitation (95th percentile) are analyzed to determine factors responsible for regionality and seasonality in their 1979-2013 trends. …. Analysis of model ensemble spread reveals that appreciable 35-yr trends in heavy daily precipitation can occur in the absence of forcing, thereby limiting detection of the weak anthropogenic influence at regional scales. … Analysis of the seasonality in heavy daily precipitation trends supports physical arguments that their changes during 1979-2013 have been intimately linked to internal decadal ocean variability, and less to human-induced climate change.”

Doerr and Santín, 2016
“Wildfire has been an important process affecting the Earth’s surface and atmosphere for over 350 million years and human societies have coexisted with fire since their emergence. Yet many consider wildfire as an accelerating problem, with widely held perceptions both in the media and scientific papers of increasing fire occurrence, severity and resulting losses. However, important exceptions aside, the quantitative evidence available does not support these perceived overall trends. Instead, global area burned appears to have overall declined over past decades, and there is increasing evidence that there is less fire in the global landscape today than centuries ago.”

Guo et al., 2016
“The combined spatial-temporal variability of U.S. tornado occurrence has remained nearly constant since 1950.”

Evidence That Cooling Is Associated With Extreme Weather Events, Instability

Dezileau et al., 2016
“Storms and tsunamis, which may seriously endanger human society, are amongst the most devastating marine catastrophes that can occur in coastal areas. … [T]hese extreme events occurred around 5250, 4000, 3600, 3010, 2300, 1350, 650, and 80 years cal BP. No comparable events have been observed during the 20th and 21st centuries. The results indicate little likelihood of a tsunami origin for these coarse-grained layers, although historical tsunami events are recorded in this region. These periods of surge events seem to coincide with the coldest periods in Europe during the late Holocene, suggesting a control by a climatic mechanism for periods of increased storm activity.”

Pratte et al., 2016
“The highest dust fluxes in the Baie bog were recorded from 1750–1000 cal. BP to 600–100 cal. BP and occur at the same time as periods of high variability in the macrofossil record (i.e. successive layers dominated by Sphagnum or Ericaceae). The timing of these events in the dust and macrofossil records also corresponds to documented cold periods. These two [cold] periods have been identified as episodes of climatic instability, which could have been caused by changes in the wind regime.”

More reports are out that Germany’s string of problems surrounding its ambitious installation of offshore wind parks has been extended once again.
North German online news site www.nwzonline.de (NWZ) reports there is “no longer a connection” to two North Sea windparks due to “a faulty transmission cable”.
According to the NWZ, the 135-kilometer Dolwin 2 cable runs from the North Sea to the North German coast and ends in the Emsland town of Dörpen. Engineers suspect the fault is somewhere onshore.
Dolwin 2 cable delivers power from wind parks Godewind 1 and 2, which are operated by Danish energy company Dong. The two wind parks comprise 97 wind turbines and have a rated capacity of 582 megawatts, the NWZ reports.
According to NWZ, grid operator Tennet blames Swedish engineering giant and cable manufacturer ABB for the problems. Currently ABB has not been able to identify the source of the problem and the power interruption is expected to cost (consumers) millions.

The BARD 1 debacle
Dolwin 2 is hardly the only debacle that has plagued the German offshore wind industry. Another embarrassment was the BARD 1 offshore wind park, which was planned to deliver power to Germany in early 2014, but because of a series of major engineering faults, the wind park did not deliver power until one and half years later – in October 2015. Read here and here.
So great were the losses at BARD 1 that a bank was forced to take over the project. The project ended up costing 3 billion euros and was much more expensive than anticipated.
Riffgat’s half-year outage
Also giant wind park Riffgat stopped delivering power late last year – also a faulty transmission cable. Read here. There’s no news from the Riffgat site on whether or not the park has been returned online. The site has not issued a press release in over 2 years.
The online OZI here reported as of April 27, 2016: “Still no power coming from Riffgat“. However, just days ago – after more than half a year of being shut down – Riffgat hobbled back online.
It seems the wind industry has been busier repairing offshore wind parks than operating them.

For such a normally astute politician, Australian prime minister, **Scott Morrison** , was shockingly wrong-footed by Australia’s bushfire crisis and the political and media hysteria that followed. Slowly, the government is moving to recover from the political firestorm.



While presumably judging – correctly, as it happens – that the federal government’s role in such emergencies is all-but-nonexistent, Morrison’s decision to take a family holiday was still inexplicably ham-fisted. He must have known that organisational realities be damned, the media-elite would pounce like hyenas. Feelings and empty gestures are the currency of today’s media. Doing takes a long second to being **seen** – especially being seen doling out hugs for the cameras as if they were emergency supplies.



But, in the process of struggling to regain political control, Morrison has risked alienating the very voters who delivered the Coalition such a stunning electoral victory. Inasmuch as elections are ever about specific issues, the Australian electorate emphatically rejected the sort of ‘climate action’ that the Greens and the globalists are demanding. So, when Morrison and his ministers seemed to be surrendering to the ‘it wuz climate change!’ narrative, many Coalition voters began to wonder if they were returning to the bad, old days of **Malcolm Turnbull** , the wannabe-Green masquerading as a Liberal.



Such fears may yet prove to be unfounded. Morrison has summarily [slapped into line](https://www.theaustralian.com.au/nation/politics/scott-morrison-slams-matt-kean-claims-over-cabinet-climate-claims/news-story/0ae3a33564bcdd33de67ea2d4bc9de36) one Coalition state backbencher who tried to link the bushfires to the government’s climate policies. He’s also putting pressure back on the states who are responsible for the parks which exploded into firestorms this summer.



Scott Morrison has called for a ­national standard for bushfire hazard-­reduction burns and ­declared that tracking measures to cut fuel loads is at least as important as monitoring Australia’s carbon emissions.



In fact, Morrison is taking the rhetorical fight right up to the [Klimate Kult](https://thebfd.co.nz/2019/10/be-very-afraid-of-the-new-kkk/), illustrating how climate alarmism is not just foolish, but dangerously ignores real problems.



In the wake of the bushfires crisis, the Prime Minister criticised the fact there were clear rules and transparency arrangements for reporting on emissions but not on mitigation measures.



He highlighted hazard-reduction burns, land-clearing laws and management of native vegetation and national parks as critical state issues that had to be scrutinised.



“We report all the time on what our emissions reductions are but across the country there is not a national system of reporting to track how hazard reduction is progressing,” Mr Morrison said on Tuesday night.



Morrison also takes a swipe at negligent Labor state governments.



“These are all responsibilities of the states and I’m not making any argument for the federal ­government to be intervening in any of these areas but it is a very reasonable expectation people have that there are national ­standards, that there is transparency around how this is being achieved.



“Hazard reduction is as important as emissions reduction and many would argue, I think, even more so because it has an even more direct practical impact on the safety of a person going into a bushfire season.”



This is a direct hit at the states, especially the Andrews socialist government, which have comprehensively failed to meet their hazard-reduction obligations. If there are any ‘arsonists’ in Australian politics, it’s governments who pandered to the Green-left and allowed staggering amounts of fuels to build up for years.



Morrison is also opening a front on what so many keyboard experts have completely failed to comprehend: that Australia’s federal system prevents Canberra from acting in areas that are supposed to be state responsibilities. When the Morrison government finally got sick of waiting for the states to step up and summarily sent in Army Reservists, he was on shaky constitutional grounds: grounds he’s obviously trying to secure.



Mr Morrison wants any royal commission to look at the legality of the federal government calling out the Australian Defence Force to respond to a natural disaster.



Three thousand reservists were called out in January on a compulsory basis to help in the bushfire recovery.



“I want to know when the trigger line is. I want to know where the authority is established for the prime minister, for the federal government, to be able to take the initiative and move in and direct getting these resources in place where we believe life and property is under threat and we believe we can play a constructive role,” Mr Morrison said.

"The White House floated an idea on Thursday afternoon that, in initial reports, sounded like a major tariff on Mexican imports  —   something that would have gone a long way toward unwinding one of the United States’ deepest economic relationships. The reality of what Sean Spicer, the press secretary, suggested is a lot less dramatic. But it sends important signals about how people in the Trump administration are thinking about overhauling the tax code  —   and how they’re thinking about claiming victory on some of the president’s audacious campaign promises. It is a sign of just how fluid things are in this moment when so much of American public policy around taxes, trade and diplomacy is in flux. Mr. Spicer suggested a way the administration could accomplish President Trump’s goal of building a border wall paid for by Mexico. A 20 percent tax on imports from Mexico would do the trick, Mr. Spicer said. That might sound as if Mr. Spicer was proposing that the United States slap a new tariff meant to punish Mexican exporters. Such a move would result in higher prices for American consumers, create profound challenges for industries with supply chains that span the border, and possibly prompt the collapse of the North American Free Trade Agreement. But you get a different picture when you put Mr. Spicer’s words into the context of the rapidly evolving debate in Washington around overhauling corporate taxation. He was pointing out that in an overhaul of taxes that House Republicans are considering, imports from all countries would be taxed at 20 percent while American exports would be tax free. It’s called border adjustment, and it would make the United States corporate tax code more closely resemble the   tax that is commonplace in other countries. House Republicans see the policy as a way to reshape the tax code to give businesses less incentive to move operations overseas while also generating revenue they can use to reduce tax rates. Opponents of the plan, which include major retailers, are skeptical. Among the risks: It could drive up consumer prices for all sorts of imported goods, from German cars to Mexican avocados, if the dollar does not rise as much as economists predict. And the policy may violate World Trade Organization rules, which could tangle it up in legal proceedings. But that Mr. Spicer was floating that plan as a way to fulfill Mr. Trump’s Mexican wall promises is interesting on two levels. First, less than two weeks ago, the    threw cold water on the House plan. “Anytime I hear border adjustment, I don’t love it,” Mr. Trump told The Wall Street Journal. “Because usually it means we’re going to get adjusted into a bad deal. ” On Thursday, Mr. Spicer was explicitly suggesting that a border tax could be used to pay for a border wall. Referring to the tax plan, he said, “This is something that we’ve been in close contact with both houses in moving forward. ” The border adjustment strategy has plenty of enemies, and there’s no certainty that it will become part of a tax overhaul bill. But the latest tea leaves suggest the administration is more open to it than it may have seemed. The second lesson from the incident is that the Trump administration looks inclined to be flexible in finding ways to satisfy campaign promises without doing major damage to the economy or international relations. Thursday was one of the roughest days for relations between the United States and Mexico in some time, with the cancellation of a planned visit by President Enrique Peña Nieto and tough talk from Mexico City, which adamantly refuses to pay for an expansion of a border wall. But Mr. Spicer’s comments, which he later said were meant more to offer an example than a concrete policy proposal, suggest that the administration will look for creative ways to proclaim victory on Trumpian promises. In other words, he will proclaim that Mexico has paid for the wall as promised  —   even if the Mexican government never literally cuts a check to pay for new concrete. Advocates of the border adjustment tax have been fond of it because it would produce enough revenue to allow a deep reduction in tax rates. But money is fungible. So if the president can claim political victory by stating that the revenue from Mexican imports is going to pay for the wall, no one is going to stop him. It is a messy time for the making of economic policy. The Trump campaign was notoriously light on policy detail, and the Trump administration still has many key vacancies in economic policy jobs. Nominees for Treasury secretary, commerce secretary and U. S. trade representative have not yet been confirmed, and key jobs on the Council of Economic Advisers and most undersecretary and assistant secretary jobs remain unfilled. So the gaps are still being filled in on what the Trump administration economic policy will really mean in practice. The way to read the latest Mexico comments is as one more hint."
"**Last Sunday night, Daryl Morey, the General Manager of the Houston Rockets, sat in his hotel room in Tokyo, where the Rockets were playing two pre-season games against the current NBA champions, the Toronto Raptors.**
Mr Morey - in a move that would reverberate around the sporting world and beyond - then fired off a tweet expressing support for the protestors in Hong Kong who have been taking to the streets for the past four months.
While he hasn't explicitly admitted as much, it's safe to say he now regrets hitting that send button.
Close to a week later, the fallout from that single, quickly-deleted tweet - which included the words ""Fight for freedom, stand with Hong Kong"" - is still dominating the news cycle.
We've seen posts from Rockets owner Tilman Fertitta, an explanation of sorts from Mr Morey, and not one, but two statements on the matter by the National Basketball Association (NBA), none of which appears to have appeased Chinese fans and sponsors, who were furious that an outsider was stirring up an issue many there regard as non-negotiable.
Freedom of speech, they argued, doesn't apply in certain areas and it wasn't Mr Morey's place to comment in the first place.
To top it all off, the league's handling of the situation simultaneously managed to spark a backlash back at home, with US fans and politicians alike calling out the league for pandering too much to China.
The timing could not have been worse: the LA Lakers and the Brooklyn Nets are in China right now to play two pre-season games, but national broadcaster CCTV refused to broadcast them. Once the state-run channel had made that decision, online streaming partner Tencent had little choice but to follow suit.
Admittedly, pre-season games don't quite get pulses racing in the way that regular season games do, but this has become something of a tradition in China, where basketball rivals football as the country's most loved sport.
NBA teams have played in front of Chinese fans in 13 of the past 14 years, with LeBron James - unquestionably the biggest name still active in the league - set to lead his Lakers in Shanghai and Shenzhen this week against the Nets, whose new owner Joe Tsai co-founded Chinese tech giant Alibaba.
Basketball in China is almost as old as the game itself and Chairman Mao was known to be a big fan.
But the sport took a great leap forward once Yao Ming joined the Rockets in 2002. Yao played the bulk of seven seasons in Houston from 2002-09, before finally retiring after two more injury-plagued years.
During that time, his popularity with fans saw him named to the All-Star team eight times - even during periods when he barely played - firmly establishing the Rockets as ""China's team"".
However, the backlash to Mr Morey's ill-fated social media post has been so strong that Houston has quickly lost that mantle.
Meanwhile, Rockets merchandise has been cleared from various e-commerce platforms in China, while almost every Chinese sponsor of the league, plus others associated directly with the team, have suspended those partnerships.
Accurate statistics in a country of 1.4 billion people are notoriously hard to come by, and the Chinese Basketball Association (CBA)'s claim that 300 million Chinese play the sport is wildly optimistic.
But the country still has millions of basketball fans, making China a clear number two market for the NBA, behind only the US.
And for a society that doesn't have a long history of paying for online content, Tencent's five-year streaming deal that puts an estimated $1.5bn (Â£1.2bn) in NBA coffers is far ahead of anything else in the sporting landscape here.
In other words, China matters.
We've seen similar incidents with foreign entities play out in China previously. Dolce & Gabbana, Marriott, Delta Airlines and others have all fallen foul of consumer sentiment in recent years for an ad, post or oversight that was perceived in China as a slight on the country.
The crisis playbook then follows a familiar pattern: the foreign brand in question issues an apology, keeps a low profile and tries to work its way back into the good graces of those consumers.
But this time it's different.
NBA Commissioner Adam Silver has made it clear he will not apologise for Mr Morey's tweet, citing the American league's values of ""equality, respect and freedom of expression"".
He has some leverage here. If consumers are annoyed with a fashion brand, hotel or airline, they can easily switch to another option; but the NBA stands apart in China.
The CBA is a supplementary, complementary league, but in no way is it ready to replace the NBA as the league of choice for Chinese fans.
Claims that basketball fans might instead follow another sport are also off the mark.
The impact of this controversy is two-fold. The NBA's regular season starts on 22 October, and the hope is that the dust will have settled by then, and the league broadcast partners can return to regular programming - albeit with Houston Rockets games kept offline for at least a few more months.
It's still possible, though, that China doubles down on its call for an official apology, meaning that the situation could escalate still further and the broadcast ban extend into the regular season - though if that does happen, enterprising fans will likely find a way to access pirated live-streams from overseas.
But, more importantly, the risk of a backlash back home for companies operating in China is becoming greater.
With consumers in the West now hearing about the demands placed on those firms in China, the companies - already acutely aware of the political minefields that lie in wait - will have to weigh their moves in the East with the reception those moves get back in the West.
And as the NBA has found this week, it's becoming nigh on impossible to strike a balance between those two very different sides, even with carefully-worded statements.
Some may choose to pick sides and prioritise one market over another for a variety of different reasons, while the majority will do their very best to continue the high-wire act and stay out of trouble in the first place.
But with online mobs all over the world amplifying every perceived misstep, expect to see more companies stuck between a rock and hard place in the future.

While this section will feature all of the areas of interest that we are emphasizing, the prominence of the climate issue is driving a tremendous amount of web traffic. Here we post a few of the best in recent days, along with our color commentary._

The _New York Times_ ran an op-ed  last week extolling the virtues of a carbon tax by trying to poo-poo the idea that a tax on carbon emissions (which are produced by burning fossil fuels like coal, oil, and natural gas during the production of 80% of our nation’s energy supply) would produce a negative impact on our economy. The _Times’_ editors attempt to do this by running through a couple of examples where they claim the imposition of a carbon tax has produced economic benefits (or at least, was somewhat neutral).   
  
Economist Dr. Robert Murphy takes the _Times_ to task on this in his post “The NYT Gets It Wrong on Carbon Tax.”   
  
Murphy is a senior economist at the Institute for Energy Research, research assistant professor at Texas Tech, and also the lead author of our Working Paper (soon to be Cato Policy Analysis) examining the cost for a carbon tax.   
  
In his response to the _Times_ , Murphy points out the _Times’_ editors’ favorite example of a carbon tax done well—British Columbia—actually serves as a counter-example when looked at a bit more carefully. Not only did British Columbia’s economy suffer after the establishment of a carbon tax, but also, the revenue-neutrality of the BC tax is not a real-world possibility in the U.S.   




Murphy writes:   




It’s worth pointing out that these dire economic impacts on the B.C. economy occurred even though they did a surprisingly good job of implementing offsetting tax cuts. Were a carbon tax to be introduced in the United States, the politics would almost certainly result in a large _net_ tax hike.



Ultimately Murphy concludes his piece with:   




The American public is being sold a bill of goods regarding a carbon tax. On the one hand, proponents tell progressive citizens about all the “green” goodies that can be funded with the trillions in revenue that such a tax will bring in. On the other hand, supporters assure conservative citizens not to worry, that the tax will be revenue neutral and will allow for huge cuts in the corporate income tax rate. As Dr. Evil would say, “Riiight.”



Check out Murphy’s full piece for the details of what’s wrong with the _Times’_ op-ed, and our “The Cost Against a Carbon Tax” Working Paper for what’s wrong with the concept of a carbon tax at large.   
  
One of the many (bad) ideas behind a carbon tax is that the federal government will have more money in its hands to do with what it wants, including funding more climate change science to support why it needs to implement a carbon tax.   
  
Dr. Roy Spencer frets over this is his recent blog post examining the observational science behind last year’s record high global temperatures. After reviewing the strength of the claims as to 2015’s temperature (including those as measured by satellites), Dr. Spencer‘s response is rather ho-hum: yes, the surface temperature data compilations do have 2015 as the warmest year in their record (thanks, in part, to a big El Niño); no, the same is not true for satellite observations which show the year as ranking 3rd or 4th; and take everything with a grain of salt, because all the data compilations have “issues.”   
  
What really gets Roy fired up is the government’s behavior in all of this. Roy writes:   




And this brings up the elephant in the room that I have a difficult time ignoring   
  
By now it has become a truism that government agencies will prefer whichever dataset supports the governments desired policies. You might think that government agencies are only out to report the truth, but if that’s the case, why are these agencies run by political appointees?



Roy continues:   




There indeed is a climate change problem to study…but I don’t think we know with any certainty how much is natural versus manmade. There is no way to know, because there is (contrary to the IPCC’s claims) no fingerprint of human versus natural warming. Even natural warming originating over the ocean will cause faster warming over land than over ocean, just as we already observe.   
  
But since the government has framed virtually all of the research programs in terms of human-caused climate change, that’s what the funded scientists will dutifully report it to be, in terms of supposed causation.   
  
And until the culture in the government funding agencies changes, I don’t see a new way of doing business materializing. It might require congress to direct the funding agencies to spend at least a small portion of their budgets to look for evidence of natural causes of climate change.   
  
Because scientists, I have learned, will tend to find whatever they are paid to find in terms of causation…which is sometimes very difficult to pin down in science.



Be sure to check out Roy’s full post “On that Record Warmest 2015 Claim” for a more complete treatment of his concerns.   
  
And, finally, as an amusing anecdote in support of Roy’s comments about the inherent uncertainties in weather observing systems comes this report on how snowfall during the weekend’s blizzard was measured at NOAA’s official weather station in our nation’s capital—Reagan National Airport.   
  
Turns out it was snowing so hard at the height of the storm that the weather observers at the airport couldn’t find the official “snow board” on which the snowfall measurements were supposed to take place. So they improvised—and in doing so seemingly under-reported the snow total during the storm (to the great dismay of many snow nerds). We are not making this up. From the Capital Weather Gang’s investigation:   




It’s not that 17.8 inches of snow wasn’t enough.   
  
But the number that will go down in the history books as Washington’s official total — recorded at Reagan National Airport — is downright paltry compared with some other spots in the region, raising the question: Why the disparity?   
  
The reason, it turns out, may be partly due to the improvised technique used by a small team of weather observers at the airport who lost their snow-measuring device to the elements midway through the blizzard. It was buried by the very snow it was supposed to measure.



Couple the problem measuring snow at Reagan National Airport with the problem measuring temperature there that we identified last summer (see here and here) and you have the makings of a Laurel and Hardy routine on how weather observations of even fairly straightforward variables are collected. And to think, these types of somewhat major problems were identified as occurring at what would have to be considered among the best observing stations in the world.   
  
Now you know why the data must be “adjusted.” Not a pretty picture.

Share this...FacebookTwitterLand area gains despite sea level rise: coastal areas have grown 13,500 sq km over past 30 years
By geologist Dr. Sebastian Luning and Prof. Fritz Vahrenholt.
(German text translated/edited by P Gosselin)
On August 25, 2016 there was in Nature Climate Change a small wonder was observed. A team of scientist led by Gennadii Donchyts of the Dutch Deltares Research Institute released a statistic on land area gain and loss in the coastal areas on earth. Given our rising sea levels, a loss of land area was expected. Thus the surprise was even more profound when the official figures were released: coastal regions didn’t shrink, rather they grew by 13,565 sq km over the past 30 years.
That’s a real sensation.
Unfortunately the German media chose to keep silent about it. Inconvenient data that they do not want the public to see. In the publication it is stated:
Earth’s surface gained 115,000 km2 of water and 173,000 km2 of land over the past 30 years, including 20,135 km2 of water and 33,700 km2 of land in coastal areas. Here, we analyse the gains and losses through the Deltares Aqua Monitor — an open tool that detects land and water changes around the globe.
For what is interesting are the figures for the coastal areas (the other figures concern inland bodies of water that are independent of sea level). The calculation is trivial:
33,700 sq km of land gain minus 20,135 sq km of land loss = a net land gain of 13,565 sq km.
The people at the Deltares-Institute did have some fear of the figures. In the original press release, they refrained from presenting this important result:
How the earth has changed over the past 30 years
The world has gained 115,000 km2 of water and 173,000 km2 of land over the past 30 years. The Dutch research institute Deltares developed an open tool that analyses satellite data and visualises land and water changes around the globe. The results were published today in Nature Climate Change.
First global-scale tool that shows water and land conversion
The Deltares Aqua Monitor was developed by Gennadii Donchyts, a remote sensing expert at Deltares. It is the first global-scale tool that shows, with a 30-metre resolution, where water has been transformed into land and vice-versa. The Aqua Monitor uses freely available satellite data and Google Earth Engine, a platform for the planetary-scale scientific analysis of geospatial datasets that is now open to the general public. Gennadii Donchyts: “The Aqua Monitor shows that, around the world between 1985 and 2015, about 173 000 km2, an area about the size of Washington State, has been transformed into land. At the same time, an area of 115 000 km2 has been transformed into water. Both documented and undocumented changes due to man-made interventions, natural variability, and climate change have now been revealed.”
Known versus unknown

While many countries report on dam construction, information about more remote or isolated areas has been lacking. In Myanmar, the Global Reservoir and Dams database shows an increase in the water surface between 1985 and 2010 of about 400 km2. Using the Aqua Monitor, we found 1,180 km2 of new surface water during the same period. The damming of the Rimjin River in North Korea close to the border with South Korea resulted in a storage surface of 12.4 km2 that was actually due to the Hwanggang Dam, which was thought to be located 35 km to the east. These unknown reservoirs may have had a severe impact on the displacement of people and on the ecology. These issues still have to be investigated.
Created by nature or humans
The results of the Aqua Monitor show only the compound impact of natural and human change or variability. It is often hard to tell what has caused a change without determining the details of the local water and sediment budget. While changes in meanders in the Brahmaputra delta are clearly natural, the Mondrian-like shapes near Taiji Nai’er lakes in China are clearly man-made.
Big data at everyone’s fingertips
Universally-available analytics for big satellite data may have major implications for monitoring capacity and associated actions. At the very local scale, members of the general public can now make assessments without expert assistance if their houses are threatened by coastal erosion. At the regional scale, a downstream riparian state can conduct year-to-year monitoring to see whether upstream neighbours are establishing new impoundments. Finally, at the planetary scale, global agencies such as the United Nations International Strategy for Disaster Reduction can monitor the appearance of new reservoir storage capacity that may reduce flood hazards.
Jaap Kwadijk, the Deltares scientific director: “This has never been done before. So it is difficult to imagine all the new applications that will be made using this tool. But the tool can be used by everybody and so I am sure multiple applications will emerge in the next few years”.
The BBC took on an approach of transparency and reported explicitly on the land area gain at the coasts:
Coastal areas were also analysed, and to the scientists surprise, coastlines had gained more land – 33,700 sq km (13,000 sq miles) – than they had been lost to water (20,100 sq km or 7,800 sq miles). “We expected that the coast would start to retreat due to sea level rise, but the most surprising thing is that the coasts are growing all over the world,” said Dr Baart. “We’re were able to create more land than sea level rise was taking.”
Why is the result so? Every geologist learns in the first semesters that deltas expand out into the sea when the rate of sediment buildup is faster than then sea level rise. This appears to be the case here. Sea level rise is too small to lead to a flooding of coastal level areas. The system finds itself in a state of regression as many sand coasts are pushing out slowly into the sea.
Policymakers need to take Geology 101
After the end of the last ice age some 10,000 years ago, the case was very different. Back then sea level rise was multiple times greater than what it is today and coasts were covered by the sea. In geological terms this is called “transgression”. Perhaps political policy makers should be required to take Geology 101 so that they are better able to take part in the climate discussion.

"The Carbon Sense Coalition today claimed that imposing a Carbon Emissions Trading Scheme was not justified by the science and was likely to be very costly and disruptive to the lives of all Australians. 
Responding to the draft Garnaut report, the chairman of “Carbon Sense”, Mr Viv Forbes, claimed that it is becoming very clear that carbon dioxide is not a key driver of earth’s temperature, and attempts to reduce man’s emissions of CO2 will do more harm than good.

“There is certainly no justification for the premature imposition of any de-carbonisation proposals in Australia – no emissions trading systems, no cap and trade nonsense, no subsidies for converting food to motor spirit, no mandating of fairyland energy proposals, no geo-sequestration and no more carbon taxes. 
“However, if we were forced to choose between all the above unpalatable de-carbonisation alternatives, we would reluctantly support a simple carbon tax on all net direct emissions of CO2 from all industries. This should be accompanied by the IMMEDIATE abolition of all the other state and federal legislated Greenhouse foolishness. As soon as the climate and the science make it clear, even to economists such as Professor Garnaut, that man does not control the climate, we can then easily abolish the silly carbon tax (amid great rejoicing among those who do not dwell in the capital city hothouses).
“The Precautionary Principle so loved by those spreading doomsday stories on everything, suggests that a simple carbon tax is far less risky than grandiose plans to create an expensive and artificial bubble industry based on Carbon Emissions Trading. 
“The immediate effect of cap and trade legislation is the creation of new electronic assets called “permits to emit” with no reality, no separate existence, no asset backing and no intrinsic value whatsoever. Their value depends solely on a politician’s promise that people holding an emissions permit will have a protected position compared to those without a permit from the Carbon Czar. It is a principle Al Capone would have understood and welcomed.
“Immediately the government creates these securities with no substance and the Carbon Bank which stores no carbon, a huge new artificial industry will be created. There will be administrators and auditors, bankers and brokers, barristers and bureaucrats, carbon credit farmers and foresters, lawyers and lobbyists, traders and tax advisers, and all the high paid never ending research jobs in Zero-Gen and Zero emissions.
“To some people, the Greenhouse industry looks like the saviour of Australia after the last coal mine and the last cement plant are closed, the last farm becomes a carbon credit plantation, and the sounds of planes, trains, trucks, tractors and dozers are no longer heard in the land. 
“However, decarbonisation will never create one more roof on a new house, a slice of toast on one plate, a steak on a single barby, a blanket on one bed or a light in one dunny. And the warm inner glow from Canberra will not boil one kettle in Cairns. 
“When the real economy dies, so too will this huge parasitic bubble economy manufactured in Parliament. It will be better for all concerned that it is never created.”

**Introduction**



The national debate over what to do, if anything, about the increasing concentration of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere has become less a debate about scientific or economic issues than an exercise in political theater. The reason is that the issue of global climate change is pregnant with far‐​reaching implications for human society and the kind of world our children will live in decades from now.



Introducing nuance and clear‐​headed reason to this debate is something of a struggle. As Cato Institute chairman William Niskanen has noted, for any international action to merit support, all of the following propositions must be proven true:



The case for any one of those statements is surprisingly weak. The case for a global warming treaty, which depends on the accuracy of all those statements, is shockingly weak. My talk this afternoon will concentrate on a few of the most important of those propositions.



 **A Continued Increase in the Emission of Greenhouse Gases Will Increase Global Temperature**



First off, this subject is terribly complex; the 2nd Assessment Report of the International Panel on Climate Change is 500 pages long with 75 pages of references. As Ben Santer, author of the key IPCC chapter that summarized climate change science, has noted, there are legions of qualifications in those pages about what we know and what we don’t. But, unfortunately, those qualifications get lost in the journalistic and political discourse.



I will dispense with an introductory discussion of the rudimentary elements of greenhouse theory. I’m sure you’re all familiar with it. Largely on the basis of computer models, which attempt to reflect what we know, what we assume, and what we can guess, many people believe that continued emissions of anthropogenic greenhouse gasses will increase global temperatures anywhere from 1 to 3.5 degrees Celsius.



At this point, I should note that those estimates have been coming down over time. The 1990 IPCC report predicted a little more than twice this amount of warming, and projections have been declining ever since as better models have been constructed. One wonders, at this rate, whether the models will continue to predict increasingly smaller amounts of warming until even the upper bound forecasts become so moderate as to be unimportant.



 _ **What We Know – And What We Don’t Know**_



Here’s what the data say, about which there is little debate; ground‐​based temperatures stations indicate that the planet has warmed somewhere between .3 and .6 degrees Celsius since about 1850, with about half of this warming occurring since WWII. Moreover: 



But even here, we have uncertainties. Shorter sets of data collected by far more precise NASA satellites and weather balloons show a slight cooling trend over the past 19 years, the very period during which we supposedly began detecting the greenhouse signal. Those data are generally more reliable because satellite and balloons survey 99% of the earth’s surface, whereas land‐​based data (1) only unevenly cover the three‐​quarters of the earth’s surface covered by oceans and (2) virtually ignore polar regions.



While some of that cooling was undoubtedly a result of Mt. Pinetumbo and the increased strength of the El Nino southern oscillation, those events fail to explain why the cooling occurred both before and after those weather events were played out and why, even correcting for those events, the temperature data show no significant warming during the 19‐​year period.



While it is true, as critics point out, that the satellite and weather balloons measure temperatures in the atmosphere and not on the ground



Even assuming that ground‐​based temperature data are more reflective of true climate patterns, that still leaves us with a mystery. When fed past emissions data, most of the computer models predict a far greater amount of warming by now than has actually occurred (the models that are reasonably capable of replicating known conditions are a tale unto themselves to which I’ll return in a moment). Notes the IPCC, “When increases in greenhouse gases only are taken into account … most climate models produce a greater mean warming than has been observed to date, unless a lower climate sensitivity is used.” Indeed, the most intensive scientific research is being done on why the amount of warming that has occurred so far is so low. After all, a .3-.6 degree Celsius warming trend over the last 150 years all but disappears within the statistical noise of natural climate variability. 



There are three possibilities:



 ** _Indirect Evidence of Global Temperature_**



Scientists who argue the first possibility cite the largely incompatible, imprecise, and incomplete nature of even recent land‐​based temperature records. Those observations, of course, are absolutely correct. Instead, these scientists concentrate on indirect evidence suggesting that the planet has been warming and has been warming significantly over the relatively recent past. They typically point to precipitation trends, glacial movement, sea level increases, and increased extreme temperature variability as suggestive of a significant warming trend. Let’s take each of these issues in turn. 



Precipitation Trends:



Glacial Movement: 



Sea Level: 



Extreme Weather Variability: 



**_The Masking Theory_**



The second theory is more widely credited. The most likely masking culprit according to the IPCC are anthropogenic aerosols, primarily sulfates, that reflect some of the sun’s rays back into space and thus have a cooling effect on the climate. That aerosols have this affect is widely understood. But as ambient concentrations of anthropogenic aerosols continue to decline (yes, global pollution is on the decline, not on the rise), the argument is that this artificial cooling effect will be eliminated and the full force of anthropogenic greenhouse gas loading will be felt in short order.



This theory becomes particularly attractive when the details of temperature variability are considered. The warming, as noted a moment ago, is largely a nighttime, winter phenomenon; patterns, which suggest increased cloud cover, might have something to do with the temperature records.



The best evidence marshaled thus far in support of the masking theory was published in _Nature_ in the summer of 1996. The study, by Santer et al., used weather balloon temperature data from 1963 to 1987 to determine temperature trends in the middle of the Southern Hemisphere, where virtually no sulfates exist to counter greenhouse warming. The article, which caused a sensation in the scientific world, showed marked warming and seemed to confirm the argument that, when sulfates were absent, warming was clearly evident. The article was featured prominently in the 1995 IPCC report as strong evidence that artificial sulphate masking was behind the dearth of surface warming.



Yet it turns out that, if one examines a fuller set of data from the Southern Hemispheric (1958–95, 13 years’ worth of data that Santer et al. did not use), no warming trend is apparent. Moreover, if we carefully examine the land‐​based temperature records, we discover that it is the regions most heavily covered by sulfates – the midlatitude land areas of the Northern Hemisphere – that have experienced the greatest amount of warming. That, of course, is the exact opposite of what we should discover if the masking hypothesis were correct. 



**_Climate Sensitivity_**



As I noted a few moments ago, a few of the climate models come reasonably close to replicating past and present climatic conditions when historical data are entered. Those models, interestingly enough, predict the least amount of future warming based on present trends. The two most prominent of those models, those of the National Center for Atmospheric Research and the U.K. Meteorological Organization, predict warming of only 1.2 degrees Celsius and 1.3 degrees Celsius over the next 50 years; the lower‐​bound estimates reported by the IPCC. 



The argument for moderate climate sensitivity to anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions largely rests on three observations: 



**_The Anatomy of the “Consensus”_**



Despite all the uncertainty, we are constantly told that there is a “consensus” of scientific opinion that human‐​induced climate changes are occurring and that they are a matter of serious concern. That belief is largely due to the weight given the IPCC report, where this consensus is supposedly reflected. Here is the talismanic sentence in the executive summary of that report, a summation of the 500 pages written not by the scientists who produced that report but by a small, politically appointed executive committee: “the balance of the evidence suggests” that human influences explain some of the detected warming. Now, compare that statement with this, which appears on p. 439 of the report:



On p. 411, the statement is even clearer:



Counterbalancing IPCC’s note of cautious concern are other, far harsher judgements about the scientific evidence for global climate change:



A recent joint statement signed by 2,600 scientists under the auspices of the environmental group Ozone Action is less than compelling. A survey of those signatories by Citizens for a Sound Economy concludes that fewer than 10% of them had any expertise at all in any scientific discipline related to climate science.





 **An Increase in Average Temperature Will Generate More Costs Than Benefits**



How costly might global warming prove to be 100 years hence? Well, that largely depends on the distribution of warming through time and space. It also depends on how much warming occurs; will it be the upper bound or lower bound estimate that comes to pass?



 ** _Benign Warming Patterns_**



For what it’s worth, I tend to agree with the IPCC’s summary statement that the “balance of the evidence suggests” that anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions explain some of the detected warming observed thus far over the past 100 years. But as noted earlier, that warming has been extremely moderate, has been largely confined to the northern latitudes during winter nights, and has exhibited no real detrimental effects thus far. I expect those trends to continue and that’s the main reason why I doubt that the costs of warming will be particularly consequential. 



The present observed warming pattern is certainly consistent with our understanding both of atmospheric physics, which indicates the following:



Virginia state climatologist Pat Michaels concludes that



Indeed, this warming scenario predicts benign, not deleterious, effects on both the environment and the economy. 



But what if the warming turns out to be more serious than this? What if the median estimate reported by the climate models comes to pass: a 2.5 degree Celsius warming over the next 100 years?



There have been six particularly comprehensive or prominent serious studies undertaken to estimate the macroeconomic consequences of such a warming. None of them gives us much reason for alarm. The main reason is that most modern industries are relatively immune to weather. Climate affects principally agriculture, forestry, and fishing, which together constitute less than 2 percent of U.S. gross domestic product (GDP). Manufacturing, most service industries, and nearly all extractive industries remain unaffected by climate shifts. A few services, such as tourism, may be susceptible to temperature or precipitation alterations: a warmer climate would be likely to shift the nature and location of pleasure trips. 



**_1974 Department of Transportation Study_**



Back when the world was more concerned with global cooling than global warming, the DOT brought together the most distinguished group of academics ever assembled before or after to examine the economic implications of both cooling and warming. In 1990 dollars, the DOT study concluded that a .9 degree Fahrenheit warming would save the economy $8 billion a year. Only increases in electricity demand appeared on the “cost” side of the warming ledger. Gains in wages, reduced fossil fuel consumption, lower housing and clothing expenses, and a slight savings in public expenditures appeared on the “benefit” side. The amount of warming examined by DOT is roughly equivalent to what the ground‐​based monitors suggest the planet has experienced over the last 100 years. 



**_1986 EPA Study_**



Crafted mostly by internal staff (not one of whom had any economics training), the EPA produced few figures, and no quantitative estimates of costs or benefits, failed to even refer to the DOT study of only 12 years earlier, and was littered with qualifications like “could” and “might.” While conceding that global warming would reduce mortality slightly, the report nonetheless concluded impressionistically that warming would probably cost the economy.



 _ **1991 Nordhaus Study**_



Perhaps the most prominent academic study of the economic consequences of warming was produced by Yale economist William Nordhaus, an informal adviser to the Clinton administration. Nordhaus calculates that a doubling of atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations would cost the economy approximately $14.4 billion in 1990 dollars, or about 0.26% of national income. On the “cost” side, Nordhaus places increased electricity demand, loss of land due to flooding, coastal erosion, and the forced protection of various threatened seaboard properties. On the “benefits” side, Nordhaus places reductions in demand for nonelectric heat. He concludes that agricultural implications are too uncertain to calculate but estimates that losses could be as great as $15 billion annually while gains could reach $14 billion annually. Finally, Nordhaus assumes that unmeasured impacts of warming could dwarf his calculations, so he arbitrarily quadruples his cost estimates to produce an estimate of warming costs somewhere around 1% of GDP. 



_**1992 Cline Study**_



One of the most extensive treatments of the economic consequences of climate change and climate change abatement was produced by economist William Cline of the Institute for International Economics. Instead of assuming a median – 4.5 degree Fahrenheit – estimate of warming a century hence (as all other studies tend to do), he assumes 18 degree Fahrenheit warming by 2300 and works back from there. Moreover, Cline includes an extremely low “social” discount rate to calculate the value of future investment. Despite all this, his preliminary calculations reveal that, for every $3 of benefits to be gained by emission restrictions, $4 of costs is incurred. Only by applying arbitrary adjustments after his initial calculations are performed does he find that the benefits of control exceed their cost; but that won’t occur, even according to Cline, for at least a century.



Even more controversial are Cline’s allocations of costs and benefits of warming. He finds no benefits whatsoever. Costs are found not only in the traditional places (sea level rise, species loss, and moderately increased hurricane activity) but also in areas where most economists have found benefits: agricultural productivity, forest yields, overall energy demand, and water demand. His net estimate is that, spread out over 300 years, the costs of warming will be approximately $62 billion annually. 



Unfortunately, it is the Cline study that receives the lion’s share of attention from the IPCC. The existence of contrary studies is often simply ignored in the document.



 _ **1997 Mendelsohn Study**_



Robert Mendelsohn of the Yale School of Forestry and Environmental Studies calculated late last year that a temperature hike of 2.5 degrees Celsius would lead to a net benefit of $37 billion for the U.S. economy. Farming, timber, and commercial energy sectors all benefit, with agriculture enjoying “a vast increase in supply from carbon fertilization.”



 ** _1998 Moore Study_**



Economist Thomas Gale Moore of Stanford University might be termed the “anti‐​Cline.” Whereas Cline has reported the steepest potential costs of warming, Moore’s review of the literature this year in addition to his own investigation pegs net annual benefits of the median warming scenario at $105 billion. While Moore too finds costs in species loss, sea level rise, increased hurricane activity, and increased tropospheric ozone pollution, he finds moderate benefits in agricultural productivity, forest yields, marine resource availability, and transportation. Moreover, he argues that major benefits will accrue from reduced energy demand, improved human morbidity, an increase from miscellaneous amenity benefits, lower construction costs, greater opportunities for leisure activities, and increased water supplies. 



**_Historical Evidence_**



There is some historical precedent for optimism regarding the consequences of the median computer model warming scenario. The period 850 AD – 1350 AD experienced a sharp and pronounced warming approximately equivalent to that predicted by the median warming scenario; 2.5 degrees Celsius. That period is known to climate historians as the Little Climate Optimum. While there were some climatic dislocations such as coastal flooding, there were marked increases in agricultural productivity, trade, human amenities, and measurable improvements in human morbidity and mortality.



Only when the climate cooled off at the end of the Little Climate Optimum did trade drop off, harvests fail, and morbidity and mortality rates jump largely due to an increase in diseases, particularly the plague.



The reason for optimism here is that human civilization was far more weather dependent a millennia ago than it is today. And even our more primitive, weather dependent ancestors appeared to do fairly well during their episodic warming. 





**Early Measures to Control Emissions Are Superior to Later Measures**



Assuming even the worst about the consequences of unabated anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions and their economic consequences does not necessarily imply that emissions controls today make more sense than emissions controls tomorrow.



There is no compelling need to act now. According to a recent study by Wigley et al. in _Nature_ , waiting more than 20 years before taking action to limit anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions would result in only about a .2 degree Celsius temperature increase spread out over a 100‐​year period.



Why might we want to wait a couple of decades before acting? First, we might profitably “look before we leap.” There are a tremendous number of uncertainties that still need to be settled before we can be reasonably sure that action is warranted. Second, we can’t anticipate what sorts of technological advances might occur in the intervening period that might allow far more efficient and less costly control or mitigation strategies than those before us today. Given the low cost of waiting, it would seem only prudent to continue to try to answer the open questions about climate change before making major changes to Western civilization. 





**Controlling Emissions Is Compatible with a Modern Industrialized Economy**



The restrictions on greenhouse gas emissions agreed to in Kyoto are not in any way minor or insubstantial. Reducing U.S. emissions 7% below what they were in 1990 by the year 2012 means reducing emissions almost 40% below what they would be absent the agreement. Adjusted for expected population growth, this means a 50% reduction per capita in greenhouse gas emissions. Virtually everyone agrees that these targets can only be met only by reducing fossil fuel consumption, the main source of virtually all anthropogenic emissions.



Environmentalists argue that such reductions can occur relatively painlessly, that we can cut the amount of fuel we use by 50% and actually produce even more economic growth as a result. Virtually no mainstream academic economist shares that opinion. The two most prominent and well respected academic specialists — Robert Stavins of the John F. Kennedy School of Government at Harvard and William Nordhaus of Yale — maintain that only the functional equivalent of a $150 per ton carbon tax can accomplish this, which they calculates would reduce GDP by 3%, or, as Stavins puts it, “approximately the cost of complying with all other environmental regulations combined.” A recent survey in Forbes summarizing the recent macroeconomic modeling that’s been done on the subject broadly agrees with Stavins’s and Nordhaus’s estimates.



Then there is the matter of whether the emissions cuts presently on the table are even worth the bother. According to the best computer model from the National Center for Atmospheric Research, the Kyoto agreement, even if signed by all the nations of the world, would reduce global warming by an infinitesimal .18 degrees Celsius over the next 50 years. That’s not much bang for the global warming buck.



The reason is that, according to all observers, actually stopping any further global warming from occurring (assuming the median predictions of present climate models) would require a 70% reduction of present emissions, roughly the equivalent of completely abandoning the use of fossil fuels. This, according to Jerry Mahlman, director of the Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory at Princeton, “might take another 30 Kyotos over the next century.” Indeed, environmentalists are frequently quoted as saying that, ultimately, we will need to completely restructure society around the objective of energy efficiency and sustainability, the economic and political costs of which we can only imagine.



Unless we’re prepared to see that journey to its completion, there’s little point in even bothering to sign the Kyoto agreement because, in and of itself, it will make virtually no difference to our planetary climate. 





**Conclusion: A Matter of Perspective**



Let me wind up my comments on a provocative note. We are constantly urged to act because “we shouldn’t be gambling with our children’s future.” In fact, our kids are marshaled endlessly to shame us into planning for the worst … for their sake. But even assuming the absolute worst case about future planetary climate change and the most extreme estimates about what that climate change will ultimately cost society, conservative estimates are that our grandchildren 100 years hence will not be 4.4 times wealthier than we are – as they would be absent global warming – but will instead be only 3.9 times wealthier than we are at present.



I ask you, would you have been comfortable had your grandmother impoverished herself so that you could be 4.4 times wealthier than she rather than 3.9 times wealthier than she? Remember also that increased energy costs are borne most directly by the poor, who spend a greater portion of their income on energy than do the wealthy. Moreover, the poor who will pay the highest price of greenhouse gas abatement will be those in the developing world who will be denied the opportunity to better their lifestyle and standard of living. They will be “saved” from the fate of industrialization and experiencing even the most rudimentary comforts of Western consumer societies.



We’re not really gambling with the lives of our grandchildren. They’ll be just fine regardless of how the climate plays itself out. We’re gambling with the lives of today’s poor, who stand to lose the most if we act rashly.



Thank you very much. I will now entertain any questions you may have.

You Ought to Have a Look _is a feature from the Center for the Study of Science posted by Patrick J. Michaels and Paul C. (“Chip”) Knappenberger. While this section will feature all of the areas of interest that we are emphasizing, the prominence of the climate issue is driving a tremendous amount of web traffic. Here we post a few of the best in recent days, along with our color commentary._   
  
  
—   
  
  
The big news of the week was the “historic” (in President Obama’s words) climate agreement between the U.S. and China—but about the only “historic” thing about it was the hype the White House and environmental groups heaped upon it. In actuality, there was very little new news. The emissions reduction pathway that Obama announced for the U.S. was not much different (actually a teense lower) than the one announced after the (failed) U.N. Copenhagen meeting in 2009, and China agreed to…well, it’s unclear to what they agreed. _NBC News_ reported “China intends to begin to halt the rise in CO2 emissions by around the year 2030.” Try that line (inserting your own specific vice) on your significant other and see how it goes over.   
  
  
A good article in Reuters by John Kemp nicely eschews the hype and looks more closely at the facts. He opening paragraph reads:   




Nov 12 (Reuters) — The joint statement by the United States and China on climate change, issued on Wednesday, is more important for its political and diplomatic symbolism than any practical effect it might have in reducing emissions.



Both Kemp’s article and our article on the announcement are worth having a look at to see what the agreement really entails, and its chances at success (spoiler alert: they aren’t good).   
  
  
Another big news item this week—or at least it should have been—was the release of Alex Epstein’s remarkable book _The Moral Case for Fossil Fuels_. We can’t say enough good things about this book—and we try often! You may have seen our glowing review on these pages yesterday along with some provocative text provided by Alex that cuts to the basic premise of the book—that the societal pros of fossil fuel use far, far exceed the cons, and therefore, it is, well, immoral, to try to restrict their usage and further development. This week Alex also hosted a Reddit AMA (“ask me anything”) to allow internet savvy folks to interact with him directly as ask questions about his new book and his general way of thinking. Alex entertained many interesting questions, for example:   




Question: What should be the role of government with respect to pollution? Should it ban pollution? Limit it? Tax it?   
  
  
Answer: Good question, the subject of chapter 7 “Minimizing Risks and Side‐​Effects.” The basic principle is that we should think of it in terms of individual rights. At a certain threshold of emission someone is polluting your person or property and should be forbidden to do so. But certain threshold is important and contextual based on the state of technology. So in the 1800s people should have been allowed to use the coal plants they did but we shouldn’t today. If something is fundamentally necessary to human life it’s not pollution. There’s a lot of complexity in application but that’s the framework I use.



If you want to see all that transpired in this lively round of questioning is archived here.   
  
  
And finally, our friend, the ever‐​informative Dr. Roy Spencer has a good post up over at his blog looking at what really are the biggest influences on the climate during the timescale of our lifetime. What does he find? Why natural variability, of course! He takes us through a couple of the most influential natural sources of variability and the possible drivers behind them. Here is some insight from Roy:   




But statistics aren’t enough. Since we understand that carbon dioxide is a greenhouse gas, and should cause some warming, but we _don’t_ understand natural climate cycles, scientists only look where the streetlight of government funding illuminates the problem: CO2.   
  
  
What complicates policymaking even further is that what motivates public perceptions and thus decision makers the most are _weather events_. Hurricane Sandy. A snowy winter. We end up blaming these on the only thing we thing we think we understand — increasing CO2 should cause _some_ change, so it must be responsible for _all_ of the change we see…   
  
  
To the extent that human‐​caused warming is occurring, I am increasingly convinced it is a largely benign — and possibly beneficial — needle lost in the haystack of Mother Nature’s natural climate gyrations.



You ought to have a look at the rest of Roy’s article, which can be found here.

Guest essay by Eric Worrall
According to Gizmodo, Carbon Emission Trading is one of the five stages of grief.
“The interplay between the climate realities we likely face and the potential psychological fallout from them was the subject of a conference convened in Washington D.C., in March 2009,” write Lise van Susteren, MD, and Kevin J. Doyle, JD, introducing their work. “A highly respected group of experts offered insights. Their thoughts, recommendations and supporting evidence are presented in this report.”
“The Psychological Effects of Global Warming on the United States,” examines the hitherto undiscussed effects of increasingly prevalent extreme weather, sea level rise, drought and other impacts of climate change on mental health. How will we cope with a changing world?
“The incidences of mental and social disorders will rise steeply. These will include depressive and anxiety disorders, post traumatic stress disorders, substance abuse, suicides, and widespread outbreaks of violence. Children, the poor, the elderly, and those with existing mental health disorders are especially vulnerable and will be hardest hit.”
…
The report’s findings are the subject of the first episode of Bill Nye’s new show, “Global Meltdown.”
He compares our gradual acceptance of the realities of global warming to the five stages of grief: denial, anger, bargaining, depression and acceptance.
Denial and anger we see every day, in our politics. Bargaining we see with carbon emissions trading. Depression has become a well known problem for climate scientists. Acceptance? That’s where we need to be so that we can do something about climate change, even if much of its future impact is already guaranteed.

I’m glad that greens are starting to admit carbon trading is a complete waste of money and effort, but I must say the prediction of a steep rise in psychological problems, is a bit like failed predictions that we shall be overwhelmed by hordes of climate refugees.
So far the only people getting depressed about climate change are green fanatics and climate scientists, whose obsession with the predictions of their broken models appears to be causing real psychological difficulties.
There is one source of future climate related psychological problems which concerns me – the ongoing efforts by green fanatics to infect school children with their depressing life view. Growing up is challenging enough; trusted teacher authority figures telling kids that they have no future, because the world is about to end, cannot be helping the children in their charge, to safely navigate their path to well adjusted adulthood.

"Climate change is not an abstract future threat to the United States, but a real danger that is already harming Americans’ lives, with “substantial damages” to follow if rising temperatures are not controlled. This was the verdict of a major US government report two years ago. The Trump administration’s attitude to climate change was perhaps illustrated in the timing of the report’s release, which was in the news dead zone a day after Thanksgiving. The report was the fourth National Climate Assessment (NCA), and is seen as the most authoritative official US snapshot of the impacts of climate change being seen already, and the estimate of those in the future. It is the combined work of 13 federal agencies, and it warns how climate-related threats to Americans’ physical, social and economic wellbeing are rising, and will continue to grow without additional action. Here we look at the regions of the US where it describes various impacts, with photography from these areas showing people and places in the US where climate change is very real. If there was a ground zero for the climate crisis in the US, it would probably be located in Alaska. The state, according to the national climate assessment, is “ on the front lines of climate change and is among the fastest warming regions on Earth”. Since the early 1980s, Alaska’s sea ice extent in September, when it hits its annual minimum, has decreased by as much as 15% per decade, with sea ice-free summers likely this century. This has upended fishing routines for remote communities that rely upon caught fish for their food. The thinning ice has seen people and vehicles collapse into the frigid water below, hampering transport routes. Roads and buildings have buckled as the frozen soils underneath melt. Wildfires are also an increasing menace in Alaska, with three out of the top four fire years in terms of acres burned occurring since 2000. The state’s residents are grappling with a rapidly changing environment that is harming their health, their supply of food and livelihoods. Last year was the hottest year on record in Alaska, 6.2F warmer than the long-term average. The north-east, home to a sizable chunk of the US population and marked by hot summers and cold, snowy winters, is undergoing a major climatic upheaval. The most rapidly warming region of the contiguous United States, the north-east is set to be, on average, 2C warmer than the pre-industrial era by 2035, decades before the the global average reaches this mark. These rising temperatures are bringing punishing heatwaves, coastal flooding and more intense rainfall. Snow storms may decrease in number but increase in intensity, while the warming oceans are already altering the composition of available seafood – lobsters, for example, are fleeing north to the cooler waters of Maine and Canada. High-tide flooding will soak about 20 north-east cities for at least 30 days a year by 2050, scientists predict, with the region also hit by stronger hurricanes and storms. These changes will “threaten the sustainability of communities and their livelihoods”, the national climate assessment warns. A major challenge for the north-east will be adaptation to this hotter, more turbulent world. As home to some of America’s oldest cities, such as New York and Philadelphia, the region has plenty of ageing, inefficient housing that ill-equipped to deal with extreme heat. Water is the crucial issue in the northern Great Plains, a vital resource largely provided by the gradual melting of snowpack that builds up in the colder months. Rising temperatures are set to increase the number of heatwaves and accelerate the melt of snow, leading to droughts. At the same time, rainfall intensity is growing, with downpours in winter and spring to increase by up to a third by the end of the century. This is set to lead to a see-sawing effect where severe droughts will be interspersed by flooding, a scenario that played out in 2011, when major floods were followed by drought in 2012. This, the national assessment states, represents a “new and unprecedented variability that is likely to become more common in a warmer world”. The US midwest, home to 60 million people, is the agricultural heartland of the country, growing the bulk of corn, soy and other commodity crops produced on US soil. The climate crisis is starting to play havoc with established farming routines, however, with increasing heat and pounding rainfall causing the erosion of soils and introduction of harmful pests and diseases. Overall yields are set to drop, with the productivity of the midwest set to drop back to 1980s levels by mid-century. Forest health is declining, while the extra heat is helping spawn algal blooms in lakes that can effect tourism. The Great Lakes, which contain 20% of the world’s surface fresh water, are experiencing a decline in seasonal ice cover and growing loss from evaporation. Worsening air quality, again caused by the heat, is expected to cause up to 550 extra deaths a year in the midwest by 2050. Communities in the south-east are set to suffer the largest losses from climate change, research has suggested, due to its existing racial and economic disparities. Soaring temperatures, rising humidity and a raft of new diseases are expected to fall heaviest on poorer people and people of color. Cities such as Birmingham, New Orleans and Raleigh are experiencing more and longer heatwaves, with diseases such as West Nile expected to spread in the region as mosquito activity increases. Huge hurricanes such as Irma, which slammed into Florida in 2017, are “expected to become more common in the future due to climate change”, the national assessment warns, with Hurricane Harvey’s landfall on the Texas coast in 2017 was “one of the costliest natural disasters in US history”, the national assessment said. It ravaged Houston, America’s fourth largest city. Estimates of the economic impact of the hurricane, which tore through the Caribbean, Texas and Louisiana, have been at least $90bn in loss of property and livelihoods. It was also the cause of scores of deaths. Some new research earlier this year, based on a radical assessment, put the price tag directly linked to climate breakdown, which is making hurricanes stronger, at $67bn, far more than the previous estimates of a $20bn loss attributable to climate change, rather than natural weather conditions. The storm made landfall 200 miles from Houston and dropped as much as 60in of rain over parts of the metropolitan area. It killed at least 68 people and flooded more than 300,000 structures in south-east Texas alone. Harvey was Houston’s third serious flooding event in as many years. The US south-west is experiencing a boom in its population, placing even greater stress on its overstretched water resources. The Colorado River is a critical water supply for seven states but is suffering from years of overuse to irrigate crops as well as a reduction in flow coming from the gradual melting of snow as rising temperatures shrink the snowpack. The volume of water in Lake Powell and Lake Mead, two critical catchments, has dropped by half in the past two decades. Fire has long been part of this landscape, but the climate crisis is fueling larger outbreaks, with scientists estimating the area burned in the US west since the 1980s was double what it would have been had humans not heated up the planet. These wildfires can often turn deadly, as seen in 2018 when fires in California razed the town of Paradise and threatened coastal communities. The north-western corner of the US is renowned for its clean air, pristine water and tracts of lush forest, but the climate crisis is beginning to take its toll even here. Rising heat is reducing snowpack and introducing new pests to the north-west’s forests, threatening the key tourism and timber industries. Commercial fisheries, too, face losses, with the warming of river waters hurting the migration and spawning of salmon. Air quality is set to decline, with the residents of Seattle given a glimpse of this in 2017 and 2018 when smoke from distant wildfires shrouded the city. The sprawling Pacific islands under US jurisdiction are major draws for tourists, but face increasingly perilous conditions as the world heats up. Increasingly powerful cyclones menace the region, while rising sea levels threaten to bring salt water inundation to places that have limited freshwater supplies. Hawaii, for example, has seen a significant reduction in rainfall over the past century. The bleaching and dying of coral reefs, caused by the warming oceans, is an unfolding disaster for the Pacific. A large proportion of people on Caribbean islands live near the coast and rely on a narrow climatic range to grow crops such as coffee and mangoes, meaning sea-level rise and soaring temperatures pose a major challenge to people in the region. Fiercer hurricanes are also a growing threat, as evidenced in 2017 when Hurricane Maria crunched into Puerto Rico, resulting in thousands of deaths, crippling the power grid and causing billions of dollars in damages. This article was amended on 20 August to correct to the preferred term for Inuit people."

Share this...FacebookTwitterNational Academy of Sciences (1975): “We do not know what causes…climatic change”
By Kenneth Richard
After having switched from warning the masses in the 1970s about imminent human-caused global cooling to warning the masses in the 1980s about an imminent human-caused global warming , the late Dr. Stephen Schneider suggested that, to avoid “potentially disastrous climatic change,” scientists should consider offering up “scary scenarios” so as to “capture the public’s imagination.”
Dr. Stephen Schneider via Discover, pp. 45-48, Oct. 1989:
On the one hand, as scientists we are ethically bound to the scientific method, in effect promising to tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but — which means that we must include all the doubts, the caveats, the ifs, ands, and buts. On the other hand, we are not just scientists but human beings as well. And like most people we’d like to see the world a better place, which in this context translates into our working to reduce the risk of potentially disastrous climatic change. To do that we need to get some broad based support, to capture the public’s imagination. That, of course, entails getting loads of media coverage. So we have to offer up scary scenarios, make simplified, dramatic statements, and make little mention of any doubts we might have.”
Notice how Schneider confirmed that an essential element in garnering “loads of media coverage” and “broad based support” is to “make little mention of any doubts we [climate scientists] may have.”  Judging by media attention, this “strategy of advocacy” appears to have worked.  After all, a growing percentage of the populace is now familiar with the claim that we can determine there is a 97% scientific consensus that humans cause climate change by selectively counting (and excluding) abstracts from scientific papers.  In other words, expressing uncertainty or doubt about “disastrous climate change” caused by humans relegates one to classification with the claimed 3% fringe.
It didn’t used to be this way. Back in the 1970s and ’80s, or before there were strong government-sponsored incentives to link human activity to climate changes, it was still quite common for scientists to acknowledge that:
(a) climate parameters are extremely difficult to model because
(b) there are far too many unknowns in the climate system to determine cause and effect with confidence, and
(c) a discernable link between climate change and human activity is extremely difficult to establish.
For example, no less than the National Academy of Sciences (NAS) at one time definitively acknowledged that too little is known about the climate system to understand what causes climatic change. The summary of their position below is taken from the extensively-referenced 1975 NAS paper entitled “Understanding Climatic Change”. (National Academy of Sciences, 1975)
[T]he mechanics of the climatic system is so complex, and our observations of its behavior so incomplete, that at present we do not know what causes any particular climatic change to occur. … What we cannot identify at the present time is how the complete climatic system operates, which are its most critical and sensitive parts, which processes are responsible for its changes, and what are the most likely future climates. In short, while we know something about climate itself, we know very little about climatic change.
Aside from local climatic effects, such as those due to urbanization, these studies have not yet established the existence of a large-scale anthropogenic climatic impact (Machata, 1973). Like their numerical simulation counterparts, such studies are made more difficult by the high levels of natural climatic variability and by the lack of adequate observational data.”
By no means was this expressed climate agnosticism by the NAS rare during that particular time period. Scientists routinely published papers in journals in the 1970s and 1980s that acknowledged a lack of understanding with regard to the main causes of climate change or the inherent limitations in climate modeling. In fact, some scientists described projections of future temperature changes in response to human activities an exercise in “the blind leading the blind.”
Other scientists acknowledged that it is “practically impossible to isolate simple cause-and-effect relationships in the internal workings of the earth-atmosphere-ocean system” or, succinctly, that we “should admit at once that we do not know what are the basic causes of climatic change“.
However, by the 1990s, or with the advent of the the United Nations issuing the first two IPCC reports (1990, 1995), these we-don’t-know concessions by scientists had begun to dissipate. Expressing uncertainty or doubt about the dangerous climatic effects of carbon dioxide has become increasingly taboo.
Even the editor of the journal Science (Marcia McNutt) has herself recently (2015) written that, with regard to human-caused global warming, “the time for debate has ended.”  (Link: here). The uncertainty, doubt, and skepticism have essentially been shooed away, which has paved the way for “scary scenarios” to potentially “capture the public’s imagination” — just as Dr. Stephen Schneider had proposed.
With this contrast between then and now in mind, perhaps it would be interesting to read what scientists used to commonly write in scientific journals with regard to the immense uncertainties associated with climate change. Below  are several prototypical examples from the time period when expressing a lack of understanding about the causes of climate change was still considered acceptable — or before scientific advocacy was normalized.

1. Barrett, 1978
In particular, detection of an anthropogenic influence through statistical analysis alone requires a long run of data of good quality and careful attention to measures of significance. It is most important to avoid the post hoc ergo propter hoc fallacy that a trend of a few years’ duration or less, following some change in human activities, can be attributed to that change even when no sound physical causal relationship is evident. … While one must presume that natural climatic fluctuations result from the operations of the laws of physics and chemistry, it is practically impossible to isolate simple cause-and-effect relationships in the internal workings of the earth-atmosphere-ocean system. This is because all the processes are interconnected by multiple nonlinear positive and negative feedbacks.
2. Fletcher, 1968
What Causes the Global Climate to Change? No one has been able to explain why such climatic variations occur. They seem to be associated with variations in the vigor of the whole global atmospheric circulation, but why the global system varies is still a mystery. It follows that the fundamental problem in the study of climatic change is the development of a quantitative understanding of the general circulation of the atmosphere; and, since three-fourths of the heat which forces the atmospheric motion comes by way of the ocean surface, a quantitative understanding of oceanic heat transport and ocean/atmosphere heat exchange is especially vital. … An adequate theoretical basis has not as yet been developed for explaining the interactions of the global heat engine and for accounting for observed changes in climate. Causal relationships have been obscured by the multitude of factors operating and problems for investigation have often been ill-defined.  … [T]here are so many variables and degrees of freedom in the global system that specific cause and effect estimates in this regard are very uncertain.
3. Hare, 1971
It is discouraging to have to start by admitting that future changes in the atmosphere may be the result of the inherent instability of the atmospheric circulation, and not of environmental changes that we can detect, and perhaps control. … Explaining past climates and predicting future climates are complementary processes.  As Murray Mitchell pointed out, also at Boulder (Mitchell, 1968), we are miles away from explaining the past, whose record is so blurred that there remain open “many degrees of freedom for the construction of altogether new hypotheses.”   He laid stress where I shall place it today — on the view that explaining climatic variation must rest on an adequate theory of existing climate.  Until we can argue backwards and forwards in time from such a secure foundation we shall continue to be the blind led by the blind.
4. Gilchrist, 1983

Unlike some other pollutants introduced into the atmosphere by Man, carbon dioxide is naturally occurring and non-toxic. The direct effect of increased concentrations may be beneficial notably because it will tend to increase the rate of photosynthesis in plants. On the other hand, there may be deleterious effects through its influence on climate but this is still unproven and we cannot be certain whether, on a global scale, it will on the whole be harmful or beneficial. … The problem of determining the effect of increased carbon dioxide on climate is difficult, the more so because there are some essential aspects of the physical basis of climate that are not well understood
5. Catchpole, 1973
Sellers (1965, p. 198) regretted that while ‘the literature has been saturated with theories of climatic change . . . uncertainty is the only thing that is certain’. Crowe (1971, p. 471) conceded that although palaeoclimatology asks straightforward questions about the nature and causes of climatic changes, ‘the answers still largely elude us’. In the same year Flint (1971, p. 789) appealed that we should ‘admit at once that we do not know what are the basic causes of climatic change’.
6. Stewart and Glantz, 1985
[I]n the early 1970s the prevailing view was that the earth was moving toward a new ice age. Many articles appeared in the scientific literature as well as in the popular press speculating about the impact on agriculture of a 1-2°C cooling. … The causes of global climate change remain in dispute. Existing theories of climate, atmospheric models, and actuarial experience are inadequate to meet the needs of policymakers for information about future climate. In the long run, research may lead to reliable forecasts of climate. For the present, however, policymakers have no recourse but to heed expert judgments – subjective and contradictory though they may be – about future world climate and its effects on agriculture and other sectors of the economy.
7. Roberts, 1975
There are, of course, many different ideas about the origins of climate change. Many factors have been looked upon as potential causes: vulcanism, sea surface temperature changes, changes in CO2 content of the atmosphere, oscillations in Arctic ice and sea depth, and atmospheric turbidity changes due to manmade dust or wind-blown soil and sand. These theories, including the solar one, share the difficulty that they have not yet reached the stage where convincing experimental verification is possible.
8. Shutts and Green, 1972
Many theories about climate change are essentially untestable, but we can still develop a consistent model based on understandable physics—in fact the data cannot be interpreted without one. Shutts and Green believe there is some fundamental defect in all present models: it could be something physically improbable, like an unreasonable effect of tiny solar variations. More likely there is a fundamental lack in our appreciation of how very interactive systems behave.
9. Chaston, 1980
Much of the Northern Hemisphere experienced a dramatic upsurge in snowfall during the 1970s as compared with the previoius decades. … Whether the “Snowy Seventies” heralded the dawn of a major cooling trend or is merely a temporary anomaly is highly debatable.  One may ask fifty meteorologists for his/her opinion on climatic change and inevitably receive fifty differing opinions.  This is why meteorology is so exciting: even with relatively advanced computer programs and the complete set of equations of motion of the atmosphere, we are far from truly understanding the mechanics of Mother Nature.
10. Mac Cracken, 1982
Several recent studies have contended that the increase in CO2 concentrations since the start of the Industrial Revolution has led to identifiable climatic warming. Significant approximations and simplifications have had to be made, however, in order to isolate this supposed CO2 effect from the comparably large latitudinal and temporal temperature variations that may have been due to changes in volcanism, solar variability, other potentially identifiable causal factors, or natural fluctuations. To overcome the resulting uncertainties, data bases must be improved, diagnostic analyses and numerical models must more completely treat the spatial and temporal patterns and phase relations of the expected changes, and a careful search for a set of CO2-specific climate modifications must be undertaken.
11. Schneider, 1974
Unfortunately, knowledge of climate theory is still too primitive to trace reliably climatic cause and effect links, and therefore it is argued that large-scale climate modification schemes appear irresponsible.
12. Dyson, 1977
The magnitude of this negative feed-back effect of atmospheric CO2 upon itself depends on many ecological interactions which have yet to be disentangled. The effect could be negligibly small, or it could be as large as 3 x 109 tons of carbon per yr. In summary, there is insufficient evidence to decide whether the carbon content of the biosphere has decreased, increased or remained stationary in response to the manifold human activities of recent decades. There exists a huge literature attempting to assess or to prognosticate the effects of the increasing atmospheric CO2 on the climate of the earth. Such attempts are useful and necessary, but they run into formidable technical difficulties. Even the mean global temperature rise caused by a given quantity of CO2 is subject to great uncertainty: and the effects of CO2 on local and time-variable phenomena (which may be crucially important to agriculture and other human activities) are more uncertain still.
13. Oerlemans, 1982
Conclusion: This estimate is subject to a number of uncertainties. First of all, opinions about the effect of an increasing CO2 content of the atmosphere differ widely. It is generally accepted that a warming has to be expected, but its magnitude is subject to much debate. Even if we did know the effect of CO2 on climate, things would not be much clearer. The global carbon cycle is poorly understood and we are not yet able to predict (given the anthropogenic CO2 input) the content of the atmosphere for next centuries.
14. Meier, 1983
Should we expect a “threat of disaster” (Mercer, 1978) with sea level and climate in the next 50 years? The obvious answer is no; the complex ice/ocean/atmosphere system is not sufficiently understood. The West Antarctic Ice Sheet may be robust to rapid oceanographic or atmospheric forcing (Whillans, 1978). Unfortunately, we are not even sure whether its grounding lines are currently advancing or retreating, and we certainly do not understand how surges are triggered. Until such understanding is at hand, and atmospheric-oceanographic circulation models are developed that perform well at high latitudes, we can only watch what is happening.
15. Sachs, 1976
This test shows that patterns of climatic change can be resolved with increasingly greater detail but that ‘first causes’ of climatic change remain elusive.
16. Bryant, 1987
Conclusions: The scenario of a CO2-warming globe contains many uncertainties. The warming of the atmosphere is not an established fact, and even if it was there may be no need to invoke increased atmospheric CO2 or other ‘greenhouse’ gases as the cause when such warmings have been a part of our temperature time series historically.  … A common factor underpinning our uncertainties about a CO2-warming atmospheric scenario is that the Earth is not covered adequately with enough data points to evaluate the scenario conclusively.  Even where geophysical time series are available, they are clouded by the inherent fluctuations of their variances.

Share this...FacebookTwitterAt his Satuurday Summary, veteran meteorologist Joe Bastardi looks at August global temperature (starting at about the 3:30 mark) and serves up a few intersting observations.
“Global” warming confined to the poles, in wintertime
First he reminds us that the “global” warming is pretty much confined to the poles, and that during the winter time. Warming during the summertime has been very small, “much to the chagrin of people who want the Arctic ice cap to disappear … Summers are not getting warmer in the Arctic”. He summarizes:
Summers are not getting warmer in the Arctic, and they are not getting warmer in the Antarctic – their summers. The winters are getting warmer and that’s where most of the global warming is. […] Most of the warming is happening in the Arctic, and in the Antarctic during their winters, not in third world countries… “
He then tells listeners that warming is hardly occurring 20° North and south of the equator. In summary the warming is mostly confined to the poles, and it isn’t even year round.
“Phony ideas” about how warm it is getting
The veteran meteorolgist then scoffs at the claim that 0.02°C warming per decade is going to cause mass migrations of populations:

Do you actually think that people can detect, and get migrational patterns, because people detect 0.02°C increase in temperatures? Cut me a break!”
“Probably one of the least ice melt seasons on record”
At 6:10 he looks at Arctic sea ice, saying that it is not going to reach a new record low, as many were hollering about earlier this year. The ice melt rate over the summer has been too slow. Joe says:
Chances are that we had probably one of the least ice melt seasons on record.”

One reason this is so, Joe adds, is because summers have not been warming up there.

"Australia’s chief scientist, Dr Alan Finkel, has rejected a letter from leading scientists who warned his advocacy for increased use of gas-fired electricity was at odds with the Paris climate agreement. The 25 scientists, several of them globally recognised in their fields, applauded Finkel’s support for renewable energy but said his backing an expanded role for gas as a transition fuel was not consistent with a safe climate.  The letter was prompted by a speech the chief scientist gave to the National Press Club in February, in which he said gas would play a “critical role” for many decades as renewable energy scaled up, and his subsequent support for the government’s claim more gas-fired power was essential. The scientists said they were concerned about Finkel’s strategy for dealing with climate change and offered to provide him scientific advice on the issue. “There is no role for an expansion of the gas industry,” they wrote. “The combustion of natural gas is now the fastest-growing source of carbon dioxide to the atmosphere, the most important greenhouse gas.” The letter was organised by Prof Will Steffen, the inaugural director of the Australian National University climate change institute. Signatories include professors John Church, Lesley Hughes, Terry Hughes, Ove Hoegh-Guldberg, Mark Howden and Matthew England. In a written reply on Tuesday, Finkel thanked the scientists for acknowledging he shared their vision for renewable electricity and said it was rewarding to see the role it was already playing in cutting greenhouse gas emissions. But on gas he said he could only reiterate what he said at the press club. “Namely, that the adoption of more renewable electricity will be faster, more economical and more reliable if natural gas-fired electricity generation continues to be available in the near to medium term,” he said. He said there would be times when renewable energy generators would not be able to meet demand, and that gas generators could fill the gap where batteries and pumped hydro power ran short. He said gas power had lower emissions than coal and could be ramped up more quickly, so it did not need to run as often. Gas is often described as having half the emissions of coal, but recent studies have suggested it could be more. The prime minister, Scott Morrison, strongly backed gas in parliament on Tuesday, declaring that expanding supply was critical to Australia’s economic recovery after the pandemic. In response to a question from the Greens leader, Adam Bandt, critical of the Coalition’s support for a gas-led recovery, Morrison said gas was an important transition fuel that would “firm renewable technologies”. “That is why we want to see more of it and get more out of the ground … so we can fuel the jobs that this country needs to come out of the Covid-19 recession,” he said. Morrison, who is working up an energy package ahead of the October budget, used Bandt’s question to round on Labor. The shadow resources minister, Joel Fitzgibbon, has endorsed taxpayer underwriting of gas infrastructure and been rebuked by the Labor leader, Anthony Albanese, and the shadow climate change minister, Mark Butler. Morrison said while Labor was “confused” about gas, the Coalition was “all behind it” and he declared the Australian public would be too. Finkel said in his letter to the scientists he had not commented on an expanded role for gas in industry, having focused solely on the electricity grid. The Australian Energy Market Operator (Aemo) last month found additional gas-fired power was an option, but not essential, for an electricity grid increasingly based on renewable energy, and gas prices would need to stay at lower levels than expected if it was to compete with pumped hydro, batteries and other alternatives. The finding was included in Aemo’s integrated system plan – a roadmap for an optimal national electricity market over the next 20 years. Finkel had recommended the roadmap in a 2017 review of the electricity market for the then Turnbull government. Guardian Australia asked Finkel in June why his assessment on gas differed with a draft version of Aemo’s plan, and whether there was modelling or empirical analysis to support his belief that more gas was critical to the national grid. He said he was basing his assessment “on the real-world experience of Britain, California and South Australia”. “They have successfully reduced their annual coal-fired electricity emissions by using high levels of gas to support solar and wind,” Finkel said. “Gas turbines already in the Australian national electricity market can help to support the transition to a low emissions electricity system.” The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change found global emissions would need to reach “net zero” by about 2050 to give the world a chance of meeting the goals of the Paris agreement."
"Shark skin might look perfectly smooth, but inspect it under a microscope and you’ll notice something strange. The entire outer surface of a shark’s body is actually covered in sharp, little scales known as denticles. More remarkable still, these denticles are incredibly similar to human teeth, as they’re also comprised of dentine and enamel-like materials.  Your dentist will no doubt have warned you that acidic drinks like fizzy cola damage your teeth. This is because acid can dissolve the calcium and phosphate in the enamel tooth covering. For the first time, scientists have discovered a similar process acting on the tooth-like scales of sharks in the ocean.

      How we uncovered the feeding habits of sharks, thanks to plankton 'post codes'


 The carbon dioxide (CO₂) that humans release into the atmosphere doesn’t just heat the planet. As more of it dissolves in the ocean, it’s gradually increasing the acidity of seawater. In the past 200 years, the ocean has absorbed 525 billion tonnes of CO₂ and become 30% more acidic as a result. Now scientists worry that the lower pH is affecting one of the ocean’s top predators. Over hundreds of millions of years, the denticles that make up shark skin have evolved to allow sharks to thrive in different environments. Different species have distinct denticle shapes and patterns that enable a range of remarkable functions. I’ve spent the last four years attempting to understand how the development of these scales is genetically controlled in shark embryos, and how their intricate details give each species an edge. Denticles have highly specialised ridges which help reduce drag by up to 10%, allowing sharks to swim further and faster while using less energy. This works in a similar fashion to the ridges in the hulls of speed boats, which help the vessel move more efficiently through the water. In fact, these scales are so effective at reducing drag that scientists and engineers have long tried to create shark skin-inspired materials for boats and aircraft that can help them travel further on less fuel. The patterning of denticles also works as a defensive armour, which protects sharks from their environment and from other predators. Some female sharks – such as the small-spotted catshark – have even developed a region of enlarged denticles which provide protection from a male shark’s bites during mating. The changing chemistry of the ocean has been linked to coral bleaching, but its effect on other marine animals is less clear. To address this, researchers exposed puffadder shysharks – a species found off the coast of South Africa – to different levels of acidity in aquariums, and used a high-resolution imaging technique to examine the effect of acid exposure on their skin. After just nine weeks, they found that increased water acidity had weakened the surfaces of their denticles. Corrosion and weakening of the denticle surface could degrade the highly specialised drag-reducing ridges, affecting the ability of these sharks to swim and hunt. Many shark species are top-level predators, so if they’re not able to hunt as effectively, this might have an unpredictable impact on the population size of their prey and other animals in the complex marine environment. Some species of shark need to swim constantly to keep oxygen-rich water flowing over their gills and to expel CO₂ – another process which might be hindered by increased drag.

      Sharks: one in four habitats in remote open ocean threatened by longline fishing


 Sharks belong to an ancient group of vertebrates known as the cartilaginous fishes, which split from the bony fishes – a lineage that later gave rise to humans – roughly 450 million years ago. Sharks, and other cartilaginous fish like rays, arose long before the dinosaurs, and have outlived multiple mass extinction events. But the rate of change in the marine environment over the last few centuries is an unprecedented challenge. These ancient predators may struggle to adapt to the fastest known change in ocean chemistry in the last 50 million years."

Talk of interference, intimidation, and abridgement of scientific freedom continues to make the news this week—and increasingly is taking the form of pushback against recently announced congressional investigations into sources of scientific research funding.   
  
On Tuesday, the _Wall Street Journal_ ran an editorial offering a “round of applause for those pushing back, providing the bullies a public lesson in the First Amendment.” Highlighted in their coverage were efforts by the Cato Institute, Heartland Institute and Koch Industries condemning attempts to “silence public debate” on climate change. From the _WSJ_ :   




Democrats and their allies have failed to persuade Americans that climate change is so serious that it warrants sweeping new political controls on American energy and industry. So liberals are trying to silence those who are winning the argument. We’re glad to see the dissenters aren’t intimidated.



Also unintimidated by attempts abridge academic freedom is Alice Dreger, professor of Medical Education-Medical Humanities and Bioethics at Northwestern University and a historian of science and medicine. Dreger has a new book out titled _Galileo’s Middle Finger: Heretics, Activists and the Search for Justice in Science_ that describes how activists try to intimidate researchers when the activists disagree with the researchers' work.   
  
Roger Pielke Jr. reviews the book for _Nature_. From his blog, leading into his review, Roger describes why he empathizes with Dreger:   




Most academic work is like the proverbial tree falling in the forest, but every so often (and probably more often than many of us would like to think), scholarship becomes the focus of a political battle.   
  
I should know. My review was completed and filed the week before I was targeted with an ""investigation"" by a member of Congress for the audacity of testifying before that august body with the results of peer reviewed, government-funded research, widely accepted as scientific consensus. But even before that, my own career has led me to be sympathetic to Dreger's arguments.   
  
I have lots of experience with personal and professional attacks based on my research and advocacy. For instance, it was one year ago today that I published a piece at _FiveThirtyEight_ on that same research, which prompted a social and mainstream media campaign to have me fired for voicing such heresies. The Guardian, New York Times, Slate, Salon and even the American Geophysical Union all joined the campaign. Unsurprisingly, _FiveThirtyEight_ succumbed to the pressure, explaining ""Reception to the article ran about 80 percent negative in the comments section and on social media. A reaction like that compels us to think carefully about the piece and our editorial process.""   
  
So, scientific consensus vs. Facebook likes - Guess who won?



Dreger herself describes some of the attacks on academic freedom in her post at Retraction Watch titled “Yes, we are seeing more attacks on academic freedom.” She leads with:   




The good news: Policy makers and the public seem to be increasingly taking scientific research seriously. The bad news? People who don’t like researchers’ findings seem to be increasingly coming after researchers and their universities. And some of those people are powerful.   
  
Technically, your university is supposed to protect your academic freedom. In my own university’s faculty handbook, academic freedom is the first topic discussed. But as I’ve learned from my own personal experiences, as well as from eight years studying the experiences of other researchers who have gotten into political hot water, your administration may not always have your back.   
  
Economist Paul Frijters of the University of Queensland in Australia seems to have found this out the hard way.



You ought to have a look at her full post for some rather lurid details.   
  
And from what we can gather, you ought to have a look at her book, too.   
  
Stay tuned. The issue of scientific intimidation is trending—big time.

"**Broken glass, raging fires, and smashed up barricades: the pictures from Hong Kong in the past few days look like random chaos.**
But in the middle of the violence, most activists are being deliberate about the places they attack.
So why are protesters targeting Starbucks? And the metro? And certain shops, restaurants and banks?
Hong Kong is complex, but can largely be divided into those who support the protesters and their anti-Beijing stance, and those supportive of the mainland.
So when peaceful protests turned into violence against property, big mainland firms like Bank of China and tech company Xiaomi became targets for vandalism and spray-painting.
But other less obvious places are also in the firing line.
While Starbucks may be a US brand, the Hong Kong franchise is operated by a local company, Maxim's Caterers.
Annie Wu, the daughter of the Maxim Group's founder, recently defended Hong Kong's police and criticised activists as ""radical protesters"".
She made her comments with billionaire businesswoman Pansy Ho, representing the Hong Kong Federation of Women, at the United Nations Human Rights Council on 11 September.
The two criticised ""a small group of radical protesters"" using ""systematic and calculated violent acts"".
So protesters started directing their anger against Maxim's and the franchises it operates.
The restaurant group is one of Hong Kong's largest, and includes other brands such as Genki Sushi and Arome bakery, which have also been targeted.
Maxim's Caterers issued a statement saying Ms Wu ""does not hold any position at the company"" and was not involved in managerial decisions - but so far this has failed to satisfy protesters.
Japanese fast food chain Yoshinoya has also come into the crosshairs.
After there was confusion about a Facebook post - which some read as coded criticism of police - the operator of the Hong Kong franchise said he supported the police and government.
Before long, Yoshinoya restaurants had their windows smashed and graffiti all over their walls.
Another targeted brand is Best Mart 360, a chain of small grocery stores. It's an example of the divisions running within the Hong Kong population.
The boss of Best Mart 360 is Hugo Lam Chi-fung, permanent honorary president of the Hong Kong Federation of Fujian Associations which has held several demonstrations in support of China.
Fujian is a Chinese province, and many local people have emigrated to Hong Kong over the years. Hong Kong's Fujianese community has been vocal in supporting the city's police force.
Those demonstrations have led to clashes with activists - who have accused their opponents of being part of the Fujian triad gangs, a form of organised crime.
Best Mart 360 has released several statements, insisting it is not linked to any Fujian triad.
The triad allegation has also been levelled against a mahjong house in a part of town home to the Fujianese community. Mahjong is a Chinese tile game, played socially.
The Yi Pei Square house was accused of hiding pro-Beijing thugs who attacked local residents.
The parlour has released a statement saying they are not Fujianese and in fact support the protesters' demands.
There have also been cases where places have become the target of activists' anger based on mistaken assumptions of China ties.
The Shanghai Commercial Bank is not mainland-owned but - despite its name - based in Hong Kong.
The Yifang bubble tea chain was also wrongly associated with the mainland when in fact it's from Taiwan.
In both those cases, the protesters wrongly targeted outlets only to later issue an apology and in some cases even help in the cleanup.
In order to avoid such mix-ups and to coordinate action, the activists have even come up with a colour-coding system.
The colours black, red and blue are used online to differentiate between thrashing a place, spay-painting it or simply boycotting it.
In the case of shops thought to support the protests, they're marked yellow with a call to actively support them.
Stations along Hong Kong's MTR metro system have repeatedly been attacked, vandalised or even set on fire during the unrest.
The MTR is privatised, with the Hong Kong government as the largest shareholder.
In mid-August, the operator was criticised by Chinese state media for helping ""rioters"" move around and protest across the city.
After that, the MTR began shutting certain stations before people could gather for demonstrations. At one point the entire network was shut down.
Activists also accuse the operator of allegedly helping the police to arrest protesters, and of failing to release CCTV footage of alleged police brutality.
_Additional reporting by Lam Cho Wai,_BBC News Chinese"
"Thirty years ago this week, the population of Earth was given official notification that it faced a threat of unprecedented magnitude. Emissions of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases, spewed into the atmosphere from factories and vehicles burning fossil fuels, were pinpointed, definitively, as triggers of future climate change. Melting icecaps, rising sea levels and increasing numbers of extreme weather events would be the norm for the 21st century unless action were taken, warned the authors of the first assessment report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). The scientists had been charged by the IPCC, which had been set up two years earlier, with establishing whether climate change was a real prospect and, if it was, to look at the main drivers of that threat. They concluded, in a report released in August 1990, that the menace was real and that coal, gas and oil would be the principal causes of global heating. Unless controls were imposed on their consumption, temperature rises of 0.3C a decade would be occurring in the 21st century, bringing havoc in their wake.  Three decades later, it is clear that we have recklessly ignored that warning. Fossil fuels still supply 80% of the world’s energy, carbon dioxide levels in the atmosphere continue to rise and global temperatures are still increasing. According to Met Office statistics, there was a 0.14C increase in global temperatures in the decade that followed publication of the first assessment report. This was then followed by a 0.2C increase in each of the following two decades. The world could easily heat by 3C by the end of the century at this rate, warn scientists. The impact on the world will, by then, be catastrophic. As the Observer reveals this week, our overheating planet has already lost a staggering 28tn tonnes of ice from its ice sheets and glaciers, triggering sea level rises that are now accelerating at a rate that matches the worst-case scenario predictions of the IPCC. Or consider the heatwave that struck Siberia this year, bringing forest fires, permafrost melting and pest invasions in its wake. Such an event would have been impossible in a world with limited, pre-industrial levels of carbon dioxide in its atmosphere. It would therefore be tempting to blame IPCC scientists for this troubling state of affairs. Should they not have guided us more adroitly through these worrying times? Could they not have acted with more precision? Certainly, the organisation is not without its critics who have claimed, on occasions, that it is overstaffed and sometimes slipshod in its work. However, we should be careful when apportioning blame for the world’s failure to act over climate change. It is the government members of the IPCC who are at fault for ignoring their own scientists’ warnings. They have allowed lobbying by the fossil fuel industry to play havoc with attempts to limit carbon emissions, while nations such as Canada, Saudi Arabia and the United States have blocked all attempts to limit global fossil fuel consumption. By contrast, the IPCC has at least made the world aware of the impending crisis, a task of considerable complexity. Getting scientific experts from 195 nations to agree anything can be likened to the herding of a similar number of bad-tempered cats. Thanks to the IPCC, we are at least aware of the problem that now faces our world. We know exactly how much fossil fuel we have left to burn if we want to limit global temperature rises to a relatively safe rise of 1.5C. Individual nations have until next year – at the United Nations climate change conference in November – to announce how they will achieve those reductions in oil, gas and coal burning in order to make that target possible and to halt global heating. It is an achievable aspiration even at this late date. We still have hope, in other words."
"**Anti-government marches in Hong Kong have ended in rioting, with attacks on government offices, a metro station and businesses with ties to mainland China.**
Police used water cannon, tear gas and truncheons, reportedly removing masks from demonstrators they arrested, and a number of people were injured.
Tens of thousands of protesters had turned out in the rain, spurred to act by a ban on wearing masks at rallies.
The controversial ban was upheld by the High Court on Sunday.
It was introduced by chief executive Carrie Lam who invoked powers dating back to colonial rule by the British.
Sunday's protests were fuelled by both the mask ban and the use by police of live bullets against protesters, which left two people injured this week.
A wave of rioting in Friday led city metro services to shut down but they had partially resumed on Sunday.
Demonstrators fear that democratic rights are being eroded in the semi-autonomous territory under Chinese rule.
The protesters' aim was to make clear their utter contempt for the emergency law banning face masks and almost all covered their faces, the BBC's Robin Brant reports from Hong Kong.
Police watched as protesters moved peacefully, chanting ""Hong Kong resist"" as they walked through the heart of the city, but after a few hours officers moved to end the disruption.
Tear gas canisters were fired on the crowd from police on walkway bridges above. Video shows small groups being targeted by charging officers on the ground.
Many shops were again closing early on Sunday evening in anticipation of more trouble, our correspondent says.
Among incidents on Sunday:
Many more people turned out for the new marches than on Saturday, when a small march was held in the aftermath of Friday's rioting.
""I'm not sure how many more chances we'll get to fight for freedom,"" said Hazel Chan, 18, who was wearing a surgical face mask when she spoke to the BBC near a road block on the city's Rodney Street.
""I don't think it'll have a big impact on the government's stance but I hope we gain international attention and show the world we won't get used to this evil law.""
Fellow demonstrator Riley Fung, 19, said: ""I don't have much confidence in protests because the government has ignored our demands even when millions came out.""
But she continued to protest, she added, in order to express herself.

Despite the pouring rain, the mood was defiant. Thousands of protesters joined the unauthorised march, wearing masks despite the emergency law, blocking and marching down roads, and chanting slogans such as ""Hong Kong revolt"" and ""stand with Hong Kong"" in Cantonese and English.
Despite the clear defiance of the law, there were hardly any police to be seen in the first few hours. Protesters set up a road block, dug up bricks, and tied banners condemning the government onto flyovers.
Then, seemingly out of nowhere, several tear gas canisters were fired. Tensions flared further as a convoy of dozens of police vans suddenly emerged - protesters shouted ""the water cannon is coming"" and ran down the streets. Within an hour or so, the roads were open again - and the protesters had seemingly melted away.
Ms Lam vowed on Saturday to prevent further violence, saying: ""We cannot allow rioters any more to destroy our treasured Hong Kong.""
She justified the law against masks as a response to the demonstrators' ""extreme violence"" which was, she said, endangering Hong Kong's public safety.
A second legal challenge to the mask ban, which was brought by opposition legislators, was rejected by the High Court.
The legislators had argued that the prohibition was unconstitutional because it denied the rights of free expression and free assembly.
Over the months, clashes between police and activists have become increasingly violent.
On Tuesday, police shot a protester with a live bullet for the first time, wounding an 18-year-old, who was allegedly attacking a police officer.
On Friday, a boy aged 14 was shot in the leg with a live round in Yuen Long, a town to the west of the city.
A plain-clothes police officer with an unmarked police car was later set upon by rioters in the same area but officials did not link the two incidents, the South China Morning Post reports.
Hong Kong is a former British colony handed back to China in 1997.
It has a ""one country, two systems"" agreement that guarantees it some autonomy, and its people certain freedoms, including freedom of assembly and freedom of speech.
But those freedoms - the Basic Law - are only enshrined until 2047 and it is not clear what will happen then."
"Picture an ideal dinner plate. If you’re like most Americans, it features a hearty portion of meat, from animals fattened on midwestern corn and soybeans, and a helping of vegetables, largely trucked in from California. The unique landscapes we rely on to deliver this bounty – the twin jewels of the US food system – are locked in a state of slow-motion ecological unravelling.  California’s agricultural sector has flourished from decades of easy access to water in one of the globe’s biggest swaths of Mediterranean climate. The Sierra Nevada, the spine of mountains that runs along California’s eastern flank, captures an annual cache of snow that, when it melts, cascades into a network of government-built dams, canals and aqueducts that deliver irrigation water to farmers in the adjoining Central Valley. In light-snow years, farmers could tap aquifers that had built up over millennia to offset the shortfall.  But the Sierra snowpack has shown an overall declining trend for decades – most dramatically during the great California drought of 2012-2016 – and it will dwindle further over the next several decades as the climate warms, a growing body of research suggests. A 2018 paper by Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory researchers articulates the alarming consensus: a “future of consistent low-to-no snowpack” for the Sierra Nevada, the irrigation jewel of our vegetable patch. Even as snowmelt gushing from the mountains dwindles, the Central Valley farming behemoth gets ever more ravenous for irrigation water, switching from annual crops that can be fallowed in dry years to almond and pistachio groves, which require huge upfront investments and need to be watered every year. As a result, farm operations are increasingly resorting to tapping the water beneath them. Between 2002 and 2017, a period including two massive droughts, farmers siphoned enough water from the valley’s aquifers to fill Louisiana’s Lake Pontchartrain three times. As the water vanishes, the ground settles and sinks in uneven and unpredictable ways, a phenomenon known as subsidence. By 2017, large sections of the Central Valley were sinking by as much as 2ft a year. In addition to damaging roads, bridges, houses, sewage pipes and pretty much all built infrastructure, subsidence snarls up the canals that carry snowmelt from the Sierra Nevada. Thus we have a vicious circle: reduced snowmelt means less water flowing through government-run irrigation channels, which pushes farmers to pump more water from underground, causing more subsidence that damages those channels and reduces their flow capacity, pushing farmers to accelerate the cycle by pumping more water from underground. Seventeen hundred miles to the east, the prevailing agriculture system consumes a different but equally precious resource: soil. When white settlers seized what we now call the corn belt from indigenous inhabitants in the 19th century, they found thousands of miles of prairies and marshlands, with hundreds of species of perennial wild grasses, legumes and flowers that towered over their heads, with roots plunging just as deep into the earth, burying carbon from the atmosphere and feeding a teeming web of micro-organisms that break down and cycle nutrients. Aboveground, vast herds of bison ate their way through fields, stimulating new plant growth and recycling nutrients through their manure. Interactions between Native Americans, plants, animals, microbes and climate left behind a majestic store of fertile topsoil that scientists call mollisol. Even today, the US midwest boasts the largest of four major mollisol stores on the planet. Mollisols develop over millennia yet can be squandered in decades. US colonial-settler agriculture transformed this ecological niche, a land mass 1.5 times the size of California, into a factory churning out just two crops – corn and soybeans. This kind of agriculture fouls water as a matter of course. Since corn and soybeans are planted in the spring and harvested in the fall, the vast majority of corn-belt farmland lies bare for the winter months, leaving the ground naked when storms hit. These deluges pummel bare topsoil and send it – and the agrochemicals and manure farmers apply to it – cascading off farms and into streams and creeks that flow into rivers, lakes and ultimately the Gulf of Mexico. But there’s another problem with subjecting the land to the same two crops every year: loss of the region’s precious black topsoil. According to research by the soil scientist Rick Cruse, Iowa – and much of the surrounding corn belt – is losing soil at a rate 16 times the pace of natural replenishment. Again, climate change is a driver. Today’s farmers encounter a weather regime radically different from that of their grandparents: more intense off-season storms, and thus ever-heavier pressure on the soil. If global greenhouse gases continue rising, the region faces a 40% increase in precipitation by the late 21st century, according to the Fourth National Climate Assessment. The soil that makes one of the globe’s most important growing regions so productive is vanishing before our eyes, degrading a crucial food production region at the very time when climate change and global population growth call for building resilience. There’s no great mystery about how to halt the withering away of California’s water or Iowa’s soil. California needs to shrink its agricultural footprint to match the scale of its water resources, which means other regions of the US should ramp up their own fruit and vegetable production to make up the difference. In the corn belt, US federal farm policy should stop paying farmers to overproduce corn and soybeans, and instead push them to diversify their plantings and keep their land covered all winter – practices known to maintain high levels of production while also preserving soil, decreasing water pollution and slashing the need for pesticides and fertilizers. Reduced demand for agrichemicals, however, pinches the bottom line of the agrichemical behemoths, and a turn from corn-and-soybean dominance will dent profits for the meat companies that rely on cheap, overproduced feed. These companies divert a share of their income into lobbying and campaign finance, and their interests shape US farm policy. But it doesn’t have to be that way. Just as creating a sane climate policy requires the rise of a social movement to negate the power of the fossil fuel lobby, a better agricultural regime will require a direct political challenge to big agribusiness. Climate justice and food justice are, in fact, the same fight – the struggle to beat back corporate dominance and make the world livable for everyone.

"After a quarter of a century of nations from around the world coming together to discuss progress in dealing with climate change, emissions are still rising. The 25th annual United Nations climate change summit is now underway – and for the sake of the planet, it’s high time it changed its approach. While climate scientists, policymakers and environmental campaigners have been engaged in a decades-long conversation about the future of the planet, most people on planet Earth see no climate emergency. Put bluntly, the science of global warming has failed spectacularly to emotionally connect with much of society, particularly those in the most powerful positions – rendering policymakers ineffective despite repeated warnings.  The science and the warnings focus on curtailing the emission of heat-absorbing gases into the atmosphere that, left unaddressed, may threaten the viability of contemporary society and worsen a mass extinction event already in motion. But these warnings are not connected with complex human systems, such as food, finance and logistics, leaving them to evolve as if climate change didn’t exist. Terms such as “tipping points” are on their own technical, distant and abstract, while humans are wired to prioritise the short-term.

      What climate 'tipping points' are – and how they could suddenly change our planet


 This failure to connect the dots means humanity has rapidly entered uncharted territory, pumping out carbon ten times faster than at any point since the extinction of the dinosaurs. So while climate scientists must continue to improve their understanding of a rapidly changing Earth system, what we really need now is to hear from experts who understand the human systems contained within, and how intertwined with the climate their fate is. The new story of our planetary emergency must highlight our vulnerability to near-term climate shocks, and offer a corresponding vision of a more urgent global response. Cascading tipping points in the Earth system – such as melting ice sheets and forest collapse – may be existential long-term threats. But we’re already causing increasingly extreme weather events that may soon become severe and frequent enough to cause what’s called “synchronous failure”. This is where multiple stresses across human-made systems lead to catastrophic collapses in their functioning. These collapses, given how interconnected our global system is, can affect one country directly but lead to the failure of our finance systems or global supply chains in many others. To paraphrase English poet John Donne, no country is an island when it comes to shielding itself from collapses in other countries. Take the global financial crisis in 2008. Following financial deregulation, banks started to create money which was used for mortgages, leading to house prices rising faster than wages. This bubble in the housing market was not sustainable and too much debt in the US and Europe led to the collapse of major financial institutions. This collapse threatened the whole banking sector, leading governments to bail them out. In turn, economies stalled, governments borrowed, and austerity was born – the effects of which are still being felt today. Our climate is now what unscrupulous banking was then. Think of the global economy as a never-ending game of tile-matching video game Tetris, where the movement of cargo ships, trains, lorries and planes gently fits together in an orderly sequence. This is made possible thanks to efficient logistics, where everything arrives “just in time” to minimise costs and maximise profit. It’s why your local supermarket has evolved to not require a small warehouse at the back. The problem is that this just-in-time economy has been designed around assumptions of a stable world, in which an action always leads to a simple and predictable outcome. But it now sits on top of a hugely unstable and complex platform – our physical world, increasingly disrupted by climate change. In other words, no more smooth-running Tetris. We are already experiencing this unstable platform. Droughts and heat have reduced global cereal production by 9-10%. The onion harvest was so compromised in 2018 that Latvia declared a natural disaster, and Lithuania a state of emergency. In Syria, an intense three-year drought contributed heavily to a crash in food production, which combined with other complex pressures to bring about the country’s collapse. In the future, food shocks are likely to get much worse. The risk of multi-breadbasket failure is increasing, and rises much faster beyond 1.5℃ of global heating – a threshold we could hit as early as 2030 should emissions continue unchecked. Such shocks pose grave threats – rocketing food prices, civil unrest, major financial losses, starvation and death. The most worrying thing about all of this is that compared to long- and medium-term climate models, we know relatively little about just how fragile the various parts of our clockwork global economy are in the near-term. By the UN’s admission, for example, the way we model the effects of crop failure is no longer viable. We urgently need to better understand how our human systems will respond to shock events, which will occur with ever more frequency and severity as the climate destabilises further. Above all, much more prominence must be given to experts in systems, food security, migration, energy transitions, supply chains and security, to develop our understanding of short-term responses within society. In particular, we need a better handle on how trigger events such as food price spikes, droughts or forest fires, overlay onto the most vulnerable and politically unstable countries. As for our response to these locked-in threats, we must ask more immediate questions than what sort of society we want in the future given that we may have already lost control of the Earth’s climate. We need to treat people as citizens and not consumers, as active participants in the shaping of how our near future navigates impending climate shocks. And with those least culpable and least prepared most in the firing line, international justice and equity must be at the forefront of these discussions. These are not distant existential issues raised by uncertain and abstract models of future climatic risk. They are urgent questions that humanity has been ducking for decades, but now demand urgent answers. Click here to subscribe to our climate action newsletter. Climate change is inevitable.

We had such high hopes for Boris: Someone who could finally rescue the UK from the EU and make Great Britain great again. Unfortunately, having rescued the Brits from the Eurocrats just a few days later **Boris Johnson** has thrown the Brits on to the economic scrap heap of the Green Utopia.



The Prime Minister will today, Tuesday 4 February, launch the next UN climate conference COP26, joined by Sir David Attenborough and Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte at an event in central London.



Once you have hitched your wagon to **David Attenborough** , it is all over.



At the event, he will set out the UK’s position as a world leader in the response to climate change, having made a legal commitment to achieve net zero emissions, and call all nations to strive towards this goal.



Sorry, Boris, Ardern and Shaw have already assumed the mantle of “world leader in response to climate change”. You will have to be content with “an also ran leader.”



Prime Minister Boris Johnson said:



“ _Hosting COP26 is an important opportunity for the UK and nations across the globe to step up in the fight against climate change. As we set out our plans to hit our ambitious 2050 net zero target across this year, so we shall urge others to join us in pledging net zero emissions._



 _There can be no greater responsibility than protecting our planet, and no mission that a Global Britain is prouder to serve. 2020 must be the year we turn the tide on global warming– it will be the year when we choose a cleaner, greener future for all._ “



The Prime Minister will use the speech to call for international efforts to reach net zero as early as possible through investment in cleaner, greener technology, preservation of our natural habitat and measures to improve resilience to climate change impact.



At the event, which will also be attended by Sir David Attenborough, the Prime Minister will reinforce his commitment to tackling climate change and biodiversity loss simultaneously, recognising the important role of the restoration of nature in his vision.



Demonstrating the UK’s urgent action to reduce emissions, the Government plans to bring forward an end to the sale of new petrol and diesel cars and vans to 2035, or earlier if a faster transition is feasible, subject to consultation, **as well as including hybrids for the first time**. […]



Oh dear, all the smug hybrid owners will have to join the ranks of the damned ICE owners.



I wonder how the UK breeding programme for the flying pigs is getting on? The UK is going to need quite a few to haul the planes of the future.



First, it was the man’s man Harry getting emasculated by Megan and now it is Boris being told what to do by his live-in girlfriend:



Boris Johnson’s partner [C](https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/carrie-symonds)arrie Symonds said politicians had a “gigantic responsibility to make the right decisions” over the climate crisis, in her first solo public appearance since moving into Downing Street.

"President Trump has carried his Twitter habit into his presidency. He has also brought with him another tech habit that is causing concern. Mr. Trump has been using  his old, unsecured Android phone to post on Twitter since moving to Washington late last week. The president’s desire to use his old, personal smartphone raises concerns that its use could be exposing him and the nation to security threats. He is using the Android smartphone mainly to post on Twitter, not to make calls. But it’s unclear what security measures have been put in place on the device and how vulnerable he could be to someone stealing data or breaking into his Twitter account. The White House did not respond to a request for comment. Twitter requires a connection to the internet, which exposes the device to security vulnerabilities if proper measures like   authentication  —   a password and a code texted to a phone, for example  —   are not in place. If he uses the smartphone on an unsecure   network, he could be exposing his location and other personal information on the device. “The absolutely minimum Trump could do to protect our nation is to use a secure device to protect him from foreign spies and other threats,” said Senator Ron Wyden, a Democrat from Oregon on the Intelligence Committee. “It would be irresponsible in the extreme for the commander in chief to use an unsecure device that could be easily hacked or intercepted. ” Among the concerns by security experts: ■ It is unclear if the device and its functions like texting are encrypted to thwart hacking. ■ The device could be more vulnerable to hacking if used on unsecured   and cellular networks, such as when Mr. Trump travels between meetings or anywhere outside the White House. ■ Hackers could access the device to turn on the camera and microphone. ■ Stingray devices, a type of surveillance tool often used by law enforcement, can track a device’s location and other information. “There are a lot of questions, but it is clear there are often vulnerabilities in our phones and internet systems  —   and it is critical that people take precautions to ensure their sensitive information is protected from hackers and other malicious actors,” said Neema Singh Guliani, legislative counsel with the American Civil Liberties Union. The president’s use of the personal device is particularly notable given his criticism of Hillary Clinton for using a personal email address and server when she was secretary of state. In 2009, President Barack Obama fought to become the first president with a smartphone though he won, the use of a White   secure device came with many rules. “As president, he is the biggest sitting target in the world,” said Kevin Bankston, the director of New America’s Open Technology Institute."
"Donald J. Trump spent his first week in office repeating the lie that between three million and five million people had voted illegally in the November election, first to members of Congress, then on Twitter, then in an ABC News interview, then again on Twitter on Friday, citing an unsubstantiated claim popular in conspiracy circles. On Wednesday, Mr. Trump had announced in a pair of tweets that he would be asking for a “major investigation” into voter fraud, “including those registered to vote in two states. ” Since then, a variety of news organizations have found that several members of Mr. Trump’s inner circle were registered in more than one state during the election. Several still are. There is no evidence that any of them voted twice. • Steve Bannon, Mr. Trump’s strategist, was registered to vote in Florida and New York, the Sarasota   found. • Tiffany Trump, Mr. Trump’s youngest daughter, was registered in Pennsylvania and New York, NBC News reported. • Sean Spicer, his press secretary, was registered in both Virginia and Rhode Island, according to The Washington Post. • Jared Kushner, his    and close adviser, was registered in New York and New Jersey, according to The Washington Post. • Steven Mnuchin, who is nominated to lead the Treasury Department, was registered in New York and California, CNN found. Not really. Have you ever moved to a new state? And did you call up the people in charge of voting in your old state to tell them to go ahead and take you off their list? Probably not. Neither, apparently, did some members of the Trump family and his White House. “There is nothing illegal about that,” Fred Voigt, the deputy election commissioner for Philadelphia, told Heat Street, the News Corp.  conservative and libertarian site, which reported Ms. Trump’s double registration. “The illegality only occurs if one votes in two places, not if you’re registered in both. ” State authorities regularly purge their voter rolls of people who move or die. Mr. Bannon’s case is a little different. A Guardian report last summer found that Mr. Bannon was registered at a vacant home he had previously rented for his   but that he had never lived there himself. Shortly after that report, the Guardian said, Mr. Bannon changed his registered address to the home of a Breitbart writer, also in Florida. When he voted in November’s election, he did so by absentee ballot in New York, a spokesman for the state Board of Elections confirmed. On Wednesday, after widespread news reports of his double registration, Sarasota County removed Mr. Bannon from the rolls, The Herald Tribune reported. As the reports of double registrations grew, Kellyanne Conway, one of Mr. Trump’s senior advisers, appeared on NBC’s “Today” show on Thursday and denied that members of Mr. Trump’s inner circle were registered in more than one place. “I talked last night to Tiffany Trump, and she said it is flatly false that she is registered in two states,” she said. But NBC had confirmed that Ms. Trump, in fact, was."
"The health and wellbeing of humans is underpinned by the natural world. Living nature in the form of ecosystems and biodiversity is the world’s life support system. It is crucial, but under threat.  Equally important, but less discussed, is non-living nature or “geodiversity”. This includes rocks, soils, water and landforms. Our new research discusses how all of nature – including the non-living – must be explicitly considered in policy if a sustainable world is to be achieved. Nature is complicated and interconnected. The ecosystems, geosystems and climate conditions upon which humans and all other species rely are intricately related to one another. For scientists to understand these systems, they must monitor them consistently across the world and through time. This allows change to be detected and communicated so that suitable policies and laws can be created and enforced. Society needs this interconnected system to work properly to protect endangered and dwindling resources. By failing to sufficiently account for geodiversity alongside other aspects of nature, society will fail to protect the very systems that are needed for a sustainable and habitable planet. Our study discusses how, despite severe threats and widespread changes, geodiversity is being overlooked in policy and international conventions. One problem is that we simply don’t have sufficient information to assess changes in geodiversity and associated resources on global and national scales because everyone measures it differently – if at all – and geodiversity data is not shared internationally. That is why we are building a database of “Essential Geodiversity Variables” (EGVs) to help better monitor the Earth’s fragile geosystems.  Geodiversity relates to the physical land surface and subsurface of the planet and its spectacular array of processes and materials. Rocks, fossils, minerals and soil play a hugely important role, as does hydrology in the form of oceans, lakes, rivers and groundwater. Landforms such as hills, valleys, mountains and geomorphological processes (such as weathering and erosion) also make up Earth’s geodiversity. It is a key component of the natural world, alongside biodiversity and the climate. It provides a range of things humans need, from the rare elements required to make our smartphones and renewable energy technology, to the soil that is needed to grow crops. It makes up the rocks that filter our water and the landscapes that support our ecosystems. But key elements of geodiversity are widely over-exploited and internationally under-regulated. This results in damage to geosystems and ecosystems and even violates human rights. While the perils and ubiquity of over-exploitation of freshwater are relatively well known, others are less obvious. For example, forests are threatened by sapphire mining in Madagascar and bauxite extraction in Ghana.  Such mining activities can increase local conflict. This was the case in eastern Congo where global trends in mineral prices are thought to have increased armed clashes around mines digging for gold and “3T minerals” (tin, tungsten, and tantalum). These minerals are required for manufacturing the electronic products that have become so fundamental in our lives. It is not just mining that can have negative impacts, though. Over-exploitation of soil is a global problem – more than half of all fertile topsoil has been lost in the past 150 years amid widespread degradation. Meanwhile, sand has been considered a virtually infinite resource by many and extraction is not regulated internationally. But over-exploitation of sand for construction is now recognised as a crisis. Our research around the sustainability of geodiversity builds on the growing body of work from geologists and others including Iain Stewart and Joel Gill and Jose Brilha). This work highlights the fundamental importance of geodiversity in sustainable resource use and overall human wellbeing. Threats to geodiversity are not only relevant in relation to the physical resources that humans need, but also to biodiversity and ecosystem services – the benefits that humans reap from nature. For example, in Great Britain and Finland, geodiversity has helped us understand patterns of biodiversity by linking threatened, native and alien plant species richness to landforms, geology and geomorphology. This relationship is fundamental, given that geodiversity and biodiversity underlay many ecosystem services. These services, such as carbon storage, groundwater production and crop production, directly affect human wellbeing. Areas with high geodiversity are also likely to be very important for biodiversity conservation as the global climate changes. Indeed, geodiverse areas provide a wide variety of environmental features that can support many different species and act as buffer against environmental changes. Our Essential Geodiversity Variables (EGVs) framework follows on from similar approaches for biodiversity, climate, oceans and sustainable development goals. These all aim to provide the tools and data necessary to effectively and consistently monitor important aspects of the world. In doing so, these frameworks make the information accessible to policymakers, stakeholders and the public. Following these guidelines and using the tools developed will ensure that the information we collect allows us to reliably spot and research change. We can then plan and respond accordingly. By combining measurements on the ground with the vast amounts of remote sensing data from satellites, aeroplanes and drones we are now able to map and track the world’s geodiversity in space and time. EGVs therefore inform us about the Earth’s surface and sub-surface and how these are changing. For example, how much sand is there in a given place and how is the volume changing? How quickly is soil eroding? How are groundwater resources changing in quantity and quality? Our forthcoming website will provide information on how to collect EGV data and provide case studies and a platform for interaction. This monitoring is vital for scientists and decision makers across a whole range of fields and marks a huge step forward in terms of effectively measuring the non-living but essential natural resources on our planet."
"An environmental campaigner is mounting a legal challenge to the government’s decision to exclude waste incinerators from its post-Brexit carbon emissions trading scheme designed to bring the UK to net zero emissions by 2050. Georgia Elliott-Smith, a sustainability consultant who is fighting the expansion of the Edmonton incinerator, is seeking a judicial review of the omission of what legal papers say are “staggering” levels of CO2 emissions from waste incinerators.  Lawyers acting for Elliott-Smith claim in a letter to the government that the failure to include millions of tonnes of carbon emissions from waste incinerators is unlawful. They argue that in drawing up its new carbon trading scheme – the first since the UK left the EU – ministers have not considered the Paris agreement requirement to reduce emissions as soon as possible. They draw parallels with the victory of Friends of the Earth, who successfully argued the government decision to allow the expansion of Heathrow airport was unlawful because it  failed to consider the Paris agreement. Elliott-Smith, who is crowdfunding to pay the legal fees, said: “I’m tired of pollution filling the lungs of my children, suffocating those that live in poorer, more industrial parts of the country. “I’m tired of incinerators claiming to be environmentally friendly while they pour out greenhouse gases that are destroying the planet.” The letter of action from Leigh Day solicitors sent to the business secretary, Alok Sharma, quotes the government’s own figures and those of the campaign group United Kingdom Without Incineration Network, which calculate that the 48 waste incinerators operating in 2019 were responsible for 6.6m tonnes of CO2 emissions from fossil fuel sources. “That’s the same as all the emissions from Birmingham and Manchester put together,” said Elliott-Smith. “Worse, a further 17 incinerators are under construction and dozens more are seeking planning permission.” While power stations and landfill site operators have to pay tax to incentivise them to reduce pollution, incinerator operators do not have to pay tax on disposal of waste or for their CO2 emissions. It was revealed this month that waste incinerators are three times as likely to be situated in areas of deprivation, where higher numbers of people from ethnic minorities live, than in affluent mostly white areas. Elliott-Smith said she was taking legal action after spending a year campaigning to get MPs, incinerator operators and local councils to implement better ways of dealing with rubbish. “They are just not listening,” she said. “As an environmental engineer I know that there are cleaner, greener ways to reduce, reuse and recycle materials that make a fairer society for everyone.” The amount of waste collected by local authorities in England and then incinerated increased from 12.1% of waste in 2008-9 to 43.8% in 2018-19. Elliott-Smith argues that is because government policies make it cheaper to burn waste. She said: “Brexit means the UK government is rewriting environmental policies, but incineration is excluded from the new UK emissions trading scheme, a crucial way to manage and reduce CO2. Ignoring incineration – simply because it’s cheaper – will be disastrous.” Lawyers for Elliott-Smith argue the government has failed to consider the pressing need to reduce emissions “as soon as possible”, as required in the Paris agreement to significantly reduce the risks and impacts of climate change, as distinct from achieving net zero emissions by 2050. The letter says the consequences of this failure are particularly acute in relation to the decision to exclude municipal waste incinerators from the new emissions trading scheme. “This will mean that huge volumes of emissions are ignored by the scheme and there will be no mechanism to account for, offset, or incentivise the reduction of emissions from incinerators. The scale of these ignored incinerator emissions is staggering,” said a Leigh Day spokesperson. “The emissions from fossil sources are particularly important, as these are emissions that would not be emitted through other forms of waste disposal: plastic waste stored in landfill does not break down and release greenhouse gas emissions for an extremely long time, while recycling similarly ensures the carbon stored within the fossil sources is not emitted in the short to medium-term.” A spokesperson for the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy said: “It is not appropriate to comment on the specifics of potential legal challenges.”"
"When a major study was published last month, showing that the global population is likely to peak then crash much sooner than most scientists had assumed, I naively imagined that people in rich nations would at last stop blaming all the world’s environmental problems on population growth. I was wrong. If anything, it appears to have got worse. Next week the BirthStrike movement – founded by women who, by announcing their decision not to have children, seek to focus our minds on the horror of environmental collapse – will dissolve itself, because its cause has been hijacked so virulently and persistently by population obsessives. The founders explain that they had “underestimated the power of ‘overpopulation’ as a growing form of climate breakdown denial”.  It is true that, in some parts of the world, population growth is a major driver of particular kinds of ecological damage, such as the expansion of small-scale agriculture into rainforests, the bushmeat trade and local pressure on water and land for housing. But its global impact is much smaller than many people claim. The formula for calculating people’s environmental footprint is simple, but widely misunderstood: Impact = Population x Affluence x Technology (I = PAT). The global rate of consumption growth, before the pandemic, was 3% a year. Population growth is 1%. Some people assume this means that the rise in population bears one-third of the responsibility for increased consumption. But population growth is overwhelmingly concentrated among the world’s poorest people, who have scarcely any A or T to multiply their P. The extra resource use and greenhouse gas emissions caused by a rising human population are a tiny fraction of the impact of consumption growth. Yet it is widely used as a blanket explanation of environmental breakdown. Panic about population growth enables the people most responsible for the impacts of rising consumption (the affluent) to blame those who are least responsible. At this year’s World Economic Forum in Davos, the primatologist Dame Jane Goodall, who is a patron of the charity Population Matters, told the assembled pollutocrats, some of whom have ecological footprints thousands of times greater than the global average: “All these things we talk about wouldn’t be a problem if there was the size of population that there was 500 years ago.” I doubt that any of those who nodded and clapped were thinking, “yes, I urgently need to disappear”. In 2019, Goodall appeared in an advertisement for British Airways, whose customers produce more greenhouse gas emissions on one flight than many of the world’s people generate in a year. If we had the global population of 500 years ago (around 500 million), and if it were composed of average UK plane passengers, our environmental impact would probably be greater than that of the 7.8 billion alive today. She proposed no mechanism by which her dream might come true. This could be the attraction. The very impotence of her call is reassuring to those who don’t want change. If the answer to environmental crisis is to wish other people away, we might as well give up and carry on consuming. The excessive emphasis on population growth has a grim history. Since the clergymen Joseph Townsend and Thomas Malthus wrote their tracts in the 18th century, poverty and hunger have been blamed not on starvation wages, war, misrule and wealth extraction by the rich, but on the reproduction rates of the poor. Winston Churchill blamed the Bengal famine of 1943, that he helped to cause through the mass export of India’s rice, on the Indians “breeding like rabbits”. In 2013 Sir David Attenborough, also a patron of Population Matters, wrongly blamed famines in Ethiopia on “too many people for too little land”, and suggested that sending food aid was counter-productive. Another of the charity’s patrons, Paul Ehrlich, whose incorrect predictions about mass famine helped to provoke the current population panic, once argued that the US should “coerce” India into “sterilising all Indian males with three or more children”, by making food aid conditional on this policy. This proposal was similar to the brutal programme that Indira Gandhi later introduced, with financial support from the UN and the World Bank. Foreign aid from the UK was funding crude and dangerous sterilisation in India as recently as 2011, on the grounds that this policy was helping to “fight climate change”. Some of the victims of this programme allege that they were forced to participate. At the same time, the UK government was pouring billions of pounds of aid into developing coal, gas and oil plants, in India and other nations. It blamed the poor for the crisis it was helping to cause. Malthusianism slides easily into racism. Most of the world’s population growth is happening in the poorest countries, where most people are black or brown. The colonial powers justified their atrocities by fomenting a moral panic about “barbaric”, “degenerate” people “outbreeding” the “superior races”. These claims have been revived today by the far right, who promote conspiracy theories about “white replacement” and “white genocide”. When affluent white people wrongly transfer the blame for their environmental impacts on to the birthrate of much poorer brown and black people, their finger-pointing reinforces these narratives. It is inherently racist. The far right now uses the population argument to contest immigration into the US and the UK. This too has a grisly heritage: the pioneering conservationist Madison Grant promoted, alongside his environmental work, the idea that the “Nordic master race” was being “overtaken” in the US by “worthless race types”. As president of the Immigration Restriction League, he helped to engineer the vicious 1924 Immigration Act. But, as there are some genuine ecological impacts of population growth, how do we distinguish proportionate concerns about these harms from deflection and racism? Well, we know that the strongest determinant of falling birth rates is female emancipation and education. The major obstacle to female empowerment is extreme poverty. Its effect is felt disproportionately by women. So a good way of deciding whether someone’s population concerns are genuine is to look at their record of campaigning against structural poverty. Have they contested the impossible debts poor nations are required to pay? Have they argued against corporate tax avoidance, or extractive industries that drain wealth from poorer countries, leaving almost nothing behind, or the financial sector in Britain’s processing of money stolen abroad? Or have they simply sat and watched as people remain locked in poverty, then complained about their fertility? Before long, this reproductive panic will disappear. Nations will soon be fighting over immigrants: not to exclude them, but to attract them, as the demographic transition leaves their ageing populations with a shrinking tax base and a dearth of key workers. Until then, we should resist attempts by the rich to demonise the poor. • George Monbiot is a Guardian columnist • A response to this column from Population Matters is published here."
"**Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam has been forced to suspend her annual address after being heckled in parliament.**
Opposition lawmakers disrupted the Legislative Council session by shouting and projecting slogans behind her.
After a first interruption, the session resumed only to be interrupted again. It was then suspended - and Ms Lam delivered the address by video instead.
It means the extradition bill - the trigger for months of protests - could not be withdrawn formally.
The bill was suspended in July, but Wednesday's meeting was the first time the Legislative Council (Legco) had resumed since it was stormed by protesters in July, and was the first opportunity to withdraw the bill altogether.
But as Chief Executive Lam was about to begin her speech, opposition lawmakers began shouting and climbing on tables.
They also projected the words ""Five demands - not one less"" on the wall behind her. Since the protests began, they have widened from rallies against the bill to five key demands - including universal suffrage.
Opposition lawmaker Tanya Chan said Ms Lam was to blame for the Hong Kong's troubles.
""Both her hands are soaked with blood,"" she said. ""We hope Carrie Lam withdraws and quits. She has no governance ability. She is not suitable to be chief executive.""
It was the first time a Hong Kong chief executive had been unable to deliver a policy address in the chamber.
Pro-establishment lawmakers condemned the interruption of the session - saying the address was important for Hong Kong's economic future.
After the assembly was suspended, a pre-recorded speech was made available on the Legco website instead.
In the address, Ms Lam stressed her commitment to ""one country, two systems"" - the parallel political system introduced in Hong Kong after British rule ended - and said calls for Hong Kong independence would not be tolerated.
She announced several housing and infrastructure policies, saying housing was the most urgent issue the city faces.
In a news conference after the address, Ms Lam rejected claims that her speech ignored the demands of the protest movement.
But she said it was not the time to consider voting reform, while insisting Hong Kong did have freedom of speech and freedom of the press without Chinese interference.
The developments came just hours after Hong Kong protesters won a show of support from US lawmakers, who passed a bill aimed at upholding human rights in the city.
Carrie Lam hoped this moment might signal the beginning of the end for Hong Kong's political crisis.
The cover page of her policy address was bright blue, she said, to represent the clear skies ahead. But the first full session of Hong Kong's parliament since it was stormed by protesters in July was cut short.
Other leaders in other places might have faced them down. But Hong Kong's limited form of democracy doesn't produce that kind of pugilistic politician, able to appeal over the heads of opponents to the public at large.
Which is of course the central point at the heart of the deep divisions splitting this society apart.
The tightly-managed political system seen as a source of stability and strength by supporters - like the ruling Communist Party in Beijing - is seen as a threat and a fundamental weakness for those taking to the streets to argue against it.
Hong Kong is part of China but, as a former British colony, has some autonomy and people have more rights.
The protests started in June against plans to allow extradition to the mainland - which many feared would undermine the city's freedoms and judicial independence.
The government in September promised the bill would be withdrawn once parliament resumed but demonstrations continued.
Demands have since widened into five key demands:
In a conversation with the EU representative in Hong Kong earlier this week, Ms Lam reportedly ruled out even debating universal suffrage in the current climate.
Protests have taken place every weekend over the past month and in every district, causing widespread disruption.
Clashes between police and activists have become increasingly violent, with police firing live bullets and protesters attacking officers and throwing petrol bombs.
Ms Lam's address was scheduled just days after Chinese President Xi Jinping said any attempt to divide China would end in ""bodies smashed and bones ground to powder"" - comments seen as an implicit warning to Hong Kong."

"Words matter. And from the moment he became president, Donald J. Trump has unleashed so many of consequence that the public has barely had time to parse their full implication. Words about the dishonest media, the end of Obamacare, the construction of that border wall with Mexico  —   this is an abbreviated list, and he hasn’t even completed his first week in office. Amid the verbal deluge, President Trump this week repeated an assertion he made shortly after his election: that millions of ballots cast illegally by undocumented immigrants cost him the popular vote. If true, this would suggest the wholesale corruption of American democracy. Not to worry: As far as anyone knows, the president’s assertion is akin to saying that millions of unicorns also voted illegally. But such a baseless statement by a president challenged the news media to find the precise words to describe it. This will be a recurring challenge, given President Trump’s habit of speaking in   hyperbole and his tendency to deride any    report as “fake news. ” The words needed to be exactly right. “And the language has a rich vocabulary for describing statements that fall short of the truth,” said Geoffrey Nunberg, a linguist who teaches at the University of California, Berkeley, School of Information. “They’re ‘baseless,’ they’re ‘bogus,’ they’re ‘lies,’ they’re ‘untruths. ’” Rarely are these words, each with its own nuance, applied directly to something said by a president, though others have also dissembled (like Bill Clinton on whether he had sex with an intern). “This is the very unique situation that we find ourselves in as journalists and as a country,” said Joshua Benton, the director of the Nieman Journalism Lab at Harvard University. “We have an administration that seems to be asserting a right to its own facts and doesn’t seem to be able to produce evidence to back those claims. ” Still, carefully chosen words can capture that. “A whole vocabulary has come bubbling up that would not have been used five years ago,” Mr. Nunberg said in an interview. “People are going to have to sit down and decide: Are we going to want to go over the moral consequences of telling an untruth? The mere fact of it being untrue? Or the fact that it’s bogus, baseless or groundless?” Some news organizations used words like “falsely” or “wrongly”  —   adverbs that tend to weaken the impact  —   in framing what the president said. Some used “with no evidence,” or “won’t provide any proof,” or “unverified claims,” or “repeats debunked claim. ” The New York Times, though, ultimately chose more muscular terminology, opting to use the word “lie” in the headline. After initially using the word “falsely,” it switched to “lie” online and then settled on “Meeting With Top Lawmakers, Trump Repeats an Election Lie” for Tuesday’s print edition. People noticed, and debated its use. That is because, from the childhood schoolyard to the grave, this is a word neither used nor taken lightly. It stands apart from most other terms in the linguistic ballpark of untruths, including “falsehood,” which Chuck Todd, the host of “Meet the Press,” recently used to counter the Trump adviser Kellyanne Conway’s Orwellian phrase, “alternative facts. ” To say that someone has “lied,” an active verb, or has told a “lie,” a more passive, distancing noun, is to say that the person intended to deceive. In addition, Mr. Nunberg said, “a certain moral opprobrium attaches to it, a reprehensibility of motive. ” The question of intent has informed National Public Radio’s approach to covering Mr. Trump’s many disputable claims: that he saw thousands of people in Jersey City cheering as the World Trade Center collapsed on Sept. 11, for example, or that the news media had made up a feud between him and the country’s intelligence agencies, despite his own tweets likening those agencies to Nazi Germany. On NPR’s “Morning Edition” on Wednesday, Mary Louise Kelly explained that she had looked up the definition of “lie” in the Oxford English Dictionary. “A false statement made with intent to deceive,” Ms. Kelly said. “Intent being the key word there. Without the ability to peer into Donald Trump’s head, I can’t tell you what his intent was. I can tell you what he said and how that squares, or doesn’t, with facts. ” Michael Oreskes, NPR’s senior president for news, supported the decision. In an article on the NPR website, Mr. Oreskes said that “the minute you start branding things with a word like ‘lie,’ you push people away from you. ” The inherent risk, he suggested, was that news organizations would be seen as taking sides. Editors at The Times also consulted dictionaries. And they had some prior experience with the matter, having approved the use of the L word once before in reference to Mr. Trump. In September, when he grandly announced the findings of a yearslong   investigation into what nearly everyone else never doubted  —   “President Obama was born in the United States, period”  —   The Times published a Page 1 article with the headline “Trump Gives Up a Lie but Refuses to Repent. ” Dean Baquet, the executive editor of The Times, said that he learned of Mr. Trump’s latest comments in a text message from an editor on Monday night. After consulting with other top editors, he decided that the use of “lie” was warranted. For Mr. Baquet, the question of intent was resolved, given that Mr. Trump had made the same assertion two months earlier through his preferred mode of communication, the tweet: “In addition to winning the Electoral College in a landslide, I won the popular vote if you deduct the millions of people who voted illegally. ” (Nota bene: The tweet actually contains what might be considered two untruths  —   or falsehoods, or erroneous assertions, or bogus claims  —   since Mr. Trump’s victory was no landslide, but among the closer elections in American history.) Mr. Baquet said he fully understood the gravity of using the word “lie,” whether in reference to an average citizen or to the president of the United States. He emphasized that it should be used sparingly, partly because the term carries such negative connotations, and partly so that it does not lose potency. “On the other hand, we should be letting people know in no uncertain terms that it’s untrue,” Mr. Baquet said, referring to the president’s assertion of a   epidemic. “He repeated it without a single grain of evidence, and it’s a very powerful statement about the electoral system. ” Mr. Baquet said that emails from readers seemed split on the appropriateness of the word’s use. Meanwhile, Mr. Benton, of the Nieman Journalism Lab, applauded its use as a noun in the Times headline (“Trump Repeats an Election Lie”) in this construction, he said, “the lie can exist as a reality distinct from the speaker’s intention. ” Over all, the tension between the Trump administration and much of the mainstream media is  —   what’s the word? Troubling, according to Sara Brady, a   specialist based in Florida. She says that a complete breakdown of the already fractious relationship affects everyone. “The media run the risk of being disrespectful to the president of the United States,” she said. “But the problem is: If he doesn’t get called out in some way, we as Americans are never going to know what’s true and what’s not. ” In other words: Words matter."
"Two potential hurricanes are heading towards the northern Caribbean and mainland United States – with a third building in the Atlantic – in apparent confirmation of meteorologists’ predictions that the 2020 Atlantic hurricane season will become one of the worst on record.  The largest of the three, Tropical Storm Laura, was named on Friday, breaking the record for the earliest use of the letter L in a storm name in the region. Forecasts said it poses a potential hurricane threat to the US and British Virgin Islands, Puerto Rico, Hispaniola, Cuba and possibly southern Florida in the coming days. The US Gulf coast may be hit by two storms next week as Laura curves north towards Louisiana and another, Tropical Storm Marco, pushes north from the Yucatan peninsula. “I’m usually pretty measured, calm and I avoid hyping things when it comes to tropical storms and hurricanes,” said Rob Lightbown of subscription forecast service Crownweather.com. “But I’m as worried right now as I have ever been regarding the forecast for the rest of the season.” Mid-August to mid-September is considered the peak of Atlantic hurricane season, the period in which powerful storms most regularly develop as they cross the Atlantic. Earlier this month, meteorologists unexpectedly increased their predictions of an “extremely active” season from a 60% chance to 85%. The United States National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration (Noaa) now says the number of named storms could be between 19 and 25 – well above the yearly average of 12. They blame extremely warm seas, unusually moist air and low winds in the upper atmosphere, estimating the amount of Accumulated Cyclone Energy (ACE), an indicator of overall storm potential, to have risen from twice the usual average to between 140% and 230%. The pandemic is a complicating factor. Some scientists say that reduced air traffic is affecting forecasts, as fewer planes are now collating weather information. “I do think this year’s reduced weather data from commercial aircraft has made a big difference,” said Lightbown. In small Caribbean islands and large cities on the mainland, the threat of hurricanes is increasing pressure on emergency systems already strained by Covid 19.  In the British Virgin Islands, a tiny archipelago in the north-east Caribbean with a population of just 30,000, the dangers of hurricanes are well known after category 5 Hurricane Irma devastated the islands in 2017. “We’ve been giving out storm warnings earlier this year,” said Crystal Kanyuck-Abel, spokeswoman for the BVI Department of Disaster Management. “Because of Covid-19, we want to nudge people to act sooner and thereby reduce the dangers from everyone preparing at the last minute.” So far, the BVI has seen just 12 cases of Covid-19, compared with almost 600,000 in southern Florida. New storm shelter protocols in the BVI, Jamaica and other Caribbean islands closely resemble those of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, but authorities across the region will probably be forced to improvise. “We’ll give out masks and sanitiser, and screen everyone on entry,” says Kanyuck-Abel. “We’ve increased distances between beds, placing sleepers head-to-toe to decrease chances of air particle exchange, and created separation areas for those showing possible symptoms so health authorities can decide whether to isolate them further.” In Florida, several areas most at risk from hurricanes have also seen high coronavirus caseloads, and mass evacuations are likely to lead not only to crowding, but mass movements of potential carriers. “For counties that may be receiving evacuees, authorities should now be thinking about how to maintain the safety of the evacuees and the host population,” said Kristina Dahl, co-author of a recent study by Columbia University and the Union of Concerned Scientists (UCS) looking at the potential impact of evacuation from southern Florida on Covid-19 numbers if a category 3 hurricane were to hit. Using survey data gathered after Hurricane Irma in 2017, and comparing them with recent Covid-19 transmission rates, the study found that evacuation would lead to between 9,100 and 61,000 new coronavirus cases. “The more we can do to keep evacuees from transmitting the virus to one another – housing evacuees in relatively private settings, mandating the use of face masks, and encouraging social distancing – the better off we’ll be after the storm passes,” said Dahl."
"**The UN and Ethiopia have agreed to allow aid into the country's conflict-torn Tigray region, UN officials say.**
UN spokesman Saviano Abreu says an assessment mission will begin later on Wednesday. There has been no word so far from the Ethiopian government.
Food and medicines are said to be running out for millions of people.
Hundreds of people have reportedly been killed in the month-long fighting between the federal army and the Tigray People's Liberation Front (TPLF).
The Ethiopian government said the regional capital Mekelle was seized over the weekend.
But TPLF soldiers said they were still fighting near the city.
Thousands of people have been displaced.
In a separate development, the Ethiopian authorities said one of the most senior TPLF figures had surrendered. Keriya Ibrahim is the former speaker of the regional parliament.
The TPLF has not publicly commented on the issue.
The UN will have ""unimpeded"" access to deliver aid to the government-held areas of Tigray, news agencies report.
UN humanitarian spokesman Saviano Abreu is quoted by the Associated Press as saying that the first mission to carry out a needs assessment is starting on Wednesday after the agreement was signed this week.
""We are of course working to make sure assistance will be provided in the whole region and for every single person who needs it,"" Mr Abreu said.
Separately, a UN source told Reuters the organisation had established a logistics group with the government to ensure access.
However, the government in Addis Ababa is yet to confirm the deal has been reached.
Among those in need of urgent aid in Tigray are thousands of refugees from neighbouring Eritrea. They fled political persecution and compulsory military service.
Meanwhile, communications have been fully restored in Alamata - a town on the south-eastern tip of Tigray. But towns in the western parts of the region saw only partial restoration of the services.
Communications blackouts since the start of the fighting have made it difficult to verify claims and counterclaims by the rival sides.
The TPLF dominated Ethiopia's military and political life for decades before PM Abiy Ahmed took office in 2018 and pushed through major reforms.
Last year, Mr Ahmed dissolved the ruling coalition, made up of several ethnically based regional parties, and merged them into a single, national party, which the TPLF refused to join.
The feud escalated in September, when Tigray held a regional election, defying a nationwide ban on all polls imposed because of the coronavirus pandemic. Mr Abiy responded by calling the vote illegal.
The TPLF sees Mr Abiy's reforms as an attempt to hand his central government more power and weaken regional states.
It also resents what it calls the prime minister's ""unprincipled"" friendship with Eritrean President Isaias Afwerki.
Mr Abiy won the Nobel Peace Prize in 2019 for his efforts to bring peace with Eritrea.
The prime minister believes TPLF officials are undermining his authority.

Economist Jeffrey Sachs of Columbia University recently made this claim (emphasis mine):   




“We’re so rich in our total production and in our capacities to do things that we could solve absolutely fundamental challenges, such as ending extreme poverty or addressing climate change or preserving biodiversity without much effort … it cannot be the most important issue in the world whether the U.S. grows at another 3% or 3.5% or 2.9% a year, when **over the last 65 years there’s been no discernible rise in wellbeing** ”



That is the theme of his new book, _The Origins of Happiness_.   
  
By “we” Sachs appears to mean the U.S. and other rich countries and calls for their governments to engage in wealth transfers to poor countries and a plethora of environmental projects. What he does not seem to realize is that humanity is already making swift progress—through the free actions of billions of individuals—toward ending poverty and better preserving the environment.



As global GDP per person has skyrocketed, global poverty has plummeted. Fewer people live in extreme poverty than ever before, both as a share of the population and in absolute terms. In other words, although there are more people alive, the number of people living in extreme poverty is lower than it has even been. If current trends continue, extreme poverty will be practically eliminated by 2030.   
  
After China liberalized its economy, hundreds of millions of its people escaped extreme poverty. Once India moved towards economic freedom in the early 1990s, its population saw a remarkable decline in poverty as well. It’s tempting to want to make this story about “us” in the U.S. and other rich countries acting as saviors for the global poor, but the reality is that people in the developing world are lifting themselves out of poverty wherever they have the economic freedom to do so. In contrast, no country has ever become rich through foreign aid, which is plagued by many problems.   
  
As incomes rise and people move past worries of basic survival, more of them come to care about the environment. Technological progress is also helping to improve environmental stewardship, by boosting agricultural yields per hectare of land and increasing water productivity, among other things. We are now witnessing numerous trends that give cause for environmental optimism, from expanding forest area in China to falling emissions in the United States.   
  
Once again, Sachs’ well-meaning call for state intervention seems misguided. The U.S. emits less CO2 today not because of EPA regulations or costly subsidies for unreliable wind and solar energy, but because the market delivered a technological breakthrough (hydraulic fracturing) that reduced reliance on more polluting energy sources.   
  
Despite Sachs’ protests, there _has_ been a discernible rise in wellbeing over the last 65 years. Even the amount of progress achieved just in my own lifetime is astounding. Sachs’ book presents data suggesting that higher incomes and better education do not heighten people’s happiness as much as sound health and strong interpersonal relationships do. From this he concludes that despite being richer and better educated, people today are not any better off than their fore-bearers.   
  
Actually, even in terms of health and interconnectedness, we are still better off today. Consider health. Life expectancy is at an all-time high. More infants survive to see their first birthday and more mothers survive childbirth. Cancer takes the lives of fewer men and women. We lose fewer lives to droughts, hurricanes, lightning, tornadoes and extreme temperatures. Safety advances also mean fewer traffic fatalities and fewer fatal plane crashes. Infectious diseases that were once common causes of death have been defeated by better treatment and prevention methods.   
  
As for relationships, despite having more disposable income, today people work less and enjoy more leisure time to spend with loved ones. In 1950, an average American worker worked 1,983 hours in a year. In 2016, that had fallen to 1,774. That’s 209 fewer hours of labor—and 209 more hours to spend with family and friends.   
  
Technology, although much maligned for providing distracting alternatives to social interaction, also makes it possible to remain in contact with others even across vast distances. Access to electricity, mobile phones and the Internet has never been more widespread, connecting more lives across the planet.   
  
Technology not only makes it easier to maintain relationships, but to form them. Just last month I attended a wedding where the bride and groom had first met through a dating app on their smart phones. They were not unusual—online dating now brings about more than a third of U.S. marriages, and the rapid spread of communications technology has also facilitated the formation of many friendships.   
  
To make his case Sachs also cites data showing that people don’t identify as happier today than a half-century ago. If true, that is perhaps evidence in favor of the “hedonic treadmill” theory of psychology, which claims that people quickly get used to improvements in their lives and take them for granted. A year after winning the lottery, for example, many people are no happier than they were previously. In a sense, just being alive right now means you’ve won the lottery—the average American today is richer in many ways than John D. Rockefeller a century ago.   
  
Sachs is too quick to dismiss the incredible progress that humanity has made by practically every measure, and also too quick to assume that government intervention is the best way to bring about progress. You can find even more data showing how far humanity has come at HumanProgress.org.

So Grant Robertson has [announced a massive spend up on roads](https://www.stuff.co.nz/national/politics/119117899/why-all-new-labour-roads-lead-to-grant-robertson-as-huge-new-funding-package-announced?cid=app-iPhone), especially in the north. On top of that, he’s given a sop to the Greens giving them $200m for decarbonisation but **$690m** for 22km of road to **NZ First**. Which one matters most? Clearly there is a disconnect between their green statements and the reality of having to build more roads. 



Grant Robertson has been a man out to prove himself. Labour ministers of finance feel the pressure to show the markets, the punditocracy – and possibly themselves – that they are just as fiscally responsible as National Party ministers in the same position.



Robertson, the son of a Presbyterian accountant, has done precisely that.



Luke Malpass, the writer of that piece, could easily have accurately described Robertson as[ the son of a convicted fraudster](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grant_Robertson#Early_life) and, based on what has been announced in the package, it really is a fraud on the taxpayers by Robertson.



So, having put in the ground work, he has now acceded to both pressure and reality and attempted to make a virtue of it, steering a [$12 billion infrastructure package](https://www.stuff.co.nz/national/119121503/projectbyproject-where-the-infra-package-will-be-spent-around-nz) ($8b of announced spending, plus **$4b to be rolled out over the coming years) covering new roads, rails, hospitals and schools.** Some projects are expected to be approved by the end of 2020. Others are further out.



It **includes an emphasis on roads** , **reversing both the Government’s rhetorical and erstwhile ideological opposition to new highways.** Robertson knows that **electric vehicles will still need roads** and that public transport can’t easily help deliver goods to shops, kids to swimming practice, or take families on holiday. The Government sees climate change as important, but recognises that roads need not be a zero-sum villain in its efforts to cut emissions. 



It’s a fraud. They are spending up on roads that National had already allocated funds for and **the government cancelled.** Now three years later they are rolling it out as if it is new spending, and worse there has been a hiatus of three years while they dithered. No surprises that the Transport minister is **Phil Twyford**.



The announcement is also a useful political tool by which Labour can distance itself from the Greens in an election year. Twenty minutes after the plans were announced, Greenpeace denounced them as missing “an opportunity to clean up New Zealand’s transport system”.



Yet that notwithstanding, this will be disappointing for the Greens: they specifically got only $200 million for infrastructure decarbonisation, in a multi-billion package. 



There is also more money being spent on [schools and hospitals infrastructure](https://www.stuff.co.nz/national/119105125/government-announces-billions-of-spending-with-roads-the-big-winner).



In comparison, NZ First gets $690m for a 22-kilometre road in Northland. Politically this is simple: NZ First’s return to Parliament is more important to the Government’s re-election prospects than if the Greens lift their party vote a bit.



Of course, all three Government parties will claims [ _sic_ ] credit for every cent spent on rail.



You’ve got to hand it to **Winston** , he seems to be a far better negotiator than the Greens and continually delivers for his constituency. This package shows that the green rhetoric from **Ardern** is just like everything else she says: a bumper sticker slogan with no real policy depth to back it up. No matter which way it is spun, you are left with the impression that NZ First and roads matter a lot more to Labour than the Greens and their nonsense.



Robertson is clever however because National can only come out and say “We will do it too, just a bit better”. I don’t know about you but “Vote National, not as shithouse as Labour” doesn’t seem to be a winning electoral proposition to me.



 **The National Party is inevitably countering that this is the Government simply reinstating National’s roading plans that it had initially ditched** when it came to office. And into the bargain, it argues, the Government has smashed both confidence and the procurement pipeline that big infrastructure companies rely on. It has argued, and will continue to argue, that Labour doesn’t really “believe” in roads.



The Government, and Robertson, won’t be overly worried by these claims. It figures that people only care about what will actually be built and how it will help them get to where they need to go, not how the Government got there. 



One thing is for sure, the winner of the infrastructure retail politics battle will set themselves up well for September’s election.



This is where the power of incumbency kicks it. The government has all the resources of government at their disposal. This was pointed out before the last election when some National backbenchers thought the best option was to lose, to clean out the old guard of National. That was a defeatist attitude that cedes power. Those same fools are saying the same thing with regards to the leadership of Simon Bridges. They’d rather see him lose than win power because it would get him and Paula Bennett out of the way. But it admits that they want to spend another 3 years in the wilderness. 



The power of incumbency is hard to defeat. Oppositions don’t win elections, governments lose them, and Jacinda Ardern will likely make a better case to continue than Bridges will make to change. Having a policy platform in almost every main instance that is similar to Labour but slightly better at delivery isn’t enough to win power. 



Advantage: Labour, right now.

You Ought to Have a Look _is a feature from the Center for the Study of Science posted by Patrick J. Michaels and Paul C. (“Chip”) Knappenberger. While this section will feature all of the areas of interest that we are emphasizing, the prominence of the climate issue is driving a tremendous amount of web traffic. Here we post a few of the best in recent days, along with our color commentary._   




A couple of interesting pieces have come recently to our attention that deal with the serious issue of “publication bias” in science.   
  
In our Cato Working Paper No. 29, we describe “publication bias” as an underreporting of negative results from scientific experiments—a practice which can bias science in the direction of supporting existing hypotheses, even highly questionable ones.   
  
In “Is the Government Buying Science or Support?” we lay out a framework for detecting whether federal funding of scientific research is perpetuating publication bias through expectations of results supporting existing federal science interests. We suspect it has.   
  
A few years back, we looked into whether evidence of publication bias was present in the reporting of climate change results that were being published in the _Science_ and _Nature_ , the most influential science periodicals on earth. Not surprisingly, we found strong evidence that findings that anthropogenic climate change being “worse than expected” was disproportionately reported, compared to findings that climate change impacts would not as great as predicted. In an unbiased condition, each event should be equally likely. We concluded:   




“This [finding] has considerable implications for the popular perception of global warming science, for the nature of ""compendia"" of climate change research, such as the reports of the United Nations' Intergovernmental Panel on Climate change, and for the political process that uses those compendia as the basis for policy.”



Rather than being uncommon, publication bias is probably closer to the norm.   
  
Two recent reports highlight its occurrence in two other major scientific research areas—the social cost of carbon and psychotherapy.   
  
The social cost of carbon (SCC) is on its way to becoming perhaps _the_ strongest influence on public policy both nationally and internationally. It represents the current value of the cost of all future damages wrought by the emission of each new ton of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere from human activities. It currently factors into virtually all newly-proposed regulations from the federal government and will no doubt be the center of focus at the international climate negotiation to take place in Paris this December. If the SCC is low (or negative) there is no need to regulation carbon dioxide emissions; the higher the SCC is, the greater the sense of urgency.   
  
But nobody know what the true value the SCC is—and, if fact, it is probably unknowable. That doesn’t stop a whole lot of people from trying to assign a value to it. The more extreme you think climate change is going to be and the less confidence that you have in the ability of mankind to adapt to changing conditions, the higher your estimates of the SCC.   
  
Since you probably only bother to study the SCC if you think there is going to be a major problem with climate change, SCC researchers are probably somewhat preconditioned to pursing methodologies which lead to high SCC estimates, and eschew those that don’t. This is a situation ripe for publication bias. And a research team led by Dr. Tomáš Havránek of the Institute of Economic Studies at Charles University in Prague set out to see if they could find one.   
  
Yesiree.   
  
From the abstract of their paper:   




We examine potential selective reporting in the literature on the social cost of carbon (SCC) by conducting a meta-analysis of 809 estimates of the SCC reported in 101 studies. Our results indicate that estimates for which the 95% confidence interval includes zero are less likely to be reported than estimates excluding negative values of the SCC, which might [how about the word _will_ —eds] create an upward bias in the literature. The evidence for selective reporting is stronger for studies published in peer-reviewed journals than for unpublished papers.



Additionally, and rather importantly, Havránek and colleagues also note that selective reporting likely plagues other aspects of the climate change literature which further leads to an inflated SCC estimates:   




Moreover, other studies suggest that some of the parameters used for the calibration of integrated assessment models [used to determine the SCC], such as climate sensitivity or the elasticity of intertemporal substitution in consumption, are likely to be exaggerated themselves because of selective reporting, which might further contribute to the exaggeration of the SCC reported in individual studies—including the results of the [U.S.] Interagency Working Group [responsible for establishing a SCC value used in federal cost/benefit analyses].



You really ought to have a look at the Havránek study in its entirety to see the nature and depth of the problem. It is available here.   
  
Another example of publication bias infiltrating a major field of science—psychotherapy—has just been published by a team led by Ellen Driessen of VU University Amsterdam.   
  
An excellent article in Vox by Julia Belluz laid out the implications of what Driessen and colleagues found:   




For years, doctors have had two main strategies for treating depression: antidepressants and psychotherapy. These practices, according to the published research, can be fairly effective.   
  
Or at least that's what we thought. But recent research now suggests that we've actually been overestimating the effectiveness of our best treatments for depression — in part because published studies were giving a biased picture of the medical evidence.   
  
The reason has to do with something called **""** publication bias. **""** Often there are lots of different scientists conducting studies on whether, say, a particular drug or therapy can alleviate the symptoms of depression. Not all of those studies, however, get published. Journal editors tend to be more interested in papers finding that a particular treatment had a big effect instead of studies showing little or no effect.



Driessen’s paper comes to this unsettling conclusion:   




The efficacy of psychological interventions for depression has been overestimated in the published literature, just as it has been for pharmacotherapy. Both are efficacious but not to the extent that the published literature would suggest. Funding agencies and journals should archive both original protocols and raw data from treatment trials to allow the detection and correction of outcome reporting bias. Clinicians, guidelines developers, and decision makers should be aware that the published literature overestimates the effects of the predominant treatments for depression.



While few even realize it exists, publication bias has serious real-world implications, from environmental policy to mental health.

"Opinion piece by Prof. David Bellamy
28 June 08
Cows and Sheep May Safely Graze?
As a youngster in a post war London I was brought up on lamb and anchor butter from New Zealand.
My first dabble into TV commercials was with WOOLMARK NZ, in what became a successful attempt to slow down the ingress of synthetic fibre into the carpet market. I still meet sheep farmers around the world who greet me their thanks and a pint of beer.
I still delight in your butter and lamb which I can buy in my local supermarket, the latter at half the price of the local product sold in our village butchers shop.
What a strange world we live in now bombarded with the rhetoric of food miles let alone tourist miles.

Hence I beg leave to put in this plea for the good husbandry of these two ruminants.
Cows and sheep are Mother Nature’s own brand of internal combustion engines. They get their energy by “burning” cellulose, the same stuff wood is made of.
During their life they produce all sorts of useful things; butter, cheeses, curds, dripping, gelatine, hide, horn, yoghurt, lamb, lard, milk, mutton, tallow, whey and wool.
Each one is a solar powered, self building, repairing and regenerating mobile mini supermarket. The solid waste from which is recycled, returning organic compost to the soil.
At the end of their useful lives any potential waste can be turned into heat and power.
Both of these amazing mammals depend on teeming hordes of ever smaller, internal combustion engines, (mini beasts, yeasts and bacteria) that live within their complex stomachs.
Chewing is not enough to crack open the tough cellulose packaging that wrap the goodies in each and every plant cell.
To release the energy rich fuels, (sugars, proteins and fats) stored within the cellulose boxes that make up the grasses and herbs, they need the power of the digestive enzymes of all their internal helpmates.
Without these, all cud chewing ruminants and non-vegetarian humans could not gainfully graze.
Please note even cows and sheep are not strict herbivores because they can and do digest these tiny animals relegating them to the ranks of the omnivores.
Exhaust from these internal combustion engines both large and small contain carbon dioxide and methane and thereby hangs my tale.
The molecules of carbon that make up their flesh, wool, hide, burps and farts is not fossil carbon.
It was sequestered from their pasture rarely longer than a year and most within a few days before their release back into the atmosphere.
Although somewhat modified by human influence they are part of the 97% of the main cycle of carbon dioxide that makes the living world go round. Not the 3% that the global warmers say are tipping the World, towards an omnivore driven armageddon.
Please note that long before the days of New Zealand lamb the world’s paddy fields, termite mounds and rotting organic matter were producing their fare share of greenhouse gasses including methane.
The IPCC reckon there is an annual production of 600 million tonnes of methane of which 25 million tonnes remain in the atmosphere. An increase of 25 million tonnes would raise the temperature by a mere 0.005 of a degree centigrade.
Not much to worry about, especially if you take into account, the fact that since 1999 the rate of increase of atmospheric methane has slowed down dramatically. Surely these ruminants should be left to safely graze.
Unless they are strict vegetarians, I beg the carbon cops not to tax these exemplary carbon trading internal combustion engines that do such wonderful things by chewing the cud.
The green dream of bio fuels has already turned into a nightmare of starvation across the poor world while devastating local biodiversity.
Since the far off days of good old British mutton and horse drawn milk carts, more and more small farmers have gone to the wall of extinction. With ever larger farms worked by machines not people, soils have lost much of their structure and hence their self-draining and nutrient retaining capacity.
In consequence they need massive applications of fertilizers, pesticides and herbicides all of which guzzle fossil fuels in their production and application.
The good news is that over the past 25 years farmers both great and small have joined forces with the Queen Elizabeth 2 Trust, DOC, conservation groups and other local and national stakeholders. Together they are working wonders of what I like to call the green renaissance.
Together they are dealing with the many feral plants and animals, while putting their patch back into more bio diverse and hence more sustainable working order.
My own small part in this was when I had the privilege to work with TVNZ and Massey University on a book and TV series called “Moa’s Ark” ready for the Treaty of Waitangi Year.
I also made another famous TV advert “Old Mans Beard Must Go” and was there both at the start and completion of the world boggling mouse proof fence around the mountain-tops of Maungatautari.
My case rests, when it comes to the future of New Zealand butter, beef, lamb, leather, mutton and wool please don’t fart in the face of common sense.

Oxford definition of propaganda: information, especially of a biased or misleading nature, used to promote a political cause or point of view.



The Prime Minister and her government coalition partners have opened the classroom door to vested interest groups to spread their propaganda.



One such group that has found strong support within Labour is the Maori sovereignty movement. It is engaged in an ambitious strategy to gain governance control of the country. This agenda is being pursued against a backdrop where both of the main political parties regard the support of the tribal elite as crucial to their own political ambitions.



Having decimated the Maori Party at the 2017 election, the Prime Minister will be highly motivated to retain all seven Maori seats within Labour. She will want to avoid the risk that a kuia-led resurgent Maori Party may regain one or more of the Maori seats, along with list MPs, since they are more likely to back National than Labour.



Likewise, National would welcome an erosion of Labour’s base and the emergence of a potential coalition partner.



It’s this political self-interest that muted the response to the calls by sovereignty activists to make their version of New Zealand ‘history’ compulsory in schools. As a result, we will have the bizarre situation where, in our self-managing education system – with a curriculum designed to give schools the freedom to choose which subjects they teach to their students – New Zealand History will be the only compulsory subject.



Such is the hypocrisy of politics that it won’t be compulsory to teach children English or Maths, but it will be compulsory to teach them the Government’s version of New Zealand history.



This is alarming on a number of fronts. Realists know that activists will control the curriculum content. They will [rewrite history](https://thebfd.co.nz/2019/10/gisborne-history-the-re-write/) to portray Maori as peace-loving folk with an established system of government prior to the colonial invasion and era of oppression. They will promote the fallacy that all of the misfortunes of Maori are due solely to the suppression of their culture.



Already a Ministry of Education [resource](http://maorihistory.tki.org.nz/assets/Uploads/Te-Takanga-o-te-Wa-Maori-History-Guidelines-English-1.pdf) on Maori history that’s available for 5 to 12-year-olds includes a section on “a return to Maori self-determination”. The unit warns, “It is difficult for younger students to understand what it is to have been denied rights or to have them forcibly removed. Discuss how they would feel if they had something important such as break time at school unexpectedly taken away from them for good…”



 **State-sanctioned Maori activism** also features strongly in the Education and Training [Bill](http://www.legislation.govt.nz/bill/government/2019/0193/latest/LMS170676.html) that was tabled in Parliament just before the Christmas break.



Under the Bill, the Minister of Education will be able to issue directives – without the scrutiny of Parliament – to ensure education providers are “instilling in each child an appreciation of the importance of the Treaty of Waitangi and te reo Maori”. In addition, “after consulting with Maori”, the Minister can instruct education agencies how to comply with Treaty of Waitangi objectives. The Ministry will clearly be at the dictate of Maori.



It remains unbelievable in this day and age that a New Zealand Government would introduce laws that **create a racial divide,** when so much of modern history has been about the removal of privilege and the pursuit of equality. That our politicians choose to define people by the origin of their ancestors only becomes comprehensible when one considers it in the context of them advancing their own political self-interest.



When will we have a government that will support the basic human right of New Zealanders to be equal and free from State discrimination? When will our politicians stop kissing the feet of Maori? When will a New Zealand Government be prepared to remove race-based legislation from the Statute books in the same way that many other countries including Sweden, France, Belgium, Austria, and many US States have done?



Anyone concerned that Labour is allowing Maori activists to gain influence over education, should send in a submission on the Bill by February 14 – details can be seen [HERE](https://www.parliament.nz/en/pb/bills-and-laws/bills-proposed-laws/document/BILL_93294/education-and-training-bill).



Radical Maori are not the only group embedding their propaganda within state education. So too are the Greens.



On the 12th of January the Education Minister Chris Hipkins and the Minister of Climate Change, the Green Party co-leader James Shaw, [announced](https://www.beehive.govt.nz/release/new-resource-schools-increase-awareness-and-understanding-climate-change) a new climate change resource has been produced for 11 to 14-year-old children.



This week’s NZCPR Guest Commentator, former Energy Minister Barry Brill and Chairman of the New Zealand Climate Science Coalition has examined the [programme](https://nzcurriculum.tki.org.nz/Curriculum-resources/Education-for-sustainability/Tools-and-resources#collapsible1) and believes that climate activism is its central objective:



“It promotes the campaigns of Greta Thunberg, School Strike for Climate, and even Greenpeace. It urges children to ‘get talking’, ‘get others involved’, ‘be powerful as a change agent’ and ‘make good choices about climate action’.



“Children are to measure their own carbon footprints as well as those of their parents’ homes and their schools. They should write to their MP and email the Prime Minister/Climate Minister demanding further action to reduce carbon footprints.



“The teaching resource implants in children the need to eat less meat and dairy products – and strongly supports the iniquitous ‘food miles’ myth…”



Barry explains that the material presents spurious predictions for the future as if they were known facts, and says, “I personally began a list of these factoids for the purpose of comparing them with the official projections set out in the Fifth Assessment Report of the Inter-Governmental Panel on Climate Change. It was all a futile exercise. Almost every future ‘scientific fact’ in this material is either flat-out wrong or highly tendentious.”



He says, “The entire document is couched in the language of climate campaigners rather than that of scientists. It is a trashy and hopelessly unbalanced catechism of all the fashionable pseudoscience. It is pure propaganda, in the very best Goebbels tradition.”



Joseph Goebbels was, of course, Adolph Hitler’s Propaganda Minister, who used the German education system to indoctrinate children with the Third Reich’s National Socialist world view.



It is said that after Germany surrendered in May 1945, the Allies required young Germans to undergo ‘de-Nazification’ to counter the effects of twelve years of the “big lie” Nazi propaganda they had received at school.



The reality is that the conscious indoctrination of a future generation is being wholeheartedly embraced by activist groups in New Zealand. Whether the big lie is the claim that the Treaty of Waitangi created a partnership between Maori and the Crown – or that free-market capitalism is creating climate change – these fanatics are targeting our children with their political propaganda.



In an [interview](https://breakingviewsnz.blogspot.com/2020/01/sean-plunket-should-climate-change-be.html) with Minister Shaw about the new climate resource for schools, Magic Radio’s Sean Plunket asked if both sides of the debate – whether mankind or nature is responsible for climate change – would be covered.



In response the Minister made an unbelievable claim: “I have not found a scientist yet who does not think that climate change isn’t happening due to human activity.”



He further claimed that “In the New Zealand scientific community there is no debate”. 



If the Minister is to be taken at his word, he clearly lives in a very isolated bubble. It seems implausible that he could have avoided hearing the concerns of scientists in New Zealand – and thousands of others overseas – who believe that climate change is a natural process and is not being caused by humans.



James Shaw was asked: “Are we teaching kids how science works? Or what the IPCC is predicting – and what the scenarios of their computerised models might mean?”



The Minister confirmed that the IPCC predictions are core to the new programme.



The IPCC is, of course, the Inter-Governmental Panel on Climate Change – a United Nations body of political representatives that is promoting the theory that mankind is causing climate change. 



Sean Plunket then asked the Minister whether teachers will explain to Kiwi kids that New Zealand is responsible for only 0.17 percent of man-made greenhouse gas emissions?



The Minister didn’t answer the question.



We also doubt whether children will learn that only around 4 percent of the world’s greenhouse gases are produced by mankind and that nature creates the rest.



Sean Plunket asked about sea-level rise and how sea levels have not materially changed in spite of dire predictions. But the Minister sidestepped the issue by talking instead about IPCC modelling.



As Barry Brill has explained, the education resource has been designed to instruct school children on how to become climate activists – and by including an invitation for them to write to the Prime Minister and Climate Minister to demand further action, New Zealanders can expect an on-going diatribe from those politicians about how Kiwi children are insisting the Government do more to combat climate change.



This is not the first time the green movement has attempted to brainwash New Zealand children with global warming scaremongering. Back in 2007 schools throughout the country began [using](https://www.nzcpr.com/politics-in-school-on-trial/) former US Vice President Al Gore’s highly controversial film ‘An Inconvenient Truth’ to promote the Labour Government’s climate change agenda.



At the time, Britain’s Labour Government had sent copies of the film to schools as part of a Climate Change Resource Pack aimed at children aged 11 to 14 years.



But a school governor from Kent took a legal challenge against the Government for subjecting his 11 and 14-year-old sons to political propaganda in the classroom: “I wish my children to have the best education possible, free from bias and political spin, and Mr Gore’s film falls far short of the standard required”.



During the hearing the Court was informed that Al Gore’s film contained serious scientific inaccuracies, that it was ‘politically partisan’, and was being used by the Government to ‘brainwash’ children about global warming.



As part of the evidence, it was pointed out that Al Gore had admitted it was appropriate to exaggerate the facts on global warming in order to get the message across.



The Judge ruled that schools were required to warn children before showing the film that it contained “partisan political views”, as well as pointing out the eleven serious inaccuracies. These included a claim that sea levels could rise by 7m causing the displacement of millions of people, when the evidence shows sea levels are expected to rise by only 40cm or so over the next hundred years and that there is no threat of mass migration.



In fact, Al Gore’s claim in the movie that rising sea levels had already caused the evacuation of some Pacific islands to New Zealand, remains as untrue now – 14 years later – as it was back then. 



The court case highlighted the fact that in Britain school children are protected from political propaganda through an amendment to their Education Act which requires political issues to be presented in a balanced manner.



Section 406 forbids … the promotion of partisan political views in the teaching of any subject in the school. And if political issues are brought to the attention of pupils, Section 407 requires… they are offered a balanced presentation of opposing views.



Since New Zealand’s Education Act has no such safeguards to protect children from political propaganda, in 2008 the NZCPR petitioned Parliament to have similar clauses introduced.



The Ministry of Education [responded](http://www.stuff.co.nz/national/politics/3607019/An-Inconvenient-Truth-sparks-school-indoctrination-debate) to our petition, saying sufficient safeguards already existed through the professionalism and common sense of school boards, principals and teachers – as well as a Code of Ethics for Registered Teachers that requires them to present material in a balanced manner. 



The Education Bill that is now before Parliament – and the infiltration of propaganda into the school curriculum by activist groups – shows the fallacy of that response. It is imperative that our education system be free from political bias. Surely, its time Kiwi children had the same safeguard in law as their British counterparts.

You Ought to Have a Look _is a feature from the Center for the Study of Science posted by Patrick J. Michaels and Paul C. (“Chip”) Knappenberger. While this section will feature all of the areas of interest that we are emphasizing, the prominence of the climate issue is driving a tremendous amount of web traffic. Here we post a few of the best in recent days, along with our color commentary._   




Despite predictions of runaway ecological destruction, beginning in the 1970s, Americans began to consume less and tread more lightly on the planet. Over the past several decades, through technological innovation, Americans now grow more food on less acres, eat more sources of meat that are less land-intrusive, and used water more efficiently so that water use is lower than in 1970. The result: lands that were once used for farms and logging operations are now returning as forests and grasslands, along with wildlife, such as the return of humpback whales off the shores of New York City. As Jesse Ausubel elucidates in a new essay for Breakthrough Journal, as humans depend less on nature for the well-being, the more nature they have returned.



Ausubel’s full article is really well-worth a detailed look.   




Another look at our impact on the environment was presented by Cato Adjunct Scholar Alex Epstein during his conversation with Glenn Beck this week. Alex says, “Of everything I have ever done in front of a video camera, this appearance on Glenn Beck was my favorite.”   
  
Here’s an excerpt of the conversation a reported by TheBlaze.com:   




“This is a battle, not about green energy versus fossil fuels, but about anti-humanism and anti-impact,” Epstein asserted. “If your ultimate goal is to maximize human well-being, then you care about your environment as a means to maximize human well-being.”   
  
But Epstein said the green movement advocates minimizing human impact as its ultimate goal.   
  
“So let’s take the decision to build New York City,” Epstein said, offering an example. “If New York City was up for a vote today, does anyone believe that the environmentalists would yes? What about Chicago? What about the first hospital? What about any given baby? No. So the idea is that if humans have an impact, it’s bad.”   
  
Epstein said there is a “fundamental bias against humans” in the green movement, and “everyone has bought into anti-impact as an ideal,” when the philosophy really should be determining what has an “anti-negative impact for humans.”



Alex’s book is an excellent read and a persuasive case for how best to talk about global warming and the humanity’s contribution to it. If you don’t have a copy of it, You Ought to Have a Look!   
  
Our quest for energy is also the subject of Cato’s Johan Norberg latest documentary _Power to the People_. This program, which recently aired on PBS, is a look at the impact that energy (or lack there of) has around the world and the best ways that are available to meet this urgent need.   
  
The production quality as well as the informational content of _Power to the People_ is very high, and just watching the two minute intro—cleverly spliced together from Johan’s travels around the world—is almost certain to draw you into watching the entire program. A good thing—we promise! Have a look:   




And last, perhaps at least recognizing some of the above realities—that energy access/reliability/expansion (aka. economic development) is going to trump climate change concerns around the world—U.N. top climate officials continue to play down expectations of what is going to be achieved at the U.N.’s Climate Conference this December in Paris and its hopes of a meaningful international agreement to limit climate change. According to Reuters:   




Christiana Figueres, laying out her recipe for a deal meant to be agreed by almost 200 nations at a summit in Paris, said it would be part of a long haul to limit climate change and not an ""overnight miraculous silver bullet"".   
  
The looser formula is a sharp shift from the U.N.'s 1997 Kyoto Protocol, which originally bound about 40 rich nations to cut greenhouse gas emissions and foresaw sanctions that were never imposed even when Japan, Russia and Canada dropped out.   
  
Figueres dismissed fears by many developing nations, which have no binding targets under Kyoto and fear that a Paris accord due to enter into force from 2020 could force them to cut fossil fuel use, undermining economic growth.   
  
""The bottom line (is that) this is an agreement and a path that is protective of growth and development rather than threatening to growth and development,"" Figueres told an online news conference.   
  
The deal would be ""enabling and facilitating"" rather than a ""punitive-type"" agreement, she said. The deal's main thrust would be to decouple greenhouse gas emissions from gross domestic product growth.



At this point in time, being “protective of growth and development” is not going to lead to emissions reduction necessary to mitigate climate change to the degree or in the time frame envisioned by the U.N. But, regardless of any existence of international climate agreements, “growth and development” will lead to enhanced environmental protections—as today’s _You Ought To Have a Look_ articles attest.   
  
Rather than just being “protective” of growth and development, the U.N. ought to be encouraging it—which it could do better if it weren’t preoccupied with mitigating climate change.

"US climate activists had high hopes for the Democratic national convention, following substantial praise for a recently strengthened plan from nominee Joe Biden and his choice of Kamala Harris as a running mate. But a mysterious decision to dial back the party platform’s language on the climate crisis has deflated morale. A statement opposing the fossil fuel subsidies that are prevalent in US law was removed. The revision drew criticism from as far away as Sweden – from youth activist Greta Thunberg. It marred the otherwise elevated profile that climate was meant to enjoy during three segments totaling more than 10 minutes of prime time on Wednesday night. It also underscored the obstacles ahead to significant US climate action, as advocates argue the party should explicitly demand the dismantling of the fossil fuel industry and issue a more full-throated endorsement of the Green New Deal. “After I learned that they removed fossil fuel subsidies from the platform, whatever they said at that point kind of fell on skeptical ears,” said the Rev Michael Malcom, the Alabama-based founder and executive of the People’s Justice Council. “The communities that I represent, serve and work with – that is exactly what’s killing us. It’s also contributing heavily to climate change, but it’s the subsidies that really harm black, brown, indigenous, poor communities.” “I’m listening to Mr George Floyd, Black Lives Matter, all of these other mantras – or I would even say honest sentiments from people – I really don’t think they’re looking at black life for real. The whole black life.” Biden’s climate plan proposes ending fossil fuel subsidies, although doing so would require legislation from Congress. His campaign on Wednesday reiterated his position. Allies of Biden insist the former vice-president is fully committed to action on the climate crisis and see his $2tn plan to shift to cleaner sources of energy as a critical plank of any post-Covid economic recovery effort. In video montages during the convention, promises of millions of good-paying jobs were voiced over images of public lands, sustainable farms and alternative transportation like electric scooters. The New Mexico governor, Michelle Lujan Grisham, spoke about the need to expand clean energy in front of a field of solar panels. The controversy over fossil fuel subsidies was “basically a screw-up” that Biden had in effect resolved, according to John Podesta, who was an adviser to Barack Obama on climate change. “There is no ambiguity there from the campaign, which should give activists heart that Biden is all in,” Podesta said. “There will be issues for sure around the pacing of all this but Biden has leaned into the issue and said, ‘We will get it done’.” Polling suggests that messages around clean energy and curbing dangerous climate change now resonate beyond the left flank of the Democratic party. “The political reality has changed, it’s a much more powerful issue,” said Podesta. “It now moves the smallish group of swing voters, most of them women, as well as amps up the motivation of younger voters.” Democrats hope these voters have been energized by the actions of Donald Trump, who has consistently dismissed the science of climate change and scrapped dozens of environmental regulations. Despite its dire ramifications, the climate crisis has been, at most, a side issue in previous presidential elections, but Democrats see the political terrain as more favorable in 2020. Stark scientific warnings, such as the UN report from 2018 that outlined the grave consequences of unchecked global heating, have added new urgency that has been further fueled by a mass youth climate movement. “The Democrats have an opportunity to galvanize millions of young voters with an ambitious, visionary climate platform, but they’re making a mess of it,” said Charlie Jiang, climate campaigner at Greenpeace. “This platform is a step backwards, and we deserve better.” Leopoldo Martinez, a DNC member and co-chair of the Hispanic Caucus, said almost 44% of Latino voters are millennials, which “pushes climate change to a high level of priority on the Latino agenda”. But at the same time, the overarching concern right now is the pandemic, he said. “We’ve never had so much unemployment. We’ve never had a Latino community more affected by an issue or crisis like this one.” Despite Democrats’ record-high attention to climate change, the crisis is being overshadowed by the death toll and economic battering from the pandemic and the party’s all-out push to mobilize voters against Donald Trump, who they say threatens the institution of democracy. The climate is falling to the background even as nearly two dozen wildfires blaze across California after a heatwave and power outages there. Collin Rees, a senior campaigner at Oil Change International, said the platform change might have had moderate Democrats and energy labor unions in mind. Some support subsidies for technologies like carbon capture and storage, to collect greenhouse gases before they are released into the atmosphere from the burning of fossil fuels. The technologies are not proven at scale, and Rees argued that investing in them would be a waste of money that would prolong the life of the fossil fuel industry. “These are the things that the fossil fuel industry is really fighting for and why they’re the last footholds in the Democratic party,” he said. Some advocates said the platform itself matters little to US policy, but others argued the party’s official stance is key to down-ballot politics, where activists must hold moderate Democrats accountable in their climate positions. “It is something we should care about because the [Democratic National Committee] has shown a pattern of not caring about climate, from ignoring the calls for a climate debate to at the last minute striking a key part of the Biden-Harris climate policy,” said Jamal Raad, co-founder of Evergreen Action. Anthony Rogers-Wright, policy coordinator for the Climate Justice Alliance, said the incident has sparked “what’s going to be a very long discussion from now until this election is settled in November and long after that, frankly.” “The way to avert climate catastrophe is to cease and desist paying the very people who are destroying the planet with the people’s money, and especially when you consider the fact that the people who are getting poisoned and extracted from the most are the people the Democrats need to vote for them to have electoral success,” he said."
"The rate at which humanity is consuming the Earth’s resources declined sharply this year as a result of the Covid-19 pandemic, according to researchers. Consequently, Earth Overshoot Day, the point at which human consumption exceeds the amount nature can regenerate in a year, has moved back by over three weeks from 29 July in 2019 to 22 August this year. According to research conducted by Global Footprint Network, an international research organisation, coronavirus-induced lockdowns led to a 9.3% reduction in humanity’s ecological footprint compared with the same period last year. However, in order to keep consuming ecological resources at our current rate we would still need the equivalent of 1.6 Earths. “Earth Overshoot Day is a way to illustrate the scale of the biological challenge we face,” said Mathis Wackernagel, president of Global Footprint Network. Although Wackernagel said this year’s data was encouraging, he called for further progress to be made “by design not by disaster”. The three week shift between the dates of Earth Overshoot Day in 2019 and 2020 represents the greatest ever single-year shift since global overshoot began in the 1970s. Since then, rising populations and increasing levels of per capita consumption have seen Earth Overshoot Day move earlier into the year, with the date arriving in July for the first time in 2019. “It’s a Ponzi scheme, we’re using up the future to pay for the present,” said Wackernagel. “Most countries have pretty strict laws about businesses running Ponzi schemes but somehow in the ecological domain we think it’s okay. We’ve only got one planet and that’s not going to change. We’ve got a very simple choice, one-planet prosperity or one-planet misery.” Previous economic crises have seen the date pushed back temporarily, such as the 2007-08 financial crisis which saw the date retreat five days further into the year.  David Lin, who leads the research team behind Earth Overshoot Day, explained: “This year it was particularly tricky because we wanted to give an indication of how Covid-19 affected 2020 results”. Lin’s research found that there was a major drop in CO2 emissions (down 14.5% compared with the same period in the previous year), and in commercial forestry (down 8.4% on 2019). Mike Childs, head of policy for Friends of the Earth, warned that “this year’s improvement in the way we use our natural resources is solely down to Covid-19 and subsequent lockdowns. Unless there is a significant change in the way we act the situation is likely to return to normal, or worse, in the following years.”"

Share this...FacebookTwitterAtmospheric research scientist Dr. Philip Klotzbach at Twitter here tweeted a chart showing that accumulated cyclone energy (ACE) has not risen at all in 30 years, despite earlier massive hype and hollering by climate scientists and media, who insist “man-made” global warming is causing more frequent and intense cyclones.

In fact Klotzbach’s plot above shows that there has even been a modest decline.
So I tweeted a question to Dr. Klotzbach, and he was kind to answer as follows:

As the reader will note, Klotzbach does not see any link between cyclone activity and global warming over the past 30 years.
If we roughly plot CO2 levels vs ACE, no statistical analysis is needed to tell us that there is no correlation, except of course that rising atmospheric CO2 concentration might be causing a little bit less cyclone activity (which is the OPPOSITE of what is claimed by alarmists):

Plot of ACE since 1980 vs atmospheric CO2 concentration. ACE has dropped a bit. CO2 chart from NOAA.
Global temperatures have also risen since 1980 (many arguing it has more to do with ocean and solar cycles, and less so with CO2). Yet, here as well a temperature increase over the period has not led to a rising trend in cyclone activity.
The paper Dr. Klotzbach refers to can be seen here. He writes in the abstract:
Ten years ago, Webster et al. documented a large and significant increase in both the number as well as the percentage of category 4 and 5 hurricanes for all global basins from 1970 to 2004, and this manuscript examines whether those trends have continued when including 10 additional years of data. In contrast to that study, as shown here, the global frequency of category 4 and 5 hurricanes has shown a small, insignificant downward trend while the percentage of category 4 and 5 hurricanes has shown a small, insignificant upward trend between 1990 and 2014. Accumulated cyclone energy globally has experienced a large and significant downward trend during the same period. The primary reason for the increase in category 4 and 5 hurricanes noted in observational datasets from 1970 to 2004 by Webster et al. is concluded to be due to observational improvements at the various global tropical cyclone warning centers, primarily in the first two decades of that study.
Globally, the year 2015 saw brisk cyclone activity, and thus has caused the trend since 1985 to be less steeply downward.

"**Hong Kong has released the murder suspect whose case led to plans to change extradition rules which then triggered the city's mass protests.**
Chan Tong-kai is accused of murdering his pregnant girlfriend in Taiwan last year before fleeing back to Hong Kong.
But Hong Kong and Taiwan do not have an extradition treaty, and his case was cited when the government proposed amending the law.
He was in jail for withdrawing money from her credit card after she died.
Walking free on Wednesday after 19 months in prison, the 20-year old apologised to the victim's family for the great ""pain and agony"" he caused them.
""I am willing to surrender myself,"" he said, adding he was willing to ""go back to Taiwan to face the trial and serve the sentence"".
Hong Kong and Taipei have clashed though over how he should be transferred to face the murder charges. It is unclear what the next steps will be.
While Hong Kong said Mr Chan was free to go to Taiwan and surrender himself, Taiwan cited security concerns and wants to send officers to escort him - a proposal that Hong Kong has rejected.
The proposed extradition bill would have allowed Hong Kong to extradite criminal suspects to places it doesn't have an extradition treaty with, including mainland China, Taiwan and Macau.
Critics of the planned law feared that extradition to mainland China could subject people to arbitrary detention and unfair trials.
The controversial bill was formally withdrawn on Wednesday.
After the bill sparked city-wide protests, the government announced in July that it would suspend the bill.
The formal withdrawal could only take place after parliament resumed in October.
Last week, parliament proceedings were interrupted when opposition lawmakers heckled Hong Kong Chief Executive Carrie Lam.
Although the Hong Kong protests started over the extradition bill, they have since widened to call for full democracy and less interference from Beijing."
"PHILADELPHIA  —   From the time Donald J. Trump became their candidate until he took the oath of office, congressional Republicans treated his policy pronouncements  —   largely out of step with Republican dogma  —   as essentially a distraction. He would talk. They would drive the policies. But now, the question of whether congressional Republicans would change President Trump or Mr. Trump would change them has an early answer. Mr. Trump cheerfully addressed the group here at their policy retreat on Thursday, and they responded with applause to many proposals they have long opposed. Republican lawmakers appear more than ready to open up the coffers for a $12 billion to $15 billion border wall, perhaps without the commensurate spending cuts that they demanded when it came to disaster aid, money to fight the Zika virus or funds for the tainted water system in Flint, Mich. They also seem to back a swelling of the federal payroll that Mr. Trump has called for in the form of a larger military and 5, 000 more border patrol agents. They have stayed oddly silent as Mr. Trump and Senate Democrats push a $1 trillion infrastructure plan, larger than one they rejected from President Barack Obama. Once fierce promoters of the separation of powers, Republicans are now embracing Mr. Trump’s early governing by executive order, something they loudly decried during Mr. Obama’s second term. Speaker Paul D. Ryan, whose own website this week still praised the   Partnership trade deal, now applauds Mr. Trump for putting the final shovel of dirt over the accord, with the president saying he is interested in bilateral agreements instead. Many Republicans, who have been longstanding opponents of Russia and written laws that prohibit torture, have chosen to overlook, or even concur with, Mr. Trump’s embrace of both. Even on the subject of Mr. Trump’s call for an investigation into voter fraud, a widely debunked claim, Republicans have often demurred. “The notion that election fraud is a fiction is not true,” said the Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell of Kentucky. Mr. Trump said he could not wait for lawmakers to get to work on their newfound common ground. “This Congress is going to be the busiest Congress we’ve had in decades, maybe ever,” Mr. Trump said. In an apparent reference to forthcoming bills, he added, “We’re actually going to sign the stuff that you’re writing. You’re not wasting your time. ” Many Republicans in Congress say his presidency is off to a substantive start, delivering on campaign promises to quell illegal immigration, reduce regulations, start the rollback of the health care law and reverse the Obama administration’s decisions to halt the Keystone XL and Dakota Access pipeline projects. “I think he’s completely winning the expectation game,” said Representative Peter Roskam of Illinois. “I think he’s a genius at lowering expectations and overperforming,” he said, adding, “It’s really remarkable. ” In one significant way, congressional Republicans potentially seemed to pull Mr. Trump to their end of the policy pool. On Thursday, the administration initially  appeared to endorse  taxing imports as a way to pay for the Mexican border wall, reversing its earlier preference for imposing a heavy tax on companies that move jobs overseas. But the White House later said it was just one option under consideration. “We are in a very good place on tax reform,” Mr. Ryan said. “It can get complicated when you get into the details of tax reform, but once we go through how tax reform works and what it’s going to take to get the kind of competitive tax system, the kind of competitive tax rates, I think most people agree that this is the right approach. ” Congressional Republicans are also struggling to keep up with Mr. Trump’s   announcements, let alone push their agenda. “It’s   stuff,” said Senator John Hoeven, Republican of North Dakota. Investigating voter fraud, for instance, is not something he would like to see Congress take on. “Our priorities are the ones we laid out,” he said. They are also eager to get on with the rest of that agenda  —   specifically a repeal and, ostensibly, a replacement of the Affordable Care Act. “We are on the same page with the White House,” Mr. Ryan insisted Thursday. “The president agrees with this agenda. ” But it is the sudden embrace of federal spending that represents perhaps the most striking departure, with Republicans backing the concept of starting the financing for the border wall with a new appropriation. And the list is much longer. By contrast, last year, Senator John Cornyn of Texas, the No. 2 Senate Republican, called Democrats’ request for $600 million in aid to Flint added to an energy bill “a huge earmark,” adding, “I think it’s not something I could support,” in keeping with most of his colleagues. Republicans also pushed for and partly succeeded in offsetting a bill to fight Zika last year. The talk of a spending surge has left some Republicans worried about an exploding deficit. “There are going to have to be some cuts,” said Representative Jason Chaffetz of Utah. “I am not interested in raising our spending levels. ” Senator John Barrasso of Wyoming, the chairman of the Environment and Public Works Committee, seemed tense when asked about the open checkbook. “We’re a fiscally conservative group,” he said of the committee. “We’re going to want to see things paid for. ” Republicans are also at times confused about what Mr. Trump is actually seeking when he makes policy declarations on Twitter. “‘Appears’ I think is the big word,” said Representative Ryan Costello of Pennsylvania. “I don’t think anyone in the House of Representatives on the Republican side of the aisle wants to go through the legislative process,” only to have the Trump administration send a bill back, he said. Republicans had expected to reveal great progress on their plans to replace the health care act here, but instead seemed stuck in a perpetual debate over the timeline of coming up with a replacement. Senators in large part made a strong argument for making sure that a replacement plan had been fashioned before repealing the law, while many in the House continue to push for a repeal with replacement coming much later. Also notable is the Republicans’ acceptance of something they have despised: the use of the executive pen to make policy. Several House Republicans dismissed the notion that Mr. Trump would abuse his power to issue executive orders in the way they complained that Mr. Obama did during his second term. “What you do by the pen can be dismantled by the pen,” said Representative Tom Reed of New York. Mr. Trump is also trying to work his will on how the Senate operates. In an interview with Sean Hannity on Fox News, Mr. Trump said he thought Mr. McConnell should get rid of the Senate filibuster rule for Supreme Court nominees, calling those who would oppose his coming pick “obstructionists. ” About three blocks from where Mr. Trump spoke, hundreds of protesters packed a plaza just across from City Hall to rally against the president. While the demonstration was organized around preserving the health care law, protesters showed up for a variety of causes. “I don’t trust anything he says,” said Ken Snyder, 62."
"WASHINGTON  —   Just days after President Trump spoke of a “running war’’ with the media, his chief White House strategist, Stephen K. Bannon, ratcheted up the attacks, arguing that news organizations had been “humiliated” by the election outcome and repeatedly describing the media as “the opposition party” of the current administration. “The media should be embarrassed and humiliated and keep its mouth shut and just listen for a while,” Mr. Bannon said in an interview on Wednesday. “I want you to quote this,” Mr. Bannon added. “The media here is the opposition party. They don’t understand this country. They still do not understand why Donald Trump is the president of the United States. ” The scathing assessment  —   delivered by one of Mr. Trump’s most trusted and influential advisers, in the first days of his presidency  —   comes at a moment of high tension between the news media and the administration, with skirmishes over the size of Mr. Trump’s inaugural crowd and the president’s false claims that millions of illegal votes by undocumented immigrants swayed the popular vote against him. Mr. Bannon, who rarely grants interviews to journalists outside of Breitbart News, the provocative   website he ran until August, was echoing comments by Mr. Trump last weekend, when the president said he was in “a running war” with the media and called journalists “among the most dishonest people on earth. ” Mr. Bannon’s remarks added to the growing acrimony between the press and a president who made attacks on the media a rallying point of his election campaign. Among Mr. Trump’s advisers in the White House, Mr. Bannon is responsible for putting into action the nationalist vision that Mr. Trump channeled during the later months of the campaign, one that stemmed from Mr. Bannon himself. And in many ways Mr. Trump has acted on that vision during his first week in office  —   from the description of “American carnage” he laid out in his inauguration speech to a series of executive actions outlining policies on trade agreements, immigration and the building of a border wall. Mr. Bannon is one of the strongest forces in an administration with competing power centers. A savvy manipulator of the press, and a proud provocateur, he was among the few advisers in Mr. Trump’s circle who were said to have urged Sean Spicer, the new press secretary, to give a confrontational, emotional statement to a shocked West Wing briefing room on Saturday, when the White House disputed news reports about the size of the inauguration crowd. He shares Mr. Trump’s view that the news media misunderstood the movement that the president rode into office. Speaking by telephone on Wednesday, Mr. Bannon delivered a broad indictment of the news media as being biased against Mr. Trump and out of touch with the American public. That is an argument familiar to readers of Breitbart and followers of personalities friendly to Mr. Trump, like Sean Hannity of Fox News. “The elite media got it dead wrong, 100 percent dead wrong,” Mr. Bannon said of the election, calling it “a humiliating defeat that they will never wash away, that will always be there. ” “The mainstream media has not fired or terminated anyone associated with following our campaign,” Mr. Bannon said. “Look at the Twitter feeds of those people: They were outright activists of the Clinton campaign. ” (He did not name specific reporters or editors.) “That’s why you have no power,” he added. “You were humiliated. ” Mr. Bannon spoke in blunt but calm tones, peppered with profanity, and humorously referred to himself as “Darth Vader. ” He said, with ironic relish, that Mr. Trump was elected by a surge of support from “the   hobbits and deplorables. ” The conversation was initiated by Mr. Bannon to offer praise for Mr. Spicer, who has been criticized this week for making false claims at the White House podium about attendance at Mr. Trump’s inaugural, for calling reporters dishonest and lecturing them about what stories to write, and for failing to disavow Mr. Trump’s lie about widespread voter fraud in the election. Asked if he was concerned that Mr. Spicer had lost credibility with the news media, Mr. Bannon chortled. “Are you kidding me?” he said. “We think that’s a badge of honor. ‘Questioning his integrity’  —   are you kidding me? The media has zero integrity, zero intelligence, and no hard work. ” “You’re the opposition party,” he said. “Not the Democratic Party. You’re the opposition party. The media’s the opposition party. ” Journalists reacted with alarm and defiance to Mr. Bannon’s comments. “What country are we living in?” Christiane Amanpour, the CNN correspondent, wrote on Twitter. “We are not the opposition,’’ Stephen Engelberg, editor in chief of the nonprofit news organization ProPublica, wrote in an email. “We are part of an essential function in any democracy. ” He added that ProPublica had no intention of “shutting up in response to this or any other president’s demand. ” “We are here to tell the truth and we intend to continue doing so, regardless of how badly some might want us to parrot ‘alternative facts,’” Mr. Engelberg said. Mr. Bannon mostly referred to the “elite” or “mainstream” media, but he cited The New York Times and The Washington Post by name. “The paper of record for our beloved republic, The New York Times, should be absolutely ashamed and humiliated,” Mr. Bannon said. “They got it 100 percent wrong. ” He added that he has been a reader of The Times for most of his adult life."

Share this...FacebookTwitterRemember how in the late 1990s/early 2000s the Medieval Warm Period (MWP) was made to disappear, and it was claimed that it was mainly a local, North Atlantic phenomenon.
Unfortunately for those trumpeting this claim, a comprehensive worldwide survey of scientific literature is now showing that the MWP was in fact a global phenomenon, suggesting large-scale natural cycles are what is really driving the climate.
=================================
Charting the Medieval Warm Period In The Southern Hemisphere
By Dr. Sebastian Lüning and Fritz Vahrenholt
(Translated/edited by P Gosselin)
The plotting of the Medieval Warm Period Map is making good progress. At first the basic idea was the Southern Hemisphere because of the notion that Medieval Warm Period (MWP) could be limited only to the Northern Hemisphere, mainly the North Atlantic, kept popping up. The collection of data for Africa, Antarctica, Australian and Oceania is now finished and it shows that the MWP was prominent.
In South America the data have been recorded foremost in the northwest part. The rest will soon follow.
The online data chart is here. 
The color code is as follows: red = warm MWP, blue = cold MWP, yellow = dry, green = wet. Here the precipitation code is shown only when there is no temperature information.
Over the last weeks the charting has been focused on the Mediterranean region, Arabia and the Caspian Sea. Once these regions are finished, the focus will move to northwards into Europe.
Recently studies from Switzerland and Austria were added. The MWP was uniformly hot and dry in this region:

========================
Vote for Dr. Lüning’s MWP Map
Within the scope of the Environment Conference in Paris in April 2016, French Minister of Environment, Energy and Ocean Issues Ségolène Royal started an Internet platform that has the aim of promoting the 100 most innovative citizens’ initiatives for climate.
Among the candidtes is also our Medieval Climate Map, which is now an officially electable project. From June 6 to July 6 it will be possible for citizens to vote for their favorites. After the voting by Internet users ends, the top 100 will be declared as the winners by Ms. Royal. These will be supported and promoted until COP22 in November in Marrakesh.
We hope you’ll support us with your vote when the voting opens. We’ll remind you at our blog, of course.

 
The MWP project is 50% funded, thanks to your generous support. More information on the MWP charting map is available here.

Satire (Possibly)



It came as a bolt from the blue. An email arrived from a crazy lady. I’d occasionally scribbled some words for a website catering to fellow right-wing nut-jobs and had submitted a piece for the editor’s consideration vis-à-vis publication. 



The email from said Devil-ess arrived a couple of hours afterwards. You won’t believe what it contained. She requested, nay, demanded: **evidence,** to substantiate claims made in my wittering screed, she stating rather severely that my (I’m very sure, of this I am certain) absolutely wonderful piece would no longer be considered for publication unless facts were forthcoming. I was, as you can well imagine, flabbergasted by the mad-woman’s affront, her high-handed nit-pikkery.



Evidence! Evidence [sigh]. Crikey. What the sheesh is evidence? And, who needs it? Not our ‘respectable’ daily news press, that’s for sure. Nevertheless, I acquiesced to the tyrant, responding with the considerable volume of 1,300 bytes of sober non-binary truth, signing it off; ‘Ha. So there!’ (Or, possibly; not).



By way of contrast, I found myself in the same sticky conundrum as our right-wing nut-job inter-web page editor (who shall remain un-named) a couple of weeks ago. Wellington’s daily rag announced on January 10th, 2020 in a front-page headline ‘Climate change takes hold’ that the temperature of 30.3c reached on January 29th, 2019 was ‘the highest temperature in Wellington since records began.” [Cue: a sharp intake of breath].



This revelatory record announcement actually annoyed me. Knowing that particular day’s temperature number was not, in fact, a record at all irritated me all over, to the point of correspondence, into which I foolishly enjoined, asking for (God help me) ‘evidence’ and challenging their ‘record’.



To their immense credit I received a reply from someone describing themselves as a ‘senior journalist’ from said rag, but honestly (you can trust me), it only missed [a parrot](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZw35VUBdzo) to complete the hilarious farce. Such was the apologetic.



Beginning with ‘I have an answer’ [to my consternation over their quite obvious bullshittery] senior reporter stated that “since records began” means, as far as they are concerned “1927”, which is exactly **not** when records began; that particular part of verified meteorological history began **sixty-three years before** , in 1864…[“He’s not dead, he’s just resting, probably pining for the fjords. Norwegian Blue’s do that”.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZw35VUBdzo)



Continuing on, senior reporter conceded “1895”, “ **may have been hotter** ” but, Aha! “Presumably it was measured differently”. Well; perhaps it was. Perhaps the thermometer reading was scaled to the volume of the bucket of water our government meteorologist emptied over his head at the time of measurement. I wasn’t there, so can’t confirm that the good weatherman used the accepted temperature scale and not a calibrated clipping from ‘Shipping News’. Who knows, maybe our ‘senior reporter’ is right.



Next: maybe the 1895 temperature was measured “at a different site”. Entirely possible, I suppose. The temperature recorded for downtown Wellington may have actually, fraudulently, been conveyed from Sivaganga, Southern India, but conceding this possibility would render the entire local temperature record as seriously misbehaved and, therefore, inadmissible to terrifying modern reconstructions and computer-models. That simply wouldn’t do.



There’s more: senior reporter (seriously) suggests that maybe the 1895 measurement was made “with different equipment”. Oh, my giddy Aunt. Good grief. Mr Fahrenheit perfected his Mercury-thermometer in 1752, nevertheless; perhaps temperature measurements were recorded in Wellington, New Zealand 143 years later using a six-inch rule, maybe a sextant, let’s not rule out the possibility of the maximum shade-sweep length of an isoscelised triangulation of Brazilian bananas being used to gauge the temperature. For heaven’ sake, what a ridiculous defence to mount in support of an unverifiable, certifiably false, **front-page full-frontal Fib.**



[‘This parrot is deceased. He is no more. He’s run off ‘is perch to meet ‘is maker. He is a Dead Parrot!’](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZw35VUBdzo) [Customer bangs rigamortised parrot on counter-top. Parrot-seller looks downward, morosely].



The correspondence descended (or ascended), to some heights (or lows), depending on your viewpoint. But that, people; is the state of the ‘Climate Crisis’ reporting from science so settled it needs no real facts, only inventive alternative suggestions and, certainly, no debate will be entered into. And, just to keep the anonymous but ever-watchful editorial and readership pedants happy, should you closet any (completely sane) reason to distrust my mirthful memoranda:



That’s all, folks. Enjoy your global warming, brought to you by fact-free _Stuff_ with no shame, with no embarrassment, and with no veracity whatsoever, at all.



Who would you rather trust with your facts?

Share this...FacebookTwitterAt the Germany-based European Institute for Climate and Energy (EIKE), Helmut Kuntz writes that Germany’s all-time record high temperature recorded last year, 2015, is likely an artifact of the urban heat island effect (UHI) and instrumentation error margins.
In 2015 the Kitzingen weather station located in southern Germany set a new all-time high when it reached 40.3°C — twice: on July 5 and August 7 — breaking the earlier record of 40.2°C set on 27 July 1983 in Gärmersdorf. The whopping margin: a whole 0.1°C! Photo right: Kitzingen station.
So why is Kitzingen suddenly so hot?
EIKE guest writer Josef Kowatsch has often claimed that the UHI has played a major role in producing the warming effect over the past decades. Recently that claim got a boost of support from University of Wurzburg climate researcher Prof. Heiko Paeth, who in an interview with MAIN POST daily here on September 7, 2016, stated that it likely has more to do with station siting then it does with a climate trend.
According to Prof. Paeth, the high reading can be traced back to Kitzingen having certain special features.
First the town of Kitzingen is located at a relatively low elevation some 20 km east of Wurzburg — situated in the Main Valley at the bottom of a sort of a bowl where heat can collect.
Secondly, he tells the MAIN POST that fresh, westerly winds that normally act to cool Germany in the summertime have been obstructed by a commercial district built not long ago where once a US base had been located. The Main Post writes:

google_ad_height = 200;
//-->




What remains is an obstacle for the air flow from the west. The town has blocked off its fresh air feed-in duct, says Paeth. ‘That could be an explanation for the heat.'”

Instrumentation error margin of +-0.4°C
Moreover Kuntz reports that the Kitzingen station was first put into operation in 2005 and the German DWD weather service equipped it with the electronic PT 100 instrument, which in comparison tests has been shown to produce considerably higher readings. Also such a weather station has a temperature measurement error of +-0.4°C at temperatures of 40°C:

Accuracy of the WXT 520 sensor for weather stations. As the ambient temperature rises over 0°C, so does the margin of error. 
Kuntz adds that if the urban heat island effect is the reason for the 0.1°C temperature increase over the last 32 years in Germany, then the supposed climate change warming of the planet looks like as follows:
– Globally it has not gotten warmer over the past 103 years.
– The global temperature upper limit temperature has not changed at all in 74 years.
– It has not gotten warmer in Germany over the past 32 years.
– If the “discarded” older measurements were used, it would be much warmer earlier than currently stated.

Increasingly, federal monies have been disbursed to the various departments and agencies in support of the Obama administration’s politically strange perseveration on global warming. Specifically, many millions go out each month for “public outreach,” more properly labeled propaganda, on the horrors of climate change.   
  
  
To show how well‐​spent this money is, we draw attention to today’s posting from the Department of Energy’s communication director Marissa Newhall, featuring pumpkins with windmills (the correct name for “wind turbine”) and solar panels carved on them. A quote:   




Last week, we shared some energy‐​themed pumpkin carving stencils to help you “energize” your neighborhood—and teach trick‐​or‐​treaters about energy—this Halloween. On our own time after work, we put the patterns to the test and carved some energy pumpkins of our own.



We note that they didn’t say they created the “energy‐​themed pumpkin carving stencils” “on their own time after work.”

Guest essay by Eric Worrall
Wikileaks has published a disturbing claim, that the US NSA have been monitoring Japanese government internal deliberations on Climate Change.
According to Wikileaks;
Target Tokyo
PRESS RELEASE
Today, Friday 31 July 2015, 9am CEST, WikiLeaks publishes “Target Tokyo”, 35 Top Secret NSA targets in Japan including the Japanese cabinet and Japanese companies such as Mitsubishi, together with intercepts relating to US-Japan relations, trade negotiations and sensitive climate change strategy.
The list indicates that NSA spying on Japanese conglomerates, government officials, ministries and senior advisers extends back at least as far as the first administration of Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, which lasted from September 2006 until September 2007. The telephone interception target list includes the switchboard for the Japanese Cabinet Office; the executive secretary to the Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga; a line described as “Government VIP Line”; numerous officials within the Japanese Central Bank, including Governor Haruhiko Kuroda; the home phone number of at least one Central Bank official; numerous numbers within the Japanese Finance Ministry; the Japanese Minister for Economy, Trade and Industry Yoichi Miyazawa; the Natural Gas Division of Mitsubishi; and the Petroleum Division of Mitsui.
Today’s publication also contains NSA reports from intercepts of senior Japanese government officials. Four of the reports are classified TOP SECRET. One of the reports is marked “REL TO USA, AUS, CAN, GBR, NZL”, meaning it has been formally authorised to be released to the United States’ “Five Eyes” intelligence partners: Australia, Canada, Great Britain and New Zealand.
The reports demonstrate the depth of US surveillance of the Japanese government, indicating that intelligence was gathered and processed from numerous Japanese government ministries and offices. The documents demonstrate intimate knowledge of internal Japanese deliberations on such issues as: agricultural imports and trade disputes; negotiating positions in the Doha Round of the World Trade Organization; Japanese technical development plans, climate change policy, nuclear and energy policy and carbon emissions schemes; correspondence with international bodies such as the International Energy Agency (IEA); strategy planning and draft talking points memoranda concerning the management of diplomatic relations with the United States and the European Union; and the content of a confidential Prime Ministerial briefing that took place at Shinzo Abe’s official residence.
Julian Assange, WikiLeaks Editor-in-Chief, said: “In these documents we see the Japanese government worrying in private about how much or how little to tell the United States, in order to prevent undermining of its climate change proposal or its diplomatic relationship. And yet we now know that the United States heard everything and read everything, and was passing around the deliberations of Japanese leadership to Australia, Canada, New Zealand and the UK. The lesson for Japan is this: do not expect a global surveillance superpower to act with honour or respect. There is only one rule: there are no rules.”
WikiLeaks Investigations Editor Sarah Harrison said: “Today’s publication shows us that the US government targeted sensitive Japanese industry and climate change policy. Would the effectiveness of Japan’s industry and climate change proposals be different today if its communications had been protected?”
Japan has been a close historical ally of the United States since the end of World War II. During a recent Presidential visit to Japan, US President Barack Obama described the East Asian country as “one of America’s closest allies in the world”. Today’s publication adds to previous WikiLeaks publications showing systematic mass spying conducted by US intelligence against the US-allied governments of Brazil “Bugging Brazil“, France “Espionnage Élysée” and Germany “The Euro Intercepts”; “All the Chancellor’s Men”.

A word of caution – in my opinion Wikileaks is not an entirely credible source. WUWT has documented at least one occasion where Mr. Assange bent the truth.
However, if the Wikileaks claim is true, it paints a disturbing picture of a US administration utterly obsessed with climate change, to the point that US covert assets are apparently being diverted from trying to catch terrorists, so the President has detailed inside information about what Japan thinks about Climate Change.
The Wikileaks press release also suggests Japan is less than enthusiastic about CO2 reductions. But given China, one of Japan’s main economic rivals, has been given a free pass to emit CO2 and grow their economy until 2030, Japan’s lack of enthusiasm for CO2 cutbacks should not be a surprise – though the Japanese also appear to be worried about offending the USA.

" A push to better recognise the economic value of “natural capital” – water systems, biodiversity, soil and carbon stores – has prompted the creation of what aims to be the world’s largest investment firm dedicated to projects that help the planet. Multinational financial services giant HSBC and Pollination, a boutique climate advisory and investment firm, announced a joint venture that they predicted would meet a multi-billion dollar demand for environmentally friendly investment beyond renewable energy.  In a statement on Wednesday, they said the new body would back projects in areas including sustainable forestry, regenerative agriculture, water supply improvement, bio-fuels and “blue carbon” capture in oceans and coastal ecosystems. Martijn Wilder, a Pollination founding partner and former chair of the Australian Renewable Energy Agency, said the newly created HSBC Pollination Climate Asset Management would accelerate investment that could help combat climate change and build biodiversity while generating long-term returns for institutional investors. He said meeting the goals of the Paris climate agreement, including keeping global warming as close to 1.5C above pre-industrial levels as possible, would require new ways of protecting nature at scale.  “Investing in the resilience of nature is investing in the resilience of the economy.” The venture, which was reached over Zoom during the Covid shutdown and is still subject to regulatory approval, follows other smaller ventures in natural capital investment, including by Mirova. It aims to attract backing from sovereign wealth and pension funds and institutional investors to raise US$1bn ($1.39bn) for an initial fund that will launch mid next year.  The companies said it would be followed by a carbon credit fund that they expected to raise US$2bn ($2.78bn). Wilder said it had been historically difficult to properly quantify the importance of ecological systems, leading to them being undervalued. “It is why we are fast approaching an environmental tipping point.” The UN, banks, investors and financial institutions and business organisations have called for a “green recovery” from the Covid-19 pandemic to simultaneously address the economic and climate crises. Several countries, including European Union members and South Korea, have backed green recovery measures, but an analysis by Bloomberg New Energy Finance in June found the vast majority of stimulus spending to that point was propping up the fossil fuel economy.  The Australian government has indicated it plans to support new gas infrastructure and projects to help the recovery from recession. A recent report by the World Economic Forum suggested a “nature-positive” economic transformation in the wake of Covid that changed practices in food, land and ocean use, extractive industries, energy and the built environment could accelerate the shift, generate US$10.1tn ($14tn) in annual revenue and create nearly 400m jobs over the next decade. HSBC Global Asset Management’s chief executive, Nicolas Moreau, said its clients were increasingly focused on environmental issues.  “This initiative is designed to help them achieve a financial return while at the same time creating a positive impact on the world’s biodiversity.”"

"There have never been two campaign gatherings like this week’s US Democratic convention and next week’s Republican one. Stripped to their essentials by the coronavirus pandemic, the 2020 conventions cannot match the energy of normal years. Yet the big speech by the presidential candidate at the convention remains a defining campaign moment, and this year is no different. The greater severity imposed by the virtual convention is also appropriate. For this is not a normal US election year. It is one in which the central contest between Donald Trump and Joe Biden will define the future of the United States and the world like few others. Because of the constraints, the Democratic convention lacked true razzmatazz. In that respect it was tailor-made for Mr Biden’s decent, stubborn but markedly unexciting political message. And yet the lack of glitz had certain advantages. It meant that the nightly coverage offered to American voters this week was more serious-minded. The televised broadcasts were full of ordinary people’s video accounts of what they are going through as a result of the pandemic, recession and racism. The format also meant that Mr Biden could use his acceptance speech to cut to the chase about the issues at stake in November’s election, rather than play up the rhetoric that would have been expected in a packed hall. In any case, Barack Obama had powerfully supplied that form of oratory the previous evening.  Mr Biden nevertheless delivered an effective and successful speech. He did not mention Mr Trump by name at any point. Yet everything he said in his 25-minute address was completely explicit about the profound contrast between the two candidates. America was experiencing “too much anger, too much fear, too much division”, he said. In the heart of the speech, he zeroed in on four policy crises which together define the choice voters must confront – the worst pandemic in a century, the worst economic crisis since the 1930s, the biggest movement for racial justice since the 1960s, and the “undeniable” threat of climate change. Together, these crises faced America with a perfect storm, through which Mr Biden promised “a path of hope and light”. Such language can sound vacuous, but Mr Biden was absolutely right about the four great issues. He has also usefully cast himself as the candidate of optimism. The Democratic leader made much of his claims to be a unifier. His choice of Kamala Harris as his running mate has helped. The convention also went some way to unite this party for the task to come. There were significant speeches from defeated rivals, notably Bernie Sanders, who has rallied behind Mr Biden since the primary season ended and played his hand well during subsequent policymaking processes. Elizabeth Warren made a strong and humane contribution too. Mr Obama’s speech was a stirring reaffirmation of his belief in an American system of democracy and justice which Mr Trump has done so much to undermine and in which the faith of many natural Democrats has been deeply challenged by events including police killings. Although Mr Biden is a candidate from the heart of old Democratic politics, it is worth noting that this year’s convention had a watershed feel because it was the first for decades not dominated by the Clintons. Mr Biden will not be an inherently exciting Democratic candidate. There are good reasons for asking whether he has either the vision or the capacity to turn post-Trump America around successfully. He is instinctively happier reaching out to the middle ground than driving the new radical agenda that the times also demand. But he came through this week much better than some feared. His campaign, like his life, has shown resilience and judgment. His offer of hope and light is well crafted for such dark times. Now Mr Biden must also beat Mr Trump. Now it gets harder. The world is willing him on."
"**On 17 February last year, a young Hong Kong couple's holiday in Taiwan went terribly wrong.**
The night before they were due to leave, the couple bought a large pink suitcase at one of Taipei's popular night markets.
Their hotel's CCTV footage showed the couple returning to their room with the suitcase. That was the last time the 20-year-old woman, Poon Hiu-wing, was seen alive.
The next morning, the footage showed her boyfriend Chan Tong-kai, who was 19 at the time, taking the suitcase, along with other luggage, out of the room to check out.
There was no sign of Ms Poon.
Chan was later seen pushing the suitcase through Taipei's busy subway stations. He took a flight back to Hong Kong that evening, alone.
It was a month later, after Ms Poon's father came to Taiwan to report her missing, that her body was found hidden in bushes, about 20 metres from a popular riverside trail in neighbouring New Taipei City.
""There was a stench, but no one thought there would be a dead body there,"" said Mr Chou, a long-time local resident.
""Sometimes as many as 10,000 dead fish would float up in the river here and it would smell bad, so everyone thought it was just the smell of dead fish.""
The Hong Kong authorities used Taiwan's request for Chan to be extradited as a reason for proposing a controversial bill to allow such extraditions.
The bill would have allowed criminal suspects to be sent to Taiwan, as well as mainland China.
The former British colony does not yet have an extradition agreement with Taiwan or mainland China. But many Hong Kongers took to the streets in protest at the plans.
Given China's human rights violations and heavily government-controlled judicial system, they feared the bill would harm Hong Kong's judicial autonomy, established under the ""one country, two systems"" principle.
Taiwan also strongly objected, accusing the Hong Kong government of using its request for Chan's extradition as an excuse to ram through the bill.
The bill has since been withdrawn due to widespread protests, but Chan's case is still in limbo.
**What happen** **ed** **on the night in question?**
According to Hong Kong's High Court document on the case, Chan and Ms Poon met in 2017 and became lovers a month later.
Ms Poon was five weeks' pregnant when, in December, Chan arranged a trip to Taiwan for the couple, paying for plane tickets and hotel accommodation.
After returning to the hotel on 16 February, they argued about how to pack the suitcase. They later made up but in the very early hours of 17 February, they argued again.
It was during that argument that Ms Poon told Chan the baby in her womb was conceived with her former boyfriend. Chan said Ms Poon then showed him a video of her having sex with another man.
Feeling angry, he smashed her head against the wall and strangled her from behind with both hands. They struggled on the floor for about 10 minutes until she was dead.
He then stuffed her body into the pink suitcase and packed her belongings into four plastic bags.
In the morning, Chan threw away Ms Poon's belongings in bins near the hotel and checked out, taking the suitcase with Ms Poon's body in it.
He took the subway for about 40 minutes to Zhuwei station, dragged the suitcase along the trail by the Danshui river, found some tall bushes off the path, took the body out and dumped it there.
He tossed the suitcase elsewhere, but kept her ATM card, digital camera and iPhone.
Before leaving Taipei, he used her ATM card to withdraw TWD20,000 (Â£507, $653) and after returning to Hong Kong, he used her card to withdraw money three times, totalling HK$19,200 (Â£1,900, $2,450).
Chan was arrested on 13 March by Hong Kong police, two days after her parents reported her missing. He was later charged with four counts of dealing with proceeds from a crime, commonly called money laundering.
During the investigation, he confessed that he had killed Ms Poon and revealed where he had dumped the body, according to the court document.
Liu Guan-wu, a Zhuwei police officer at the time, said he and around 30 other officers found the body after a three-hour search.
""We were looking for the suitcase initially, because we thought the body was still inside the suitcase,"" said Mr Liu.
""But when we found her, it was just her body there. He didn't dismember her; he simply curved her body to stuff it inside the suitcase. She was not a tall girl and she was skinny.
""The body was decomposed. There were no signs of injury.""
In Hong Kong, Chan pleaded guilty to money laundering and was sentenced to 29 months in prison, but the High Court reduced the sentence by a third.
On 18 October this year, days before Chan's release, the Hong Kong government released a statement about his ""alleged offence"" in Taiwan.
""The courts of Hong Kong have no jurisdiction over it,"" the statement said.
""Neither do the local authorities have any ground to extend Chan's detention or pursue the offence that he was alleged to have committed in Taiwan.""
The case has revealed the conflicted relations between Taiwan and Hong Kong - as well as the island and mainland China, which considers Taiwan a province that must be reunified one day.
It also highlights the unnatural state of affairs among the three sides - places so close to each other, but with no extradition or judicial cooperation agreements.
The long dispute over Taiwan's sovereignty - whether it's a part of China or not - makes forming such agreements, usually reached between countries, a very sensitive matter.
On Wednesday, the day he was released from Hong Kong's jail, Chan bowed deeply before a large crowd of TV cameras and journalists, apologised to Ms Poon's family, expressed hopes that she would rest in peace, and asked society for forgiveness.
But the bickering continued between Taiwan and Hong Kong.
Taiwan's authorities initially refused to accept Chan's surrender, even though they issued an arrest warrant for him.
They suspect the whole thing was orchestrated by Beijing to treat Taiwan as a part of China and had insisted Hong Kong first negotiate a judicial assistance agreement before handing over Chan.
Hong Kong's authorities dismissed that as ""nonsense"" and urged Taiwan to take a suspect willing to surrender himself, so as to give justice to Ms Poon and her family.
Police officer Mr Liu said he's handled other murders, but never one like this, not least because of the political battles involved.
""I hope the case can be dealt with quickly,"" he said. ""It must be really sad for her parents.""
Perhaps Chan is also eager to find closure.
""For my impulse, for the wrongful act I've committed, I'm willing to surrender and go back to Taiwan to face prison sentence and face trial,"" he told the media.
""To society and Hong Kong people, I can only say I'm sorry. I hope everyone can forgive me. I hope everyone can give me a chance to be a new person and give me a chance to give back to society."""

This month Education Minister Chris Hipkins changed the school system to **discourage** religious teaching in State schools. Previously it was an opt-out system but he has changed it to an opt in system. The opt-out system requires effort only from those opposed to religious instruction for their children but now that has been reversed. Now parents who support religious instruction are being treated as the minority and as such have to go out of their way in order for their children to be able to take part in it.



This is a **significant change** as it is treating Christianity as an abnormal/unusual choice instead of a mainstream choice relevant to the majority of the New Zealand population. It is a move designed to sideline and eventually remove religious instruction in schools, as parents are far **less likely** to opt-in than to opt-out because opting in will now take effort, which is the opposite of how the system previously worked.



Out with the old in with the new. Not coincidentally a[ **replacement religion**](https://thebfd.co.nz/2020/01/shane-jones-wallops-eco-bible-bashing-climate-change-wombles/) has been introduced to schools at the same time that Christianity is being pushed out the door.



[…] nature abhors a vacuum, and the Government had a quasi-religious substitute locked, loaded and ready to fill the gap. January 13 was also the date on which the far more significant news broke that climate change is to become part of the [school syllabus](https://thebfd.co.nz/2020/01/the-child-molesters-of-the-mind-pervert-more-nz-children/)[ ](https://www.stuff.co.nz/national/education/118909741/lets-respect-all-beliefs-in-schools-including-those-of-nonbelievers)for Years 7-10 pupils, which means those aged between 11 and 14.



[…] This was no sudden political impulse. The climate change curriculum emerged fully formed, with the Greens’ fingerprints all over it.



[…] Join the dots. Out goes religious instruction and in comes its secular substitute in the form of politically charged dogma surrounding climate change. The two announcements neatly complemented each other, serving as a kind of metaphor for wider political and social changes driven by the “progressive” Left.



[…] It is quite explicit about its goal, which is to groom a generation of climate change activists. Apparently drawing inspiration from Greta Thunberg, the teaching resource is threaded with statements such as: “Climate change poses a severe threat to children’s most basic rights”.



It’s a piece of work the Nazi propaganda minister Joseph Goebbels would have been proud to call his own – one that targets malleable young minds in much the same way as the Hitler Youth did in the 1930s.



[…]Guilt is an unstated sub-text throughout. The message is that Earth has been put at risk through greed and complacency and we must act fast before the process becomes irreversible.



In effect, schoolkids will be captive zealots in training. Indoctrination isn’t too strong a word for this, and it raises questions about the morality of using the public education system to impose adult anxieties and political convictions on the young.



[…] Valid scientific scepticism is caricatured as Donald Trump-style craziness.



Nowhere in the teaching resource is there any acknowledgement that many of the statements it makes are scientifically contestable.



[…] If climate change alarmism is the new religion, then scepticism – or denialism, to use the more damning term favoured by climate-change activists – is the new heresy.



There’s a disturbing whiff of totalitarianism in the way this secular religion permits no dissent. If you believe that it’s dangerous in a democracy to allow one view to hold unchallenged sway, denialism starts to look like an honourable stance, purely on principle.

Share this...FacebookTwitterLa Niña is coming: the Earth is cooling!
By Schneefan.
(Translated and condensed by P. Gosselin)
The warming El Niño weather phenomenon has been history since June 2016. The cool La Niña started in mid July 2016.
The daily anomalies in sea surface temperatures (SSTA) in the main Niño region 3.4 are now updated. In mid July it is in the La Niña zone at -0.74°K:

The plot above shows the daily SSTA with respect to the international climate mean of 1981-2010 in the main Niño region 3.4 with data from NOAA/CDAS (Climate Data Assimilation System). The SSTA reached and dipped below the -0.5°K mark in mid July. The latest value was -0.74°K (July 19, 2016). Source: www.tropicaltidbits.com/analysis/ocean/.
The following chart shows the current La Niña extending from the coast of Peru to the international dateline (180°):

The cold La Niña (blue at the equator) is shown developing. Source: www.tropicaltidbits.com/analysis/ocean/.
After a record warm February 2016 with an anomaly of +0.83°K using the unaltered UAH satellite data, the global temperature of the lower troposphere centered at 1500 meters fell by 0.49 K in June to +0.34°K, see the following chart:

UAH chart depicting monthly lower troposphere temperature anomaly (blue curve), along the 13-month smoothed moving average (red curve). Original text: “This gives a 2-month temperature fall of -0.37 deg. C, which is the second largest in the 37+ year satellite record…the largest was -0.43 deg. C in Feb. 1988. In the tropics, there was a record fast 2-month cooling of -0.56 deg. C, just edging out -0.55 deg. C in June 1998 (also an El Nino weakening year).“ Source: UAH Global Temperature Update for June 2016: +0.34 deg. C.

Finally, after months of disagreement, the major ENSO models are now almost in full agreement that La Niña conditions will start to take hold this summer, now that there is already a deviation of -0.7°K. See: http://www.bom.gov.au/Pacific-Ocean.
The ENSO model CFSv2 of the NOAA again looks totally confused, as it did in May. Today the ENSO monthly prognosis shows a broad scatter of +0.4°K to -2.2°K for January 2017, see following chart. That means: Nobody knows! 

The plot shows the CFSv2-ENSO prognosis from the NOAA July 17, 2016, for the monthly SSTA in the Nino region 3.4 up to April 2017. Source: www.cpc.ncep.noaa.gov/html.
The energy content of the water down to a depth of 300 m at the equatorial Pacific continues to show a negative anomaly for July 2016 at -1.0°K and thus has been in the cold La Niña range of under -0.5°K.

El Niño is dead – La Niña is coming! Source: www.cpc.ncep.noaa.gov/enso.shtml.
It is therefore not expected that a significant cooling will take place in July this year. Dr. Roy Spencer (UAH) has already pointed that out here:
Just remember, the temperature anomaly can also temporarily rebound for a month, as it did in late 1998.”
However, it is already clear from the unaltered satellite data of the first half of this year: 2016 will not be a record warm year.

"**Tourists are staying away and retailers are reeling after nearly five months of protests that have dealt a ""devastating"" blow to businesses in Hong Kong, and pushed the economy to the brink.**
Growth figures issued on Thursday showed Hong Kong has entered a technical recession, defined as two consecutive quarters of negative growth.
In the third quarter, Hong Kong's GDP shrank 3.2% from the previous quarter, which had seen a drop of 0.4%.
Ahead of the numbers, the city's leader Carrie Lam warned of a looming recession. She expects the economy to record negative growth for the year.
DBS economist Samuel Tse agrees the upcoming figures will show Hong Kong has sunk into recession - and expects more pain to come.
""We don't think it will rebound that fast,"" Mr Tse says.
The protests - which began over a proposed extradition bill between the territory and mainland China - have piled pressure on existing economic strains.
Hong Kong has been grappling with the US-China trade war, while a weaker yuan has hit spending from mainland visitors and bruised consumer sentiment.
The controversial extradition bill has been withdrawn, but demonstrations continued and evolved into demands for greater freedoms, and an independent inquiry into alleged police brutality.
Clashes between police and activists have become increasingly violent, with police firing live bullets and protesters attacking officers and throwing petrol bombs.
Those dramatic scenes have kept tourists away.
In August, arrivals to the city - a popular travel destination and transit hub - hit their worst level since the SARS crisis of 2003. Visitor numbers are expected to plunge nearly 50% in October compared to the previous year.
Many hotels are struggling to fill their rooms and Mr Tse says the vacancy rate is sitting around 60%.
Some hotels have slashed prices in the hopes of winning back tourists, while reports suggest many have forced staff to cut work hours or take leave to cope with the slowdown.
Among those to have taken a hit is Ovolo Group. The firm, which operates four hotels in Hong Kong, has seen occupancy rates fall by up to 30% over the past three months.
""It's devastating to see the effect that the recent situation in our city has had on local businesses, particularly those of us in the hospitality industry,"" Ovolo Group's chief executive Girish Jhunjhnuwala says.
Mr Jhunjhnuwala says business is holding up better on weekdays as most guests choose to leave before the weekend, when protests typically kick off. The firm has introduced flexible cancellation policies to help offset uncertainty for guests.
With fewer tourists flying in, airlines have also been knocked. Days of protests at Hong Kong's airport in August, one of the world's busiest transit hubs, led to widespread flight cancelations.
Hong Kong's flagship carrier Cathay Pacific has seen a sharp drop in passenger numbers to the territory in the past two months, while Qantas said the protests would hit first-half earnings by A$25m ($17m; Â£13m).
Lighter tourist flows have weighed on retailers in the city, many already battling with softening consumer sentiment from local shoppers.
Some shops have been forced to shorten trading hours while workers report fears over their safety as protests have turned violent.
Certain businesses have faced direct attacks.
Vandals have targeted big mainland firms like Bank of China and tech company Xiaomi. Stations along Hong Kong's MTR metro system have also repeatedly been attacked, vandalised or even set on fire.
The chaos has led to a sharp fall in retail sales, down 23% in August, the biggest drop on record. The decline in September is expected to be even worse.
Additionally, the long-running unrest has shaken business confidence and frustrated investment. That could have a more lasting impact on the economy, Mr Tse says, as questions and uncertainty remain over Hong Kong's future as a financial hub.
The city has so far injected more than HK$20bn to combat the slowdown including help for the transport, tourism and retail sectors. More relief measures are expected.
But the government argues there's only so much it can do to stem the economic slide.
""To truly cure the problem, we must always work together to stop the violence, stop the destruction of traffic infrastructure and specific target shops, banks and institutionsâ¦ and let the society recover as soon as possible,"" Hong Kong's Financial Secretary Paul Chan said in a blog post.
""Our society and the economy need to take a breather and need to get back on the road."""
"WASHINGTON  —   When President Obama relied heavily on executive orders to push through policies that had no chance in Congress, Republicans called him a dictator who abused his power and disregarded the Constitution. They even took him to court. “We have an increasingly lawless presidency where he is actually doing the job of Congress, writing new policies and laws without going through Congress,” Representative Paul D. Ryan, then the Budget Committee chairman, said in a 2014 television interview after Mr. Obama made clear in his State of the Union address that he would readily take unilateral action to get his way. Now President Trump, at the start of his tenure, is relying heavily on executive actions not just to reverse Obama administration initiatives, but to enact new federal policies covering immigration, health care and other areas in ways that could be seen more as the province of the House and Senate. And he is doing that with clear Republican majorities in Congress. The flurry of administration edicts flowing from the Trump White House puts some top Republicans in the awkward position of welcoming aggressive executive muscle flexing from a president of their own party after castigating Mr. Obama for using the same approach. Their rationale: Mr. Obama took executive action too far, stretching the intent of legislation to fulfill an ideological agenda. “We’ve never been against executive action,” said Ashlee Strong, a spokeswoman for Mr. Ryan, now the House speaker. “We’re against overreaching, illegal action. ” Mr. Trump’s eager embrace of the executive order  —   he signaled clearly during his campaign that he intended to follow his predecessor’s lead  —   allows him to claim immediate progress on his campaign promises rather than waiting for a lengthy legislative process to play out. Many of his major proposals  —   building a border wall, hiring more border and immigration officers, creating a new office for victims of crimes committed by immigrants in the country illegally  —   will presumably require funding by Congress, and that is no certainty in the current political environment. The question then becomes how Mr. Trump would proceed if Congress balks. House Republicans are currently suing the executive branch  —   and winning  —   in a case that argues the Obama administration spent more than $13 billion on health insurance subsidies without necessary congressional approval in a clear breach of the Constitution. The health care executive order issued by Mr. Trump last week directed federal officials to find ways to minimize the financial burden of the health care law on governments, health care providers and others. Many saw the move as a backdoor attempt by the new White House to undermine the current law of the land while Republicans try to figure out a way to repeal it. It was the reverse of the type of action Republicans criticized President Obama for  —   using his executive powers to prop up the health care law without sufficient authority. But there were no loud complaints from Republicans this time, a fact not lost on Democrats. “Congressional Republicans’ hypocritical acquiescence to President Trump’s executive orders is an abdication of their responsibility to govern, especially in light of their vocal opposition to even the most restrained use of executive authority by President Obama,” said Representative Nancy Pelosi of California, the Democratic leader. But some Republicans are wary too. Even as they welcome the opportunities opened up by having an ally in the White House, some worry that the continued emphasis on executive actions is just another step in the dilution of legislative power. “We need to go back to being the legislative branch,” said Representative Ileana   a Florida Republican opposed to a potential executive order by Mr. Trump that would end a special program allowing younger illegal immigrants to remain in the United States. “We didn’t like this when Obama was doing it, so why should we accept it now?” Other Republicans were hoping the start of a new administration would allow a reset between the executive branch and a legislative branch that has seen its influence steadily erode as lawmakers surrender power and responsibility to the administrative side. Mr. Trump’s broad assertion of executive power could make any rebalancing difficult to achieve, though lawmakers say they intend to keep pushing. “The imperial presidency was not created overnight and it will not be undone overnight,” said Senator Mike Lee, Republican of Utah, who is leading an effort called the Article I Project to try to recapture some lost authority for the House and Senate. Mr. Lee and Ms. Strong of the speaker’s office said a good first step in Congress’s reasserting itself would be enactment of a bill passed by the House this month requiring congressional approval of major new rules being pushed by federal agencies. If it could clear the Senate, Mr. Trump has said he would sign it in what would represent a major victory for congressional Republicans trying to rein in the regulatory power of the executive branch. Still, Mr. Trump’s early focus on pushing his agenda through executive actions underscores a fundamental truth of presidencies. New occupants of the White House tend not to surrender power accumulated by their predecessors. They tend to build on it."
"BEIRUT, Lebanon  —   There was once a nice sea view at the Al Jazira beach club, and umbrellas of palm fronds sticking from the sand are reminders of nicer days. Nowadays, the place is surrounded by an   garbage dump. “It used to be a beach,” said Hassan, a Syrian man who works as a caretaker at the club and insisted on being identified only by his first name because of a lawsuit concerning the landfill. “There was sea. There were rocks. I used to fish. ” Just up the shoreline, Mohammed Jradi, who has been fishing the waters of the Mediterranean off Beirut for 20 years, said the trash had driven even the fish away. “All over the world, they have solutions for this, but not here,” he said. There is no end, it seems, to Lebanon’s trash crisis, a potent symbol of the dysfunctional,   politics that define this tiny country  —   just half the size of Vermont, the journalist and historian David Hirst has noted. When trash piles built up across this city two years ago, enveloping Beirut in a nasty stench, they spawned a protest movement, called “You Stink,” against the political class. Now, the latest episode of the crisis has become a uniquely Lebanese story, entwining bird migration, civil aviation, mysterious gunmen and the long story of Lebanon’s struggle to become a functioning state that can at least take care of its trash, more than 25 years after emerging from a long civil war. Last year, as a   solution to the garbage crisis, the municipality opened the Costa Brava landfill here on the shoreline, not far from Beirut’s Rafic Hariri International Airport. And so for many visitors to Beirut, a city whose   architecture, great cuisine and French colonial influences are otherwise enchanting, the first thing to greet them was a strong whiff of garbage. The landfill also attracted birds  —   lots of them  —   not just the sea gulls that normally fly around the coast, but others on migratory patterns from Europe and North Africa. “In other words,” wrote one local blogger, “a giant free Lebanese restaurant for birds. ” More seriously, this posed a problem to civil aviation. When an airliner with Lebanon’s Middle East Airlines hit a bird this month  —   an episode that recalled Capt. Chesley Sullenberger’s crash landing in the Hudson River eight years ago after hitting a flock of birds  —   Lebanon’s trash problem suddenly became a matter of aviation safety. Almost immediately, gunmen showed up on the coast line, apparently deployed by the government to shoot the birds out of the sky, raising the ire of environmental activists, not to mention the fishermen. “I used to see sea gulls everywhere,” Mr. Jradi said. “But today there are none. They were shot down. ” He added: “Of course, I am missing them. They were entertainment for us. For me, it was an entertaining scene, watching them fly. ” Activists have said that the killing of the birds was in violation of the Barcelona Convention, which aims to protect wildlife in coastal regions of the Mediterranean, and that the government could have found other solutions, like using tranquilizer guns on the birds. “Lebanon is an important bird area,” said Paul Abi Rached, a prominent Lebanese environmental activist, noting that millions of birds from Europe and North Africa pass through Lebanon each year on migratory patterns. “So what you are killing are not Lebanese birds,” he said. “They are the birds of Europe. That is the catastrophe. ” The chairman of Middle East Airlines, Lebanon’s national carrier, told an interviewer with the TV channel MTV this month that the safety of airline passengers was more important than the lives of birds, saying that the hunters would continue their work as needed. The garbage problem has long been a symbol of a failure of Lebanese politics, one that activists say has its roots in the time shortly after the country’s civil war, which ended in 1990. Soon after the war ended, the government set up a trash collection company, called Sukleen, that was connected to political parties and over the years became a vehicle for corruption, say activists. This thwarted the possibility of other solutions, like recycling, and in a country as small as Lebanon it has been hard to find enough space for landfills. “Lebanon is a very densely populated place,” said Habib Battah, the founder of the news website Beirut Report, who has written about the Costa Brava landfill. “Other countries have big, open spaces, but we don’t have that. ” He said that in the long term, recycling was the answer, because when trying to find new places for trash dumps, “wherever you go in Lebanon there is a village nearby. ” Mr. Battah said the problems with garbage went back to the decision at the end of the war to privatize trash collection. He said that Lebanon offered a lesson to other postwar societies on the dangers of rushing into privatization too fast, and that he often wished he could bring   libertarians to Lebanon for a field trip to see what can happen in the absence of strong government regulations. “Basically, when you do that, people in power get richer,” he said. Public services across the board, not just trash collection, have long suffered in Lebanon, he said, forcing political leaders to confront a difficult question: “What do you fix first? The water? The garbage? The internet?”"
"Rosanne Bloom and her family had just settled into their seats on a flight from Philadelphia to Turks and Caicos Islands on Christmas morning when two airline employees ordered Dr. Bloom, her husband and two boys off the plane. Their luggage had already been removed. The problem? Dr. Bloom had informed the crew that her teenage sons had severe nut allergies. “I said, ‘We have our medicine. We brought our own food, and we’re comfortable staying on the plane.’ I offered to sign a waiver,” said Dr. Bloom, an orthodontist in Clarksville, Md. “We were off the plane in two minutes. ” Matt Miller, a spokesman for American Airlines, said such decisions are left to the pilot. “The pilot determined it would be best for the family not to travel based on the severity of the allergy and the need to divert the airline if anyone were eating nuts,” he said. Airline carriers have a long tradition of serving peanuts on flights, and often serve little else. But the practice also presents a challenge to travelers with severe nut allergies, who can suffer a reaction simply by touching a surface that has been exposed to nuts. But tensions between passengers with food allergies and airline staff members have risen in recent years, as airlines have begun to enforce stricter rules related to preboarding passengers. In the past, parents of young children could board the plane early, giving them a chance to wipe down seats, trays and armrests to reduce exposure to allergens. But today many airlines have stopped letting families with children board before other passengers. When families request permission to preboard  —   or pose another request, such as asking whether nuts will be served  —   they risk being taken off the flight or threatened with removal, said Mary Vargas, a lawyer whose family was almost kept off a plane from London back to the United States in December because of a nut allergy. Now families with nut allergies are waging a legal challenge against such policies. Two formal complaints filed with the Department of Transportation in the last month accuse American Airlines of discrimination against passengers with allergies. The complaints cite the airline’s preboarding policy, which  prohibits preboarding specifically for people with allergies, and not for others. “This is about being allowed to fly like everybody else in the United States,” said Ms. Vargas, the lawyer representing the families. Although nobody tracks medical emergencies on airplanes, studies show that   medical emergencies are relatively uncommon and affect only a fraction of the estimated 3. 6 billion passengers who fly each year. Chest pain and cardiovascular events are the most common reason planes are diverted for a medical emergency. Allergic reactions make up fewer than 4 percent of all   medical emergencies, according to a 2013 study published in the Western Journal of Emergency Medicine. Notably, American Airlines, which operates one of the largest fleets of planes in the world, does not even serve peanuts. But it does have a peanut policy, in which it states: “Requests that we not serve any particular foods, including tree nuts, on our flights cannot be granted. We are not able to provide nut ‘buffer zones,’ nor are we able to allow passengers to   to wipe down seats and tray tables. ” “Ultimately we cannot guarantee customers will not be exposed to peanuts or other nuts during the flight, and allowing people with nut allergies to preboard can create a false sense of security and does not eliminate risk,” Mr. Miller said. Individuals who suffer from severe,   food allergies can experience swelling and difficulty breathing after even a mild exposure. They usually carry an   which contains epinephrine, a medication that can reverse the symptoms. But in the case of a severe reaction, a person may still need urgent access to a medical facility. Research has shown that taking steps like creating buffer zones, in which nearby passengers are asked to refrain from eating nut products, and wiping down seats and trays may reduce the risk of an allergic reaction in flight. One of the complaints, filed on Dec. 28, is from Nicole Mackenzie, the mother of a    with   allergies to peanuts, tree nuts and seeds. She was not allowed to preboard to clean the seat before the family’s trip last fall from Portland, Ore. to Charlotte, N. C. The second complaint was filed on Jan. 10 on behalf of Food Allergy Research  Education (FARE) an organization that represents individuals with all kinds of food allergies. “American Airlines’s action was clearly discriminatory,” said FARE’s chief executive officer and chief medical officer, Dr. James Baker Jr. “It has a defined policy that they put on their website, and the only people they single out from preboarding are people with food allergies. ” Lianne Mandelbaum, whose son has allergies, tracks the experiences of travelers with allergies on her website, the No Nut Traveler. She said that each airline makes its own rules but that the policies are inconsistently enforced, so travelers often don’t know what to expect when they make travel plans. “It’s like playing Russian roulette,” said Michael Silverman, a psychologist in New York City whose    daughter, Sydney, has a severe allergy, but who is reluctant to raise the subject for fear of being kicked off a plane. The Department of Transportation is investigating the complaints, officials said, adding in an email that severe allergies are considered a disability under the Air Carrier Access Act, which regulates air travel, if they impact one’s ability to breathe “or substantially impact another major life activity. ” The nut industry has lobbied against restricting nut consumption on airplanes, and Congress has prohibited the Department of Transportation from imposing any restrictions. Some airlines are more accommodating to passengers with food allergies.  Jet Blue will create a   “buffer zone” around an allergic passenger. Southwest will avoid serving peanuts if flight attendants know an allergic passenger is on board. Delta’s policy is also to refrain from serving peanuts if an allergic passenger is onboard. But interviews with nearly a dozen families and young adults with severe allergies suggest that many people worry about being removed from a flight if they ask whether nuts will be served. Ana Govorko, a hospital administrator from Princeton, N. J. said that in July she and her teenage daughter and adult son were ordered off a Lufthansa jet bound from New York for Munich and Trieste, Italy. She had informed the gate attendant that her daughter has severe allergies and she was carrying medication. The family waited in the airport for seven hours, trying to find another flight, while airline employees, “were joking about her allergies,” Ms. Govorko said. “They were very rude. It was shocking. ” Ms. Govorko was able to get on another Lufthansa flight departing from Newark the next day. A Lufthansa spokeswoman, Christina Semmel, said that the Govorkos were allowed to fly after presenting a letter from her daughter’s physician, but Ms. Govorko says she had presented the letter when she tried to board the first flight. Laura Ilsley, a mother of two now living in Travis, Calif. had a similar experience last April, when she and her husband, who is in the military, were flying from Incirlik, Turkey, along with their son and    daughter, who is severely allergic to peanuts. When Ms. Ilsley informed Air France of her daughter’s allergies, the airline’s agents said the crew planned to serve peanuts and would not alter their plans, and said the family was “not welcome on board,” Ms. Ilsley said. Eventually, an Air France manager was able to get the family on a Delta flight, where the crew made an announcement that a child with a severe allergy to peanuts was on board and that pretzels and cookies would be offered instead. “The staff was very kind and it went off without a hitch,” Ms. Ilsley said. In a statement, Air France said the flight crew had “determined it was not in the best interest of the passenger to board the flight on such short notice,” and that “the case was handled with concern for passenger safety as the top priority. ” Dr. Silverman’s daughter, Sydney, said she actually had a very good experience when she flew on Delta from Palm Beach, Fla. back to New York City over the Martin Luther King weekend. A flight attendant noticed she was wiping down her seat and asked if she was allergic to peanuts. Sydney said that she was, but that it was O. K. to serve nuts. Nevertheless, the attendant “turned to the people in the row in front of me and in back of me and asked, ‘Is it O. K. if I don’t serve you peanuts on the flight?’ And they all said yes,” Sydney said. “And then she went on the intercom and said they weren’t going to serve peanuts because someone on the flight has an allergy, and if people brought peanuts to please not eat them. “And it made me feel thankful,” she said. “No one’s ever done anything like that before. ”"

A recent _Science_ article with the catchy title “Classroom Confusion” is as fine a case of political spin as one can find. The study it reports is actually pretty good, but the report is atrocious. There is an important message here, because the topic is climate change, which is arguably the most political scientific debate in history. This is spin over science.





The study is a modest survey of middle and high school science teachers, about 1500 in all, conducted by the Penn State Survey Research Center. Unlike prior surveys, this one involves a lot of selection of respondents and weighting of responses. The goal is to match the small sample to the actual demographics of American education. It is an elaborate and interesting process but this has nothing to do with the questions asked in the survey, which is where the spin comes in.



They apparently ask two kinds of questions. (Strangely, the survey questions are not provided in the online Supplementary Materials.)





Rather than being settled, the question of how much of global warming is due to human activity, and how much is from other causes is still unanswered.



The first are procedural questions. These have do with such things as whether global warming is included in the curriculum and if so, how much time is taken, how much the debate is discussed, etc. The findings are that global warming is widely discussed, but typically for just a few class sessions. This makes sense because the issue is widely known, but the science curriculum is very crowded.



Then there apparently are a bunch of questions about the teacher. This is a bit murky but the focus seems to be how much the teacher knows about the global warming issues and what they think about them. This is where the spin begins.



The problem is that the authors are proponents of the dogmatic view that there is a ‘consensus’ within science, according to which humans are the dominant cause of (dangerous) global warming. The problem with that synthesis is evident in any graph showing global surface average temperature since 1900, shown above.



There’s clearly a substantial warming early in the 20th Century, roughly from 1910 to 1945. This was largely before the major emissions of carbon dioxide, which commenced with the War, so that’s not likely to be caused by human activity. The second period of warming, from the late 1970s through the late 90s is of similar magnitude and certainly does have some characteristics that would largely (though not completely) associate it with emissions, but it cannot be distinguished in magnitude from the earlier warming (Note the spikes in 1998 and 2015 are caused by strong El Niño events. Because of that, it is not clear that the world has indeed resumed warming at the previous rate.)



The bottom line is—given the caveat about 2015—it would appear that as much warming occurred naturally as could be attributed to human activity.



The authors of the _Science_ paper ignore this. When they found that many teachers do not agree and are teaching that a substantial component of global warming may be natural, they went on a bit of a rhetorical rampage, accusing the teachers of being ignorant and confused.



This grossly unscientific behavior is probably explained by the presence of the National Center for Science Education. NCSE is a political activist organization, not a science shop. They are strident proponents of the dogmatic ‘consensus’ view. It appears that NCSE funded this study, plus providing three of the five co‐​authors. So no wonder it is stridently political.



In short, the title “classroom confusion” is a political statement, not a scientific finding. Much of the article is similarly political. Science should not have published this article, because it is not science. The scientific finding is that the climate debate is alive and well in the classroom, as it is in the nation. This is good news.



Not surprisingly, reports have amplified the article’s error. For example, a _Washington Post_ article on this study begins with the title: “How teachers are getting it wrong on climate change.” The very first sentence then claims that the idea that global warming may be a natural process is an “incorrect idea.” It’s very clear from the data shown above that a substantial portion indeed is _not_ because of carbon dioxide emissions.



Rather than being settled, the question of how much of global warming is due to human activity, and how much is from other causes is still unanswered. Teachers who recognize this are hardly espousing an “incorrect idea.”

"It’s illegal in the UK for anyone to release grey squirrels into the wild from December 2019. This means that wildlife rescue centres in England which previously took in, rehabilitated and released wild grey squirrels, will instead have to kill them, on both practical and ethical grounds. The campaign against grey squirrels is justified by the UK government, which insists that grey squirrels threaten native wildlife and harm the economy. The cost to UK forestry is estimated to be £10 million per year, including damage to timber caused by the grey squirrel’s habit of stripping bark from trees. But that cost also includes money spent on controlling grey squirrels, and there is no link between how much is spent on controlling their numbers and reducing damage to trees. So killing grey squirrels is not necessarily money well spent. There are also glaring contradictions in what is considered invasive and what needs to be controlled. There are 11 million pet cats in the UK, which kill about 27 million wild birds each year and around 92 million wild prey in total. It’s often argued that killing grey squirrels is justified as they predate bird nests. They do, and so do red squirrels. But there is scant evidence that squirrels have a significant impact on songbirds. While domestic and feral cats decimate songbird populations, they’re unlikely to be targeted for culls any time soon. Why is it acceptable for animal shelters to rescue an invasive alien species, the domestic cat, and for the public to allow them to roam free, but unacceptable for wildlife rescue centres to help and release a few grey squirrels?

      In defence of the grey squirrel, Britain's most unpopular invader


 On an even greater scale, the game bird industry releases millions of non-native birds – 35 million pheasants and six-and-a-half million red-legged partridges – into the British countryside each year, to be shot for sport. The total mass of pheasants released annually exceeds that of the entire breeding population of native birds. There’s evidence that pheasants affect local plant communities by increasing the area of bare ground and changing the soil chemistry. They’re also significant predators of native adders, a species of major conservation concern, and the extremely rare sand lizard. Pheasants also cause around a million road accidents each year. When grey squirrels are singled out for strict release control on the EU hit list of Invasive Alien Species, why aren’t pheasants? Many of the UK’s native predators are killed to maximise the density of game birds for hunters to shoot. Snares can be legally used to kill foxes and dogs can be legally used to flush foxes out of cover to be shot. Stoats and weasels can be killed in snap traps. Bird traps used under general licence capture and kill corvids and gulls.  Compared to the 11 million domestic cats and more than 40 million non-native game birds, there are only an estimated 2.5 million grey squirrels living in the UK, and 700 are taken into captivity each year. The environmental impact of releasing a handful of grey squirrels – particularly in areas where red squirrels are absent – is likely negligible. Should the UK commit to the relentless killing of grey squirrels in perpetuity? Too often the default response to a “problem” animal is simply to kill it. But just about everybody accepts the impossibility of eradicating grey squirrels. The only successful local eradication happened in Anglesey in Wales, where 9,597 grey squirrels were killed at a cost of £1,019,000 – that’s £106.18 per squirrel, and it took 16 years. I would recommend alternative methods to limit grey squirrels, and to encourage natural processes that can set a new ecological balance. These alternatives to trapping and shooting include developing oral contraceptives to prevent grey squirrels reproducing and managing woodlands to benefit reds over greys, by planting more conifer trees and allowing pine martens to return. Research continues to develop a squirrel pox vaccine that would inoculate red squirrels against the disease that greys carry. An area-specific licensing system could also be maintained, whereby rescue centre greys are only released in areas with no red squirrels and no commercial forestry concerns. Elsewhere, it might make little sense for wildlife rescue centres to put time, effort and money into caring for animals that, upon release, would be targeted by a cull. But the point of rescue centres isn’t principally conservation, it’s about animal welfare and well-being. Too often, when an animal is referred to as a pest or an invasive species, any concerns for their welfare go out the window. In the meantime, my advice to the public is to leave injured or orphaned grey squirrels be. They are better off taking their chances in the wild."

These are meltwater streams and rivers on the surface of the western area of the Greenland Ice Sheet.CREDIT Dr Andrew Sole, University of Sheffield
From the UNIVERSITY OF EDINBURGH and the “note the soot on the ice in the image they included above” department:
Satellites shed light on Greenland Ice Sheet response to warming
Parts of Greenland’s ice sheet have been found to be less vulnerable to climate warming than was thought – a discovery that could have a small but beneficial impact on sea level forecasts.
Satellite images have revealed that despite dramatic increases in ice melt across Greenland in recent years, the speed of ice movement in some areas has slowed down rather than accelerated.
The finding, observed on a sector of the ice sheet that terminates on land rather than in the ocean, will help scientists improve predictions of how quickly Greenland’s ice will be lost in a warming climate.
Until recently, scientists thought that the increased volumes of meltwater from Greenland’s ice in response to climate warming would speed up the motion of all parts of the ice sheet by helping the ice slide more rapidly.
However, their latest study shows that in recent decades, ice movement in some areas that terminate on land has slowed down rather than accelerated. The discovery suggests that further increases in ice melting, fuelled by climate change, may further slow movement of these sectors of the ice sheet.
A team of researchers from the University of Edinburgh used satellite data to track the shift of ice features such as crevasses in an 8000km2 area of Greenland over three decades. They found that, despite a 50 per cent rise in meltwater from the ice surface in recent years, overall movement in the past 10 years was slower than in previous decades.
They found that this was caused by large amounts of meltwater produced in summer producing channels at the base of the ice sheet, which drain away water efficiently, slowing the glacier’s movement the subsequent winter.
Scientists say more research is needed to understand the movement of other parts of the ice sheet, which terminate in the ocean and which have seen acceleration in recent decades.
The study, published in Nature, was carried out in collaboration with the Université Savoie Mont-Blanc in France and the University of Sheffield.
Andrew Tedstone of the University of Edinburgh’s School of GeoSciences, who led the study, said: “A large sector of the Greenland Ice Sheet has slowed down, despite sustained warming in the past decade. However, the ice sheet’s overall contribution to sea level rise continues to accelerate in two ways – through increases in surface melting and the movement of glaciers which terminate in the ocean.”

"Janet Napolitano, president of the University of California, knows exactly what’s at stake if President Trump shuts down an Obama administration program that has given work permits and protection from deportation to some 752, 000 young undocumented immigrants. In 2012, in her previous job as secretary of Homeland Security, she signed the document  —   nothing more than a policy memo  —   that created the program. So when alarm spread among immigrants on college campuses following Mr. Trump’s election, Ms. Napolitano moved quickly to determine what the California system could do to shelter its students if he carried through on his pledges to cancel the program, Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals. The university estimates that almost 3, 800 among its 190, 000 students are undocumented, many but not all with DACA. Ms. Napolitano, retaining her law enforcement instincts, does not mention the word “sanctuary” when describing what the university could offer. “Sanctuary is such a vague term, we don’t use it,” she said crisply. Instead, the university has published detailed principles of support for undocumented students, including assurances that campus police would not question students solely about their immigration status or join any cooperation agreements with federal immigration authorities under the Trump administration. Through the Davis campus law school, the university is organizing legal help for students detained for deportation. Another worrisome prospect, Ms. Napolitano said, is that students could lose the permits that allow them to work. Undocumented students, including any losing DACA, will continue to pay   tuition and be eligible for state financial aid and for a revolving loan program funded, in part, by the university. “We want to do everything we can so students are safe on our campuses,” Ms. Napolitano said, “so they can focus on what they are there to do, which is to study. ” Students at dozens of college campuses, galvanized by Mr. Trump’s depictions of immigrants as criminals or potential terrorists, have pressed administrators to provide sanctuary for those without legal papers. But universities have had differing ideas about what that would mean in practice, and most leaders have been careful to say they would not defy the law. Some institutions have flatly rejected sanctuary plans as encouraging lawbreaking. At New Mexico State University, the president, Garrey Carruthers, said that banning federal agents from campus might imperil its federal funding. One of the first presidents to declare a sanctuary campus explicitly was Michael S. Roth of Wesleyan, who announced in November that it “will not voluntarily assist” any efforts by federal authorities to deport students (a policy he reaffirmed on Jan. 29). Soon after, John Coatsworth, the provost of Columbia University, said that it would not allow immigration agents on campus without a warrant. Some administrators point out that student information, including their immigration status, is already protected under   privacy laws requiring the authorities to show a warrant or court order before any data can be released without students’ consent. In Georgia, Emory, which is a private university, considered but ultimately decided against protective measures. “Emory is not seeking to establish itself as a sanctuary campus, for which there is no legal definition,” the university said in a Jan. 4 statement. Taking a tougher line, the University System of Georgia said that any call for sanctuary was “unacceptable” and added, “We expect our institutions to follow the law. ” In his first formal briefing, on Jan. 23, Sean Spicer, the White House press secretary, suggested that canceling DACA would not be a priority for the new administration, but he did not provide any explicit reassurance that the program would continue. Ms. Napolitano is still contemplating the bitter possibility that Mr. Trump will sweep away her most significant immigration accomplishment. She hopes to persuade him that the program is a good use of executive power, emphasizing that DACA immigrants pose little security risk because they pass background checks to get into the program. Her message for Mr. Trump: “Why waste resources trying to deport good students who’ve done everything right?”"
"**Students have held protests at a UK university over issues that have sparked violence in Hong Kong.**
Two groups gathered at the University of Reading's campus, one supporting Hong Kong's protesters and another supporting mainland China.
Some eyewitnesses said the atmosphere was ""very hostile"" between the two groups, but others taking part said they had ""peacefully discussed"" issues.
A university spokesman said students had been ""peacefully protesting"".
He added a small group of students who ""had planned to show support for Hong Kong"" had been met by people ""waving Chinese flags"".
He said he was ""not aware of there being any clashes between the two groups"".
However, Abi Jones, 19, said the atmosphere was ""very hostile and very uncomfortable"" and ""people were thinking something was going to break out"".
Protests in Hong Kong started in June against proposals to allow extradition to mainland China.
Clashes between police and activists have become increasingly violent, with police firing live bullets and protesters attacking officers and throwing petrol bombs.
**Andre Rhoden-Paul, BBC News**
Students wore yellow helmets, goggles and gas masks - the symbol of resistance to the Hong Kong government's clampdown on protests.
Except these students were thousands of miles away at Reading University.
For them, this gathering was about showing solidarity with their friends back home protesting for Hong Kong's autonomy, and spreading this message to fellow students on campus.
Similarly, students supporting mainland China felt compelled to defend China's position, proudly flying their flag.
Stephen Chan, 24, said the gathering in Reading was to ""raise awareness to students and staff at the university about the situation in Hong Kong"".
He said he and others had promoted the event online and ""then the Chinese students started forming up their group against us"".
Mr Chan said: ""At first we thought they would cause violence so that's why we told security, but now we've peacefully discussed what's been happening in Hong Kong.""
Rachel, who is a supporter of the Chinese government but did not want to give her surname, said she attended the gathering ""to explain myself and my country's position"".
""Most of them are very nice to talk to,"" she added."

Naturally, the Real Clear Science headline actually read…
Greenland Lost 9 Trillion Tons of Ice in Century
Which sounds even more serious than the original headline…

Greenland has lost 9,000 billion tons of ice in a century
One would think that the fact that 99.7% of Greenland’s ice sheet survived the 20th Century might just be more scientifically relevant than a 0.3% loss… But I guess that doesn’t make for a very dramatic headline.
Here’s the math…
First I converted 9 trillion tons to metric tonnes.
9,000,000,000,000 tons = 8,164,662,660,000 tonnes
Then I converted tonnes to gigatonnes.
8,164,662,660,000 tonnes = 8,165 gigatonnes
Then I converted  gigatonnes of ice to cubic kilometers, assuming 1 Gt = 1 km3.
8,165 Gt ~ 8,165 km3
Note: This conversion is inexact because ice is slightly less dense than water.  But it is close enough for this exercise.
Now that I roughly knew the volume of ice loss during the 20th century, I needed to know how much ice volume was still in place. I chose to rely on the USGS and their figure of 2,600,000 km3.
So now I could calculate the percentage of ice volume which survived the 20th century…
The ice volume at the onset of the 20th century should be…
2,600,000 km3 + 8,165 km3 = 2,608,165 km3
Converting to percentage surviving the 20th century…
2,600,000 km3 / 2,608,165 km3 = 0.997 = 99.7%
 
To put the math into perspective, I’m going to actually rely on the SkepScibots…
1 gigatonne of ice is big… Much bigger than an Olympic sized swimming pool.
So, throughout the 20th century, Greenland lost about 8,165 gigatonne ice cubes.  8,165 km3 equates to a 20 km x 20 km x 20 km cube of ice (3√ 8,165 = 20.136565).  That would be one big@$$ cube of ice!
However, it’s not even a tiny nick when spread out over roughly 1.7 million square kilometers of ice surface.  That works out a sheet of ice about 5 meters thick.
 
2,600,000 km3 / 1,700,000 km2 = 1.53 km
The average thickness of the Greenland ice sheet is approximately 1.5 km (1,500 meters).  5 meters is obviously 0.3% of 1,500 meters.
Isopach map of Greenland ice sheet (Wikipedia).  The “Lost Ice Cube” represents 8,165 cubic kilometers of ice.
 
From a thickness perspective, 5 meters looks like this…
 
Radar Cross Section of Greenland Ice Sheet (Source: Columbia University).  Note that even with a vertical exaggeration of 75 x, 5 meters is insignificant.
The red line along the top of the cross section is approximately 5 meters thick. Here is an enlarged view…

While my math may not be exact, estimates of the volume of the Greenland ice sheet vary from 2.6 to 5.5 × 106 km3.  The difference between 2.6 and 5.5 million cubic kilometers of ice is quite a bit larger than 9,000 gigatonnes.  For that matter, GRACE derived estimates of recent (2003-2011) ice mass balance vary widely as do the glacial isostatic adjustments…
For the analyzed period, the ice mass balance of Greenland and the corresponding GIA correction are, respectively, − 256 ± 21 Gt yr−1 and − 3 ± 12 Gt yr−1 (1%) for SM09, − 253 ± 23 Gt yr−1 and − 6 ± 5 Gt yr−1 (2%) for AW13, and − 189 ± 27 Gt yr−1 and − 69 ± 19 Gt yr−1(36%) for Wu10 (table 1). At the regional scale, the ice mass estimates are more dependent on the GIA correction, especially in NE Greenland where the Wu10-GIA correction is the largest portion of the signal measured by GRACE (table 1).
From Sutterley et al., 2014
With ~±10% margins of error in modern satellite measurements of glacial mass balance and GIA accounting for up to 1/3 of the reported ice mass loss, it is truly amazing that a 0.3% reduction in the Greenland ice sheet during the 20th century can be identified with such robustness [/Sarc].

"They are a gardener’s best friend, good for the soil and a treat for birds. But the humble earthworm may not always be good news, according to a study that suggests invasive earthworms could be making Arctic soils too fertile. The earthworm is not typically thought of as an invasive species. “Most parts of Europe have earthworms so we never really saw them as a problem,” says lead researcher Dr Gesche Blume-Werry, an ecologist from the University of Greifswald in Germany. But Blume-Werry and her colleagues realised that “more and more spots in the Arctic have worms because humans brought them there”. Earthworms move at around five to 10 metres a year in the Arctic, but human mobility means they can jump from the UK to Svalbard in a single move. They are reaching remote areas by hitchhiking in the treads of people’s shoes, from being used as bait for fishing and in imported soils for gardening. As the Arctic warms, they are able to colonise more areas. Early research indicates that the earthworms could have the same effect on Arctic plant productivity as a 3C rise in temperature. Invasive plant and animal species are non-native organisms that disrupt the natural balance of ecosystems, often outcompeting native wildlife, which causes their own populations to explode. A minority of non-native species become invasive but common traits include rapid growth, fast reproduction and high resilience to new environments.  For example, in South Georgia in the Atlantic ocean, the accidental introduction of rodents by whalers devastated bird populations on the islands for 250 years and required a huge mouse and rat eradication programme to protect native wildlife. Why are they a problem? Invasive species are among the largest threats to biodiversity in the world because they can permanently alter the healthy functioning of an ecosystem and cause local extinctions, resulting in large-scale economic and environmental damage. Japanese knotweed damages building foundations and flood defences in the UK, costing hundreds millions of pounds to manage every year.  Other highly problematic invasive species include the European wild boar in the southern US, the North American grey squirrel in Europe and South American water hyacinth in waterways around the world.  How do they spread? Human trade, tourism and the pet business have caused large-scale redistributions of plants and animals around the world, driving local extinctions of native organisms. A recent study in the journal Global Change Biology warned that, if left unchecked, the spread of non-native plant and animal species around the globe could lead to cataclysmic loss of biodiversity. Patrick Greenfield, biodiversity reporter Typical Arctic temperatures are too cold for decomposers like fungi and bacteria to break down organic matter effectively, causing a lack of nutrients in the soil, which inhibits plant growth. Now, scientists are realising the absence of earthworms is also a key part of the story because they unlock nitrogen, an important component in plant growth. They do this by breaking down litter and humus, excreting it in their worm casts. Worms move nutrients down to where roots are, through networks of horizontal and vertical tunnels. Anecic worms (the most common in the UK) make vertical burrows and endogeic worms make horizontal burrows. Earthworms that just work on the surface (epigeic worms) don’t make tunnels and are not considered geoengineers. Taller, scrubby plants (which have grown better due to nitrogen-rich soils) are more likely to stick out of the snow during winter, and scientists believe this could mean more heat is absorbed, accelerating snow melt. “You have these changes in albedo [the reflective quality of a surface],” explains Blume-Werry. “If the surface is darker, which happens if plants are not covered in snow, then less light is being reflected and more heat is being trapped. You get this positive feedback to warming. The warmer it gets, the better plants grow, and then you have this kind of cycle of more plant production and warmer temperatures.” In the northern boreal forests of Canada and the US, earthworms had been absent since at least the last ice age, 12,000 years ago. But as settlers from Europe colonised these lands, they brought earthworms with them in the ballasts of ships and on imported plants. Slowly, these invaders changed the forest ecosystem by converting leaf litter into humus. This altered the delicate relationship between fungi and plants, which changed the pH of the top layers of soil, leading to reduced overall biodiversity, according to 2016 research published in Global Change Biology. In 2017, a team of scientists went digging for worms in the Arctic. Associate professor Jonatan Klaminder, an environmental scientist at Umeå University in Sweden, who was involved in the research, said he had assumed the climate would be too cold and harsh. He was wrong. Initially, researchers looked at older sites where nomadic Sami people had gathered reindeer for milking between 1600 and 1900 but did not find any geoengineering worms. The first ones seem to arrive in 1850 when people came to the interior of northern Sweden to try to start farming in the Arctic – unsuccessfully, it turned out. At some of these old sites, earthworms had spread 800 metres away from where humans lived, according to the paper, published in Biological Invasions. In total, earthworms were found at around 20 sites. In some spots the worms were found in even greater abundance than in the forests in Minnesota, where they are considered a serious problem. Arctic soils around this area generally have 10cm of poorly decomposed organic material, but at the 19th century site in northern Sweden the organic layer on top of the soil and leaf litter had disappeared, just as it had in the northern boreal forests in the US. Most of the spots in which earthworms were found were near human settlements such as old farms, cabins, gardens or fishing sites, which reinforced the idea they were brought in by humans. Geoengineering earthworms have now established themselves in Arctic soils in North America, Greenland, Iceland, Fennoscandia, and Russia. In the paper scientists warned earthworms “may pose a potent threat to some of the most remote and protected Arctic environments in northern Europe”, and called for immediate action, as the worms are almost impossible to eradicate once they have colonised. Klaminder says the research is a canary in the coalmine. “During the past 10,000 years we have not had geoengineering earthworms in the landscape. And suddenly if we introduce them this will change how the system functions, so that’s why we’re seeing a strong impact … If you have 10,000 introduction points then this could be a very rapid process.” In the latest experiment, Klaminder, Blume-Werry and colleagues wanted to find out what these earthworms do to plant growth. They put soil in containers, or mesocosms, that were 50 x 39 x 30 cm and filled them will heath and meadow vegetation. The containers were kept at Abisko Scientific Research Station, which is 200km north of the Arctic Circle. Around 45 worms were added to half of the mesocosms. To determine root growth scientists put a camera in the soil that took photos of the roots at regular intervals. The “greenness” of vegetation (a measure of photosynthesis and therefore plant productivity) in the different containers was also monitored to work out how much impact worms were having. The effects caused by geoengineering earthworms were “as strong, or even stronger, than other important environmental drivers in the Arctic”, such as temperature increase, grazing animals and fertilisation using deer faeces, researchers wrote in their paper on the experiment, published in Nature Communications. Earthworms increased plant nitrogen concentrations on average more than three times as much as a 3C increase in summer temperatures. They caused an increase in plant greenness that appeared similar to the increase caused by a 3C temperature rise. Blume-Werry said the researchers were “super surprised” by the scale of the impact. Earthworms are not the only invasive species threatening the Arctic. Polar limitations of where species can reach are quickly eroding. In the summer of 2008 scientists sampled the footwear of 259 travellers arriving in Svalbard by plane. They found an average of 3.9 seeds per traveller, which equates to 270,000 seeds for the entire year, according to the team’s paper, published in Biological Invasions. A quarter of the seeds collected germinated under local conditions. Polar and alpine ecologist Jesamine Bartlett from the Norwegian Institute for Nature Research says there are approximately 8,000 individual dandelion plants that have been creating “enormous lawns”, she says. “What’s alarming is that a couple of years ago there weren’t that many. They’re visually very striking. Every year it changes slightly depending on how warm the summer is.”  Earthworms are also probably a lot more widely distributed than we think, says Bartlett, but there are few specialists working in this area. “I don’t think we’re aware of it at all,” she says. “Some of the major activity in Svalbard has been going on for decades. It’s very likely this could have spread further and no one has done a basic survey of just running through the most populous towns and gone through it to see what is there.” Detritivores, including earthworms, are some of the most damaging invasive species you can get because if people don’t see them they don’t think they’re a problem. They change the foundations of ecosystems and set a precedent for other invasive species looking to move in. “They are the aliens to watch. Don’t be distracted by the big glossy, invasive plants. See what’s happening in your soil,” says Bartlett, who promotes a “stop Arctic aliens” website to raise awareness about the importance of making sure visitors do not accidentally bring in unwanted species. Research in this area is still in its infancy, says Marc Macias-Fauria, an ecologist from the University of Oxford who was not involved in these studies. The mecocosm research by Blume-Werry et al was creative, smart and timely, he says, given Arctic ice melt and increasing numbers of humans in the region. It would be interesting to see how growth varies in different Arctic environments, he adds. “The discussion is engaging and exciting but this is a first stage, there are many more questions in front of the paper than behind it”. In general, big Earth systems – ways of modelling the interacting physical, chemical, and biological processes of our planet – do not look at the impact of animals and vegetation on the land . Instead, models looking at vegetation are usually dictated by research on the climate. There is only one climate model – the Madingley model in Cambridge – that looks at the impact of animals. Macias-Fauria says encouraging more of these big models to incorporate the role of animals is “definitely very welcome”. Dr Bonnie G Waring, an ecologist at the Grantham Institute, who was not involved in the research, says it highlights how humans change natural ecosystems in myriad ways, not just by burning fossil fuels. “The Arctic is experiencing multiple perturbations that could lead to rapid and profound restructuring of high-latitude ecosystems, and we need to study these disturbances in a holistic way,” she says.

A couple of days ago we ran a piece at WUWT: Did We Really Save the Ozone Layer? In light of this press release, the question is worth pondering again.
From the NASA/GODDARD SPACE FLIGHT CENTER
Annual Antarctic ozone hole larger and formed later in 2015

The 2015 Antarctic ozone hole area was larger and formed later than in recent years, said scientists from NASA and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA).
On Oct. 2, 2015, the ozone hole expanded to its peak of 28.2 million square kilometers (10.9 million square miles), an area larger than the continent of North America. Throughout October, the hole remained large and set many area daily records. Unusually cold temperature and weak dynamics in the Antarctic stratosphere this year resulted in this larger ozone hole. In comparison, last year the ozone hole peaked at 24.1 million square kilometers (9.3 million square miles) on Sept. 11, 2014. Compared to the 1991-2014 period, the 2015 ozone hole average area was the fourth largest.
“While the current ozone hole is larger than in recent years, the area occupied by this year’s hole is consistent with our understanding of ozone depletion chemistry and consistent with colder than average weather conditions in Earth’s stratosphere, which help drive ozone depletion,” said Paul A. Newman, chief scientist for Earth Sciences at NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland.
The ozone hole is a severe depletion of the ozone layer above Antarctica that was first detected in the 1980s. The Antarctic ozone hole forms and expands during the Southern Hemisphere spring (August and September) because of the high levels of chemically active forms of chlorine and bromine in the stratosphere. These chlorine- and bromine-containing molecules are largely derived from man-made chemicals that steadily increased in Earth’s atmosphere up through the early 1990s.
“This year, our balloon-borne instruments measured nearly 100 percent ozone depletion in the layer above South Pole Station, Antarctica, that was 14 to 19 kilometers (9 to 12 miles) above Earth’s surface,” said Bryan Johnson, a researcher at NOAA’s Earth System Research Laboratory in Boulder, Colorado. “During September we typically see a rapid ozone decline, ending with about 95 percent depletion in that layer by October 1. This year the depletion held on an extra two weeks resulting in nearly 100 percent depletion by October 15.”
The ozone layer helps shield Earth from potentially harmful ultraviolet radiation that can cause skin cancer, cataracts, and suppress immune systems, as well as damage plants. The large size of this year’s ozone hole will likely result in increases of harmful ultraviolet rays at Earth’s surface, particularly in Antarctica and the Southern Hemisphere in the coming months.
Ozone depletion is primarily caused by man-made compounds that release chlorine and bromine gases in the stratosphere. Beginning in 1987, the internationally agreed-upon Montreal Protocol on Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer has regulated these ozone-depleting compounds, such as chlorine-containing chlorofluorocarbons used in refrigerants and bromine-containing halon gases used as fire suppressants. Because of the Protocol, atmospheric levels of these ozone depleting compounds are slowly declining. The ozone hole is expected to recover back to 1980 levels in approximately 2070.
This year, scientists recorded the minimum thickness of the ozone layer at 101 Dobson units on October 4, 2015, as compared to 250-350 Dobson units during the 1960s, before the Antarctic ozone hole occurred. Dobson units are a measure of the overhead amount of atmospheric ozone.
The satellite ozone data come from the Dutch-Finnish Ozone Monitoring Instrument on NASA’s Aura satellite, launched in 2004, and the Ozone Monitoring and Profiler Suite instrument on the NASA-NOAA Suomi National Polar-orbiting Partnership satellite, launched in 2011. NOAA scientists at the South Pole station monitor the ozone layer above that location by using a Dobson spectrophotometer and regular ozone-sonde balloon launches that record the thickness of the ozone layer and its vertical distribution. Chlorine amounts are estimated using NOAA and NASA ground measurements and observations from the Microwave Limb Sounder aboard NASA’s Aura satellite. These satellites continue a data record dating back to the early 1970s.

As the most recent polls show, Australian PM **Scott Morrison** has been politically damaged by the fallout from this summer’s bushfires. No small blame is due to Morrison’s foolish miscalculation of the public mood, but much also stems from the subsequent hysterical opportunism of the political left and their camp-followers in the legacy media. But Morrison is nothing if not a survivor, as his [wresting of victory ](https://thebfd.co.nz/2019/09/morrison-got-trumpeters-on-the-roof-of-the-white-house-what-will-ardern-get/)in last May’s election shows.



Morrison is already moving to repair, not just the physical damage wreaked by the fires, but the political damage inflicted by his opponents. Many of whom he is moving to hold to account for their own disastrous failings.



Scott Morrison has flagged strengthening the constitutional and legal powers of the commonwealth to allow prime ministers to declare national disasters and call in the Defence Force rather than waiting for the states to ask for ­assistance.



The Australian understands the Prime Minister will also shift the Coalition’s posture on ­climate change and ­elevate preparation, resilience and adaptability to ­increasingly ­extreme events to a national security footing…He will also focus on the government’s economic plan as a successful formula by making a virtue of fiscal discipline that has given the government the ability to ­respond to disasters.



Some of this is plain, old political narrative-setting: Morrison is moving to ally the Coalition’s traditional strength – economic management – to emergency management. This is not all just spin, either. As the wildly differing outcomes from recent natural disasters around the world show, well-off, well-managed countries will sail all-but-unscathed through disasters that, in poorer, less-prepared countries, inflict staggering losses.



But Morrison is also sailing into untested constitutional waters.



Mr Morrison will call for a more immediate role for the ADF in future disasters and consider an overhaul of constitutional and legal frameworks to hand greater powers to the commonwealth to respond to natural disasters…



Victorian Premier Daniel Andrews called for Defence help in late December at the height of the bushfire crisis and the navy evacuated stranded holidaymakers from Mallacoota.



The NSW government early this month declined an offer from the Prime Minister to deploy a fleet of naval ships and military helicopters to help with evacuations from the state’s south coast.



Traditionally, conservative governments have zealously protected Australian federalism and states’ rights. But, in this case, the egregious failures of almost exclusively left-wing state governments seems to demand action. The simple fact is that under the constitutional rules as they are currently understood, the federal government cannot unilaterally send in the troops on Australian soil. Victoria waited until the last minute when thousands had fled to the beaches to escape the flames, to ask for Commonwealth assistance. NSW flatly refused. The Queensland premier didn’t even deign to interrupt her holidays.



Yet it was Morrison who copped the political blame from the public, and worse, from a legacy media either too ignorant or too biased to bother telling the public the truth. Unsurprisingly, Morrison seems determined that blame be sheeted home where it’s most richly deserved. Even if he has to re-write commonwealth-state relations in order to pull negligent states into line.



The Prime Minister will also pledge to introduce an enhanced national accountability for “natural disaster risk management, resilience and preparedness”.



Mr Morrison last week called for a national standard for bushfire hazard reduction burns and declared that tracking measures to cut fuel loads was at least as important as monitoring Australia’s carbon emissions.



Despite the fears of Coalition voters who emphatically rejected the sort of “climate action” demanded by the left, Morrison isn’t about to bow to the Krazy Klimate Kult. Instead, he’s determined to reset the national discourse, to focus on the [real causes of Australia’s periodic mega-fires](https://thebfd.co.nz/2019/12/bushfires-hysterical-journalists-need-to-read-some-old-newspapers/), rather than futile tilting at carbon windmills.

"Kenny Wells, the feckless owner of a Nevada mining company, is the latest entry in the Matthew McConaughey gallery of charming rogues. Swaybacked and paunchy, with a thinning dome and an appetite for Winstons and Seagram’s that would keep both brands in business if the rest of the world went cold turkey, Kenny doesn’t quite have the wolfish charisma or the mystical intensity of some of Mr. McConaughey’s other recent characters. But like them  —   like Mick Haller in “The Lincoln Lawyer,” Ron Woodroof in “Dallas Buyers Club” and that guy in those car commercials  —   he is fun to watch and hard not to root for. “Gold,” which chronicles a few of Kenny’s rises and falls in the 1980s, describes itself as “inspired by actual events,” but inspiration is precisely what the film, directed by Stephen Gaghan from a script by Patrick Massett and John Zinman, seems to lack. Mr. McConaughey is a ball of profane, entrepreneurial energy bouncing around in a vacuum. The story swings from the Nevada desert to the Indonesian rain forest to Wall Street boardrooms, and the screen bristles with signifiers of capitalist activity: meetings, phone calls, stock tickers. But the movie isn’t really doing any work. It’s just looking busy. Having nearly run the family prospecting business into the ground (so to speak) Kenny gambles on the expertise of a Mike Acosta (Édgar Ramírez) a geologist with an almost mystical reputation. They strike gold in Indonesia, and a gilded future opens up for Kenny and his longtime girlfriend, Kaylene (Bryce Dallas Howard). There are shadows and complications, of course, including the corruptions of wealth, the treachery of rivals and Kenny’s own impulsiveness. Broad hints are dropped that things will end badly. But enough goes wrong along the way  —   with the movie, I mean, not with Mike and Kenny’s scheme  —   to make the outcome feel almost moot. The film is well cast: You can’t really go wrong with Bill Camp, Corey Stoll, Stacy Keach and Bruce Greenwood. It’s beautifully shot (you can’t go wrong with Robert Elswit, either). There is a pleasingly sleazy, swaggering,   ’80s vibe. And there are flickering reminders of other ambitious,   mock epics, as if the filmmakers were hoping an algorithm would deposit “Gold” in the queues of viewers who liked “American Hustle,” “The Big Short” and Mr. Gaghan’s own “Syriana. ” With this material, he could have gone in any number of interesting directions, which may have been part of the problem. “Gold” could have been a biting satire of greed and folly, a   tale of Western misadventure in Asia, a rousing fable of underdog triumph or a caper comedy. It tries, in its frantic, clumsy fashion, to be all of those things, and comes close enough to succeeding to qualify as an honorable failure. What holds your attention is the question of whether that description fits Kenny as well. He could just as well be the opposite  —   a dishonorable success. He is far from a subtle guy, but Mr. McConaughey is a sly enough actor to make us wonder whether we’re in the company of a fool or a con artist and to make us question whether there’s really a difference. His wild, abrasive and improbably delicate performance is what makes “Gold” watchable, even if the rest of the movie doesn’t supply sufficient reason to keep watching."
"**US gaming publisher Activision Blizzard has reversed its decision to withhold prize money from a player who expressed support for the Hong Kong protests.**
Professional gamer, Ng Wai ""Blitzchung"" Chung, said in Mandarin, ""Liberate Hong Kong, revolution of our age,"" on a live broadcast after a tournament.
He was banned for one year and said was told he would not get any prize money.
In a new statement, the company said: ""In hindsight, our process wasn't adequate, and we reacted too quickly.""
The hashtag #Blizzardboycott trended on Twitter after the 21-year-old was banned, and some players tried to delete their accounts in solidarity with ""Blitzchung"".
Even some US politicians commented on Blizzard's initial decision.
Activision Blizzard is behind some of the most popular console, PC and mobile video games, including Call of Duty, Overwatch, World of Warcraft and Candy Crush.
It initially said Ng Wai Chung broke rules as ""the official broadcast needs to be about the tournament"" and it wanted to ""keep the official channels focused on the game"".
But the game-maker decided that he didn't break any rules during the game, and so revised their decision.
Ng Wai Chung's statement showed solidarity with the protests happening in Hong Kong.
The protests started in June against proposals to allow extradition to mainland China.
The extradition bill would have allowed for criminal suspects to be tried in mainland China, under certain circumstances.
Some said it might give China more influence over Hong Kong and could be used to target activists and journalists.
Ng Wai Chung also put on a gas mask in the post-match interview, which protesters have been wearing since Hong Kong police have been using tear gas.

"**Apple has removed an app that protesters in Hong Kong have used to track police movements and tear gas use, saying the app violated its rules.**
The company said the app, HKmap.live, had ""been used in ways that endanger law enforcement and residents"".
Apple initially rejected the app \- which uses data from protesters on the ground - from its store.
When it later appeared on the App Store, there was a sharply-worded response in official Chinese media.
The removal then came after ""many concerned customers in Hong Kong contacted us"", Apple said.
""We have verified with the Hong Kong Cybersecurity and Technology Crime Bureau that the app has been used to target and ambush police,"" Apple said.
The statement added that ""criminals have used it to victimise residents in areas where they know there is no law enforcement"".
Although the app has been removed from Apple's store, a website version appears to remain active. There is also a version on Google Play.
When the app was available on the App Store, Apple was criticised in Chinese state media.
Communist Party publication the People's Daily didn't name the app, but criticised Apple for ""opening the door"" to violent protests.
""Letting poisonous software have its way is a betrayal of the Chinese people's feelings,"" the paper said.
Apps previously have been removed after their release if they were found to facilitate illegal activity or threaten public safety.
A number of companies have drawn the ire of Chinese officials over the long-running Hong Kong protests.
China's state broadcaster has scrapped plans to show two US NBA basketball pre-season games over a pro-Hong Kong tweet from a team manager, and sponsors have also been critical.
Jeweller Tiffany & Co scrapped an advert image after some Chinese consumers suggested it was supportive of the protesters.
And California-based Video-game company Blizzard suspended a gamer after he expressed support for the protestors during a livestream.
Hong Kong protesters, meanwhile, the other hand, have targeted mainland banks and what they perceive to be pro-mainland businesses.
For Apple, China is both a major market and a manufacturing base for its products.
The manufacturing of Apple products directly and indirectly accounts for around three million jobs in China.
Apple had sales of $9.61bn last quarter in its Greater China category, which includes Taiwan and Hong Kong."

CLINTEL – the Climate Intelligence group of more than 800 international scientists and professionals – have sent a letter to the World Economic Forum to inform them that there is NO Climate Emergency, and that’s good news for Greta Thunberg and her followers, many of whom are scared about climate change. 



Present day climate change turns out to be well within natural variability of the past. Dr. Guus Berkhout, president of CLINTEL, has issued a new plain language climate science essay that shows how computer simulated models have been mistaken for ‘reality’ and why they are unsuitable for setting climate policy. 



Some people wonder why the WEF business community and Al Gore claim there is a climate crisis, but the CLINTEL scientists and professionals don’t… the answer is found in a Forbes story where Roger Pielke, Jr. reveals that two green billionaires sponsored a very influential climate risk report that used the most extreme and least likely scenario. That document and that thinking became embedded as if fact in science, when it is pure speculation.

"Abortion opponents gathered on Friday in Washington for their annual march, which has taken place every year since 1974 to protest the Supreme Court’s    Roe v. Wade decision from 1973. ■ Vice President Mike Pence, the   official to ever speak in person at the march, told the crowd that “life is winning. ” ■ Kellyanne Conway, counselor to President Trump, also addressed the crowd. ■ The march drew thousands of activists. Mr. Pence, using the refrain “life is winning,” assured the crowd that Mr. Trump shared their opposition to abortion and would appoint a justice to the Supreme Court who held that view as well. “We will not rest until we restore a culture of life in America,” Mr. Pence said, and thousands in the crowd cheered. He also said that by many measures  —   the views of members of Congress and advances in science among them  —   “life is winning in America. ” Standing where other Republican leaders have usually just sent video or audio recordings of their message, Mr. Pence said the   movement should embrace the moment. Kellyanne Conway may have sprung onto the national political scene largely unknown. But inside the movement of those opposing abortion, she has been a leading figure for two decades. “Kellyanne is one of us,” is how she was introduced at the March for Life. As a pollster and political strategist, she advised numerous groups like the Susan B. Anthony List and the March for Life, urging them to adopt what she often described as a more   approach that avoided some of the more incendiary language of the movement in the past. Opponents of abortion gather every year on the National Mall and march to the Supreme Court. Usually their defiance is not much more than symbolism  —   the court is the origin of Roe v. Wade, the decision in 1973 that they have sought for more than 40 years to overturn. This year they have ample reason to believe that under a   government, they will begin to see movement for the first time in more than a decade. In previous years, no president or vice president has ever addressed the march in person. This year, the Trump administration will be out in full force with the appearances of Mr. Pence and Ms. Conway. President Trump, in one of his first official acts, signed an order prohibiting foreign aid to health providers abroad who discuss abortion as a   option. And in a break with previous Republican presidents, he has embraced the idea of a litmus test for his Supreme Court nominees and pledged explicitly to name someone who opposes abortion. He said he would announce his choice on Thursday to fill the seat left vacant by the death of Justice Antonin Scalia last February. Mr. Trump has become an unlikely champion for the movement, with abortion opponents saying he is probably their most unflinching White House ally since President Ronald Reagan. Though Mr. Trump spent much of his life as a supporter of abortion rights, he spoke more vividly and forcefully on the issue during the campaign than any recent Republican nominee. And while many groups opposing abortion were vehemently opposed to Mr. Trump during the Republican primaries last year, almost all of them came around. Today, however unexpectedly, they march in a Washington suddenly more friendly to their interests. Many of the activists said they were looking forward to President Trump appointing Supreme Court justices who might overturn the right to abortions and to the defunding of Planned Parenthood. Marchers waved signs spelling out their beliefs in messages like “Save the babies,” “    ” and “Trump for Baby Bumps. ” Still, some of the marchers remained wary of the new president. Kathleen Crank, 19, a sophomore at Benedictine College in Atchison, Kan. traveled on a five bus caravan of 260 students to come to the march. She said she was happy to have a president who would oppose abortion but wasn’t excited about much else about Mr. Trump. She said she waited until the last minute and decided not to vote for either him or Hillary Clinton. “Their stance on abortion is probably the only issue I’m glad about for this administration,” she said. “I’m glad that after eight years of reading Obama’s tweets celebrating Roe v. Wade, I’m glad we finally have an administration that is recognizing we need to cut funding for abortions in other countries and bringing it back down to the state level. ” Ms. Crank also said she saw abortions as less about religion than about preserving the rights of unborn children. “It’s more a social justice issue for unborn babies than a religious one to push an agenda,” she said. “Everyone should be able to live their life and live it however they want to. ” Annette Saunders, 60, drove five hours with her husband from Norwalk, Conn. to volunteer with Save the Storks, a group that opposes abortion, and to hand out signs that said, “For those who can’t. ” Though she voted for Mr. Trump, Ms. Saunders said she agonized over the decision because she found him to be “crass” and was frustrated by the tape of him using vulgarities to talk about women. “I was concerned but I felt like God told me to vote for Donald Trump,” she said. “He is standing up for   and his vice president certainly is and I’m excited about seeing a turnaround. ” Jon Banks and Josie Rauh, both 18, were taking photos of each other in front of the Washington Monument clad in red and blue   President caps. They were part of a group that traveled to Washington from Archbishop Hoban, a private Catholic high school in Akron, Ohio. Both said Mr. Trump’s opposition to abortion were the centerpieces of their support for the new president. They grew up in families dedicated to the cause. Ms. Rauh had supported former President Barack Obama but became enthusiastic in 2016. “I thought Obama was a pretty good president,” she said. “I think there are some things that need to be changed, like Roe v. Wade. I think Trump has got a plan and is ready to do it. ” “I want women to have their rights,” she added. “But I think there are a bunch of women in the womb that are being killed, too. ” Mr. Banks, the son of a police officer, said he was thrilled by Mr. Trump’s patriotism. He said he hoped the new president found a way to outlaw abortion. As Mr. Pence, Ms. Conway and several other speakers celebrated what they described as a new phase for the   movement, thousands of people shouted “Trump” and “Life” while happily waving their hands. Anne Nudi, 49, a nurse and college professor who flew to Washington from her home in Kenosha, Wis. to come to the march, said she enthusiastically cast her ballot for Mr. Trump and has been encouraged by his first busy week in office. “I feel empowered. I feel positive. I feel encouraged about the future and I feel blessed that I have a president who is supportive of our cause,” she said as she shivered while watching the speakers. “I believe he’s a good person. He’s made his own way and I believe he wants what’s best for our country regardless of party affiliation. ”"
"If you have turned on a TV or read the news during the past few months, you have probably heard of the widespread fires that wrought havoc on the Amazon rainforest this year. Fires occur in the rainforest every year, but the past 11 months saw the number of fires increase by more than 70% when compared with 2018, indicating a major acceleration in land clearing by the country’s logging and farming industries.  The smoke from the fires rose high into the atmosphere and could be seen from space. Some regions of Brazil became covered in thick smoke that closed airports and darkened city skies. As the rainforest burns, it releases enormous amounts of carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide, and larger particles of so-called “black carbon” (smoke and soot). The phrase “enormous amounts” hardly does the numbers justice – in any given year, the burning of forests and grasslands in South America emits a whopping 800,000 tonnes of black carbon into the atmosphere.  This truly astounding amount is almost double the black carbon produced by all combined energy use in Europe over 12 months. Not only does this absurd amount of smoke cause health issues and contribute to global warming but, as a growing number of scientific studies are showing, it also more directly contributes to the melting of glaciers. In a new paper published in the journal Scientific Reports, a team of researchers has outlined how smoke from fires in the Amazon in 2010 made glaciers in the Andes melt more quickly.  When fires in the Amazon emit black carbon during the peak burning season (August to October), winds carry these clouds of smoke to Andean glaciers, which can sit higher than 5,000 metres above sea level.  Despite being invisible to the naked eye, black carbon particles affect the ability of the snow to reflect incoming sunlight, a phenomenon known as “albedo”. Similar to how a dark-coloured car will heat up more quickly in direct sunlight when compared with a light-coloured one, glaciers covered by black carbon particles will absorb more heat, and thus melt faster. By using a computer simulation of how particles move through the atmosphere, known as HYSPLIT, the team was able to show that smoke plumes from the Amazon are carried by winds to the Andes, where they fall as an invisible mist across glaciers. Altogether, they found that fires in the Amazon in 2010 caused a 4.5% increase in water runoff from Zongo Glacier in Bolivia. Crucially, the authors also found that the effect of black carbon depends on the amount of dust covering a glacier – if the amount of dust is higher, then the glacier will already be absorbing most of the heat that might have been absorbed by the black carbon. Land clearing is one of the reasons that dust levels over South America doubled during the 20th century. Glaciers are some of the most important natural resources on the planet. Himalayan glaciers provide drinking water for 240m people, and 1.9 billion rely on them for food. In South America, glaciers are crucial for water supply – in some towns, including Huaraz in Peru, more than 85% of drinking water comes from glaciers during times of drought. However, these truly vital sources of water are increasingly under threat as the planet feels the effects of global warming. Glaciers in the Andes have been receding rapidly for the last 50 years. The tropical belt of South America is predicted to become more dry and arid as the climate changes. A drier climate means more dust, and more fires. It also means more droughts, which make towns more reliant on glaciers for water.  Unfortunately, as the above study shows, the fires assisted by dry conditions help to make these vital sources of water vanish more quickly. The role of black carbon in glacier melting is an exceedingly complex process – currently, the climate models used to predict the future melting of glaciers in the Andes do not incorporate black carbon. As the authors of this new study show, this is likely causing the rate of glacial melt to be underestimated in many current assessments.  With communities reliant on glaciers for water, and these same glaciers likely to melt faster as the climate warms, work examining complex forces like black carbon and albedo changes is needed more now than ever before.

“Knowing and understanding the past is a vital key to the future, and earth scientists can present much of this information in a context that can assist in exposing the truth and misrepresentations of the current “Climate Change” debate.
“It is fact that the vast bulk of the Great Barrier Reef area was exposed land and above sea level, prior to 10,000 years ago, when sea levels were over 70m lower than present. There was no great coral reef there until recently, and Kakadu was probably not a swampy wetland then either.”

By Dr. Sebastian Lüning, Prof. Fritz Vahrenholt
(German passages translated by P. Gosselin)
[NOTE: Comment moderation will be slow over the next couple of days due to limited WIFI access. -PG]
Gradually word is getting out that the current climate trend has to be put in an historical pre-industrial context before one can draw far-reaching conclusions on anthropogenic causes. The Spanish Research platform sinc published on 27 June 2016 a press release on the drought history of Spain during the past three hundred years:
Radiography of drought periods in Spain from the last 318 years
The Mediterranean Basin has been witness to increased droughts for at least five decades, but has this always been the case? A team from the University of Zaragoza has been successful in reconstructing, for the first time, the droughts from 1694 to 2012 based on the precipitation index and the study of tree growth rings. According to the study, the twelve months leading up to July 2012 were the driest.
In the Mediterranean Basin, droughts are a recurring phenomenon that negatively impacts society, economic activities and natural systems. No one seems to doubt the fact that temperatures all over the world have risen in recent decades. However, this trend does not appear to be perceived as clearly when it comes to precipitation (for which data from 1950 onwards is available). Thus, up until now, the study on the recurrence and severity of droughts in Spain has been based on information from weather stations, with sufficient data only as of the mid-twentieth century.
To test the evolution of the droughts, scientists from the Department of Geography at the University of Zaragoza utilised indirect information, such as the study of tree growth rings, to reconstruct the climate of the Iberian Range as far back as 1694 and to analyse dry periods using the Standardised Precipitation Index (SPI). The researchers collected 336 samples and 45,648 growth rings from five different species (P. sylvestris, P. uncinata, P. nigra, P. halepensis, and Pinus pinaster) from 21 locations in the province of Teruel, in the east of the Iberian Peninsula, at an average altitude of 1,600 metres. The results, published in the ‘International Journal of Biometeorology’, made it possible to evaluate droughts from the last three centuries; they reveal that the twelve months leading up to July 2012 were the driest over the entire period studied. “We have been able to successfully identify seven especially dry periods and five wet periods since the end of the 17th century”, says Ernesto Tejedor to Sinc, the main author of the study.
The driest periods
According to the researchers, in addition to these periods there have been 36 extremely dry years and 28 very wet years since the end of the 17th century. “Some of these dry years, such as 1725, 1741, 1803 and 1879, are also identified in other drought reconstructions in Romania and Turkey, thus demonstrating the larger-scale coherence of the extreme deviations and their relationship with increasingly global atmospheric processes”, adds Tejedor.
Many of these extreme events are associated with catastrophic historical and cultural changes from the last three centuries. In fact, 1725 is known as ‘The year without a harvest’ in Monegros. These events are reflected in historical documents as the ‘pro-pluvia’ rogations, “since the intense droughts led to bad harvests with serious consequences for society”, comments Tejedor.

The reconstruction of droughts using dendrochronology does not make it possible to directly predict extreme future events, although these reconstructions are indeed used to validate future climate change models. “What we are seeing from the 20th century, and what we have seen so far in the 21st is an increase in the recurrence of extreme phenomena, including both wet and dry years”, stresses the researcher to Sinc. For the expert, predictions for precipitation variability and trends are not yet reliable like those for temperature, as other factors which are still being studied also play a role.

Citation: Tejedor, Ernesto; de Luis, Martin; María Cuadrat, José; Esper, Jan; Angel Saz, Miguel. “Tree-ring-based drought reconstruction in the Iberian Range (east of Spain) since 1694” International Journal of Biometeorology 60(3): 361-372 DOI: 10.1007/s00484-015-1033-7 marzo de 2016″

Using tree rings the authors documented 36 extremely dry years in Spain over the past 318 years. Somewhat sensationally they declared 2011/2012 the driest year ever, which as a single incident is hardly evidence of any climate trend. More interesting would be the distribution of the drought-intense periods over time. Here the press release is silent on this, and so we present the original chart from the paper to have a look.

Figure 2: Precipiation curve for the Iberian Range in Spain for the last 3 centuries. Source: Tejedor et al. 2016b. The yellow areas mark the 11-year drought periods. 
When it comes to the trend, the press release is somewhat misleading.
Yes, there is an obvious increase in drought in 20th century. In the second half of the 20th century two longer periods of drought were registered while in the first half it was wetter. Yet there was also a higher frequency of drought phases in the 18th century and early 19th century – i.e. during the Little Ice Age. That could have been mentioned.
Instead the press release concluded that it was still too early to make trend projections. Yet as it stands it looks as if there isn’t any real long term trend over the centuries. Thus it would be false to infer any trend based on the droughts of the last decades alone.
A look back at the last major warm phase – the Medieval Warm Period (MWP) of 1000 years ago – shows how complex the Iberian peninsula is when it comes to precipitation. Within the scope of the MWP-charting project we identified a corridor on the Iberian peninsula where it got wetter during the MWP (green points on chart). To the contrary in the outer areas of the Iberian peninsula it became drier during the MWP (yellow points).

Guest essay by Eric Worrall
The shameless attempt by green activists like Prince Charles and President Obama, to link Climate Change and the Syrian Civil War, has just lost even more credibility thanks to The Guardian;
Is climate change really to blame for Syria’s civil war?
Prince Charles is the latest high-profile figure to echo claims that ‘securitise’ the conflict. But the evidence just doesn’t stack up.
Was the Syrian civil war partly caused by climate change? Prince Charles, for one, seems to think so. “There is very good evidence indeed that one of the major reasons for this horror in Syria was a drought that lasted for about five or six years,” he told Sky News, adding that climate change is having a “huge impact” on conflict and terrorism.
The Prince is not alone on this one: he joins a chorus of voices making similar claims. In the US President Obama, Al Gore, and the democratic presidential hopefuls Martin O’Malley and Bernie Sanders have all talked of a link between climate change and the Syria conflict, Sanders going so far as to argue that climate change is “directly related to the growth of terrorism”.
…
This time round, there at least appears to be some scientific support for the climate-conflict thesis: a study by Earth scientists at Columbia University, published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, found: “Climate change is implicated in the current Syrian conflict”. The problem is, this study is deeply flawed.

"LaGRANGE, Ga.  —   Some people here had never heard about the lynching of Austin Callaway  —   about how, almost 77 years ago, he was dragged out of a jail cell by a band of masked white men, then shot and left for dead. Some people never forgot. But on Thursday evening, the fatal cruelties inflicted upon Mr. Callaway  —   long obscured by time, fear, professional malfeasance and a reluctance to investigate the sins of the past  —   were acknowledged in this city of 31, 000 people when LaGrange’s police chief, Louis M. Dekmar, who is white, issued a rare apology for a Southern lynching. “I sincerely regret and denounce the role our Police Department played in Austin’s lynching, both through our action and our inaction,” Chief Dekmar told a crowd at a traditionally   church. “And for that, I’m profoundly sorry. It should never have happened. ” He also said that all citizens had the right to expect that their police department “be honest, decent, unbiased and ethical. ” “In Austin’s case, and in many like his, those were not the police department values he experienced,” he said. The apology for the Sept. 8, 1940, killing is part of a renewed push across the American South to acknowledge the brutal mob violence that was used to enforce the system of racial segregation after Reconstruction: In a 2015 study, the Equal Justice Initiative, a nonprofit based in Montgomery, Ala. documented 4, 075 of what it called the “racial terror lynchings” of blacks by white mobs in 12 Southern states from 1877 to 1950. The group has begun construction of a memorial to lynching victims in Montgomery, which could open by March 2018. To Chief Dekmar, however, the apology in the town he has called home since 1995 is about more than righting history’s wrongs. It is also an effort, in the age of the Black Lives Matter movement, to address some of the deepest roots of minority mistrust in the police, and create a better working relationship between officers and the community. “It became clear that something needed to be done to recognize that some things we did in the past are a burden still carried by officers today,” Chief Dekmar said in a recent phone interview. “Institutions are made up of people, and relationships go like this: Before you trust somebody, you need to know that they know that they did you wrong, and that you’re stepping up and apologizing for it. ” Chief Dekmar, 61, a New Jersey native raised in Oregon, embraces a view of law enforcement that extends beyond the narrow goals of protecting the good and locking up the bad. He tends to speak about his department as one organ of a broader social body, though one that is perhaps more exposed than others to its ills. He leads regular meetings of a “community outreach committee” in which he shares with other civic leaders what his officers see on the streets  —   homelessness, juvenile delinquency, children with learning and literacy issues  —   and looks for ways that various   entities might work together to solve them. He has also sought to address trust issues: The department, he said, has mandated the use of body cameras on officers for the last five years. The chief became familiar with the lynching of Mr. Callaway only about two or three years ago, when one of his officers overheard two older   women who were looking at old photos of the LaGrange police on display at the headquarters building. One woman said to the other, “They killed our people. ” Chief Dekmar began researching the episode but found, he said, only “sketchy reports”  —   there was “no investigation I could find, no arrest, no   by the media. ” Indeed, the details of the crime appear to have been deliberately obscured for the   residents of LaGrange. Then, in 2014, Jason M. McGraw, a student at the Northeastern University School of Law in Boston, wrote a research paper about the lynching. He noted that while newspapers around the country had reported that a band of masked whites had abducted Mr. Callaway, the local paper, The LaGrange Daily News, wrote only that Mr. Callaway had died “as a result of bullets fired by an unknown person or group of individuals. ” The paper’s headline on the Sept. 9, 1940, article declared, “Negro Succumbs to Shot Wounds. ” Mr. Callaway is generally believed to have been 16 or 18 years old on Sept. 7, the day he was arrested and charged with trying to assault a white woman. According to Mr. McGraw’s research, six white men arrived at the jail that night with at least one gun, forced the jailer to open the cell and forced Mr. Callaway into a car. He was driven to a spot eight miles away and shot in the head and arms. He was later found by a roadside and taken to a hospital, where he died. Mr. McGraw noted that the investigation of Mr. Callaway’s death fell to the town’s police chief, J. E. Matthews, and the Troup County sheriff, E. V. Hillyer, but that an investigative report was never made public. Chief Dekmar has learned that generations of   were well aware of what happened. “There are relatives here and people who still remember,” he said. “Even if those people are not still alive, down through the generations, that memory is still alive. That’s a burden that officers carry. ” As Chief Dekmar learned more about the case, he decided that something must be done to acknowledge it. The city he has sworn to protect is less than 70 miles southwest of Atlanta. Before the Civil War, LaGrange was a wealthy hub in Georgia’s cotton kingdom: Troup County, of which LaGrange is the seat, had the state’s   number of slaves. Today, according to recent census figures, the city is about 48 percent black and 45 percent white. A Kia plant in nearby West Point, Ga. suggests an economic future for the area beyond the textile industry that once sustained it. But nearly one in three LaGrange residents live in poverty. Residents say race relations here, as in many multicultural American communities, run the gamut from friendly to frayed, depending on the day and the issue. When LaGrange College, a private liberal arts school in town, announced that it had invited Representative John Lewis, the Georgia Democrat, to speak at a Martin Luther King Jr. event scheduled for Thursday, protests poured in, in part because Mr. Lewis had questioned the legitimacy of President Donald J. Trump. On Thursday, some businesses around town bore signs promoting Mr. Lewis’s appearance, while some homes featured   signs declaring “Back the Blue. ” For the last two years or so, city and county residents, including Chief Dekmar, have been engaged in a program of racial reconciliation and racial  . At a monthly meeting this summer, Chief Dekmar approached the president of the county N. A. A. C. P. chapter, Ernest Ward, and asked if he would help set up a public apology for the lynching. Mr. Ward served on the police force for nearly two decades starting in the  . He acknowledged that some of his fellow black residents harbored an    attitude toward the police. “I lost many friends when I became a police officer,” he said, “because they felt that I sold out. ” He was asked how much the apology would help with    police work. “I believe it’s a start,” he said. “And it’s helped me to have a newfound respect for Chief Dekmar. ” “Historically certain people in the white race don’t like to bring up the past when it may not show a good light on their ancestors,” Mr. Ward said. “And so they would prefer to keep things hidden. ” Chief Dekmar issued his apology to relatives of Mr. Callaway on Thursday night at Warren Temple United Methodist Church here. The month after the shooting, Mr. McGraw noted, a church minister named L. W. Strickland wrote to Thurgood Marshall, the future Supreme Court justice who was then a lawyer for the N. A. A. C. P. telling him that the local branch of the rights group had asked the authorities to look into the case, but that “nothing is being done  —   not even acknowledgment of our requests. ” Some white LaGrange residents said on Thursday that they were deeply skeptical about whether the apology would have any practical effect. They noted that the crime took place before most people here were even born. “I don’t care if they apologize or don’t,” said Jessie East, 74, who works at a furniture and appliance shop. “It’s not going to change a thing that happened 77 years ago. ” But to others, including one of Mr. Callaway’s relatives, the apology was a step toward healing. “I speak your name, Austin Callaway, and ask God for forgiveness for the people that did this inhumane thing to you,” Deborah Tatum, a descendant of Mr. Callaway, told the congregation. “Some might say ‘forgiveness’? And I say to you that I believe God when he tells us that there is power and freedom in forgiveness. ”"
"The fossil fuel industry, political lobbyists, media moguls and individuals have spent the past 30 years sowing doubt about the reality of climate change - where none exists. The latest estimate is that the world’s five largest publicly-owned oil and gas companies spend about US$200 million a year on lobbying to control, delay or block binding climate policy. Their hold on the public seems to be waning. Two recent polls suggested over 75% of Americans think humans are causing climate change. School climate strikes, Extinction Rebellion protests, national governments declaring a climate emergency, improved media coverage of climate change and an increasing number of extreme weather events have all contributed to this shift. There also seems to be a renewed optimism that we can deal with the crisis.  But this means lobbying has changed, now employing more subtle and more vicious approaches – what has been termed as “climate sadism”. It is used to mock young people going on climate protests and to ridicule Greta Thunberg, a 16-year-old young woman with Asperger’s, who is simply telling the scientific truth.  At such a crossroads, it is important to be able to identify the different types of denial. The below taxonomy will help you spot the different ways that are being used to convince you to delay action on climate change. This is the type of denial we are all familiar with: that the science of climate change is not settled. Deniers suggest climate change is just part of the natural cycle. Or that climate models are unreliable and too sensitive to carbon dioxide. Some even suggest that CO₂ is such a small part of the atmosphere it cannot have a large heating affect. Or that climate scientists are fixing the data to show the climate is changing (a global conspiracy that would take thousands of scientists in more than a 100 countries to pull off). All these arguments are false and there is a clear consensus among scientists about the causes of climate change. The climate models that predict global temperature rises have remained very similar over the last 30 years despite the huge increase in complexity, showing it is a robust outcome of the science.

      Five climate change science misconceptions – debunked


 The shift in public opinion means that undermining the science will increasingly have little or no effect. So climate change deniers are switching to new tactics. One of Britain’s leading deniers, Nigel Lawson, the former UK chancellor, now agrees that humans are causing climate change, despite having founded the sceptic Global Warming Policy Foundation in 2009. It says it is “open-minded on the contested science of global warming, [but] is deeply concerned about the costs and other implications of many of the policies currently being advocated”. In other words, climate change is now about the cost not the science.  The idea that climate change is too expensive to fix is a more subtle form of climate denial. Economists, however, suggest we could fix climate change now by spending 1% of world GDP. Perhaps even less if the cost savings from improved human health and expansion of the global green economy are taken into account. But if we don’t act now, by 2050 it could cost over 20% of world GDP. We should also remember that in 2018 the world generated US$86,000,000,000,000 and every year this World GDP grows by 3.5%. So setting aside just 1% to deal with climate change would make little overall difference and would save the world a huge amount of money. What the climate change deniers also forget to tell you is that they are protecting a fossil fuel industry that receives US$5.2 trillion in annual subsidies – which includes subsidised supply costs, tax breaks and environmental costs. This amounts to 6% of world GDP.   The International Monetary Fund estimates that efficient fossil fuel pricing would lower global carbon emissions by 28%, fossil fuel air pollution deaths by 46%, and increase government revenue by 3.8% of the country’s GDP. Climate change deniers also argue that climate change is good for us. They suggest longer, warmer summers in the temperate zone will make farming more productive. These gains, however, are often offset by the drier summers and increased frequency of heatwaves in those same areas. For example, the 2010 “Moscow” heatwave killed 11,000 people, devastated the Russian wheat harvest and increased global food prices.  More than 40% of the world’s population also lives in the Tropics – where from both a human health prospective and an increase in desertification no one wants summer temperatures to rise.  Deniers also point out that plants need atmospheric carbon dioxide to grow so having more of it acts like a fertiliser. This is indeed true and the land biosphere has been absorbing about a quarter of our carbon dioxide pollution every year. Another quarter of our emissions is absorbed by the oceans. But losing massive areas of natural vegetation through deforestation and changes in land use completely nullifies this minor fertilisation effect. Climate change deniers will tell you that more people die of the cold than heat, so warmer winters will be a good thing. This is deeply misleading. Vulnerable people die of the cold because of poor housing and not being able to afford to heat their homes. Society, not climate, kills them. This argument is also factually incorrect. In the US, for example, heat-related deaths are four times higher than cold-related ones. This may even be an underestimate as many heat-related deaths are recorded by cause of death such as heart failure, stroke, or respiratory failure, all of which are exacerbated by excessive heat. Climate change deniers argue we cannot take action because other countries are not taking action. But not all countries are equally guilty of causing current climate change. For example, 25% of the human-produced CO₂ in the atmosphere is generated by the US, another 22% is produced by the EU. Africa produces just under 5%. Given the historic legacy of greenhouse gas pollution, developed countries have an ethical responsibility to lead the way in cutting emissions. But ultimately, all countries need to act because if we want to minimise the effects of climate change then the world must go carbon zero by 2050. Deniers will also tell you that there are problems to fix closer to home without bothering with global issues. But many of the solutions to climate change are win-win and will improve the lives of normal people. Switching to renewable energy and electric vehicles, for example, reduces air pollution, which improves people’s overall health. Developing a green economy provides economic benefits and creates jobs. Improving the environment and reforestation provides protection from extreme weather events and can in turn improve food and water security. The final piece of climate change denial is the argument that we should not rush into changing things, especially given the uncertainty raised by the other four areas of denial above. Deniers argue that climate change is not as bad as scientists make out. We will be much richer in the future and better able to fix climate change. They also play on our emotions as many of us don’t like change and can feel we are living in the best of times – especially if we are richer or in power. But similarly hollow arguments were used in the past to delay ending slavery, granting the vote to women, ending colonial rule, ending segregation, decriminalising homosexuality, bolstering worker’s rights and environmental regulations, allowing same sex marriages and banning smoking.  The fundamental question is why are we allowing the people with the most privilege and power to convince us to delay saving our planet from climate change?

Think carefully about which roles you’re interested in, recommends Morag Walling, a careers consultant at King’s College London. “Thinking more broadly about possible sectors and directions for your interest will increase the uniqueness of your offer and increase the chance of success,” she advises. Browse professional networking sites like LinkedIn to understand the organisations and what sort of opportunities they advertise. Identify someone with a role you’d love and look at the career path they took. Next, use the abundance of opportunities you’ll have at university to create the sort of skills employers are looking for. When it comes to sustainability, these include problem-solving, critical thinking and emotional intelligence, so you can engage others in the topic, says Houde. She suggests taking on leadership roles in clubs or societies related to the environment and getting your ideas published via blogs, vlogs or social media to prove you can communicate effectively. Get involved in a diverse set of extracurricular activities, adds Walling. Graduates are expected to exhibit skills and knowledge through their academic background, work experience, independent projects and volunteering. “[This is] to showcase not only understanding but real commitment,” she says. Tailor these activities to the sustainability role you’re after too, says Daniel Lewis, an employability adviser at Northumbria University. “For example, if you want to work in the charitable/third sector, it might be best to explore volunteering opportunities with environmental charities. If you’re thinking more of sustainability consultancy or working within civil engineering, then summer internships and year long placements as part of your degree might be a better option.” You could also consider signing up to a professional body focused on the environment, like the Institute of Environmental Management and Assessment. It offers free membership to students on approved courses and opportunities to develop skills and connect with the industry. Contact your university to see if they can offer any extra help. “I’d definitely recommend contacting the careers service to speak about this in more detail and get support in developing a career plan,” says Lewis."

Sound familiar? A study revealing a stunning lack of reproducibility in psychological science triggers another instance of reluctance to share data with any but friends, and an “adjustment” of  data to fit a theory.
Frank Lee MeiDere writes:
By now most have probably heard about the paper published in the August 28 edition of Science magazine entitled “Estimating the reproducibility of psychological science.” Coordinated by the Center for Open Science, and headed by its executive director, Dr. Brian Nosek, the project examined 100 psychological studies mostly from three sources: Psychological Science, the Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, and the Journal of Experimental Psychology: Learning, Memory, and Cognition.
According to the The New York Times’ article, “Many psychology findings not as strong as claimed, study says,” written by Benedict Carey: “The vetted studies were considered part of the core knowledge by which scientists understand the dynamics of personality, relationships, learning and memory. Therapists and educators rely on such findings to help guide decisions.”
In the end, 60 of the 100 studies did not hold up well when reproduced.
This, of course, is disturbing in itself. As Carey points out, “the fact that so many of the studies were called into question could sow doubt in the scientific underpinnings of their work.”
Of more concern, however, is a quote from Dr. Norbert Schwarz, a professor of psychology at the University of Southern California: “There’s no doubt replication is important, but it’s often just an attack, a vigilante exercise” (italics added).
The problem is, that’s exactly what a replication is supposed to be: “an attack, a vigilante exercise.” It’s not a waltz with both partners in perfect step with each other; it’s a battle in which the invaders try every trick in the book to break through the castle walls. Schwarz’s attitude would seem to suggest a rephrasing of that famous justification for withholding data: “Why should I make the data available to you, when your aim is to try and find something wrong with it?”
Has this become the cry of all science? Hardly. In the physics world, for instance, new results are flung into the air for target practice like so many skeet. But then, the reproducibility rate in physics is pretty high — in fact, it makes up our entire technological world, virtually all of which is simply practical reproductions of laboratory experiments.
Other scientific foundations, however, are much shakier, and all too often their response is to ask everyone to sit quietly rather than examining the cause.
Psychology is especially prone to this shakiness. No sooner does one theory get established than it’s uprooted for another. In fact, there are numerous theories in play at any one time, each backed by its own body of “scientific” evidence. As Jelte Wicherts, associated professor of methodology and statistics at Tilburg University, Netherlands, said, “I think we knew or suspected that the literature had problems, but to see it so clearly, on such a large scale — it’s unprecedented.”
There are, of course, those who disagree with the findings of this study. The New York Times reports an email from Paola Bressan, a psychologist at the University of Padua who criticized the project for its reproduction of her study “Female preference for single versus attached males depends on conception risk.” Her complaint was that they used female psychology students as subjects whereas she had used female Italians. She is quoted as saying “I show that, with some theory-required adjustments, my original findings were in fact replicated.”
Any time the phrase “theory-required adjustments” is uttered there should be cause for alarm. This isn’t to say that it can’t be valid, but in this case we have to remember that Bressan’s original study was assumed to hold true universally (it wasn’t titled “Italian female preference” after all), and any adjustments made to “correct” the new study’s results in order to match her own could well be open to bias.
All scientific research should be considered “guilty until proven innocent” and requires an extremely strong defense to stand up to a justifiably hostile prosecutor. The idea of “settled science” is wrong in virtually every field, although there might be vast areas of strong replication and, therefore, confidence.
But at no point should we be under the old army edict of “Don’t ask: Don’t tell.”

You Ought to Have a Look _is a feature from the Center for the Study of Science posted by Patrick J. Michaels and Paul C. (“Chip”) Knappenberger. While this section will feature all of the areas of interest that we are emphasizing, the prominence of the climate issue is driving a tremendous amount of web traffic. Here we post a few of the best in recent days, along with our color commentary._   
  
Patrick J. Michaels and Paul C. Knappenberger   
  
\---   
  
One of the planet’s most prolific weather and climate Tweeters is Florida State PhD and WeatherBell wizard Dr. Ryan Maue (rhymes with zowie). Ryan’s initial claim to fame was his analysis of tropical cyclone (e.g., hurricane) activity that shows, over the past 45 years, lots of variability but no overall change. Originally published in 2009, it flies in the face of global warming doomsayers who predict increases in all manner of extreme weather events including hurricanes and their tropical brethren. As a young scientist, going against the grain is not typically a good career move (which is why the global warming establishment is self-perpetuating), but Ryan is driven more by the truth than by political correctness. In fact, political correctness is an antonym of Ryan.   
  
He has risen to prominence as the creator of the amazing analyses and graphics produced by the private weather forecasting firm WeatherBell Analytics. Many of these products find their way onto Ryan’s Twitter page along with some insightful (and often witty) commentary. His analysis of current weather events is unparalleled. If you’ve heard of the “polar vortex,” you can thank (or blame) Ryan: he first popularized this arcane professional term last winter.   
  
This past week he has been active, covering the humongous lake-effect snows burying parts of greater Buffalo, the cold outbreak setting all-time monthly low temperature records in the Eastern United States, and pushing back against the growing tide of media that so desperately wants to link it all to global warming.   
  
From our standpoint, Ryan is one of the best young weather/climate guys out there. If you don’t want to limit yourself to only encountering Ryan’s analysis on the Drudge Report (which actually isn’t too limiting since his work is frequently featured there), then you ought to have a look for him on Twitter and become another of his more than 13,000 followers. To tune in to Ryan telling it like it is, check out @RyanMaue.   




Also worth noting is that the deadline for the public to comment on the Environmental Protection Agency’s proposal to regulate carbon dioxide emissions from existing power plants is December 1 (yes, that’s the Monday after Thanksgiving). This legislation is the crème-de-le-crème of President Obama’s Climate Action Plan and seeks to reduce carbon dioxide emissions from existing power plants to 30% below the emission level in 2005 by the year 2030. According to the EPA, that will result in a reduction of 730 million metric tons of carbon dioxide, equivalent to taking 150 million cars off the road.   
  
While that sounds like a lot, it really is a very little, especially when it comes to the climate impact. In public comments we are about to submit, we calculated that these emissions reductions would avert only 0.02°C of projected global warming by the end of the century—a value too little to care about (and assuming a warming that is way too much). That is, unless you care about the price. Then you come to realize just how much pain this insignificant gain costs.   
  
Just this week, an economic analysis from Energy Venture Analysis was released examining the impact of the proposed EPA regulations on energy prices. From the report’s press release:   




The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s (EPA) proposed carbon rule is the latest in a series of regulations alongside rising natural gas prices that will increase the cost of electricity and natural gas by nearly $300 billion in 2020 compared with 2012, according to a study released today by Energy Ventures Analysis, Inc. The study, “Energy Market Impacts of Recent Federal Regulations on the Electric Power Sector,” demonstrates the heavy financial burden the EPA’s collection of regulations will force on American families, businesses and manufacturers through soaring energy costs.   
  
The study found the typical household’s annual electricity and natural gas bills would increase by $680, or 35 percent, from 2012 compared to 2020, escalating each year thereafter as EPA regulations grow more stringent. The cost of electricity would increase the most in states that have implemented deregulation of wholesale electric power markets, where the price of electricity will rise to the marginal cost to support new generating capacity.



The full report, including an online tool to examine the impacts on a state-by-state basis, is available here.   
  
If you wish to point out any of this to the EPA, or if you have other details (pro or con) that you feel worth mentioning, you can submit your comments at the website Regulations.gov. We are currently busy putting the final touches on ours!   
  
And finally, a bit of a departure. While typically our focus here is on global warming, the bigger view of the Center for the Study of Science is examining how federal control of research dollars influences science. Global warming is a prominent (and popular) example, but it is by no means the only science topic that is co-opted by the government.   
  
We just came across this example even though it was reported on earlier this year: “Feds Accused of Steering Funding to Anti-pot Researchers.” As drug legalization is a major libertarian emphasis, we thought it was worth dusting off this article and mentioning it here. That the feds are apparently meddling in the scientific research process and favoring those researchers who will produce results that support the federal stance (in this case, that marijuana is bad) should hardly be surprising for anyone who follows us at the Center for the Study of Science.   
  
From the article’s lead:   




As the nation’s only truly legal supplier of marijuana, the U.S. government keeps tight control of its stash, which is grown in a 12-acre fenced garden on the campus of the University of Mississippi in Oxford.   
  
From there, part of the crop is shipped to Research Triangle Institute in North Carolina, where it’s rolled into cigarettes, all at taxpayer expense.   
  
Even though Congress has long banned marijuana, the operation is legitimate. It’s run by the National Institute on Drug Abuse, part of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, which doles out the pot for federally approved research projects.   
  
While U.S. officials defend their monopoly, critics say the government is hogging all the pot and giving it mainly to researchers who want to find harms linked to the drug.



For the rest of the story of the government bogarting the weed, be sure to check out the full piece.   
  
That’s it for this week. We’ll be off for Thanksgiving next week, but we’ll be back with other interesting tidbits that you ought to have a look at come the first week of December.

James E. Hansen wiped sweat from his brow. Outside it was a record‐​high 98 degrees on June 23, 1988, as the NASA scientist testified before the Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources during a prolonged heat wave, which he decided to cast as a climate event of cosmic significance. He expressed to the senators his “high degree of confidence” in “a cause‐​and‐​effect relationship between the greenhouse effect and observed warming.”



With that testimony and an accompanying paper in the Journal of Geophysical Research, Mr. Hansen lit the bonfire of the greenhouse vanities, igniting a world‐​wide debate that continues today about the energy structure of the entire planet. President Obama’s environmental policies were predicated on similar models of rapid, high‐​cost warming. But the 30th anniversary of Mr. Hansen’s predictions affords an opportunity to see how well his forecasts have done—and to reconsider environmental policy accordingly.



Mr. Hansen’s testimony described three possible scenarios for the future of carbon dioxide emissions. He called Scenario A “business as usual,” as it maintained the accelerating emissions growth typical of the 1970s and ’80s. This scenario predicted the earth would warm 1 degree Celsius by 2018. Scenario B set emissions lower, rising at the same rate today as in 1988. Mr. Hansen called this outcome the “most plausible,” and predicted it would lead to about 0.7 degree of warming by this year. He added a final projection, Scenario C, which he deemed highly unlikely: constant emissions beginning in 2000. In that forecast, temperatures would rise a few tenths of a degree before flatlining after 2000.





James Hansen issued dire warnings in the summer of 1988. Today earth is only modestly warmer.



Thirty years of data have been collected since Mr. Hansen outlined his scenarios—enough to determine which was closest to reality. And the winner is Scenario C. Global surface temperature has not increased significantly since 2000, discounting the larger‐​than‐​usual El Niño of 2015–16. Assessed by Mr. Hansen’s model, surface temperatures are behaving as if we had capped 18 years ago the carbon‐​dioxide emissions responsible for the enhanced greenhouse effect. But we didn’t. And it isn’t just Mr. Hansen who got it wrong. Models devised by the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change have, on average, predicted about twice as much warming as has been observed since global satellite temperature monitoring began 40 years ago.



What about Mr. Hansen’s other claims? Outside the warming models, his only explicit claim in the testimony was that the late ’80s and ’90s would see “greater than average warming in the southeast U.S. and the Midwest.” No such spike has been measured in these regions.



As observed temperatures diverged over the years from his predictions, Mr. Hansen doubled down. In a 2007 case on auto emissions, he stated in his deposition that most of Greenland’s ice would soon melt, raising sea levels 23 feet over the course of 100 years. Subsequent research published in Nature magazine on the history of Greenland’s ice cap demonstrated this to be impossible. Much of Greenland’s surface melts every summer, meaning rapid melting might reasonably be expected to occur in a dramatically warming world. But not in the one we live in. The Nature study found only modest ice loss after 6,000 years of much warmer temperatures than human activity could ever sustain.



Several more of Mr. Hansen’s predictions can now be judged by history. Have hurricanes gotten stronger, as Mr. Hansen predicted in a 2016 study? No. Satellite data from 1970 onward shows no evidence of this in relation to global surface temperature. Have storms caused increasing amounts of damage in the U.S.? Data from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration show no such increase in damage, measured as a percentage of gross domestic product. How about stronger tornadoes? The opposite may be true, as NOAA data offers some evidence of a decline. The list of what didn’t happen is long and tedious.



The problem with Mr. Hansen’s models—and the U.N.’s—is that they don’t consider more‐​precise measures of how aerosol emissions counter warming caused by greenhouse gases. Several newer climate models account for this trend and routinely project about half the warming predicted by U.N. models, placing their numbers much closer to observed temperatures. The most recent of these was published in April by Nic Lewis and Judith Curry in the Journal of Climate, a reliably mainstream journal.



These corrected climate predictions raise a crucial question: Why should people world‐​wide pay drastic costs to cut emissions when the global temperature is acting as if those cuts have already been made?



On the 30th anniversary of Mr. Hansen’s galvanizing testimony, it’s time to acknowledge that the rapid warming he predicted isn’t happening. Climate researchers and policy makers should adopt the more modest forecasts that are consistent with observed temperatures.



That would be a lukewarm policy, consistent with a lukewarming planet.

"**A group of hardcore protesters threw petrol bombs at a police station as violence flared in Hong Kong during a banned march that drew tens of thousands.**
Authorities had refused permission for a march through an upmarket shopping area, citing public order concerns.
But large numbers defied that - and a small group of black-clad protesters later attacked a police station.
Hong Kong has been convulsed by pro-democracy protests for four months.
The unrest in the territory, which is part of China but enjoys unique freedoms, is its most serious crisis since the Britain handed it over in 1997.
At Tsim Sha Tsui police station, officers fired tear gas as the building's gate was set on fire. A water cannon was then deployed to clear the area, which would normally be thronged with Sunday shoppers.
In one controversial incident, a water cannon truck fired powerful jets of blue liquid at protesters outside a mosque.
Police said the water cannon had ""accidentally affected the entrance and front gate"" of the mosque.
The Muslim Council of Hong Kong said the mosque was not targeted by police, whose officers later apologised and helped with the clean-up effort.
Elsewhere, shops and Chinese banks were vandalised. A large blaze, started by protesters, engulfed the store of Chinese smartphone maker, Xiaomi, in the Mong Kok area.
Not all of Sunday's demonstrators engaged in violence. Although the rally was unauthorised, it began peacefully.
The anger of the crowd was partly fuelled by an attack on pro-democracy leader Jimmy Sham earlier this week which left him in hospital. He was set upon by five men with hammers in the Mong Kok district of Kowloon.
On Saturday, another man who was reportedly handing out pro-democracy flyers was stabbed.
In recent weeks, numbers attending protests have dropped from their peak. The movement has seen hundreds of thousands taking part in demonstrations on several occasions.
This Sunday's rally rivalled those numbers, according to organisers, who said around 350,000 people attended. Attendance figures from Hong Kong police are not yet available.
One protester, Daniel Yeung, said Sunday's turnout far exceeded his expectations, adding that ""Hong Kongers won't easily give up their right to demonstrate"".
""The government are now refusing to authorise any peaceful protest,"" another demonstrator named Avery said on Sunday. ""That means anyone who comes out will inherently be breaking the law. So that's the tactic the Hong Kong government is using.""
Originally, the protests were prompted by outrage at a new law that would have allowed criminal suspects to be extradited to mainland China.
People in Hong Kong are fiercely protective of their legal system and enhanced personal rights, which are governed under an arrangement known as ""one country, two systems"".
But they have grown increasingly concerned that China seeks greater control.
Hong Kong's leader eventually vowed to scrap the extradition bill, but the protest movement has broadened to include four other demands:
Hong Kong's embattled leader Carrie Lam is seen by many pro-democracy campaigners as a mouthpiece for Beijing â something she denies.
Ms Lam was forced to abandon her major annual speech in parliament this week after opposition lawmakers heckled her, brandishing banners and shouting slogans.
Her speech, calling for an end to the protests, eventually had to be delivered by pre-recorded video.
US lawmakers, meanwhile, have backed the pro-democracy movement by passing a bill in the House of Representatives supporting them.
American companies, including video game firm Blizzard and the National Basketball Association, have also found themselves embroiled in the political crisis."

Dear Simon,



Many have been saying that there is [no pathway to power for National](https://thebfd.co.nz/2019/11/election-today-would-result-in-a-col-landslide/) at the next election.



I disagree. Here is the track clearly laid out for you to follow.



First read President Trump’s Davos speech. Second, plagiarise the heck out of it for your own use.



Mock the doomsters and show Miss Ardern what real positivity looks like.



Third, explain how under your leadership New Zealand will ride the tsunami of growth, innovation and wealth creation triggered by the growth in the world’s biggest economy.



Next, fix the NZ/US relationship as this is presently an empty space that Miss Ardern has left for you to fill (and for an innovation bonus dividend, as well as claiming the moral high ground, address the [NZ/Israel relationship](https://thebfd.co.nz/2020/01/it-seems-that-for-the-nz-government-jews-are-not-us-israel-snubbed-for-holocaust-remembrance-day/) tool).



Then, having gotten us all excited, lay out real plans to address the housing imbalance, (clue: address supply and population growth). Address the reason why so many are in low wage jobs or are jobless (clue: it’s in social structure and parental control of education). 



Finally, stop wasting money on the impossible demands of the climate alarmists, and halve the size of the Government and its Ministries thereby releasing all those good people to become productive.



Unite the country in the quest to be the best and wealthiest small country in the world and by wealthiest, we don’t necessarily mean as measured by money.



Best of luck.

This post responds to the last of Conor Clarke’s comments on my study, “What to Do About Global Warming,” published by Cato. This series started with the imaginatively titled, Response to Conor Clarke Part I, and continued with Cherry Picking Climate Catastrophes and Do Industrialized Countries Have a Responsibility for the Well-Being of Developing Nations?   
  
CONOR said:   
  
**I think Goklany is a bit picky and choosey with the evidence.** ... I also _like_ the Goklany paper a lot. [THANK YOU!! I'll take whatever I get.] But in this case it's hard to resist. [ **Emphasis in original**.]   
  
To take one example (of several), Goklany's hunger estimates rely heavily on those published by _Global Environmental Change_ (GEC), which he uses to make the argument that ""the world will be better off in 2085 with respect to hunger than it was in 1990 despite any increase in population."" But the GEC produced two estimates of hunger and climate change -- one that assumes the benefits of CO2 fertilization and one that does not. Goklany picks the former estimate (I have no idea why), despite the fact the GEC says the effects of climate change ""will fall somewhere between"" the two. … [I}f you embrace _anything_ other than the most Pollyanish CO2 fertilization estimate -- the one that Goklany uses in his Cato paper -- we will be living in a world in which climate change puts tens of millions of additional people at risk of starvation by 2085.   
  
My RESPONSE:   
  
First, let me elaborate on my selection of the set of studies that I used in my paper. Essentially, the selected set of studies (published in _Global Environmental Change_ ) was the only one that had estimated **global** impacts using detailed process models in conjunction with the IPCC’s latest scenarios, and were peer reviewed. Moreover, they come with a provenance that people who may be unhappy with my results cannot impugn. [This is important only because many people arguing about global warming seem to be more concerned about who did the study and whether the results bolster their predilections, than how the study was done.] Specifically, virtually all the authors were intimately connected with the IPCC. The senior author of the hunger study was also the co-chairman of the IPCC’s Work Group II, which was responsible for compiling the portion of the IPCC’s latest assessment that dealt with impacts, vulnerability and adaptation. The authors of the water resource and coastal flooding studies were the lead authors of corresponding chapters in that IPCC report. An earlier version of the same set of impact studies was the basis for the claim by Sir David King, erstwhile science advisor to Her Majesty’s Government, that global warming was a more serious threat than terrorism (see here). The Stern Review also drew quite heavily from these studies (see below).   




Let’s now turn to Conor’s comments on the hunger study and why I assumed that the benefits of carbon fertilization would be realized in the future. Indeed, the hunger study (Parry et al.) produced two separate estimates — one assuming that carbon fertilization is a reality, and the other assuming zero carbon fertilization. But the two estimates are not equally likely. There are literally hundreds, if not thousands of experimental studies that show carbon fertilization is a reality (see also here), that higher CO2 not only increases the rate of photosynthesis, but also increases the efficiency of water use by plants (i.e., it confers a degree of immunity to drought), among the many other benefits CO2 bestows on plants and other carbon based life, including all creatures – big and small -- in the biosphere that depend directly or indirectly on photosynthesis. The probability that direct CO2 effects on crop growth are zero or negative is virtually non-existent (IPCC, 2001b: 254–256). Second, the positive effect of carbon fertilization was based on the **average** of experimental studies; it’s not an upper bound estimate. On the other hand, the notion of “zero fertilization” is an assumption not supported by the vast majority of empirical data. So averaging results from the two estimates makes no sense and would understate the average benefits that would likely result from carbon fertilization.   
  
Notably, the Stern Review, invoked a study by Long et al. (subscription required) to estimate future levels of hunger based on “zero fertilization” using precisely the same study (Parry et al.) that I -- and Conor, in his comments -- used. But Long et al.’s results have been disputed by other scientists (also see here), including some contributors to the IPCC’s assessment. More importantly, Long et al. only suggested that under field conditions, carbon fertilization may be a third to less than half of what is indicated by experiments using growth chambers, not that it would be zero. It also noted that fertilization may be stronger under drought conditions or if sufficient nitrogen is employed. But drought is one of the bogeymen of global warming, and increased use of nitrogen is precisely the kind of adaptation that would become more affordable in the future as countries become wealthier, as they should if the IPCC’s scenarios are to be given any credence. Indeed, that is one of the adaptations allowed in Parry et al. Also, the fact that crop yields are higher in richer countries is partly because they can more easily afford nitrogen fertilizers (see here, p. 78). In fact, China’s nitrogen use per hectare is already among the world’s highest. For all these reasons, even if one accepts the Long et al. study as gospel, it is reasonable to assume that the effect of carbon fertilization will be closer to the “higher” estimate from the Parry et al. study than to the “zero fertilization” case.   
  
But, more importantly, the uncertainties related to the magnitude of the CO2 fertilization effect is most likely swamped by a major source of overestimation of hunger in Parry et al.’s estimates.   
  
Although Parry et al. allows for some secular (time-dependent) increases in agricultural productivity, increases in crop yield with economic growth due to greater application of fertilizer and irrigation in richer countries, decreases in hunger due to economic growth, and for some adaptive responses at the farm level to deal with global warming, Parry et al. itself acknowledged that these adaptive responses are based on the “current range” of available technologies, not on technologies that would be available in the future or any technologies developed to specifically cope with the negative impacts of global warming (Parry et al., p. 57). The potential for future technologies to cope with global warming is large, especially if one considers bioengineered crops (see here, chapter 9), which Parry et al. admittedly didn’t consider. Moreover, an examination of the sources cited in Parry et al. indicates that the “current range” of technology is actually based on 1990s or earlier technology. That is, it is not quite current.   
  
The approach used in Parry et al. to estimate the impacts of global warming decades from now is, in essence, tantamount to estimating today’s level of hunger (and agricultural production) based on the technology of 50 years ago. In fact, the major reason why Paul Ehrlich’s _Population Bomb_ turned out to be a dud was that it underestimated or ignored future developments in agricultural technology.   
  
As noted in Part I of this series of responses, ignoring technological change can, over decades, lead to overestimating adverse impacts by orders of magnitude. Notably, due to a combination of technological change and increasing affluence, U.S. death rates due to various water related diseases – dysentery, typhoid, paratyphoid, other gastrointestinal disease, and malaria – declined by 99%–100% from 1900 to 1970. For the same reasons, during the twentieth century, global death rates from extreme weather events declined by over 95%.   
  
This basic methodological shortcoming, however, is not unique to Parry et al. It is common to ALL global warming impact studies that I have read – and I have read plenty of them.   
  
For all these reasons, the adverse impacts of global warming for hunger (as well as other aspects of human well-being, e.g., due to malaria and coastal flooding) that I used in my paper are, more likely than not, substantially overestimated. And by the same token, ignoring technological change (and not fully accounting for increases in wealth) also assures that the positive impacts of global warming are likely to be underestimated, further overestimating the net negative impacts of global warming.   
  
Therefore, far from being Pollyanish, the estimates used in my paper most likely substantially exaggerate the net negative impacts of global warming. Despite that, those estimates cannot justify emissions cuts that go beyond no-regret actions at this time or through the foreseeable future.

Guest Post by Bob Tisdale
This post provides an update of many of the ENSO-related variables we presented as part of last year’s 2014-15 El Niño Series.  For the posts this year, we’ve used the evolution years of different El Niños as references to the goings-on this year.  This month we’re including the 1997/98 El Niño because it was the strongest El Niño in our short instrument temperature record.  For the other reference, we’re using 1987, which is the second year of the 1986/87/88 El Niño.  Next month, we’ll compare this year to the El Niños of 1982/83 and 1997/98.
Figure 00 compares NINO3.4 sea surface temperature anomalies for the evolutions of the 1986/87/88 and the 2014/15/16 El Niño. Sea surface temperature anomalies for the NINO3.4 region did reach El Niño conditions in the latter part of 2014 so it’s reasonable to compare the two events.

Figure 00
We can see that 1987 (the second year of the 1986/87/88 El Niño) began with noticeably higher NINO3.4 temperature anomalies than in 2015.  However, the 1986/87/88 El Niño started to decay before the usual end-of-year peak in 1987, while the El Niño this year continues to evolve.
Note: Depending on the sea surface temperature dataset, the 2014/15 El Niño registers on NOAA’s Oceanic NINO Index as an “official” El Niño.  See the comparison in Table 1.  With NOAA’s ERSST.v3b data, 2014/15 was an “official” El Niño, but with the new NOAA ERSST.v4 “pause buster” data, 2014/15 was not an “official” El Niño. It did, however, reach El Niño conditions even with the ERSST.v4 data.

Table 1
We discussed the differences in the new and former versions of NOAA’s ONI index in the post here.
INTRODUCTION 
There are a couple of notable things this month. First, NINO3.4 region sea surface temperature anomalies, which NOAA uses as its primary metric for determining the strength of an El Niño, are still running neck-and-neck with the 1997/98 El Niño.  See the weekly comparison here.   Considering the volume of warmer-than-normal water below the surface of the central and eastern equatorial Pacific, we definitely should not expect the El Niño to decay anytime soon.  See the NOAA animation of subsurface temperature anomalies through October 25 here. In fact, we should expect the NINO3.4 region anomalies to continue to rise.
Second, there appears to have been yet another westerly wind burst in the western tropical Pacific recently.  As a result, the El Niño should continue to strengthen.
ENSO METRIC UPDATES
This post provides an update on the progress of the evolution of the 2015/16 El Niño with monthly data through the end of September 2015, and for the weekly data through late-October. The post is similar in layout to the updates that were part of the 2014/15 El Niño series of posts here. The remainder of the post includes 13 illustrations so it might take a few moments to load on your browser.  Please click on the illustrations to enlarge them.
Included are updates of the weekly (and monthly) sea surface temperature anomalies for the four most-often-used NINO regions. Also included are a couple of graphs of the monthly BOM Southern-Oscillation Index (SOI) and the NOAA Multivariate ENSO Index (MEI).
For the comparison graphs we’re using the El Niño evolution years of 1997 and 1987 (a very strong El Niño and the second year of a multiyear El Niño) as references for 2015.
Also included in this post are evolution comparisons using warm water volume anomalies and depth-averaged temperature anomalies from the NOAA TOA project website.
Then, we’ll take a look at a number of Hovmoller diagrams comparing the progress so far this year to what happened in both 1997 and 1987.
I’ve excluded the comparisons of the maps and cross sections (2014 and 2015) from the GODAS website this month.  We already know the 2015 El Niño conditions are stronger than those of 2014.  Next month I’ll include the animations again so that we can watch the evolutions of conditions in both 2014 and 2015.
NINO REGION TIME-SERIES GRAPHS
Note: The weekly NINO region sea surface temperature anomaly data for Figure 1 are from the NOAA/CPC Monthly Atmospheric & SST Indices webpage, specifically the data here.  The base years for anomalies for the NOAA/CPC data are referenced to 1981-2010.
Figure 1 includes the weekly sea surface temperature anomalies of the 4 most-often-used NINO regions of the equatorial Pacific. From west to east they include:

NINO4 (5S-5N, 160E-150W)
NINO3.4 (5S-5N, 170W-120W)
NINO3 (5S-5N, 150W-90W)
NINO1+2 (10S-0, 90W-80W)

As of the week centered on October 21, 2015, the sea surface temperature anomalies for the often-referenced NINO3.4 region are closing in on the values reached at the peak of the 1997/98 El Niño.  But they’re falling well behind the 1997/98 El Niño in the NINO3 and NINO1+2 regions.

Figure 1
Note that the horizontal red lines in the graphs are the present readings, not the trends.
EL NIÑO EVOLUTION COMPARISONS FOR NINO REGION SEA SURFACE TEMPERATURE ANOMALIES
Using monthly sea surface temperature anomalies for the four NINO regions, Figure 2 compares the goings on this year with the 1997/98 and the second year of the 1986/87/88 events.  All of the NINO regions this year are warmer than during the same times in 1987…the second year of the 1986/87/88 El Niño. The NINO1+2 and NINO3 regions are now lagging well behind the 1997/98 El Niño.

Figure 2
In other words, the 1997/98 El Niño was a stronger East Pacific El Niño than the 2015/16 El Niño.
The monthly Reynolds OI.v2 sea surface temperature data are available from the KNMI Climate Explorer.
THE MULTIVARIATE ENSO INDEX
The Multivariate ENSO Index (MEI) is another ENSO index published by NOAA.  It was created and is maintained by NOAA’s Klaus Wolter.  The Multivariate ENSO Index uses the sea surface temperatures of the NINO3 region of the equatorial Pacific, along with a slew of atmospheric variables…thus “multivariate”.
According to the most recent Multivariate ENSO Index update discussion, strong El Niño conditions exist, but they haven’t yet reached “super” El Niño conditions:
Compared to last month, the updated (August-Spetember) MEI has increased by 0.16 standard deviations to +2.53, or the 2nd highest ranking, surpassed only in 1997 at this time of year. This new peak value of the current event ranks third highest overall at any time of year since 1950, closing in on 1982-83 and 1997-98 with ‘Super El Niño’ values around +3 standard deviations.
There’s something else to consider about the MEI.  El Niño and La Niña rankings according to the MEI aren’t based on fixed threshold values such as +0.5 for El Niño and -0.5 for La Niña.  The MEI El Niño and La Niña rankings are based on percentiles, top 30% for the weak to strong El Niños and the bottom 30% for the weak to strong La Niñas.   This is difficult to track, because, when using the percentile method, the thresholds of El Niño and La Niña conditions vary from one bimonthly period to the next, and they can change from year to year.
The Multivariate ENSO Index update discussion and data for August/September were posted back on October 3rd.  Figure 3 presents a graph of the MEI time series starting in Dec/Jan 1979.  And Figure 4 compares the evolution this year to the reference El Niño-formation years of 1997 and 1987.

Figure 3

Figure 4
Like the sea surface temperature-only based ENSO indices, the MEI started out higher in 1987 than in 2015, but decayed early.
EL NIÑO EVOLUTION COMPARISONS WITH TAO PROJECT SUBSURFACE DATA
IMPORTANT NOTE:  The 1987 values of the TAO Project subsurface data have to be taken with a grain of salt. The deployment of the TOA project buoys started in the late 1980s and was not compete until the early 1990s.  Also keep in mind that these values are the output of a reanalysis, not observations-only-based data.
The NOAA Tropical Atmosphere-Ocean (TAO) Project website includes the outputs of a reanalysis for two temperature-related datasets for the waters below the equatorial Pacific.  See their Upper Ocean Heat Content and ENSO webpage for descriptions of the datasets.   The two datasets are Warm Water Volume (above the 20 deg C isotherm) and the Depth-Averaged Temperatures for the top 300 meters (aka T300).  Both are available for the:

Western Equatorial Pacific (5S-5N, 120E-155W)
Eastern Equatorial Pacific (5S-5N, 155W-80W)
Total Equatorial Pacific (5S-5N, 120E-80W)

Keep in mind that the longitudes of 120E-80W stretch 160 deg, almost halfway around the globe. For a reminder of width of the equatorial Pacific, see the protractor-based illustration here. Notice also that the eastern and western data are divided at 155W, which means the “western” data extend quite a ways past the dateline into the eastern equatorial Pacific.
In the following three illustrations, we’re comparing reanalysis outputs for the evolution of the 2015/16 “season” so far (through month-to-date October 2015) with the outputs for the evolutions of the 1997/98 and 2014/15 El Niños. The Warm Water Volume outputs are the top graphs and the depth-averaged temperature outputs are the bottom graphs.  As you’ll see, the curves of two datasets are similar, but not necessarily the same.
Let’s start with the Western Equatorial Pacific (5S-5N, 120E-155W), Figure 5. The warm water volume and depth-averaged temperature anomalies show the Western Equatorial Pacific began 2015 with noticeably less warm water than during the opening months of 1997, but higher than in 1987. Both western equatorial datasets now, though, are higher than in both 1987 and 1997, but note that the values this year are now negative and have been for a number of months.  They simply aren’t as “cool” as they were in 1987 and 1997.

Figure 5
Both warm water volume and depth-averaged temperature anomalies in the Eastern equatorial Pacific (5S-5N, 155W-80W) continue to lag behind the values of 1997, but are greater than the 1987 values.  See Figure 6.

Figure 6
The total of the TAO project eastern and western equatorial subsurface temperature-related reanalysis outputs, Figure 7, are as one would expect looking at the subsets. Warm water volume and depth-averaged temperature anomalies in 2015 are higher than they were in 1987, but comparable to where they were in 1997.

Figure 7
SOUTHERN OSCILLATION INDEX (SOI)
The Southern Oscillation Index (SOI) from Australia’s Bureau of Meteorology is another widely used reference for the strength, frequency and duration of El Niño and La Niña events.  We discussed the Southern Oscillation Index in Part 8 of the 2014/15 El Niño series. It is derived from the sea level pressures of Tahiti and Darwin, Australia, and as such it reflects the wind patterns off the equator in the southern tropical Pacific.  With the Southern Oscillation Index, El Niño events are strong negative values and La Niñas are strong positive values, which is the reverse of what we see with sea surface temperatures.  The September 2015 Southern Oscillation Index value is -17-7, which is a much greater negative value than the threshold of El Niño conditions. (The BOM threshold for El Niño conditions is an SOI value of -8.0.)   Figure 8 presents a time-series graph of the SOI data.  Note that the horizontal red line is the present monthly value, not a trend line.

Figure 8
The graphs in Figure 9 compare the evolution of the SOI values this year to those in 1997 and 1987…the development year of the 1997/98 El Niño and the second year of the 1986/87/88 El Niño. The top graph shows the raw data. Because the SOI data are so volatile, I’ve smoothed them with 3-month filters in the bottom graph. Referring to the smoothed data, the Southern Oscillation Index has recently surpassed the values in 1987 and 1997.  We can also see the early decay of El Niño conditions in 1987.

Figure 9
Also see the BOM Recent (preliminary) Southern Oscillation Index (SOI) values webpage. The current 30-day running average is a very high negative value, as is the 90-day average.
COMPARISONS OF HOVMOLLER DIAGRAMS OF THIS YEAR (TO DATE) WITH 1997 AND 1987
NOTE:  The NOAA GODAS website has not yet added 2015 to their drop-down menu for Hovmoller diagrams. For the following illustrations, I’ve used the Hovmolller diagrams available for the past 12 months, deleted the 2014 data and aligned the 2015 data with the other 2 years.
Hovmoller diagrams are a great way to display data.  If they’re new to you, there’s no reason to be intimidated by them. Let’s take a look at Figure 10.  It presents the Hovmoller diagrams of thermocline depth anomalies (the depth of the isotherm at 20 deg C.  Water warmer than 20 deg C is above the 20 deg C isotherm and below it the water is cooler). 2015 is in the center, 1997 on the left and 1987 to the right.  (Sorry about the different sizes of the Hovmollers, but somewhere along the line NOAA GODAS changed them, but they are scaled, color-coded, the same.)
The vertical (y) axis in all the Hovmollers shown in this post is time with the Januarys at the top and Decembers at the bottom.  The horizontal (x) axis is longitude, so, moving from left to right in each of the three Hovmoller diagrams, we’re going from west to east…with the Indian Ocean in the left-hand portion, the Pacific in the center and the Atlantic in the right-hand portion.  We’re interested in the Pacific. The data are color-coded according to the scales below the Hovmollers.

Figure 10
Figure 10 is presenting the depth of the 20 deg C isotherm along a band from 2S to 2N. The positive anomalies, working their way eastward early in 1997 and 2015, were caused by downwelling Kelvin waves, which push down on the thermocline (the 20 deg C isotherm).  We can just see the end of a strong downwelling Kelvin wave at the beginning of 1987 and a couple of weaker ones that followed that year.  You’ll note how, in 1997 and 2015, the anomalies grew in strength as the Kelvin waves migrated east. That does not mean the Kelvin waves are getting stronger as they traveled east; that simply indicates that the thermocline is normally closer to the surface in the eastern equatorial Pacific than it is in the western portion.
The El Niño conditions were much stronger in 1997 than they were in 1987 and so far in 2015.
Figure 11 presents the Hovmollers for wind stress (not anomalies) along the equator.   The simplest way to explain them is that they’re presenting the impacts of the strengths and directions of the trade winds on the surfaces of the equatorial oceans. In this presentation, the effects of the east to west trade winds at various strengths are shown in blues, and the reversals of the trade winds into westerlies are shown in yellows, oranges and reds.  To explain the color coding, the trade winds normally blow from east to west; thus the cooler colors for stronger than normal east to west trade winds. The reversals of the trade winds (the yellows, oranges and reds) are the true anomalies and they’re associated with El Niños, which are the anomalous state of the tropical Pacific.  (A La Niña is simply an exaggerated normal state.)

Figure 11
The two westerly wind bursts shown in red in the western equatorial Pacific in 1997 are associated with the strong downwelling Kelvin wave that formed at the time. (See the post ENSO Basics: Westerly Wind Bursts Initiate an El Niño.) Same thing with the three westerly wind bursts early in 2015, January through March:  they initiated the Kelvin wave this year. Throughout 1997, there was a series of westerly wind bursts in the western equatorial Pacific. There were comparatively few westerly wind bursts in 1987, according to this GODAS reanalysis, and those that did occur were not as strong as we’ve seen in 1997 and 2015. So far in 2015 we’ve had a good number of westerly wind bursts. The most recent one happened in October 2015 and should help to strengthen the El Niño this year.
Figure 12 presents the Hovmollers of wind stress anomalies…just a different perspective.  But positive wind stress anomalies, at the low end of the color-coded scale, are actually a weakening of the trade winds, not necessarily a reversal.

Figure 12
NOTE: There are a number of wind stress-related images on meteorological websites.  Always check to see if they’re presenting absolute values or anomalies.
And Figure 13 presents the Hovmollers of sea surface temperature anomalies. Unfortunately, the Hovmoller of sea surface temperature anomalies is delayed a few weeks at the GODAS website.

Figure 13
Notice how warm the eastern equatorial Pacific got during the evolution of the 1997/98 El Niño. While the sea surface temperatures this year have reached well above threshold of a strong El Niño, they’ve still well behind those of the 1997/98 El Niño…especially east of 120W (to about 90W), where sea surface temperature anomalies were more than 4.0 deg C at this time.
That is, as noted earlier, the 1997/98 was a stronger East Pacific El Niño than the one taking place in 2015.
GODAS MAPS AND CROSS SECTIONS
NOTE:  Next month I will start to present the animations of the GODAS maps and cross sections again to capture the goings-on in 2014 and 2015.

"Ever noticed how few rivers you can see in most city centres? It’s easy enough to spot the big, usually tamed, main river such as the Thames in London, the Seine in Paris, the Aire in Leeds or the Don in Sheffield. But you will be hard pressed to find any of their tributaries.   The lost rivers of London are well known, but all cities have them. In my home city of Bradford there is virtually no trace of the small main river, the Bradford Beck, or most of its urban tributaries. In Bradford alone, more than 25km of streams have been covered over and now flow within an engineered structure known as a culvert. Rivers were put in culverts partly to contain the smell. Bradford grew from a town of 15,000 in 1800 to 100,000 by 1860 as it became the richest city in England on the back of the wool trade, yet the first mile of public sewer was not laid until 1862 and first sewage works not completed until a decade later. Until then much of the sewage and industrial waste ended up in the Beck or canal which must have smelt appalling – it is said the canal was so putrid that it could be set on fire.   Rivers were also put in culverts to make flat land available. Buildings were constructed over the river itself, combined with raising the boggy land of the flood plain with ashes and other wastes. In Bradford at least, most of the culverts are under buildings rather than roads or public spaces. They often have a wall down the centre of the river, indicating that the two owners built out to the edge of their property. “Daylighting” is the action of returning a culverted river to open water. At its simplest it is taking the lid off the culvert, but most designs aim to create a more natural river shape and re-introduce ecological habitats.  It makes sense to do this now that the benefits of Victorian-era culverting have given way to modern problems of old age, pollution, capacity and blockage, and the loss of the pleasure of water. No engineering structure will last for ever – culverts have to be maintained and eventually replaced if the buildings and infrastructure above are to be safe.  Victorian culverts were built when cities were smaller and less of the ground was paved. Nowadays flood runoff is much greater even before we consider climate change, but the culverts’ flood capacity has not increased. This can have serious consequences, as in Newcastle a few years ago when an overwhelmed culvert collapsed and washed out the foundations of two blocks of flats built over it. An open river will have a higher flood capacity than a culvert, and a slight overflow certainly won’t have the catastrophic consequences of a blockage or collapse. Culverts also help conceal pollution sources. For example, Bradford has more than 50 sewer overflows and many more frequently unmapped drains from roads and factories. Most of these discharge into culverts without anyone seeing them. It is not surprising that there is widespread pollution from misconnected drains and malfunctioning sewage infrastructure that we don’t discover until the river eventually emerges downstream into the daylight. This problem is definitely not unique to Bradford or to the UK. If rivers were daylighted and visible the pollution would more obvious and easier to fix. Colleagues and I have been researching the impact of “deculverting” for a over a decade now, most recently in a review of evidence published in 2018.  In the 96 urban projects the review looked at, daylighting was mostly driven by a desire to create new habitats, to reduce flood risk, provide new amenities and as part of regeneration projects. Water gives a sense of place in a city, and often becomes to focus for civic activities. Wildlife will return to the city – even if it is just ducks.  Many successful daylighting projects have been suburban or parkland sites such as the opening of 900 metres of the River Alt in Liverpool. Major urban daylighting projects are rarer – the opening of the Roch in the centre of Rochdale to reveal the river and a 14th-century bridge is a notable recent example.   One particularly impressive example is the Saw Mill River in Yonkers, a suburb of New York City, where US$34 million was allocated to opening the river to create a public park and habitat for migratory fish. Consequential redevelopment along the new corridor is reshaping the city. A lovely small example is the creation of a pocket park on the Porter Brook in Sheffield, costing a more modest £400,000. As a senior Sheffield City Council official said to me, having this completed example has made it easier to explain the idea and value of daylighting to developers, and further projects are now planned in the city. Earlier generations culverted – and killed – their rivers for reasons which were good at the time. But times have changed. Daylighting offers the opportunity to reduce flood risk and bring water and nature back to towns and cities.   David Lerner discussed his “daylighting rivers” research on a recent episode of BBC Radio 4’s Start the Week."

Disappointing results from an initial rank wildcat can’t kill a play.
The cyclical ups and downs of product prices can’t kill a play.
High operating costs can’t kill a play.
Only massively incompetent government can kill a play.
“This is a clearly disappointing exploration outcome,” Marvin Odum, director of Shell’s Upstream Americas unit, said in a statement. While indications of oil and gas were present in the Burger J well in Alaska’s Chukchi Sea, they weren’t sufficient to warrant further exploration, the company said. Shell will now plug and abandon the well.
Shell had planned a two-year drilling program starting this July. The company was seeking to resume work halted in 2012 when its main drilling rig ran aground and was lost. It was also fined for air pollution breaches. The Anglo-Dutch company first discovered oil and gas in the region in the late 1980s.
The company continues to see potential in the region and the decision not to explore further in Alaskan waters “reflects both the Burger J well result, the high costs associated with the project, and the challenging and unpredictable federal regulatory environment in offshore Alaska,” according to the statement.
http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articl…ulations-costs
The potential of the Alaska OCS is nearly as large as the Central Gulf of Mexico…

Product prices and exploration results are by their nature, unpredictable. Operating costs are tied to product prices and regulatory requirements. Regulatory requirements must be predictable in order for any business to function.

Undeterred by the Senate’s refusal to ratify the mandatory reductions of greenhouse gases stipulated under the 1997 Kyoto Protocol, the federal government has plunged ahead with a $1 billion annual program to reduce industrial emissions that may contribute to global warming. The Climate Change Technology Initiative–administered by five separate cabinet departments–employs an amalgam of tax credits, research and development funds, product labeling and public awareness programs, demonstration projects, industry subsidies, and regulatory programs to increase energy efficiency and the economic attractiveness of renewable energy.



The program, however, is little more than a sham. The CCTI is but a repackaging of failed programs that have littered the federal budget for 20 or more years. The program offers misleading and incomplete cost/​benefit analyses, is obsessed with remedying market failures that do not in fact exist, projects emission reductions that are wildly implausible, asserts a correlation between energy efficiency and energy consumption that is demonstrably false, proposes counterproductive labeling and product standards, and misleads the public about the ability of such a program–even if it performs as advertised–to measurably affect global temperatures.



The CCTI is built on economic ignorance and political symbolism. Regardless of one’s position on the threat of global climate change, the CCTI is nothing but an empty and expensive political gesture.

Guest opinion: Dr. Tim Ball
Kafkaesque is one word that encapsulates the entire Paris Conference. It is defined as:
A nightmarish situation which most people can somehow relate to, although strongly surreal. With an ethereal, “evil”, omnipotent power floating just beyond the senses.
 
There are insufficient superlatives to describe the disaster that is the UN COP21 Climate Conference in Paris. None of the superlatives are the ones used by the organizers and their lackeys. It is the largest, most political conference ever, based on completely false claims deliberately created in the greatest science deception in history. It will cost more socially in direct damage to individual lives, communities, and social structures. It will cost more in economic damage to jobs, businesses, and industry. In addition, besides destroying lives it will remove freedom and actually cost lives. It will weaken economies preventing resistance to terrorism. This far exceeds any potential damage from terrorism and is much worse because it is self-inflicted (Figure 1). 

Figure 1
Maurice Strong died on the eve of the Paris Climate Conference. They are there because of him. They propose a global energy and environment agenda based on completely false science because of him. I do believe in talking ill of the dead if the evil they created continues after they die. Such is the case with Maurice Strong. Paris is a meeting of global leaders completely conned by the master manipulator – the person who fooled the world. Paris is an Orwellian gathering of people who want to save the planet, but who really want to rule the world in their manner. The French government underscored the Orwellian nature of the meeting with a government directive,
…citing the state of emergency powers and scrapping the human rights convention as justification.
Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau would sympathize with this directive because his father did a similar thing.
The people of Quebec are legally identified in the Canadian constitution as a distinct nation with cultural and language differences from the rest of Canada. In addition, they have their own territory (state), so their desire to become a separate nation-state was well within any of the rules set down by the Treaty of Versailles and the United Nations Charter. Pierre Trudeau used the excuse of two deaths in the struggle by the Quebec separatists (FLQ) to invoke the War Measures Act that took away every citizen’s rights completely. He then used the Canadian military to keep them silent and submissive at gunpoint.
It is not difficult to imagine any of the leaders at Paris using any excuse to take control in a similar manner. Ironically, most don’t seem to realize that the entire objective of the conference is to subjugate and then eliminate them and the individual nation states they represent. Maurice Strong planned this when he set up the United Nations Environment Program (UNEP), organized and chaired the 1992 Rio Conference and created the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) to produce the false scientific justification.
The most telling analysis of Maurice Strong occupies approximately 20 percent of Elaine Dewar’s book Cloak of Green.[1] The book is classic journalism because Dewar wanted to write in praise of Canadian environmentalists Maurice Strong, David Suzuki and Elizabeth May now Green Party leader and part of the Canadian Paris delegation. Dewar’s research revealed a very different story. She discovered that they were more manipulative, controlling, and with a specific political agenda than any of the people they attacked.
Strong told Dewar that it was necessary to get rid of the industrialized nations. His reason was based on the Club of Rome neo-Malthusian claim that world population was using up all resources at an unsustainable rate. He told Dewar he couldn’t do anything as a politician but at the UN
He could raise his own money from whomever he liked, appoint anyone he wanted, control the agenda.
Dewar concluded after five days with Strong at the UN that:
Strong was using the U.N. as a platform to sell a global environment crisis and the Global Governance Agenda.
Paris is the culmination of Strong’s time at the UN. A meeting built round the greatest deception in history, a deliberately created lie.
John Holdren was a very active part of the Club of Rome and carried Strong’s climate message into the White House as Obama’s science advisor. The message of undermining developed industrialized nations like the US and redistributing their wealth to developing nations oppressed by US imperialism suited Obama’s belief. He took up Strong’s deliberately orchestrated false story for his legacy. He will find out that you cannot create a legacy – history decides.
Vaclav Klaus was the only world leader to explain what was going on. He knew about totalitarian control and destruction. As he explained at the New York Heartland Climate Conference, we have just escaped 70 years of communism why the hell would you want to go back to that? He summarized the situation in a brief book titled, Blue Planet in Green Shackles, subtitled What is Endangered: Climate or Freedom? (Figure 2). 

Figure 2
Obama used his political skills to bring together a disparate group of people whose views and understandings are in absolute conflict. A well informed catholic Pope would not sit down with socialists advocating a dramatic reduction in world population by any means possible, especially abortion. The juxtaposition is exemplified in likely one of the most bizarre images ever. Surrealist Salvador Dali portrayed the crucifixion from a different perspective than anybody else (Figure 3).

Figure 3
At least, it was the most unique before Evo Morales, Marxist President of Bolivia gave a statue to Pope Francis recently (Figure 3).

Figure 4
To make sure the Pope could not just pass off the statue of a crucifixion of Jesus Christ on a hammer and sickle and move on he put the same symbol on the chain around the Pope’s neck (Figure 5).

Figure 5.
Kafka would understand the scenario, but he likely could not have dreamed up such a plot and cast of characters.
John Ralston Saul wrote a book called Voltaire’s Bastards. It used the same device as an earlier play by Dostoevsky. This has a person of great historical influence return only to be shocked by the interpretation and devolution of his ideas. For Dostoevsky, it was Jesus Christ returning in the middle of the Spanish Inquisition and wandering around saying this is not what I intended. Saul has Voltaire come back in today’s world to learn that the Age of Reason and Enlightenment he envisioned is equally distorted. He would have understood one thing about Paris based on his observation that,
Those who can make you believe absurdities can make you commit atrocities.

"In the world according to President Trump, the United States and Britain are about to make their special relationship great again. Having cast off decades of global niceties  —   the United States by putting him in the White House, Britain by voting to leave the European Union  —   they can now forge a magnificent future. Mr. Trump is readying proof. As he prepares to host Prime Minister Theresa May of Britain at the White House on Friday, he intends to begin discussions on a   agreement that would deepen commercial ties between their countries. A trade agreement would make for useful political theater on both sides of the Atlantic, particularly as President Barack Obama had pointedly warned that a deal would not easily happen. But as a spur to economic expansion and hiring, a deal would almost certainly amount to very little. Until Britain actually leaves Europe  —   a step most likely at least two years away  —   it is legally barred from entering a trade agreement with any country. If a deal was quietly negotiated to take effect after Britain’s departure, its economic punch would probably be modest. Tariffs between the countries are already minimal, meaning there are relatively few trade impediments left to clear away. What areas of business could be opened to increased competition tend to be the most politically sensitive: agriculture, government procurement and defense. Legions of lobbyists would mount ferocious battles to preserve the privileges of   industries. American federal government contracts would attract keen interest from British defense and aerospace companies, especially as Mr. Trump has vowed to rebuild the military. But opening such business to foreign competitors in a trade agreement would directly collide with Mr. Trump’s “America First” mantra. “If President Trump genuinely means ‘buy American, hire American’ above all else, then there’s going to be very little left to offer other countries,” said Adam S. Posen, a former member of the   committee at the Bank of England and now president of the Peterson Institute for International Economics in Washington. “There is no way in hell this is a massive trade deal. It would take massive effort to create a trade deal of even minimal effect. ” Trade, it is worth noting, tends to involve  . Negotiations are politically fraught, because they expose domestic industries to the prospect of greater competition with overseas companies. In exchange, domestic consumers gain access to more and cheaper products. British steak aficionados may cheer the shrinking of steep tariffs that limit the influx of American beef. The British beef industry would probably respond less enthusiastically. It would seek protection, particularly as Britain’s exit from the bloc would eliminate European subsidies for British agriculture. Any proposed opening of agriculture would probaly provoke British opposition to genetically modified crops. British insurance companies may be eager for a greater crack at the enormous American market, but that would be outside the scope of a potential deal. In the United States, the insurance industry is regulated at the state level, meaning the Trump administration would lack the authority to engineer an opening. The biggest impediment to a substantial deal between Britain and the United States is the similarity of the two economies, and especially the importance of financial services on both shores. Opening finance to greater competition would require that British bankers pledge fealty to American regulations. Either that, or the rules would have to be opened and renegotiated by both sides. That might happen in the same way that Mr. Trump might perhaps renounce shiny ties and golf in favor of   and Zen meditation. For American companies, the appeal of giving something up to gain access to the British market has been diminished by the very thing that makes such a trade permissible: Britain’s looming exit from Europe, known as Brexit. Britain’s inclusion in the European Union and its enormous single market has made Britain a prized center for manufacturing and corporate headquarters for multinational companies. American investment banks have been able to set up shop in London and use these bases to serve clients from Ireland to Romania, as if operating in one country. But once Britain leaves Europe, these benefits would almost certainly disappear, raising endless questions about the future terms of trade across the English Channel. Already, major banks are publicly outlining plans to shift some operations to cities in the European Union, exploring Dublin, Paris and Luxembourg. Already, major multinational companies are expressing reservations about sinking the next investment in Britain. All of this makes a trade deal less compelling, diminishing the stakes, leaving politics as the most meaningful context. Last year, before Britain’s referendum, Mr. Obama visited the country and urged voters to opt for remaining in Europe. He sought to undercut a key aspiration of those urging a break from the bloc  —   the prospect that a more independent Britain could strike a   deal with the United States. Washington had little interest in striking deals with single countries, Mr. Obama said, preferring to focus on giant multilateral trade arrangements like the sprawling   Partnership (a deal Mr. Trump just renounced). If it sought a trade deal with the United States, Britain would land “in the back of the queue,” Mr. Obama warned. With Mr. Trump now in the White House, Britain’s place in the queue has effectively been upgraded, a handy development for Mrs. May as she presses ahead with Brexit. She is under pressure to demonstrate that Britain, once liberated from Europe, can harvest bounty via trade with   more innovative parts of the globe. A trade deal with the largest economy on earth would presumably check that box. “It is clearly in the British government’s political interest to show that it can negotiate a   agreement with the United States,” said Stephen Woolcock, a trade expert at the London School of Economics. “The question is what the economic costs and benefits of such an agreement would be? These would seem to be less clear cut. ” In much of the world, Britain’s decision to abandon the European Union has been construed as a retrenchment of British influence and a disengagement from global affairs. In recent weeks, Mrs. May has labored to displace that notion by describing   Britain as a land of dauntless capitalists scouring the planet for fresh opportunities. In a speech at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, last week, she described a British exit as “a vote to take control and make decisions for ourselves and, crucially, to become even more global and internationalist in action and in spirit, too. Because that is who we are as a nation. ” A trade deal with the United States could be considered evidence to further that case. Mr. Trump could post a deal with Britain on Twitter as proof he is not, despite popular perceptions, a nativist protectionist leading the United States on a retreat from global concerns. Mr. Trump has   Carrier and Ford Motor into altering plans to shift production from American factories to Mexico, cashing in on photo opportunities that allow him to claim he is engineering a renaissance in industrial America, even as the big picture remains unchanged. In a similar vein, he could use a trade deal with Britain  —   even a narrow, economically inconsequential one  —   to claim vindication for his encouragement of leaving the bloc. That could resonate with the sort of voters who make up Mr. Trump’s base as well as supporters of Brexit in Britain  —   that is, those inclined to blame immigrants for economic afflictions. “Trump can play to his constituents,” Mr. Posen of the Peterson Institute said, people “who believe that trade deals among white rich people are particularly desirable. ”"
"There’s an idea that when the climate crisis begins, we will know it. Movies present it as a moment when the world’s weather suddenly turns apocalyptic: winds howl, sea levels surge, capital cities are decimated. Climate messaging can bolster this notion, implying that we have a certain number of years to save the day before reaching a cataclysmic point of no return. Living in expectation of a definitive global break can blind us to the fact that gradually, insidiously, the climate crisis has already arrived. In few places is this as clear as California, where extreme wildfires have become the new abnormal. There is currently a “fire siege” in northern California, with wildfires burning in every one of the nine Bay Area counties except for San Francisco, which is entirely urbanized. Tens of thousands of residents have evacuated and people are choking on smoke. The circumstances of these blazes are unusual. They began with a tropical storm deteriorating in the Pacific Ocean, spinning off moisture in the direction of California. As it made landfall in the San Francisco region over the weekend, it sparked a remarkable lightning storm, and 10,849 lightning strikes were tallied in three days. Over millennia California’s landscape has adapted to burn, with some tree species requiring the heat of flames to open their seed cases, and lightning-sparked wildfires are not unusual. But the state has been experiencing unheard-of heat, and just logged what may have been the hottest ever temperature recorded on earth: 129.9F in Death Valley, a few hundred miles southeast of the Bay Area lightning swarm. Vegetation is achingly dry and primed to ignite. California’s governor announced on Wednesday that there were 367 fires, and conflagrations have grown so rapidly that there are not enough firefighters to tackle them all. Neil Lareau, an atmospheric scientist, told us in an interview that he was watching the current fires with “incredulity”. “It seems like every year re-ups the previous year in terms of pushing the envelope, in terms of how much fire we’re seeing in the landscape and how severe that fire is,” he said. There were also, by the by, several fire tornadoes at the weekend. Witnessing these phenomena, another fire expert remarked that California “is the exemplar for climate change extreme events today”. In the last decade, amid drought and searing heat, California has entered the “era of megafires”. Our new book, Fire in Paradise, tells the story of a town that was almost entirely wiped out by a fire of unheralded speed in 2018. It killed 85 people, making it the deadliest ever fire in California. Other notable blazes include a 1,000-ft wide fire tornado that churned through the town of Redding a few months before the Paradise catastrophe, and fires in California’s Wine Country that killed 44 people. All of this is why, as we scan the headlines for the planetary shift that will mark the true arrival of the climate crisis, we risk losing sight of the fact that places like California are already experiencing it. This is not entirely surprising. According to the ecological theory of “shifting baselines”, we do not notice the degradation of the natural world because little by little we get used to it, like a frog in hot water. We think that it has always been this way. Once, for example, the passenger pigeon was the most abundant bird in North America, perhaps the world. Observers in the 19th century described great flocks so loud that you couldn’t hold a conversation and so large they blocked the sun: “The light of noon-day was obscured as by an eclipse”. Yet slowly, as a result of overhunting and habitat destruction, they vanished into extinction, and most of us do not miss them because we have never known anything else. Our expectations of the natural world are simply different. When it comes to California wildfires, the ground has been moving under our feet for decades, as heat rises, snowpacks shrink, and plants dry out. The baseline has shifted. How long before we forget that it was ever otherwise? Alastair Gee and Dani Anguiano are the authors of Fire in Paradise: An American Tragedy, available from WW Norton. Read an excerpt here"

The United States leads in defense budgets by a wide margin, accounting for 38 percent of the globe’s total defense spending. The defensive umbrella extends all over the world with little benefit to the security of the homeland. Pressing threats such as global health and climate change are changing the notion of what national security means—and these threats have no clear military solution. The rate of U.S. military spending was unsustainable long before the COVID-19 pandemic.



Continuing to divert a large amount of resources towards pre‐​COVID‐​19 military threats siphons funds away from where they are needed most: economic recovery. The pandemic’s economic impact is a sobering reminder of President Eisenhower’s warning on military spending, “Every gun that is made, every warship launched, every rocket fired signifies, in the final sense, a theft from those who hunger and are not fed, those who are cold and are not clothed.” Inflating the Pentagon’s budget further only weakens other institutions that could make positive contributions to America’s security and well‐​being. To illustrate the tradeoff between additional military spending and public health, the F-35’s $144 million per aircraft price tag could purchase some 2,800 ventilators. Military power is still important for preventing or responding to some threats, but these challenges should be narrowly defined.



Persistent budget pathologies impede innovation. The Department of Defense, for example, abuses its Overseas Contingency Operations (OCO) funding stream by including items in the spending category that are not related to overseas combat missions as the fund is intended. Since 9/11 Congress appropriated $2 trillion through OCO. This allows the Pentagon to skirt legally mandated budget caps; the OCO funding line alone would make it the fourth largest government agency. The DoD reprograms carefully allocated budget lines against legislative intent, recently stripping billions from the department’s base improvement funds to build a wall with Mexico that no one else will fund.



Inflating the Pentagon’s budget further only weakens other institutions that could make positive contributions to America’s security and well‐​being. 



On top of these challenges, the structure of the military requires overhaul. We are long past the time when manpower was the key facet of U.S. military strength, now we need a lean and agile fighting force. The United States should also stop investing in old and outdated systems that do not meet the requirements for modern battle. Premier new systems, such as the F-35 fighter program (the Pentagon had requested $11.4 billion to buy 79 F‐​35s next year) do not meet design goals due to either structural flaws or bureaucratic malfeasance. The Air Force should focus on improving readiness, training, and retention so it can shift away from its recent pattern of doing less with more money.



Ending the forever wars in the Middle East and shifting the Army’s priorities toward long‐​range offense and short‐​range defense will enable the service to get smaller without sacrificing effectiveness. Investing in new long‐​range weapons platforms and mobile missile defense will give the ground service the defensive capabilities it needs to survive as other countries develop their own precision strike capabilities.



The U.S. Navy needs to re‐​think its strategic objectives and shape the force accordingly. COVID-19’s economic fallout will make it impossible to achieve the legally mandated 355‐​ship navy by 2030. The _Columbia_ -class nuclear missile submarine program is useful as a nuclear deterrent, but it will eat up a large share of the service’s shipbuilding budget and potentially crowd out funding for other ships. A distributed fleet architecture based on smaller manned warships, such as frigates, plus a new class of unmanned surface and subsurface vessels, are best suited for meeting future challenges.



The U.S. Marine Corps has a head start on the other services when it comes to finding innovative solutions to their pressing challenges. The service recently released its 2030 force design, which sacrifices several legacy platforms like helicopters and tanks to move the service toward new capabilities like unmanned vehicles and mobile, anti‐​ship missile systems. The Marines will be in a much better position to fight effectively on future battlefields with a lighter, more agile force.



Finally, America’s approach to strategic deterrence also deserves a fresh look. Our current, overly broad definition of strategic deterrence encourages the creation of a nuclear arsenal that prioritizes flexible response options that are both expensive and excessive for preserving strategic deterrence.



The United States is ramping up a nuclear modernization plan that could cost well over $1 trillion over 30 years. The fiscal impact of COVID-19 ought to renew serious debate in Congress about which modernization efforts are necessary, given budget cuts on the horizon. Nuclear modernization should not be discarded entirely, but delaying some programs and reducing others would be prudent steps. One such modernization effort that could be scaled back is the B61-12 nuclear bomb. Malfunctioning parts recently added $600-$700 million on top of the bomb’s $9.4 billion expected total cost. Moreover, the modernization plan calls for a new air‐​launched nuclear cruise missile that U.S. aircraft could launch at long range from their target, making the B61-12 superfluous.



A global health crisis should communicate the need for drastic changes, including how we define threats and what we consider to be normal. The U.S. defense budget was never normal nor built for the defense of the homeland. The time is now to divest from age‐​old ideas of military strength built on manpower and endless spending.

Portrait of Vladimir Putin, Source kremlin.ru,Author Russian Presidential Press and Information Office
Guest essay by Eric Worrall
h/t DailyCaller – Russian President Vladimir Putin has stated that he thinks the Western climate scare is a fraud, designed to restrain industrial development in countries like Russia.
According to the New York Times;
While Western media have examined the role of rising temperatures and drought in this year’s record wildfires in North America, Russian media continue to pay little attention to an issue that animates so much of the world.
The indifference reflects widespread public doubt that human activities play a significant role in global warming, a tone set by President Vladimir Putin, who has offered only vague and modest pledges of emissions cuts ahead of December’s U.N. climate summit in Paris.
Russia’s official view appears to have changed little since 2003, when Putin told an international climate conference that warmer temperatures would mean Russians “spend less on fur coats” while “agricultural specialists say our grain production will increase, and thank God for that”.
The president believes that “there is no global warming, that this is a fraud to restrain the industrial development of several countries including Russia,” says Stanislav Belkovsky, a political analyst and critic of Putin. “That is why this subject is not topical for the majority of the Russian mass media and society in general.”
…
Putin’s scepticism dates from the early 2000s, when his staff “did very, very extensive work trying to understand all sides of the climate debate”, said Andrey Illarionov, Putin’s senior economic adviser at the time and now a senior fellow at the Cato Institute in Washington.
“We found that, while climate change does exist, it is cyclical, and the anthropogenic role is very limited,” he said. “It became clear that the climate is a complicated system and that, so far, the evidence presented for the need to ‘fight’ global warming was rather unfounded.”

Its difficult to know what impact Putin’s overt skepticism will have on the Paris climate meeting. The meeting is reportedly already in a lot of trouble, because even our economically illiterate leaders seem to be balking at the prospect of borrowing money from China, so they can gift the principle they just borrowed back to China as climate development assistance, then repay the loan back to China a second time, with interest.
To his credit Putin has no qualms about yanking the chain of climate obsessed Western Politicians. During the recent G20 conference in Australia, when asked why there was a fleet of Russian Warships just outside Australian territorial waters, the Russian embassy replied the ships were there to research “climate change”.

Guest Post by Willis Eschenbach
There’s a new study out, under the imprimatur of the Energy Institute of the Haas School of Business in Berkeley, California, entitled The Distributional Effects of U.S. Clean Energy Tax Credits.  As the title implies, it looks at who actually profited from the various “green energy” tax credits across the United States. SPOILER ALERT! It wasn’t the poor folks.
How much money are we talking about? Well, the paper says that from 2006 to 2012, the taxpayers have been on the hook for $18 BILLION DOLLARS to fund these subsidies, money that would have otherwise gone into the General Fund.
And just how much money is eighteen billion dollars? Here’s one way to think about eighteen gigabucks, regarding safe, clean drinking water.
Water Wells for Africa reports from their ongoing projects that on average it has cost them about $3.50 per person ($7,000 per well serving 2,000 people) to provide people with clean safe well water. So eighteen billion dollars is enough money to drill drinking water wells for three-quarters of the world’s 7 billion inhabitants. (Yes, I know that’s a gross simplification, some folks don’t live over a subterranean water table, and so on, but it is still enough money to drill the two and a half million wells that would be needed.)
So what did we do with this huge amount of money, enough wealth to truly change the lives of the world’s poor?
Well, following the brilliant policies pushed by the Obama Administration and the climate alarmists, we took enough taxpayer money to truly change the lives of the world’s poor folks … and instead, we gave it to the American rich folks.
No kidding! This is not a joke. This is what passes for moral activism in the liberal American universe. Throwing money at the rich is seen as striking a noble blow for POSSIBLY saving the poor from a tenth of a degree of warming by 2100.
Sadly, it’s no joke at all—the whole war on carbon has been a tragedy for the poor. In this case, the result of these misguided tax subsidies, of the type which have been pushed by climate alarmists for years, has been to create a real climate “hockeystick”. Here is the data from their paper:
Figure 1. Distribution of benefits of the “Clean Energy Tax Credits” by the income class of the benefit recipient for the period 2006-2012. All values are percentages of the given benefit. “Residential” is subsidies for residential solar systems and weatherization. “Hybrid” are the subsidies paid to the owners of hybrids, as well as hydrogen, fuel cell and natural gas vehicles. “Electric Vehicle” is the subsidy paid to the pure electric vehicles like the Tesla, Leaf, and Volt.
Note that in all cases, the bottom half of the income scale got 4% or less of the benefits …
Look, if someone wants to fight the claimed evil menace of CO2, that’s their business.
And when they want to justify it on the basis that to them, it is a deed most noble and virtuous to be POSSIBLY helping the poor in 2050 by POSSIBLY reducing the future global average temperature by a few tenths of a degree … well, I gotta say that’s as dumb as a bag of ball bearings, but there’s no law against dumb.
But that’s just for starters. From there, it gets ugly fast. Tragically the preferred method of fighting evil carbon is to increase the cost of energy, which is an extremely regressive tax. Not only is it regressive, but unlike many taxes, there is no escape at the bottom of the income scale from increased energy costs. The poor pay no income tax, but they pay energy costs, and energy costs are a greater portion of their expenses than for the rich. So rather than going down with decreasing income, the effect of hikes in energy costs go UP with decreasing income. Like I said, it is among the most regressive,inescapable kinds of taxes you could design.
Raising energy costs sentence the global poor to further impoverishment, sickness, and even death. And hiking energy prices based on the pathetic justification of a POSSIBLE cooling by 2050 of a few tenths of a degree is a crime against the poor of unimaginable size and ubiquitous effect. The war on carbon literally hurts, sickens, and kills poor people all over the world. And I can assure you … the poor are not amused.
But I guess that merely shafting the poor by increasing energy costs doesn’t help the rich enough. So the other noble and virtuous method for POSSIBLY helping the future poor is to fling tax money at various pluted bloatocrats … yeah, that’s the ticket. We’ll help the poor in 2050 by making it easier for rich people to buy a new $100,000 Tesla, and meanwhile Elon Musk is laughing all the way to the bank … at this point, we have to wonder how much folks like Al Gore and Warren Buffet and the UN Climate Ambassador Leonardo Dicaprio had to do with the design of these tax subsidies for the rich.
And of course, these are just the income tax subsidies. They don’t include the massive subsidies handed out directly to the solar and wind industries. They don’t include the subsidies paid to the people wealthy enough to justify rooftop solar when the utilities have to buy their electric production at three times market value … or the cost that I and millions of others pay as electrical consumers to subsidize those over-the-top rooftop solar payments. They don’t include the cost of Solyndra and the other solar companies slurping at the public trough. They don’t include the millions of dollars that with one stroke of the pen Obama gave to his billionaire pal Warren Buffet by vetoing the Keystone pipeline. This is merely the Federal tax-related subsidies, nothing more … and this tiny part of the global waste in the war on carbon is eighteen billion freakin’ dollars.
But always remember … this is all being justified by the alarmists on the basis of “Think of the grandchildren”, and because they’re saving the planet from imminent doooom and destruction.
And if you are someone saving the planet from imminent doooom and destruction, well, you are the man. There is no action that you shouldn’t take if it is in the service of your noble cause. You know that you have right on your side, you’re preventing disaster. You know you are fighting the good fight to cool the fevered brows of those sweltering in the 2050 heat by at least a tenth of a degree, and that it is a fight that has to be fought if we are to save the very planet. Your strength is as the strength of ten because your heart is pure, and you have the moral high ground. As a result of all of that, there is no transgression you won’t commit in order to have other people pay to make your beautiful Elysian (and slightly-cooler) dream come to fruition … and meanwhile, let’s go for a spin in your new Tesla. After all, you only bought an electric car because it’s noble and virtuous and pollution-free … if you don’t count the coal-fired power plant providing your electricity.
I have a proposal for a new name for the Holocene, and it’s not the Anthropocene like some folks claim.
I think we should call it the Egoscene …
Regards to all,

My Plea For Better Understanding: If you disagree with someone, please have the courtesy to quote the exact words you disagree with. This will allow all of us to understand precisely what you are objecting to.
About The Title: For those not up on their English history, Robin Hood was the name of a legendary English outlaw whose most notable characteristic was that he robbed from the rich and gave to the poor … hence my invention of the term“Hood Robin Syndrome” to describe the opposite action.
Fossil Fuel Subsidies: To me, the issue is never the existence of a subsidy. It is whether we get something for the subsidy. For example, one of the fossil-fuel subsidies in the US is the tax exemption for diesel used by farmers and fishermen … in exchange for which, it encourages production and so we get more food. To me, that’s a good deal. The problem with renewable subsidies is that we’ve been subsidizing solar and wind since Jimmy Carter was President, and they are still not economically competitive in the grid-scale marketplace.
We get large value in return for fossil fuel subsidies, whereas for solar and wind subsidies we get almost nothing. Per kilowatt-hour (kWh) of energy produced from solar and wind, there is a subsidy to the producers of about two cents/kWh. Since base electric price in the US is around 8-10 cents per kilowatt-hour, that’s about a 20% subsidy.
The subsidy for oil, on the other hand, is about a hundredth of one cent per kWh, coal is about two hundredths of a cent per kWh, and nuclear is about eight hundredths of a cent per kWh.
Why the huge disparity? It’s because solar and wind don’t produce economically, so they have to be artificially propped up. I wouldn’t mind the subsidy if they actually produced. It’s the lack of getting value in return that is the problem.

"**US Vice-President Mike Pence has criticised the US National Basketball Association (NBA) in a speech attacking Chinese diplomatic and trade policies.**
He accused both the NBA and the sports firm Nike of ""kowtowing"" to Beijing and ""muzzling"" criticism of China.
Hours later, Beijing hit back at Mr Pence, saying the US should ""cease expressing irresponsible opinions"".
It comes in the wake of a diplomatic row over an NBA team manager's support for anti-Beijing protests in Hong Kong.
In the speech in Washington DC late on Thursday, Mr Pence also said Chinese policy was growing ""more aggressive and destabilising"".
""In siding with the Chinese Communist Party and silencing free speech, the NBA is acting like a wholly-owned subsidiary of the authoritarian regime,"" the vice-president said.
But on Friday, Chinese foreign ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying accused Mr Pence of ""arrogance and hypocrisy"", according to news agency AFP.
Ms Hua added the US should ""cease actions that harm the relations and mutual trust between the two countries"".
The China-NBA row began early this month with a tweet - since deleted - by Houston Rockets general manager Daryl Morey expressing support for the Hong Kong protesters.
It sparked furious reactions in China, where the NBA has a mass following that provides substantial revenue. NBA products were taken off shelves and games were boycotted by Chinese state TV.
The NBA released two statements on the tweet - the first one distancing itself from Mr Morey - turning a Chinese backlash into an American backlash as well.
In his remarks, Mr Pence accused the Chinese government of trying to ""influence the public debate here in America"" by ""trying to export censorship"".
He also accused Beijing of ""exploiting corporate greed"" of American companies hoping to do business in China.
""Nike promotes itself as a so called 'social-justice champion,' but when it comes to Hong Kong, it prefers checking its social conscience at the door,"" he said.
""Nike stores in China actually removed their Houston Rockets merchandise from their shelves to join the Chinese government in protest against the Rockets general manager's seven-word tweet: 'Fight for Freedom, stand with Hong Kong.'""
Some of the NBA's biggest players and owners who routinely exercise their freedom to criticise the US are silent on other people's rights, he said.
President Donald Trump and his administration have previously criticised Nike over its decision to support Colin Kaepernick, an American football player who controversially knelt as the US national anthem was played ahead of NFL games.
Mr Pence also called on China to show more respect for the rights of its minority citizens.
The speech came after Congress voted on laws to support Hong Kong protesters. Beijing has indicated ""strong countermeasures"" if the White House allows the bill to become law.
The latest row between Washington and Beijing also comes amid efforts by the US and China to end their trade war.
In his speech, Mr Pence said the US was ""not seeking to contain China's development"".
""We want a constructive relationship with China's leaders,"" he added.
Basketball is the most popular sport in China with 300 million people playing the game, according to the NBA.
The NBA has had a presence in China since 1992 when it opened its first office in Hong Kong.
The Houston Rockets are widely followed in China after it signed Chinese player and eight-time NBA All-Star Yao Ming in 2002.
NBA China, which conducts the league's business in the country, was launched in 2008 and is now worth more than $4bn (Â£3.1bn), according to Forbes."

Share this...FacebookTwitterThe daily Berliner Kurier here writes today that solar physicists at the ultra-warmist Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research (PIK) are warning that Europe may be facing “a mini ice age” due to a possible protracted solar minimum.

Solar activity has been much lower than predicted earlier. Credit: D. Hathaway/NASA/MSFC
The Berliner Kurier writes:
That’s the conclusion that solar physicists of the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research reached when looking at solar activity.”
For an institute that over the past 20 years has steadfastly insisted that man has been almost the sole factor in climate change over the past century and that the sun no longer plays a role, this is quite remarkable.

The Berliner Kurier reports that the PIK scientists foresee a weakening of the sun’s activity over the coming years. “That means that conversely it is going to get colder. The scientists are speaking of a little ice age.”
According to the PIK scientists, the reduced solar activity will, however, not be able to stop the global warming and only brake the warming up to 2100 by 0.3°C.
Given the extreme warnings of warming and sea level rise put out by the Potsdam Institute in the past, this still represents an extraordinary admission, one that has us suspecting a major climate turnaround may be ahead – despite all the efforts by the Potsdam Institute to play it all down. Here we see them possibly setting up a global warming postponement of a couple of decades. The sun plays a role after all.
The source of the Berliner Kurier report is the Austrian weather site wetter.at here. The wetter.at site writes that some solar physicists suspect the current solar inactivity may be “the start of a new grand minimum” like the one the planet saw in the 17th century and left Europe in an ice box.
Dozens of studies show Little Ice Age was global!
Though most scientists agree that the Little Ice Age took place, many dispute its extent. Some insist it was localized over the North Atlantic region. But now there are dozens of studies that show it was in fact a global event. That should make us worry.

Share this...FacebookTwitterDr. Sebastian Lüning and Prof. Fritz Vahrenholt look at recent news articles on the Energiewende (transition to green energies) in the German mainstream media. Finding: the Energiewende has turned into a folly and the media are waking up.
Due to a shortage of time, I will present the main points of the DkS article.
The Energiewende Disenchantment
Things are not going well for Merkel’s Energiewende, and it would be almost entertaining if it were not such a serious issue. Globally countries looked at Germany with keen interest, wondering if the ambitious project would ever succeed. Now we see that the project has run aground. In Switzerland people are starting to feel pity for their northerly neighbors.
The Neue Zürcher Zeitung did not mince words in a June 15 article:
Berlin’s project of the century now in a precarious situation: The disenchantment with the Energiewende
In the discussion over the Energiewende, illusions and myths dominate. […] indeed the euphoria is gone. Recently the director on the Mining, Chemicals and Energy Trade Union, Michael Vassiliadis, depicted a ‘High-End-Version of GDR central planning economy’ as the state intervenes in increasingly more sectors in order to organize the ‘greenhouse gas-neutral’ society by 2050.”
A week later at Die Welt, Daniel Wetzel wrote on the Energiewnde madness – with drastic words:
The absurd excrescence of climate protection
Greenpeace revealed a study on what the world climate treaty of Paris would mean for the citizens. If implemented Germany would be unrecognizable in just a few years.”
On June 14, 2016, even the climate activist Focus allowed concerns by Florian Asche to be printed:
Climate protection-paradox. Commentary:
Energiewende is causing more damage than climate change itself is.
The Energiewende is supposed to rescue our planet. Here no cost or effort is to be spared. However, the good intentions will fall flat if we barrel over the original aims, FOCUS-Online-Expert Florian Asche believes. Politics seem to be ignoring this paradox. […]
A rescue that isn’t.”
So crazed is the rush to rescue the planet, that Asche writes:
Suicide because of the fear of death

Currently it is not climate change that is the big threat, but rather it is much moreso the unplanned climate protection that is threatening our spectrum of species. So here the German Wildlife Foundation estimates a quarter million strictly protected bats are lost per year because of wind turbines. The red kite, a species found only in Germany, has a total population of 13,000 birds. With an annual loss of 1000 birds, the days of this species will soon be numbered.”

Also at Spiegel the German government gets only sharp criticism:
Energiewende: No signs of Merkel
As the Schildburger fools noticed that they constructed their new town hall and forgot the windows, they came up with the brilliant idea simply bringing sunlight inside with buckets. This was also the same type of optimism that the architects of the German Energiewende demonstrated, as a recent report of the German Federal Grid Agency shows. As new wind turbines and solar systems get installed, almost everywhere transmission lines are missing. […] Acccording to the report, a total of 6000 kilometres of new power lines have to be installed.”
On May 30, 2016, the German Employers Association (DAV) disclosed that a very expensive Mother’s Day present was made.
On Mother’s Day 21 million euros were given away in 7 hours: More socialism is not possible.
The fun and games cost us 21.3 million euros. No, not the presents for mothers on Mother’s Day – rather to those who were kind enough to accept our surplus power. On Sunday, May 8, 2016, there were blue skies with lots of sun over the country, and much wind along the coast. […]
It works! The Greens cheered; sun wind and everything else could supply Germany with power completely. Such wacky aphorism spew green parliamentarians again and again across the country. When you don’t count the costs, it works.”
What remains ahead? The outlook is grim Die Welt stated in clear terms on June 10, 2016:

Energiewende – The worst remains ahead”

Especially wind turbines have become notorious. On May 10, 2016 Jan Grossarth described in the FAZ the incredible destruction of nature now taking place in Germany in the wake of the wind energy growth:
The countryside, a wind industrial park
Is the Energiewende leading to ‘more nature’? Absolutely not. We used to think that it would. Now it is clear for everyone to see in the countryside how the solar era looks: rapeseed, corn and wind turbine monocultures everywhere.”
Lüning and Vahrenholt add at DkS:
Not only the landscape is in danger, but also millions of birds have been killed. The Green Party has been quiet about this. Collateral damage that is to be tolerated? Blood is stuck to Green hands. In a few years, when the euphoria over wind disappears, there’s going to have to be an investigation. How could the green movement have gone so awry as to damage nature and wildlife – all motivated by a supposed climate protection, whose neffectiveness and necessity is becoming ever more questionable?”

“The climate change debate is forever shifting as science casts long shadows of doubt on the predictions of global catastrophe. The debate gathered a world-wide audience when climate alarmists gained control of the climate science agenda. Its popularisation has given it a political momentum that is proving difficult to halt.”

Tempranillo (also known as Ull de Llebre, Cencibel, Tinto del Pais and several other synonyms) is a black grape variety widely grown to make full-bodied red wines in its native Spain.[1] Its name is the diminutive of the Spanish temprano (“early”),[1] a reference to the fact that it ripens several weeks earlier than most Spanish red grapes.Guest essay by Eric Worrall
The International Organisation of Vine and Wine has stated it is not concerned about the impact of climate change, at least in the short to medium term.
According to Reuters;
Good news for wine drinkers: a leading international body says grape vines are a hardy little number and can survive climate change, at least over the medium term.
Earlier harvesting, changes in grape varieties and new wine-making processes have already helped counter the impact of the harsher weather hitting vineyards across the globe, the head of the International Organisation of Vine and Wine (OIV) says.
“Wine producers all over the world have adapted to the changes and the plant has a capacity of adjustment that you can find in no other plant,” OIV Director General Jean-Marie Aurand told Reuters in an interview.
He cited the example of the Canary island of Lanzarote where vines are grown in lava which absorbs overnight dew – virtually the sole water they receive in the summer – and releases it during the day.
In China, he said, more than 80 percent of production acreage is located in regions where temperatures can drop below minus 30 degrees Celsius (-22 degrees Fahrenheit) in winter. Growers cover vines to protect them and uncover them when spring comes.

This kind of broad range of growing conditions seems common. Pick up any vegetable seed packet from your local garden shop, and you will see instructions for growing the plant in a wide range of climatic conditions, in different regions of your country.
Staple crops like Wheat are grown in conditions ranging from Canada and Siberia, on the edge of the Arctic, to the blistering hot Australian Outback.
Warmth loving plants such as tomatoes sometimes have to be started in a greenhouse, when grown in cold countries. On a commercial scale, this is often achieved by covering acres of new seedbeds with plastic.
The successful adaption of rice to a wide variety conditions is even more spectacular. Dr Peter Jennings probably deserves a post of his own – he literally saved millions of people in Asia from starvation, by selective breeding, providing the world with new, high yielding varieties of rice.
Other plants like strawberries thrive in cold England, but they also thrive in subtropical Australia, providing you keep them well watered.
Even coffee bushes can cope with a broad range of environmental growing conditions. There are commercial coffee growers in Australia, who produce coffee in climatic conditions far removed from more traditional alpine equatorial coffee producing countries.
In my opinion, it is no exaggeration to suggest climate scares about food production in a warmer world are nonsense. It is good to see industry bodies like the International Organisation of Vine and Wine starting to push back against such claims.

Tribal National supporters are ecstatic that **Simon Bridges** has declared that [he won’t have a path to victory.](https://thebfd.co.nz/2020/02/simon-bridges-announces-he-has-no-path-to-victory/) Their disconnect from the reality of the situation is astonishing. Let’s look at the claims.



 **Winston can’t be trusted because he sued National two days before the last election.**



This one is astonishing. National supporters ignore that National was donkey deep in spreading rumours of a pending issue for Winston Peters over superannuation. **Anne Tolley** was briefed and then stupidly asked her ministry for more information under a misapprehension that it was covered by no surprises. She discussed the matter with at least 10 people, amongst them her own sister, her husband and her staff. She admitted to that in court. National operatives were spreading rumours around the press gallery and on social media before the news broke. One was a staffer in **Paula Bennett** ‘s office, someone well known for leaking, and who has coincidentally recently resigned. So for National to talk about a lack of trust is astonishing in its hypocrisy.



 **Winston doesn’t honour his promises.**



No politician, perhaps with the exception of **Donald Trump** , honours their promises. This is a consequence of MMP. John Key never honoured his promises. He raised GST, added new taxes and generally rode roughshod over core National party principles. We have had two chances to get rid of MMP and both failed, the last because **John Key** rigged the referendum so the vote was split. He genuinely thought he could govern forever under MMP and when he discovered he couldn’t he bolted for cushy jobs outside of parliament.



 **This decision will send unhappy NZ First voters to National.**



Really? Then how come National is behind in every poll except 1News? If this is the case then why hasn’t NZ First’s vote approached zero in recent polls? The numbers don’t lie and the maths doesn’t work in National’s favour. Every scenario that shows them winning needs heroic assumptions to make it work. The two big parties usually slide in the final weeks and smaller parties grow in support. That is likely to still be the case. Deny the maths all you like but on the latest numbers out of UMR, **Simon Bridges** plan doesn’t work. Labour 41, National 39, Greens 7, NZ First 7, Act 2. That seven percent from Winston isn’t going to go magically to National. Those people will still vote for him, they certainly won’t vote for someone who has dissed their leader like Bridges has. Do the math, there aren’t enough votes to get Bridges to the prime minister’s chair.



 **NZ First slid from 12.5% to 7% at the last election, this election will see them slide further.**



Yes, they did. However, in past elections, the smaller parties’ vote increased at the expense of the larger parties. The last election was an aberration for two main reasons. NZ First’s slide coincided with two things. The first being the National dirty tricks over Winston’s superannuation and secondly a surge from Labour after ditching the poorly-performing Andrew Little for **Jacinda Ardern**. 



Those supporting NZ First that saw them climb to 12.5% **weren’t National voters** , they were Labour voters, and they went home. National didn’t grab ANY of that slide, yet somehow they think they will now. National’s vote hasn’t increased in the intervening two years, its slowly ebbing away, not growing. One per cent has gone to ACT, but that doesn’t help National. Some, the soft middle, are pretty happy with Labour, and National has now declared that they don’t want friends. Simon Bridges is expecting us all to believe that from his own personal rating of **5%** he can best Jacinda Ardern and Labour with only ACT helping, something that John Key, despite his more than **50%** personal rating, never achieved.



 **Every time NZ First has been in coalition with someone it ends in tears.**



True, but with a qualifier. Every time NZ First went into a coalition in the past it was with a third term government. There hasn’t been any government with more than three terms since **[Sir Keith Holyoake](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keith_Holyoake)** , a gap of more than 48 years. The Bolger/Shipley government was three terms, the last with NZ First. The Clark government was three terms, the last with NZ First. The Key/English government was three terms and ended, I suppose because of Winston Peters too, ironically, but not because of a coalition. This time it is different: this is a first-term government, not a third term one.



 **Winston Peters was always going to go with Labour anyway.**



Are people forgetting that his first coalition was with National? Are people not considering that Winston Peters would on the balance of probabilities have had a greater chance of going with National this time around to keep the king-maker narrative alive. Bridges has taken that off the table now, so now it becomes a truism that he will go with Labour. But it is also true that Winston’s narrative will now be that National can’t win any more and so only a strong NZ First can keep the Greens out or in check, along with softening the more socialist extremes of Labour.



 **Ruling out Winston Peters makes me more likely to vote National**



Why? National is a less socialist party than Labour. So far we have seen National agree with Labour on almost everything, especially climate change. On almost every policy issue so far this term National has been found wanting. Simon Bridges just seems to have become **Little Sir Echo** , saying “me too” to everything. The mantra seems to be that National aren’t quite as shit as the other lot, plus we don’t like Winston Peters. That is hardly a groundswell to change the government or to vote National. 



People vote for things like health, security, jobs and the economy. They don’t choose a party because of who they may or may not form a coalition with. Apart from aggrieved gun owners, who have been dumped on by every party in parliament except for ACT, there is no groundswell of anger at this government.



 **I’m not supporting NZ First because they brought in the gun law changes**



Yes, and so did every other party in parliament except ACT. With the proposed second tranche of gun laws, supporting ACT can’t and won’t do anything to get those amended in any meaningful way. **There is only one party who can seriously affect those changes right now.** NZ First has seen the shift in polling, only a fool would ignore that, and Winston Peters is no fool. He’s not going to let ACT get any more support from gun owners and the best way he can stop that is by substantially altering the proposed laws to something far more sensible. ACT has one vote, and maybe after the election 2 or three votes, but the legislation is before the house now, not after the election, so blindly supporting ACT won’t change a thing right now.



 **I cannot stand the way our MMP system works – it is totally flawed how it allows horse-trading after the vote.**



That’s not going to change. To expect that it will is folly. We have had 24 years of MMP and will have many more. Whining that you don’t like the rules is like a cricketer whining about being [‘Mankadded’](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vinoo_Mankad). It’s within the rules but people get their knickers in a bunch as it’s supposed not to happen in the spirit of the game. The rule has never been changed since Mankad famously used it in 1948 against Australia. Same goes for MMP…get over it, that’s our system, time you got used to it.



 **Bridges has made a principled stand, he should be commended.**



What tosh. If he has, it’s the first principled stand he’s ever made. However, that is beside the point. What he has chosen is to remain in opposition. So much for “saving” the nation from Labour. Given a choice between swallowing one’s pride and removing Labour from government, he’d rather be pious and sanctimonious and let Labour win. That’s like the Democrats rushing to impeach Trump before Christmas because he shouldn’t be president for a second longer, then holding onto the articles of impeachment for over a month.



 **New Zealand can’t survive another term of Labour**



Another trite bucket of cow dung. We’ve survived Labour before, we will do it again. We even survived nine years of Muldoon, then six years of Labour then nine of Bolger and nine of Clark. I think we can survive another three years of Labour. We will have to anyway because that’s what Simon Bridges would rather do than do a deal with someone he doesn’t like. He’s made the choice to give Labour another three years.



 **I don’t really have any hard facts to support the fact that Winston is terrible, let’s call him a traitor, treasonous, corrupt and duplicitous anyway because that will make me feel better.**



Yeah, that has always worked well. **MMP was designed to foster cooperation.** National seems to think that demonisation of personalities is the way forward. That is the politics of poison and it poisons your own party. **Parties need to learn to work with other parties not talk past them.** Brazen partisan politics is unbecoming and almost always destructive. It is also puerile and negative. You don’t win office by having hordes of puerile partisans mouthing off on Twitter. You win by looking like you can be trusted.



Simon Bridges emailed supporters and said this:



This Labour/Green/NZ First Government has failed to deliver for New Zealanders. The cost of living has gone up, taxes have been piled on, there’s been no new infrastructure, and crime has risen making your family less safe. New Zealanders have been let down and we can’t afford another three years of this incompetence.



If that is true why is National behind Labour in the polls, not 20% in front and why are Bridges’ net favourables **60% behind** those of Jacinda Ardern?



If you can answer those two questions then you may be some way to finding the path to victory for National. You should give Simon Bridges a call because he sure as hell can’t answer that.



I know readers don’t like hearing this, but where possible I have provided facts, history and proof. I welcome you to challenge me with your own facts, ones that don’t rely on heroic assumptions for your dreams to become reality. Try it as an exercise, refute me if you can. Research the polls, average them to gain a sensible data point, then try and work out precisely what path to victory exists for Simon Bridges. I ask you to do that for your own good, so you can see for yourself just how improbable it is to suggest that Simon Bridges can do that which eluded John Key.

Uh, oh…It’s about to become more about the people behind the letter, than the letter itself.
Source: Google search results
Now all we need is a steamy potboiler novel and some internal investigations and it could be Rajenda Pachauri all over again.
The big story at Climate Audit this week (see Shukla’s Gold) is about the twenty authors of the letter demanding that climate skeptics be put on trial, and in particular the man pushing the letter, Jagadish Shukla, seems to be getting quite prosperous with all that Koch Brothers money Oil Money public money he gets sent his way. Steve McIntyre writes:
In 2001, the earliest year thus far publicly available, in 2001, in addition to his university salary (not yet available, but presumably about $125,000), Shukla and his wife received a further $214,496  in compensation from IGES (Shukla -$128,796; Anne Shukla – $85,700).  Their combined compensation from IGES doubled over the next two years to approximately $400,000 (additional to Shukla’s university salary of say $130,000), for combined compensation of about $530,000 by 2004.
Shukla’s university salary increased dramatically over the decade reaching $250,866 by 2013 and $314,000 by 2014.  (In this latter year, Shukla was paid much more than Ed Wegman, a George Mason professor of similar seniority). Meanwhile, despite the apparent transition of IGES to George Mason, the income of the Shuklas from IGES continued to increase, reaching $547,000 by 2013.  Combined with Shukla’s university salary,  the total compensation of Shukla and his wife exceeded $800,000 in both 2013 and 2014.  In addition, as noted above, Shukla’s daughter continued to be employed by IGES in 2014; IGES also distributed $100,000 from its climate grant revenue to support an educational charity in India which Shukla had founded.
But it seems Shukla doesn’t like people looking into that, because the letter seems to have been disappeared from the IGES website. I’ve confirmed this over 24 hours and several search techniques. What was once visible to search engines, is no more:

The original link that no longer works: http://www.iges.org/letter/LetterPresidentAG.pdf

The letter survives on the Wayback Machine here:
http://web.archive.org/web/20150920110942/http://www.iges.org/letter/LetterPresidentAG.pdf
And here is the letter as a single image, with page 1 and 2 combined from the PDF:

Bishop Hill notes:
You can imagine the horror on the signatories’ faces when they realised that some very determined people were about to take a close interest in their financial arrangements and those of their colleagues at IGES.
I’m not sure taking the letter down is going to help much though.
The Streisand effect has been unleashed Mr. Shukla, enjoy the ride.

Note: shortly after publication, this story was updated to make two links active (a recent wordpress problem caused this) and a hat tip added.

[A slightly shorter version of this article appeared in The Australian newspaper on Friday 18 July 2008.]
I devoted six years to carbon accounting, building models for the Australian Greenhouse Office. I am the rocket scientist who wrote the carbon accounting model (FullCAM) that measures Australia’s compliance with the Kyoto Protocol, in the land use change and forestry sector. FullCAM models carbon flows in plants, mulch, debris, soils and agricultural products, using inputs such as climate data, plant physiology, and satellite data. I’ve been following the global warming debate closely for years.

When I started that job in 1999 the evidence that carbon emissions caused global warming seemed pretty good -CO2 is a greenhouse gas, the old ice core data, no other suspects. The evidence was not conclusive, but why wait until we were certain when it appeared we needed to act quickly? Soon government and the scientific community were working together, and lots of science research jobs were created. We scientists had political support, the ear of government, big budgets, and we felt fairly important and useful (well, I did anyway). It was great. We were working to save the planet!
But since 1999 new evidence has seriously weakened the case that carbon emissions are the main cause of global warming, and by 2007 the evidence was pretty conclusive that carbon plays only a minor role and is not the main cause of the recent global warming. As Lord Keynes famously said, “When the facts change, I change my mind. What do you do, sir?”
There has not been a public debate about the causes of global warming and most of the public and our decision makers are not aware of the most basic salient facts:
1. The greenhouse signature is missing. We have been looking and measuring for years, and cannot find it.
Each possible cause of global warming has a different pattern of where in the planet the warming occurs first and the most. The signature of an increased greenhouse effect is a hotspot about 10 km up in the atmosphere over the tropics. We have been measuring the atmosphere for decades using radiosondes – weather balloons with thermometers that radio back the temperature as the balloon ascends through the atmosphere. They show no hotspot whatsoever. Not a little hotspot, but none at all.
If there is no hotspot then an increased greenhouse effect is not the cause of the global warming. So we now know for sure that carbon emissions are not a significant cause of the global warming. If we had found the greenhouse signature then I would be an alarmist again.
When the signature was found to be missing in 2007 (after the latest IPCC report), alarmists objected that maybe the readings of the radiosonde thermometers might not be accurate and maybe the hotspot is there but went undetected. Yet hundreds of radiosondes have given the same answer, so statistically it is not possible that they missed the hotspot. Recently the alarmists have suggested we ignore the radiosonde thermometers, but instead take the radiosonde wind measurements, apply a theory about wind shear, and run the results through their computers to estimate the temperatures. They then say that the results show that we cannot rule out the presence of a hotspot. If you believe that you believe anything.
2. There is no evidence to support the idea that carbon emissions cause significant global warming. None.
There is plenty of evidence that global warming has occurred, and theory suggests that carbon emissions should raise temperatures (though by how much is hotly disputed), but there are no observations that implicate carbon emissions as a significant cause of the recent global warming. The world has spent $50b on global warming since 1990, and we have not found any actual evidence that carbon emissions cause global warming. Evidence consists of observations made by someone at some time that support the idea that carbon emissions cause global warming. Computer models and theoretical calculations are not evidence, they are just theory.
3. The satellites that measure the world’s temperature all say that the warming trend ended in 2001, and that the temperature has dropped about 0.6C in the last year (to the temperature of 1980). Land based temperature readings are corrupted by the ‘urban heat island’ effect – urban areas encroaching on thermometer stations warm the micro-climate around the thermometer, due to vegetation changes, concrete, cars, houses. Satellite data is the only temperature data we can trust, but it only goes back to 1979. NASA report only land based data, and report a modest warming trend and recent cooling. The other three global temperature records use a mix of satellite and land measurements, or satellite only, and they all show no warming since 2001 and a recent cooling.
4. The new ice cores shows that in the past six global warmings over the past half a million years, the temperature rises occurred on average 800 years before the accompanying rise in atmospheric carbon. Which says something important about which was cause and which was effect.
None of these four points are controversial. The alarmist scientists agree with them, though they would dispute their relevance.
The last point was known and past dispute by 2003, yet Al Gore made his movie in 2005 and presented the ice cores as the sole reason for believing that carbon emissions cause global warming. In any other political context our cynical and experienced press corps would surely have called this dishonest and widely questioned the politician’s assertion.
Until now the global warming debate has merely been an academic matter of little interest. Now that it matters, we should debate the causes of global warming.
So far that debate has just consisted of a simple sleight of hand: show evidence of global warming, and while the audience is stunned at the implications, simply assert that it is due to carbon emissions. In the mind of the audience, the evidence that global warming has occurred becomes conflated with the alleged cause, and the audience hasn’t noticed that the cause was merely asserted, not proved. If there really was any evidence that carbon emissions caused global warming, don’t you think we would have heard all about it ad naseum by now?
The Labor Government is about to deliberately wreck the economy in order to reduce carbon emissions. If the reasons later turn out to be bogus, the electorate is not going to re-elect a Labor government for a long time. When it comes to light that the carbon scare was known to be bogus in 2008, the ALP is going to be regarded as criminally negligent or ideologically stupid for not having seen through it. And if the Liberals support the general thrust of their actions, they will be seen likewise.
The onus should be on those who want to change things to provide evidence for why the changes are necessary. The Australian public is eventually going to have to be told the evidence anyway, so it might as well be before wrecking the economy. It is the job of our opposition politicians and press to demand the evidence from the relevant minister, Penny Wong.
And what is going to happen over the next decade as the global temperature continues not to rise? When the public find out that all the above points were known in 2008, might they feel deceived, furious at the futility of the economic sacrifices?
Who is going to be held responsible? Perhaps the political class, for not having the wit to examine the evidence? Maybe the press, for not have not done even the most elementary job of informing a debate and asking questions? (If any of the missing signature, the lack of actual evidence, the lack of temperature rises since 2001, or the 800 year lag of CO2 in the ice cores are news to you, then no, your press has not been keeping you well informed.)
Don’t you think some evidence is required before wrecking the economy? Someone simply has to demand to see evidence. You will find that there is none.

"**A Hong Kong student has died after falling during protests on Monday - sparking impromptu protests and vigils from pro-democracy activists.**
Alex Chow fell from the ledge of a car park during a police operation to clear the area on Monday morning.
The exact circumstances of his fall are unclear, but reports say he was trying to get away from tear gas.
The 22-year-old's death came after another week of political violence in Hong Kong.
On Wednesday a pro-Beijing lawmaker was stabbed in the street by a person pretending to be a supporter.
Mr Chow had been in a coma since Monday and was certified dead early on Friday, according to the hospital he was treated in.
Fellow students at the city's University of Science and Technology called for an investigation into how Mr Chow fell, and why it took paramedics nearly 20 minutes to arrive. Amnesty International echoed that call.
At the time of his fall, dozens of riot police were approaching, firing tear gas into the car park and surrounding areas to clear away protesters.
Police said they used tear gas to disperse protesters near the site but denied any wrongdoing, saying their actions had been justified.
But Mr Chow's death is expected to fuel more anger at the police, who are already under pressure as Hong Kong faces its worst crisis in decades.
""Today we mourn the loss of the freedom fighter in HK,"" Joshua Wong, a pro-democracy campaigner, said on Twitter. ""We will not leave anyone behind - what we start together, we finish together.""
Protesters gathered across the city, taking part in mourning events. Thousands left flowers at the spot in which he fell at the car park. Some people sang hymns.
A 23-year-old student, who said she attended the same university as Mr Chow, told AFP news agency: ""I think there should be an independent inquiry commission to investigate his death and other incidents that happened during the movement.""
Other people gathered in the shopping district of Causeway Bay, lining the streets in silence.
At Hong Kong's University of Science and Technology, dozens of protesters vandalised a Starbucks, Bank of China and at least three cafeterias on site, the South China Morning Post reports.
They wrote ""condemn police brutality"" on the walls of the Starbucks store.
Protesters are calling for more demonstrations this weekend.
Hong Kong is part of China but as a former British colony it has some autonomy and people have more rights.
The protests started in June against plans to allow extradition to the mainland - which many feared would undermine the city's freedoms.
The bill was withdrawn in September but demonstrations continued and now call for full democracy and an inquiry into police behaviour.
Clashes between police and activists have become increasingly violent and in October the city banned all face masks."
"The year 2019 concludes a decade of exceptional heat, and is on track to be the second or third warmest year on record. While the global average temperature teeters on 1.1°C above the pre-industrial record, the world’s glaciers are in stark retreat.  In high mountain areas, the steady trickle of melting snow in spring has nourished people for generations. Today, 1.9 billion people – or 22% of the world’s population – live downstream of snowpacks and glaciers and depend on them as their main source of drinking water. These icy and snowbound mountain regions could be considered water towers, which provide a regular supply of water for drinking, irrigation and power generation, and provide a life-saving buffer during droughts.

      Greenland has lost 3.8 trillion tonnes of ice since 1992


 But as rainfall patterns shift and temperatures rise due to climate change, these glaciers are thinning and retreating. When snowpacks shrink, so does the amount of water stored in these mountain water towers. I’m part of a team of 32 international scientists that have looked at 78 of these water towers worldwide and tried to find out how much water they store and supply, and how many people depend on them for their survival. The Indus basin is the most important water storage unit in Asia. Fed by rain and snow high up in the Himalayan, Karakoram, Hindu-Kush, and Ladakh mountain ranges, the water that drains from lakes and glaciers here supports 206 million people across parts of Afghanistan, China, India and Pakistan. Much of it is used for irrigating crops and in industry, as well as drinking water. But the Indus is also the most vulnerable water tower on Earth. The number of people directly dependent on the water it supplies is set to substantially increase over the next 30 years. At the same time, regional temperatures are projected to rise by 1.9°C. The glacial melt this causes could mean millions of people without enough water during dry seasons and especially during drought years. Eventually, entire communities may be forced to seek refuge elsewhere. In Europe, the Alps is the most important water tower for the number of people dependent on its supply, followed by the Rhone, Rhine and Po basins. In North America, the Fraser and Columbia basins are the most critical water towers. The river Fraser has a high natural water demand in the downstream forest ecosystem, while the Columbia basin is rich in snow and ice and has high demand for irrigation from local farms. In South America, the South Chile, South Argentina, Negro, La Puna and North Chile water towers are the most critical suppliers of water to the thirsty South Atlantic and South Pacific coasts.

      Amazon fires are causing glaciers in the Andes to melt even faster


 As in the Indus, water storage and supply in these regions is under threat. Severe and unmitigated climate change could see mountain glacier ice and snow that existed in 2015 reduced by up to 80% by 2100. But if global heating can be limited to 1.5°C, the world could retain 75% of its mountain glacier area and avoid the most significant impacts. Limiting global heating to 1.5°C could also be pivotal for the polar ice sheets. Another recent study showed that the Antarctic Peninsula, which extends north from the Antarctic continent towards South America, is currently undergoing rapid changes driven by global heating. Here, glaciers are retreating and ice shelves are thinning and collapsing. Parts of some glaciers have beds that are 1,000 metres below sea level. These are eroding as changes in ocean circulation bring warm ocean currents. The small Antarctic Peninsula currently accounts for 25% of all ice losses from Antarctica, and its relatively small, fast-flowing glaciers are sensitive to change. As such, the peninsula is an early warning system that would precede catastrophic ice loss from the larger West Antarctic Ice Sheet. Melting from the Antarctic Peninsula alone has the potential to raise global sea levels by 64 to 74mm, and currently adds 0.09mm per year to global sea level rise. But if global heating stops at the critical threshold of 1.5°C, most polar ice will be saved. Those receding glaciers that end in the sea will slow their retreat as they reach land and find a new equilibrium. Ice shelves will likely not collapse, and will continue to stabilise the glaciers that feed them. By limiting warming to under 1.5°C, the world will probably avoid catastrophic ice loss from West Antarctica.

      Sea level rise is inevitable – but what we do today can still prevent catastrophe for coastal regions


 Our research showed how gravely global heating threatens the water supply of one third of the world’s population. But we also found cause for hope. Strong action now to maintain global temperatures below 1.5℃ will mean that the majority of the world’s mountain glaciers remain, preventing droughts that could affect millions of people. The polar ice sheets will keep most of their mass, meaning that substantial flooding of lowland areas can be avoided. The next decade will determine whether the world is serious about ensuring that."
"If you see a violet carpenter bee, Xylocopa violacea, in Britain, it seems too exotic for our shores, and too big. It is up to 3cm long, the size of our largest bumble bee, and it looks even larger when flying with an impressive buzz. In late August, the adults emerge from a dead tree trunk or other old wood where they have spent the larval stage. After mating in late April or May, female bees bore holes in rotten wood and lay eggs in separate chambers, each one sealed in with a store of pollen so the emerging larvae can have a good start in life.  Climate change has brought this southern European species to our shores. It was first spotted breeding here in 2007 in Leicestershire, but it is still extremely rare, almost certainly because of lack of suitable breeding sites rather than the climate. The bees need rotting wood, soft enough to create nesting holes, hence the name carpenter bees. They have been accused of destroying wooden buildings but they only start colonising when the wood is already rotten so the structure was in danger before they arrived. What they are looking for now is old nest holes or other cavities in decaying timber to hibernate until the breeding cycle begins again in the spring. "

Share this...FacebookTwitterEconomics editor Daniel Wetzel at Germany’s center-right national daily Die Welt here writes that the Brexit may be the end of the Paris climate treaty and that it is a climate-political nightmare for the EU.
Already, he notes, the price of CO2 emissions certificates has plummeted to near low-grade levels, see chart at Die Welt.
The Die Welt journalist writes that those holding these pollution-permitting certifcates saw a large chunk of value get wiped out. Already at the end of last year the certificates had a value of near 9 euros. Now they are hovering at less than 5 euros.
The reason for the plunge in price, Wetzel writes, is that Great Britain will no longer be bound to the European Emissions Trading system, and so dozens of UK power plants will no longer need their certificates and will likely dump them on the European market, causing their price to plummet further. The result, Wetzel writes:
For industrial plants all over Europe there will be hardly any financial incentive left to invest in CO2-saving efficiency technology.”
New political constellation at Westminster
Activists are still hoping that Britain will remain in the Emissions Trading Scheme, even after exiting the EU, just as non EU member Iceland, Norway and Lichtenstein are currently doing. Wetzel asks whether Britain will continue staying commited to ambitious CO2 reductions as it has in the past. One factor that speaks against continued commitment to reducing CO2 emissions is that “among Brexiteers and EU-skeptics in Unitted Kingdom – as is the case with the German AfD – the number of climate skeptics is especially high“.
Wetzel adds:

In part not only is the man-made impact on climate questioned, but whether climate change is happening at all. In a new political constellation in Westminister, the high British climate targets may not be possible to maintain in the future.”
A weakened Europe in climate negotiations
Here Wetzel cites a recent research paper by the Chatham House that looked at the possible impacts on climate policy should Britain vote to leave the EU. The Chatham Report has in its conclusion:

A diminished EU, for its part, would be weaker in managing relationships with Russia, which already seeks to divide it and to negotiate bilateral energy deals with individual member states. The EU would also be less able to influence global climate negotiations alongside other major powers such as China and the United States, as it would represent a much smaller share of the global economy and of global emissions. This would not serve the longterm interests of either the UK or the EU.

The report concludes that in the event of a British exit (which is now the case), Britain would be freer to decide its energy policies on its own without meddling from Brussels.
Climate policy-making center of gravity shifts eastwards
What bodes especially ill for European climate policy, Wetzel writes, is that the “decision-making center of gravity” will now likely shift eastwards to more climate-policy obstinate countries, such as coal-producing Poland, and the Czech Republic.
Wetzel even warns, citing the Chatham House report, that should Britain not live up to its climate protection commitments, it could face “international criticism, and in the worst case sanctions from other countries“.

"The overthrow of Bolivian president Evo Morales shows how the politics of environmentalism and social justice intersect in a silvery-white metal. As Morales flew to exile in Mexico, commentators wondered what will become of Bolivia’s lithium, a strategic resource used in consumer electronics and electric cars.  Lithium batteries are the most energetic ever created, and have inspired hopes that electric vehicles can help reverse climate change, as well as expectations of a boom in “white petroleum” or “white gold,” as boosters refer to lithium. These are loaded analogies in a country defined by the brutal legacy of the Spanish conquest, and this history has guided how the Morales government approached the question of natural resources.  Its goal with lithium was to produce raw materials and battery components as part of a plan to foster domestic industrialisation. Depending on your ideological perspective, the fall of Morales either signals a return to the bad old days or heralds an era of rational resource development. Will Bolivia get its white gold rush under new management? The short answer is probably not, for reasons that have as much to do with the paradoxes of public policy and the global market for electric cars as with persistent north-south inequity.  Essentially, Bolivian lithium gained value thanks to California air quality policy. In 1990, the Golden State basically forced the auto industry to produce battery electric vehicles. Automakers were aghast because batteries have shorter lifespans than electric motors, and this durability dilemma primarily rewards battery-making, not auto-making. In response, they fiercely lobbied to delay their commitments, infamously recalling and “killing” their small fleets of leased electrics around the turn of the millennium.  In the late 2000s, though, electrics staged a comeback, largely thanks to Tesla Motors, a start-up that benefited from heavy state and federal subsidies. In turn, Tesla’s survival led some mainstream automakers to grudgingly reconsider electrics. And that stimulated the global lithium industry, especially in South America, home to the “lithium triangle”, a vast area of lithium-rich salt pans in the Andean high desert that overlaps Argentina, Bolivia and Chile. Over the past decade, Bolivia’s neighbours became important exporters of lithium carbonate, the basic form of refined lithium, and the Morales government wanted in, too.  Bolivia has at least a quarter of the world’s lithium, including the single largest deposit in the Salar de Uyuni, a salt pan so large it can be seen from space. In 2008, the government started work on a pilot plant to refine lithium carbonate and in 2018 struck a deal with a German company called ACI Systems to build an integrated plant producing lithium compounds and battery components. Sceptical observers pointed out that this ambitious scheme faced a host of serious technical, economic and geopolitical obstacles from the outset. Lithium is mined in two ways: from hard rock, as in Australia, one of the world’s largest producers, or by evaporating the thin layer of brine that covers salt pans. This is how it is done in the Chilean and Argentine deposits.  But the Uyuni is wetter and at a higher altitude (3,656 metres), so evaporation there is less efficient. Moreover, Bolivian lithium contains more impurities, complicating the extraction process. ACI said it could overcome these problems with new technology, but delays and disputes about royalties led the Bolivian government to cancel the deal in early November. Days later, Morales was deposed. It is impossible to abstract lithium politics from Bolivia’s longstanding social crisis, often characterised as a struggle pitting white economic elites based in the lowland city of Santa Cruz, the commercial centre, against the largely indigenous political class in highland La Paz, the national capital. Critics argued that the integrated lithium operation had been ill-coordinated and some welcomed the coup as an opportunity to reorganise and speed up the effort. The reality is that Bolivia is beholden to forces largely out of its control. Its lithium reserves are isolated and hard to process, but the main factor preventing a white gold rush is the uncertain market for all-battery electric vehicles.  There are around 5 million electric vehicles in the world today. An impressive figure in historical context, but electric cars still represent only 0.7% of overall production, and mainstream automakers are not keen to ramp it up. The cars generally lose money and remain expensive.  Because the electric vehicle fleets are so new, nobody knows what battery lifetime and lifecycle costs might be and who is going to pay for replacement packs. Right now, those costs are decoupled from market demand and obscured by public subsidies that in some cases are being phased out. And these uncertainties are bad news for lithium producers. Expecting an electric vehicle boom, they overinvested and created a supply glut that slashed the price of lithium carbonate from US$25,000 to US$10,000 per metric tonne over the past two years. You might think that this would make for cheaper batteries, but battery packs are actually less sensitive to the prices of commodity materials than typically assumed – instead, much of the cost comes from manufacturing inefficiencies.  If the coup-makers believe that getting rid of Morales is going to change any of this, they are likely to be disappointed. The former president represented a constituency that is in no hurry to develop the country’s resources if that means giving control and most of the profits to outsiders. The changing fortunes of the electric car industry, symptomatic more of a vast experiment than a true commercial enterprise at this stage, bear out this cautious approach. What is certain is that the civil unrest provoked by the coup will not do Bolivia’s lithium industry any good."
"**Ethiopian Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed says he is launching the ""final phase"" of the army's operation in the northern region of Tigray after weeks of fighting.**
He said the military would try not to harm civilians in the regional capital Mekelle - a city of 500,000 people - and urged residents to stay at home.
The TPLF party, which controls Mekelle, has vowed to keep fighting.
The UN warns of possible war crimes if the Ethiopian army attacks Mekelle.
UN human rights chief Michele Bachelet told the BBC the city's inhabitants were in ""deep peril"".
""We're really alarmed by the dangerous situation particularly because of the civilians trapped in Mekelle,"" she said, adding that there was ""potential for serious violations of international humanitarian human rights law"".
The UN has also expressed concerns about the lack of access to the region for humanitarian workers.
The Ethiopian authorities on Thursday said that ""a humanitarian access route"" overseen by the government will be opened up, adding that they were ""committed to work with UN agencies... to protect civilians and those who need it"".
Mr Abiy's announcement on the military operation came after a deadline he gave for Tigray fighters to surrender passed on Wednesday.
Hundreds of people have reportedly been killed and thousands have been forced from their homes as Ethiopian forces have seized various towns in Tigray from the TPLF.
Details of the fighting are hard to confirm because all phone, mobile and internet communications with the Tigray region have been cut.
Journalist and political activist Daniel Berhane, who is in Mekelle, told the BBC there was no sign yet of any attack, and that shops, cafes and restaurants in the city were ""almost full"".
Three African Union representatives have arrived in the Ethiopian capital Addis Ababa to try to broker talks but Ethiopia has so far rejected all mediation attempts, saying the conflict is an internal matter and Mr Abiy's government is engaged in a law enforcement mission in Tigray.
The three envoys will not be allowed to travel to Tigray.
Also on Thursday, Ethiopian troops were deployed along the Tigray region's border with Sudan, where they prevented people fleeing the violence from leaving the country, according to refugees.
The BBC's Anne Soy, on the Sudanese side of the border, saw at least a dozen members of the Ethiopian military, leading to a marked decrease in the number of people crossing into Sudan.
More than 40,000 people have fled Ethiopia since the conflict began.
**By Kalkidan Yibeltal, BBC News, Addis Ababa**
In the ""final phase"" of the military offensive that PM Abiy launched following the expiry of the 72-hour ultimatum, he spoke of a military strategy in which top personnel of the TPLF would be brought to justice without harming civilians or properties in and around Mekelle.
It is not clear what that strategy is but it will not be easy to carry it out, particularly if there's active fighting in the city. Artillery attacks, as were suggested by an army official last week, and airstrikes are particularly difficult to conduct without killing civilians and destroying civilian infrastructure.
The federal government's troops could be met with a sort of guerrilla warfare from the area outside Mekelle.
And it could also take longer than the government would like to conclude the offensive. That could mean a worsening of the humanitarian crisis and consequently more international pressure.
In the past three weeks the government has taken control of a number of areas in Tigray but at a cost. An offensive on the state capital - believed to be the main stronghold of the TPLF - could be even more costly.
He ordered the Ethiopian military to launch an offensive on Mekelle in the ""third and final phase"" of the federal government's military campaign against the TPLF.
Mr Abiy said ""great care"" would be taken to protect civilians and ""all efforts"" would be made to limit damage to Mekelle.
He urged people in Mekelle and the surrounding areas to disarm, stay at home and keep away from military targets.
Religious and historical sites, institutions and residential areas would not be targeted, he said.
The leader of the powerful regional party, Debretsion Gebremichael, has said Tigray forces are ""ready to die in defence of our right to administer our region"".
The TPLF fighters, drawn mostly from a paramilitary unit and a well-drilled local militia, are thought to number about 250,000. Some analysts fear that the situation could turn into a guerrilla conflict - with the TPLF continuing to mount attacks on government forces even if they take Mekelle.
One example of how this might play out is the battle for Aksum airport, which according to pro-government sources fell to Ethiopian forces on 11 November and is still controlled by them.
But 11 days after the capture state media published pictures of the runway apparently strewn with rubble and with trenches dug across it to prevent planes landing, accusing the TPLF of sabotage attacks. Mr Debretsion denied destroying the airport, saying his forces had put up obstacles to stop the Ethiopian army.
Reuters quoted a diplomatic source as saying the TPLF ""have mobilised lots of people in Mekelle"". The person added: ""They are digging trenches and everyone has an AK-47 [rifle].""
Aid groups fear the conflict could trigger a humanitarian crisis and destabilise the Horn of Africa region.
Ethiopia's state-appointed Human Rights Commission has accused a Tigrayan youth group of being behind a massacre earlier this month in which it says more than 600 non-Tigrayan civilians in the town of Mai-Kadra were killed. The TPLF has denied involvement.
The conflict is rooted in longstanding tension between Ethiopia's central government and the TPLF, which was the dominant political force in the whole country until Mr Abiy came to power in 2018 and introduced a series of far-reaching reforms.
When Mr Abiy postponed a national election because of coronavirus in June, relations further deteriorated.
The TPLF said the central government's mandate to rule had expired, arguing that Mr Abiy had not been tested in a national election.
In September the party held its own election, which the central government said was ""illegal"".
Then, on 4 November, the Ethiopian prime minister announced an operation against the TPLF, accusing its forces of attacking the army's northern command headquarters in Mekelle."

The United Nations recently concluded a five‐​week conference in Rome aimed at finalizing a treaty establishing a permanent international criminal court. The advertised mission of the court is to investigate, indict and try future war criminals. But as it did with last year’s Kyoto climate change treaty and the Ottawa landmine treaty before it, the Clinton administration has negotiated another international agreement that stands no chance of being ratified by the U.S. Senate. But don’t be misled: this court could still have dangerous consequences for the United States.



For starters, there is the issue of the court’s jurisdiction, which is unprecedented. In fact, the treaty’s proponents have given the court the legal authority to try citizens of nations that haven’t even ratified the document. As State Department spokesman James Rubin has remarked, “Never before has a treaty put itself over those who have not been included in it.” 



What the treaty says is that even if the United States doesn’t ratify the agreement, its citizens can be brought before the court as long as the nation where alleged crimes took place has ratified the treaty. In other words, American troops stationed in foreign lands could find themselves arrested and prosecuted by the court. Paradoxically, the treaty also says that the nations that ratify the agreement can opt out of the court’s jurisdiction over war crimes for seven years, while citizens of those nations that do not ratify the treaty can be subjected to the court’s jurisdiction immediately.



Not ratifying the international criminal court treaty does not necessarily mean that the United States will be exempt from paying for its operation. 



More worrisome still is the inclusion of the yet‐​to‐​be‐​defined crime of “aggression” in the court’s expansive jurisdiction. According to the Rome debates, “aggression” could eventually include such things as the “bombardment by the armed forces of a State against the territory of another State” and “the blockade of the ports or coasts of a State by the armed forces of another State.” Including those actions under “aggression” will reduce the military options available to the United States by outlawing preemptive strikes and the kind of naval blockade President Kennedy employed during the Cuban Missile Crisis. That has U.S. policymakers worried. As Department of Defense spokesman Kenneth Bacon has explained, “What we’re concerned about is that the court not be set up in a way that gives it very broad authority to pursue a vague definition of aggression that could be confused with legitimate defensive action to protect our national security interests.” 



The court also could jeopardize future U.S. efforts to resolve international conflicts. For example, if the court indicts the leaders of a warring faction while the United States is trying to conduct peace talks, that faction may respond by rejecting the resulting peace plan or staying away from the negotiating table altogether. That result would lead to more death and destruction, not less. In fact, according to former British envoy David Owen, a similar scenario unfolded in Bosnia in 1993 when the Serb faction rejected the Vance‐​Owen peace plan out of “fear that skeletons in their cupboard, such as massacres and war crimes, would be uncovered by the United Nations if they accepted the peace plan.” The result: the Bosnian war dragged on for another 18 months.



Furthermore, the court could destabilize future U.S.-led peacekeeping operations and endanger American lives in the process. Suppose the court handed down a verdict that the leaders of one faction had to pay reparations or return conquered territory to the victims of another faction, U.S. peacekeeping troops on the ground could find themselves in the messy position of either enforcing or refusing to enforce the court’s judgment. Either way, one faction will be upset and U.S. peacekeepers will be caught in the middle — a prospect that adds one more reason to get out of the peacekeeping business altogether.



Finally, not ratifying the international criminal court treaty does not necessarily mean that the United States will be exempt from paying for its operation. That’s because the court’s funding will be derived, in part, from the United Nation’s general budget. If historical contribution rates apply and the United States resumes making payments to the U.N. budget, 25 percent of the court’s costs could be passed on to American taxpayers.



Thus, even though the international criminal court treaty is not likely to be ratified by the U.S. Senate, it still threatens to compromise your national security and your pocketbook — a bad deal that only the United Nations could cook up.

"Reforestation has enormous potential as a cheap and natural way of sucking heat-absorbing carbon dioxide out of the atmosphere and restoring the degraded natural world, while supporting local livelihoods at the same time. But there is more than one way to plant a tree – and some of the most widely used techniques aren’t up to scratch. Here’s how to do it the right way. The most popular approach to reforesting – adopted for example by 59 countries signed up to the Bonn Challenge, a global effort to reforest 350 million hectares by 2030 – is called Forest Landscape Restoration. This approach includes a range of different techniques, including regeneration of natural forests, plantations of exotic or native species for harvest, and agroforestry, where trees are grown around farmland. However, these activities have very different consequences for the amount of carbon they store in the long term. Like fine wines, the carbon-storing potential of forests grows as they age. But almost half of pledged reforestation under the Bonn Challenge is for commercial plantations, which are regularly harvested – and which cycle nearly all of the carbon they have stored back into the atmosphere every 10-20 years. This means that on balance, these plantations store little if any carbon. Worse, activities such as logging can disturb soils, releasing additional carbon which potentially tips the scales from carbon sink to carbon source. To meet the world’s climate targets, we need a greater focus on restoring natural forests. If protected from fire and other disturbances, the trees that return will keep storing more carbon until they match the stores of a mature, old-growth forest in around 70 years – and remain a long-term carbon sink. Natural regeneration is particularly effective in humid tropical areas, where trees grow faster than in northern latitudes. There is a broader issue with all reforestation approaches, however. Forest landscapes must be resilient to future stresses brought by climate change, such as increasing temperatures, droughts, floods and other weather extremes – or else their benefits will be lost. This is especially important in the densely forested tropics, where climate impacts are predicted to be harshest. There are a number of ways that we can ensure new forests are resilient to these impacts. First, having a diversity of species with a wide variety of traits in the forest landscape reduces the risk that a single event will wipe out large parts of the ecosystem. This is because tree species have different resistances and vulnerabilities. For example, pests and diseases are likely to migrate as the climate changes.  In a single-species plantation, that could wipe out the whole forest. But with many different species in the area, parts of the forest will be resilient.

      Climate explained: how different crops or trees help strip carbon dioxide from the air


 We should also plant and introduce species that are adapted to the future climatic conditions projected for the area. For example, if climate models project a drier climate with increased droughts, then including native species with tolerance to drought would increase the chances of that forest staying resilient, and therefore maintaining its carbon store for longer. Finally, it is important to accept that some trees, as well as animals and plants within the forest ecosystem, may not be able to cope with future climatic conditions in the areas they currently inhabit. They need to be able to migrate to areas with more favourable conditions, and for this to be possible, areas of forest within the landscape must remain connected. The best way of doing this is by planting forest corridors that connect fragmented forests across a vast area. Forests aren’t just carbon stores. How we reforest is also crucial to the health of the smaller flora and fauna that support a healthy planet. The most appropriate way to support wildlife depends on the land’s history and natural tendencies – and sometimes this means not reforesting at all. For example, replacing native grassland and shrubland with forest plantations may actually reduce the diversity of wildlife in an area, as grassland species would be lost. On deforested and former agricultural lands, regeneration of native forests will increase biodiversity. However, plantations of a single species of tree for harvest are unlikely to support thriving wildlife as well as natural forest would. This is particularly the case when the planted species is not native, as local wildlife will not be adapted to this new environment and the non-native tree may outcompete or threaten native trees. Without care, reforestation can badly damage ecosystems. For example, Australian Acacia species have been introduced into the Fynbos shrubland region of South Africa, a highly diverse UNESCO World Heritage site. The introduction of these nitrogen-fixing trees has altered the nutrient cycling of the ecosystem, making conditions less favourable for native fynbos plant species which are adapted to nutrient-poor conditions. One of the key principles of the Forest Landscape Restoration approach is that projects should enhance human as well as environmental wellbeing. Human livelihoods are interlinked with forest landscapes and should not be excluded from their restoration but supported, so that the intertwined problems of climate change, biodiversity loss and poverty can all be tackled together. Working with local communities to plan, plant, protect, and take ownership of forest landscapes ensures that they will be maintained and protected long into the future. To this end, allowing a diversity of approaches – including some agricultural activities that meet the needs of local people – is key to delivering sustainable social and environmental change. When restored well, forest landscapes can even help vulnerable communities adapt to climate change, especially in tropical regions. For example, forests add moisture to the atmosphere and limit local temperature rise by absorbing some of the Sun’s radiation.

 Maintaining forest in the landscape may also reduce the risk of natural disasters such as floods and landslides, and provide alternative sources of income when agricultural production is low, through forest products such as fruits, resins, game and animal fodder. Reforesting our landscapes has great potential to improve the health of the planet and its inhabitants. If we plant trees with resilience to climate change, supporting wildlife, and promoting local human wellbeing in mind, reforestation can play a big part in tackling the climate and ecological crises, and supporting vulnerable communities across the world.

"A “sea-faring sister” of climate resistance group Extinction Rebellion (XR) launched this week with a protest against a 196-metre (644ft) luxury cruise liner docked in Falmouth, Cornwall, aimed at highlighting the environmental impact of cruise shipping. In its first action, Ocean Rebellion used guerilla advertising tactics to project films, slogans and messages, including “Turn the Tide” and “Fuck this ship”, on the hull of the World, a converted ocean liner that bills itself as the largest private residential ship on the planet. Residents aboard the ship are promised “a life of adventure at the pinnacle of luxury” as the ship continuously circumnavigates the globe, according to its website, although there are currently no residents aboard because of the Covid-19 pandemic.  Set up by a group of activists linked to XR, Ocean Rebellion plan to use a series of disruptive, non-violent actions aimed at tackling biodiversity loss, overfishing, the impact of the climate emergency on the ocean, and deep-sea mining. Rob Higgs, 44, a member of the group and inventor who lives in a 30ft fishing boat in Falmouth with his family, said Ocean Rebellion was small, with about 50 activists, and grew out of the XR movement. But there were big differences between the two groups, he said, including a reluctance by OR to use arrest as a means of protest. Ocean Rebellion is a separate organisation, with a non-hierarchical structure. “What we were doing is entirely legal,” he said of the first protest. “My motive is to raise awareness out there, to get people talking. I didn’t know how polluting the cruise industry is, but I do now. We need systemic change in shipping.” XR launched in 2018 and one of its first actions was the blocking of bridges and roads in London to highlight the climate emergency. Before long, it grew to a movement with groups in 75 countries. Higgs said its ocean-related cousin aims to work with other groups, including Greenpeace and Sea Shepherd, to pursue three main aims: to tell the truth about ocean destruction; to reverse drivers of ocean warming, acidification and sea level rise by 2025; and to hold the UN to its duty to govern the seabed for the benefit of mankind, rather than the interests of a few. But the group immediately came under fire over a series of claims made about the World’s pollution emissions, at least one of which turned out to be wrong. A spokesperson for the World questioned the evidence for the claims and the basis on which the figures were calculated. They said the ship conformed to industry best practice on emissions and pollution and used low-sulphur fuel. The activists used comparisons provided by Transport and Environment (T&E), a European organisation campaigning for tougher environmental standards, to claim that the fuel used by cruise ships like the World is 100 times more polluting than diesel fuel used by cars, in terms of emissions of sulphur oxides. Sulphur oxides are harmful to human health, causing respiratory symptoms and, in the atmosphere, acid rain. T&E said it stands by that particular calculation, but admitted it had introduced errors in assumptions over comparisons of how much carbon dioxide each of the ship’s apartments emitted compared to an equivalent on land. Lucy Gilliam, the aviation and shipping campaigner for T&E, said of the World’s fuel choice: “It may be low in sulphur but it is still high-sulphur marine fuel, with 1,000ppm of sulphur, compared to 10ppm of sulphur for diesel fuel for roads. They are burning dirtier fuel than cars. We as T&E want tougher rules on ships.” A spokesperson for the World said: “The World is a clean class vessel that conforms to industry best practices regarding emissions, water treatment, sewage plant and waste management systems. It operates on low sulphur (less than 0.1% sulphur) marine gas oil, the cleanest marine fuel available and has a ‘zero discharge to sea’ policy – no solid garbage of any kind is released to sea, even when permitted by international pollution regulations. A dedicated health, safety and environmental officer on board is responsible for oversight of occupational safety, environmental and public health policies, procedures and systems” A three-bedroomed apartment aboard the yacht cost a reported $2m-$15m (£1.5m-£11.4) in 2017."

You Ought to Have a Look _is a feature from the Center for the Study of Science posted by Patrick J. Michaels and Paul C. (“Chip”) Knappenberger. While this section will feature all of the areas of interest that we are emphasizing, the prominence of the climate issue is driving a tremendous amount of web traffic. Here we post a few of the best in recent days, along with our color commentary._   
  
_—_   
  
This week, as our title suggests, we have a somewhat eclectic mix of articles worthy of your attention (and some that are not). Let’s get started.   
  
In handing down its decision on Monday in _Michigan v. EPA_ , the Supreme Court ruled that the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) was remiss for not considering costs when deciding to (expensively) regulate mercury emissions from coal-fired power plants. This ruling was urged in Cato’s amicus brief, and hailed as a victory for “liberty and sound science.”   
  
But the direct impact on the ruling as it pertains to mercury emissions is likely to be slight as most coal-fired power plants have already been modified (or shut down) in an effort to reduce mercury emissions under the EPA’s 2012 regulation. Rather, what is being debated in the ruling’s aftermath is what the implication may be on future EPA actions.   
  
Some have argued the ruling in _Michigan v. EPA_ was “pointless,” while other have argued that it “may be the beginning of the end of the Obama Administration’s climate agenda.” Perhaps the biggest thing that could result would be for the Supreme Court to re-evaluate its decision in the _Chevron v. Natural Resources Defense Council_ case. This possibility was raised by Clarence Thomas in his concurring opinion on the case. The _Wall Street Journal_ editors picked up on this in their review of the _Michigan v. EPA_ decision and highlight its importance:   




Which is why Justice Clarence Thomas’s concurring opinion deserves a larger audience. He makes a provocative case that the Court’s 1984 decision in _Chevron_ _v. Natural Resources Defense Council_ is unconstitutional. Under what has become known as “Chevron deference,” the Court defers to executive interpretations when laws are ambiguous. Justice Thomas writes that this has become a license for the executive to usurp legislative powers that are supposed to be vested in Congress.   
  
“Perhaps there is some unique historical justification for deferring to federal agencies, but these cases reveal how paltry an effort we have made to understand it or to confine ourselves to its boundaries,” Justice Thomas writes. “Although we hold today that EPA exceeded even the extremely permissive limits on agency power set by our precedents, we should be alarmed that it felt sufficiently emboldened by those precedents to make the bid for deference that it did here.”   
  
That’s an especially apt point coming in a year when the Supreme Court seemed to abdicate much of its obligation to police the Constitution’s separation between the executive and legislative power. A future Court ought to revisit Chevron deference in what has become an era of presidential law-making.



Here’s hoping!   
  
And here’s how it can happen. At Cato, your obedient servants have, through the years, purposefully compiled a massive record of public comments on global warming regulation that we have filed as official responses to requests for them in the _Federal Register_. These include our _Addendum_ to the Government’s second “National Assessment” of climate change. It was designed to have a look similar to the federal document, with the cover the exact same material paragraph-by-paragraph, if possible, to make comparison as simple as possible.   




Now, suppose someone files in DC District court over the next EPA insult with regard to global warming, claiming authority because of its “endangerment finding” from carbon dioxide, which, they claim, compels them to regulate it under the Clean Air Act. Turns out that 2009 Finding is largely based upon the second _Assessment_.   
  
In our fantasy world, the plaintiff enters both the _Assessment_ and our _Addendum_ into the record, and, our dream goes, the judge holds them side-by-side and notes the massive amount of science that is missing from the federal report. Perhaps, thanks to Clarence Thomas, he or she might think that the EPA’s purported “science” is clearly an attempt to mislead, and seeing as this is such an egregious insult, upholds the plaintiff _based upon an abrogation of Chevron Deference._   
  
Another interesting post this week came courtesy of Blair King who runs the blogsite “A Chemist in Langley.” King is an avowed lukewarmer and has interesting things to say on a variety of climate-related topics. In a recent post, he takes on the term “Business-as-Usual” which has been co-opted by the climate activists to replace “worst case.” While “worst case” sounds like something which can be dismissed as being very unlikely, “Business-as-Usual” (BAU) sounds like something that is imminent unless things change. But, what is conveniently ignored by the activists using the term is that things _do_ change. Which means things changing is really what BAU represents. BAU is not a static technology, frozen actions case. Instead it is a highly dynamic future filled with new technologies, adaptations, etc.   
  
King points out that BAU and the high end emissions scenarios (RCP8.5) described by the U.N.’s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) in its most recent _Assessment Report_ are _not_ synonymous despite increasing usage as such by those pushing climate catastrophe and regulations to avert it.   
  
There are few folks who call the activists out on this. But the numbers are increasing. Besides ourselves, several recent pieces have appeared (see here and here for example), and King’s piece another welcomed example.   
  
King sets the stage:   




As I describe in my post “Does the climate change debate need a reset? - on name calling in the climate change debate” one of the critical battles in any debate is control over the labelling of the actors. If you can apply the best possible label to yourself and the least agreeable label to your opponent you immediately gain the upper hand. In the climate change debate, the “Business as Usual” label has been used more times that I can count with activists from the folks at Skeptical Science to the Suzuki Foundation, and from the Pembina Institute to 350.org  all finding some way to slip that phrase into their calls demanding immediate action (and of course donations to their cause). As this post will demonstrate, however, the “Business as Usual” descriptor used by the activists in the climate debate is nothing of the sort. Rather it is an artifact from earlier versions of the IPCC reports and was conspicuous by its absence in the most recent (Fifth Assessment) report.



After taking us through the list of reasons why BAU is really not BAU, King concludes:   




Looking at what the activists have labelled the “Business as Usual” scenario we see a slew of assumptions that are anything but business as usual… Similarly when an activist talks about “business as usual” in their sales pitch, it is time to put your wallet back in your pocket.



You really ought to have a look at King’s entire piece.   
  
  
  
And this week, we introduce a new concept in our _You Ought to Have a Look_ series—Look Away, items that are most definitely _not_ worth your time.   
  
Two notable items fall into our Look Away category this week.   
  
The first is a piece titled “Potent Poison Ivy” that appears on the ClimateCentral.org website—a website that spends an undue amount of time spreading worries about climate change. Their poison ivy piece is a good example of this tendency (and a classic example of our Good for Bad; Bad for Good theory). Of the literally 1000s of article in the scientific literature that highlight the benefits that an atmosphere enriched with carbon dioxide has on plants, Climate Central decides to highlight the growth enhancement of _poison ivy_. No doubt, poison ivy does grow better, healthier, stronger, and more productive under conditions of elevated carbon dioxide, _but so do virtually all plants_ —including food crops.   
  
To be better and more fully informed about the impacts of elevated carbon dioxide on plant health, you should visit the wealth of data contained in the website CO2science.org that is run by Cato Adjunct Scholar Dr. Craig Idso. For example, in a recent paper, Craig reviewed the impact of elevated CO2 on the world’s top 45 food crops and found that the yield enhancement to date to be about 10 to 15 percent—a sizeable and significant benefit. Craig expects the crop yield increases to continue to grow as the atmospheric carbon dioxide concentration continues to increase as a result of emissions from human activity. We don’t expect finding like these to appear anytime soon at Climate Central.   
  
Another article to look away from comes from the NationalGeographic.org and links shark attacks to global warming. In their post “North Carolina’s ‘Perfect Storm’ for Shark Attacks” National Geographic includes this gem:   




“Clearly global climate change is a reality and it has resulted in warmer temperatures in certain places at certain times,” says Burgess.   
  
As warming is expected to increase, it will likely bring more sharks farther north and entice more people to get into the water, which will lead to more bites.



This is exactly how we scripted it many moons ago, when we wrote a tongue-in-cheek journalist’s guide to linking shark attacks to global warming. We dummied up an article that went like this:   




Shark Attacks on Humans Related to Global Warming!



How best to explain the relationship? ""Well, Katie [Couric], we suspect (and our preliminary research bears this out) that higher temperatures make sharks more active. We already know those same high temperatures send more people to the beach in an effort to cool off. It just stands to reason that the more people there are in the water, the more opportunities there are for shark attack. As global temperatures continue to rise due to fossil fuel emissions, so too will incidents of shark attack. In fact, that drive to the beach is contributing to the problem. People really ought to stay home.""



The similarity to the National Geographic piece is scary! But of course, we weren’t being serious. So, if you really insist on looking into global warming and shark attacks, our article will prove much more entertaining (and pertinent) than the one from National Geographic—so that’s where you really ought to have a look!

From The GWPF:
Each year since 1995, the nations of the world have gathered to try to reach a global agreement on carbon dioxide emissions. These ‘Conferences of the Parties’, or COPs as they are usually termed, involve all of the members of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change and take place towards the end of the year. This year will see the twenty-first COP take place in Paris. Over the years the COPs have developed a style all of their own. Indeed, some observers have even gone as far as to suggest that each year sees less and less by way of meaningful activity, and more and more liturgy and ritual. They may just have a point.

"**The head of local forces in Ethiopia's northern region of Tigray says they are still fighting near the regional capital, Mekelle, which was seized by government troops at the weekend.**
Debretsion Gebremichael, who leads the Tigray People's Liberation Front (TPLF), also says his fighters have retaken another key city.
The government denies the claims and insists the TPLF has been crushed.
Hundreds of people have reportedly been killed in the month-long conflict.
Thousands have been displaced, while the UN and aid agencies have voiced concern about the humanitarian situation.
Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed told parliament on Monday that not a single civilian had been killed since the government launched its offensive in early November.
With all phone lines and the internet cut off, it is impossible to independently verify statements from either side.
In another development, the TPLF said it had released more than 4,000 federal soldiers who had been held captive since Tigrayan troops attacked a federal military base earlier in November.
That attack led to the start of the federal army's operation in the region.
US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo has phoned Mr Abiy to urge an end to ""the fighting and constructive dialogue to resolve the crisis"".
In a text message to Reuters news agency on Sunday, the TPLF leader said his forces had shot down a federal warplane and captured the pilot.
In another message on Monday, Mr Debretsion said the TPLF was ""close to Mekelle, fighting"".
He also said the TPLF had retaken the city of Aksum from the federal army.
On Monday, Fisseha Asgedom, a former Ethiopian ambassador to the UN with affiliations to the TPLF, told the BBC that reports by the Addis Ababa government of a sweeping advance were ""a joke"".
""The Addis Ababa government announced that they have captured Mekelle and six hours after they announced this they bombarded Mekelle... It's propaganda. Why can't they send the international community some videos?""
Mr Abiy announced that Mekelle had fallen to the federal army on Saturday, describing the move as the ""last phase"" in his government's offensive.
In a BBC interview on Monday, Minister of Democratisation Zadig Abraha, denied the TPLF's claims that they had captured Aksum and shot down a plane.
He also said the TPLF were ""not engaged in a guerrilla war"" but were ""running for their lives"".
""Their rank and file have disbanded. Everyone is surrendering,"" he added.
Redwan Hussein, a senior federal official in Tigray, said government soldiers had been careful not to involve civilians in their advance.
Troops ""just left the towns encircled and then moved on to the next. That's how we see no casualty out of our operation until we also reached Mekelle,"" he said.
On Sunday the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) said supplies in Mekelle's main hospital - including body bags - were running ""dangerously low"" as doctors treated people involved in the fighting around the city.
However it gave no figures for the numbers of injured or dead. Neither did it say whether the victims were civilians or soldiers.
Ethiopian officials have promised to allow humanitarian groups to operate in Tigray, but the UN has said it is ""extremely concerned about the safety and welfare of civilians in Tigray"", and called for better access.
Ethiopia has deployed troops along Tigray's border with Sudan, preventing people fleeing the violence from leaving the country, according to refugees.
The TPLF fighters, drawn mostly from a paramilitary unit and a well-drilled local militia, are thought to number about 250,000.
The organisation was founded in the 1970s and spearheaded the uprising against Marxist dictator Mengistu Haile Mariam, who was toppled in 1991.
It then went on to be the dominant political force in the country until Mr Abiy became prime minister in 2018.
Mr Debretsion has said the Tigray forces are ""ready to die in defence of our right to administer our region"".
The conflict is rooted in longstanding tension between Ethiopia's government and the TPLF, which dominated the entire country until Mr Abiy came to power in 2018.
When Mr Abiy postponed a national election because of coronavirus in June, relations further deteriorated.
The TPLF said the government's mandate to rule had expired, arguing that Mr Abiy had not been tested in a national election.
In September the party held its own election, which the government said was ""illegal""."
"Climate change sceptics may be a minority, but they are a sizeable one. One in five Americans think that climate change is a myth, or that humans aren’t responsible for it. What’s more, they’re backed up by many in the Middle East and parts of Asia, especially China. They’re a vocal minority too – and with the ear of the US president, they are therefore a serious obstacle to collective climate action. So what can we do about them? You might think that the answer is more or better science education. The more you know about climate science, the more likely you will be to think that climate change is real. But the science says that this isn’t true. If you want to predict what someone’s attitude to climate change is, you are better off asking them about their politics than about science. In fact, in the US, the more numerate and scientifically literate a Republican you are, the more sceptical you are about climate change.

      Our political beliefs predict how we feel about climate change


 What climate science really needs is better marketing. Researchers might think that the science sells itself. But, while people might trust scientists in general, the picture is more mixed when it comes to politically charged issues such as climate change. With many politicians actively persuading people that the science isn’t that serious, we need to persuade people that these politicians are wrong and the climate scientists are right. And luckily, there are three key marketing tools we can use to do so. Think about how climate change is framed. We are usually asked what we as individuals, businesses, and states can do to reduce the carbon emissions that are undoubtedly but imperceptibly heating up the planet. Given that these emissions have powered the global economy’s growth over the last century, this narrative can sometimes be perceived as pitting science against free market economics and our desire to lead our lives as we choose. This framing doesn’t work for all audiences. Just as a good marketer fits their message to their audience, a good science communicator will understand that when communicating an issue so broad and that affects so many, it makes sense to frame climate change in different ways to different groups of people. For example, framing climate change as an opportunity for technological innovation helps keep staunch defenders of the free market on side, minimising political resistance to climate action. Framing climate change as a “stewardship” issue – that is, a sacred duty to care for the Earth – may help get religious believers on side. Debunks of climate myths abound on the internet. But debunking misinformation is tricky, because once a piece of informatin has entered someone’s mind, it’s hard to dislodge it – especially if the information confirms previously held beliefs. An alternative strategy is “prebunking”. Inspired by inoculation theory – the idea that it is better to a prevent a disease than to treat it – prebunking aims to prevent misinformation from spreading in the first place, rather than debunk it once it has spread. This can be done by identifying common argumentative strategies used by climate change sceptics, such as spurious appeals to expertise or exaggerations about the uncertainties in climate models, and explaining why they are dodgy. Of course, this information needs to reach the right people. Much like protection against disease, the most effective inoculation starts in childhood, with education. Misconception-based learning, an approach which sets out to avoid misconceptions, provides a framework for doing this. Climate breakdown is not a flash in the pan problem, and our strategies to combat it need to be designed for the long haul. Finally, it’s important to focus not just on the message, but the messenger too. We would rather listen to people who share our political views than “experts” who disagree with us. This means that if you want to effectively communicate a pro-science message, you need to have people from different corners of the political spectrum making the case. It’s great that activists like Greta Thunberg are spreading the word, but not everyone wants to listen to them, and there are politically diverse groups out there who share the same message. For instance, when he was president Barack Obama reached out to religious leaders, who played an active role in promoting environmental issues in their communities. Marketing is manipulative. It can try to trick us into buying things we don’t want. So using it to sell climate science and interfere with our basic right to make up our own minds might seem suspect. But it’s important to remember that while climate change is a contentious political issue, its effects are real and severe no matter what you, I or anyone else think. We have the right to decide how or even whether to change our behaviour in light of a destabilising climate. But we don’t have the right to decide that our actions have no impact on the climate. As the saying goes, we are not entitled to our own facts. What’s more, there is a difference between the aims of marketers and those of scientists trying to communicate with the public. The marketer wants to sell us stuff. The scientist wants us to break through our ideological biasesand apathy to engage with the truth. The strategies I have outlined are designed to create the conditions for these breakthroughs. They don’t detract from our ability to make up our own minds. In fact, they may enhance it, precisely because they neuter our ideological biases. Sometimes, we need a little help to think for ourselves. Of course, good marketing is no guarantee of a sale. Even if scientists use these methods, climate change sceptics may refuse to buy it. But good marketers also don’t give up. If these methods don’t work, we can always look for some other ones.

"The 2019 UK general election matters because the climate emergency means that the next decade is critical for the future of humanity. Only a Labour government can really turn things around, not just in the UK, but globally. This may sound exaggerated, but it’s true. Let me explain. While flooding has affected people in Yorkshire during the election period, look further afield and many millions are suffering the impacts of catastrophic floods in Central and East Africa. Fires have raged in Australia and things will get a lot worse until humans stabilise Earth’s rapidly changing climate. To do that means carbon emissions need to decline to zero. Fast. Pursuing policies to limit warming to 1.5℃, as the Paris Agreement mandates, is a two part process. Stage one is to halve global emissions by 2030. Stage two is to eliminate the other half by 2050. Getting the world to zero emissions is extremely difficult as it means every sector of every country needs to get to zero. We can still pollute, but every tonne of carbon dioxide emitted will need to be immediately captured again, giving a net impact of zero emissions. Finally, after 30-plus years of scientists explaining the problem, a major political party of a major economy has a serious plan for part one of the process. After wrangling between grassroots activists and trade unions, the Labour Manifesto pledges that the “substantial majority” of UK emissions will be eliminated by 2030. This isn’t bluster, as there is serious investment planned across electricity production (more wind and solar), buildings (retrofitting all UK houses to high efficiency standards), transport (investment in buses, only electric cars sales from 2030), and heavy industry (research and development into hydrogen and carbon capture technology), to name a few sectors. Crucially, this would be driven by those who control the finances of the country. A new Sustainable Investment Board would bring together the chancellor, business secretary and Bank of England governor to oversee and co-ordinate these major investments. A National Investment Bank with £250 billion allocated for decarbonising the economy provides serious funds. And climate and environmental impacts will be included in the Office for Budget Responsibility forecasts, so that the cost of not acting will be factored into every government decision. Labour are calling it a Green Industrial Revolution. And it would be. It is a far-reaching set of policies and investments befitting the scale of the problem.  By comparison the Conservative Party manifesto lacks ambition and seriousness. Capital spending on climate – broadly conceived – is just £20 billion. There is no overarching strategy to reach net zero. As the independent analysts, the Institute for Fiscal Studies, said of the whole manifesto, “If a single Budget had contained all these tax and spending proposals we would have been calling it modest. As a blueprint for five years in government the lack of significant policy action is remarkable.” While the Conservatives have a net zero target of 2050 and official UK emissions have dropped by 43% from 1990 levels, most of the reduction has come from the power sector, and the low-hanging fruit of switching from coal-fired electricity generation to gas and renewables. Beyond this, their record over the past decade in government has been poor – emissions from transport, buildings and agriculture have not declined over recent years. In 2019, the government’s own independent advisers, the Committee on Climate Change, said that only one of 25 policy recommendations had been delivered, and the UK is on track to miss its binding interim carbon budget for 2023 to 2027. Of course, UK emissions are just 1% of the world’s total, so does it matter what the UK does? It does. First, because every country needs to get to net zero emissions. Second, as the fifth largest economy in the world, large and sustained reductions in emissions across all sectors simultaneously would become a beacon to other countries to learn from the UK and reduce their emissions more quickly. Third, Labour would use £4 billion of new overseas development funds help countries leap-frog the fossil fuel age. Finally, geopolitics matters. The world is gripped by right-wing populists who are often hostile to tackling climate change. Brazil’s Jair Bolsonaro abandoned hosting this years’ UN climate talks, while Donald Trump plans to pull out of the Paris Agreement. Fearful inward-looking nationalism means that the internationalism necessary to tackle climate change is being eroded. The antidote to the rising right-wing populism that Brexit and Boris Johnson are part of, is a Labour government with a Green Industrial Revolution at its heart. And just as Brexit spurred the Trump campaign, a win for Labour would increase the chances of the Democrats in the US reaching office and pursuing a similar Green New Deal. The tide would be turning towards deploying the tools of the state to reshape the economy to seriously tackle climate change. Scientists working on climate often say some form of transformation of society is needed to tackle climate change. Here’s a rare chance to lever serious resources to do just that. Of course, supporting any political party is a major compromise, especially with our voting system. When it comes to the environment, you can’t beat the Greens, but they can’t form the next government. The big prize is to grasp the chance to turn things around. So, I won’t just be voting this election. I’ll be out knocking on doors to canvas for Labour. It’s the least I can do. The stakes couldn’t be higher.

Guest essay by Eric Worrall
In Australia a fierce debate is raging, between people who want to reduce the rising risk of shark attack on swimmers, by culling dangerous sharks, and greens, who often give the impression that losing a few people to shark attacks every year is acceptable. Now Professor Rod Connolly has added a new argument to the debate – he claims culling sharks exacerbates climate change.
According to the Brisbane Times;
As debate over shark culling continues along Australia’s coastline, a Queensland researcher has thrown another consideration into the mix – climate change.
Gold Coast-based marine scientist Professor Rod Connolly looked at data from coastal wetlands around the world and found those with fewer predators were less effective at storing carbon.
Simplistically, this meant less greenhouse gas locked away in plants and more floating free in the atmosphere contributing to warming and climate change.
The findings, published Tuesday in journal Nature Climate Change, came a few days after a seven-year-old girl was apparently bitten by a shark off Russell Island, near Cairns.

The abstract of the study;
Predators continue to be harvested unsustainably throughout most of the Earth’s ecosystems. Recent research demonstrates that the functional loss of predators could have far-reaching consequences on carbon cycling and, by implication, our ability to ameliorate climate change impacts. Yet the influence of predators on carbon accumulation and preservation in vegetated coastal habitats (that is, salt marshes, seagrass meadows and mangroves) is poorly understood, despite these being some of the Earth’s most vulnerable and carbon-rich ecosystems. Here we discuss potential pathways by which trophic downgrading affects carbon capture, accumulation and preservation in vegetated coastal habitats. We identify an urgent need for further research on the influence of predators on carbon cycling in vegetated coastal habitats, and ultimately the role that these systems play in climate change mitigation. There is, however, sufficient evidence to suggest that intact predator populations are critical to maintaining or growing reserves of ‘blue carbon’ (carbon stored in coastal or marine ecosystems), and policy and management need to be improved to reflect these realities.

I’m personally disgusted that anyone could put the welfare of a few sharks, even an entire species of sharks, ahead of the safety of Australia’s children. As for the alleged “climate risk” associated with shark culling – lets just say I’m prepared to take that chance.

What do you think was the most costly intelligence failure of all time? No, it was not the world’s leading intelligence agencies’ failure to notice that Saddam had few, if any, weapons of mass destruction. It was the failure of many leading climate model builders to be modest enough about their predictions, and the politicians’ and media’s failure to ask the tough questions of these climate experts. 



As a consequence of what we now know was an overblown global‐​warming scare, everyone on the planet is paying substantially more for food and fuel than is necessary. 



Despite the prediction of all the major climate models, the Earth has been getting cooler since 1998. At first, it was not considered a big deal because temperatures fluctuate from year to year. However, the drop has now been going for a decade, with another big drop last year.





The reason people like Al Gore and many others are in denial is explained by cognitive dissonance. 



The global warming zealots have just been handed another rude shock, when the peer‐​reviewed journal, Nature, reported on May 1 that according to a new (and hopefully improved) climate model, global surface temperatures may not increase over the next decade. 



Roger A. Pielke, environmental studies professor at the University of Colorado, and not previously a global warming skeptic, reacted to the Nature article: “Climate models are of no practical use beyond providing some intellectual authority in the promotional battle over global‐​warming policy.”



Hudson Institute environmental economist Dennis Avery said: “The Earth’s warming from 1915 to 1940 was just about as strong as the “scary” 1975 to 1998 warming in both scope and duration — and occurred too early to be blamed on human‐​emitted CO2. The cooling from 1940 to 1975 defied the Greenhouse Theory, occurring during the first big surge of man‐​made greenhouse emissions. Most recently, the climate has stubbornly refused to warm since 1998, even though human CO2 emissions have continued to rise strongly.”



As a direct result of the global‐​warming hysteria, which, as noted above, was grossly overblown to say the least, governments reacted by restricting energy production from traditional sources, such as oil, gas and coal, and by enacting very costly regulations on CO2 emission sources. Governments also quickly jumped on the fad of “biomass” production, which, at least in the case of corn, does not result in less CO2 but more than standard oil and gas wells produce — a clear “intelligence” failure.



The restrictions on oil and gas have greatly increased the cost of gasoline and home heating oil, and the production cost of almost everything else, especially plastics and food.



In addition, the corn‐​based ethanol craze has removed huge quantities of agricultural land that was used to produce things like wheat, rice and corn for animal food, to corn to be used as motor fuel. The predictable result was a huge rise in global food prices. 



A revisionist history is under way, where many who believed Saddam had weapons of mass destruction, and said so, and supported the war, are now in denial — another type of “intelligence” failure.



We now see a similar thing among these same politicians who used, in part, the excuse of global warming to justify their votes against more drilling on the North Slope of Alaska, and offshore in the Lower 48. If you prevent new oil supplies, gasoline prices will rise. If you divert farm land used for growing food crops to that of growing corn to make ethanol for transportation, food prices will increase. Two more clear cases of “intelligence” failures, or worse. 



Now some of the same politicians who have, in part, created the oil and food price problems want to put a “windfall” profits tax on oil companies. (New York Democratic Sens. Hillary Clinton and Chuck Schumer and Vermont Independent Sen. Bernie Sanders have been particularly outspoken advocates of this idea). They seem not to have noticed that the price of oil is largely set by world supply and demand.



They have also failed to notice that over the years oil production and refining companies have had no higher profits on average than most other industries, and if you tax away all their profits this will not reduce prices at the gas pump. Most of the cost of a gallon of gasoline is the price of crude oil (only 12 percent of it controlled by private companies, the rest owned by state‐​controlled companies like Pemex in Mexico), and federal, state and local taxes. A windfall profits tax would only reduce investment in new production and refining and incentives to produce more oil — another “intelligence” failure. 



You may wonder — if the data from the last decade show the Earth is not getting warmer, and the climate models have been making incorrect predictions — why are so many in the political and media classes continuing to shout about the dangers of global warming and insisting the “science” is settled when the opposite is true. (You may recall that Copernicus and Galileo had certain problems going against the conventional wisdom of their time.)



The reason people like Al Gore and many others are in denial is explained by cognitive dissonance. This occurs when evidence increasingly contradicts a strongly held belief. Rather than accept the new evidence and change their minds, some people will become even more insistent on the “truth” of the discredited belief, and attack those who present the new evidence — again an “intelligence” failure. 



Finally, many people directly benefit from government funding global warming programs and care more about their own pocketbooks than the plight of the world’s poor who are paying more for food. This is not an “intelligence” but an “integrity” failure.

"The Labour Party’s manifesto for the 2019 general election lays out a plan for transforming British society and the economy to address climate change. The “green industrial revolution” calls for massive investment in renewable energy and low-carbon infrastructure, sweeping changes to how public transport services are owned and operated and an overhaul of agriculture subsidies to prioritise conservation and habitat restoration. Academic experts give their verdict on the proposals.  Stephen Hall, Research Fellow in Energy Economics and Policy, University of Leeds Labour has committed to investing £400 billion across the UK in energy generation, energy efficiency, transport and the natural environment. The party has promised to ensure local people have a say in where funding should go.

      Labour's low-carbon 'warm homes for all' could revolutionise social housing – experts


 Of all the spending commitments the most expensive, and yet the one that makes the most sense, is the commitment to retrofit the UK’s 27 million homes to a high energy efficiency standard. This national programme might take up to £200 billion to complete, but with 70% of British houses poorly insulated, the economic benefits are massive. People in these homes waste over £400 on gas every year while losing much of that heat through leaky walls. Retrofitting homes would employ hundreds of thousands of people across the UK. The resulting health benefits of warmer homes could save the NHS billions.  Labour also committed to a huge expansion of renewable energy. Anyone who lives in my region, Hull and East Yorkshire, knows someone who works on the wind farms. Rebuilding the electricity sector around renewables offers a huge jobs boost and ensures clean and affordable energy for the long term. I’m not convinced Labour needs to nationalise “the big six” energy companies to deliver its investment programme – it could end up taking on a lot of market risk as the UK’s energy demand and consumption patterns change. But the point of the nationalisation is noble: to protect the jobs of workers in those companies and to put an end to unfair market practices, such as overcharging already fuel-poor households.  Bold plans indeed, and there are inevitable risks to public finances. That said, as the manifesto claims, the cost of doing nothing is far higher. Marc Hudson, Researcher in Sustainable Consumption, University of Manchester Labour’s autumn conference passed a motion agreeing to “work towards a path to net zero carbon emissions by 2030”. It never amounted to a firm, legally binding commitment, but the manifesto version of Labour’s pledge on decarbonisation has certainly been watered down. Labour will now: develop the recommendations of our “30 by 2030” report to put the UK on track for a net zero carbon energy system within the 2030s – and go faster if credible pathways can be found. We will deliver nearly 90% of electricity and 50% of heat from renewable and low-carbon sources by 2030. Two things matter here. First, the new 2030 pledge limits its commitment to the energy system – but there are plenty of carbon emissions outside of that. Transport and agriculture would not be included in Labour’s new pledge, which collectively accounted for 28% of the country’s emissions in 2018. Second, Labour isn’t even aiming for the energy sector to hit net zero by 2030. That could now come as late as 2039. Labour’s decarbonisation targets are still more ambitious than the other major parties. But in many ways, these longer-term goals are not what we should judge the party on. Debating net zero dates misses the fundamental point that the transition to a zero carbon society desperately needs kick-starting with strong policy action in the next five years.  There are promising announcements – including a windfall tax on oil companies to cover the costs of knowingly damaging the climate. Its recent “30 by 2030” report goes into greater depth, listing urgent actions to achieve the party’s long-term aims and acknowledging the need for immediate implementation. Trade unions persuaded Labour to soften its pledge – an unsurprising move to anyone who has been following their influence in recent decades. But without the support of industry, the promises of Labour – and any other party – are empty. Union backing for what are still ambitious plans may make the difference in translating them into reality. Nicole Badstuber, Research Associate in Transport, University of Cambridge If sustainable transport is the aim, buses are rightly Labour’s priority. Buses are Britain’s most used form of public transport, providing 59% of all public transport trips – that’s 4.8 billion journeys a year. Yet bus services have been choked by service and funding cuts. Over 3,000 bus services have been cut since 2010 and local government bus funding has halved. Labour promises to reverse the bus cuts, invest in local transport and give free bus passes to people under 25. This is important. Good, reliable and frequent bus services will be crucial for any sustainable transport system.  Labour would give local government the power to strategically manage the bus network and run their own services, undoing legislation that currently obstructs and bans this. There are successful examples of both. London has a regulated bus market that has allowed for strategically planned, managed and integrated services. Reading and Nottingham are examples of successful municipal bus companies.  Labour also vows to bring rail into integrated public ownership. Today, Britain’s railways are a confusing part public, part private patchwork, with track managed by government and services run by numerous private companies. Rather than compensate these rail operators by ending their contracts early, Labour would take the cheapest route by not renewing them. New rail links would also be built, such as a Crossrail for the North and the High Speed 2 (HS2) railway to Scotland, which is currently only committed to running from London to Birmingham. New railways for fast services free up capacity on the “old” railways for more frequent and reliable local services. Improving rail links – particularly local links – is key to encouraging people out of their cars. To tackle air pollution, Labour proposes to electrify the railway network, encouraging rail freight, ending combustion engine vehicle sales by 2030 – ten years ahead of the Conservatives’ 2040 pledge – and investing in electric vehicle charging infrastructure. Labour doesn’t rule out expanding London’s airport capacity though, seemingly at odds with their rhetorical commitment to decarbonise transport. Labour understands that to compete with the car, public transport needs to be improved. But the manifesto falls short of committing to directly discourage driving, such as congestion pricing, motorway tolling or banning new road building. Perhaps this is politically wise. Talk of curbing car use is rarely popular. Mike Jeffries, Associate Professor in Ecology, Northumbria University Labour is promising legally binding targets for restoring habitats and biodiversity. After a decade in which central government funding for nature conservation has fallen by over 40%, the prospect of a £250 billion green transformation fund is very positive.  Restoring ecosystems will entail land reform, and the manifesto suggested repurposing agricultural funding to support habitat recovery and sustainable food production. Labour alludes to the green belt being “threatened by development” but remains quiet on how its approach would differ. A new “environmental tribunal” to ensure decisions are consistent with environmental obligations could quickly become bogged down in ambiguities.

      Climate crisis: the countryside could be our greatest ally – if we can reform farming


 The UK’s wildlife may be in trouble, but government agencies, NGOs and even enthusiastic citizens are very good at managing local conservation efforts. Trying to marry their collective expertise with the central plans, funds and tribunals could get messy. But the fact that Britain’s wildlife is addressed in the first few pages of the manifesto shows how seriously political parties are now taking the ecological crisis. Turning the big ideas into reality will be the challenge. Rather simpler is the list of things that Labour promises to ban or crack down on – fox hunting, badger culling and pet monkeys. Politicians underestimate the animal vote, as Theresa May found to her cost. Labour appears unlikely to make the same mistake.

Over the next couple of days, as the Nor’easter honing in on the New England coast matures and eventually unleashes its winter storm fury, you are going to be subject to a lot of global warming hype.   
  
After all, the climate change alarmist credo is: let no extreme weather event pass without pointing out that it is “consistent with” climate change caused by human industrial society.   
  
The push has already begun.   
  
But this time around, the pushback is also well-prepared.   
  
While the “curator” of the _Washington Post_ ’s newly-minted online “Energy and Environment” section Chris Mooney tells us in his article that global warming may make blizzards worse by increasing the temperature of the western Atlantic ocean and thereby increasing the moisture feed into the developing storm, meteorologist Ryan Maue is quick to point out that just the opposite is likely the result—that the elevated sea surface temperatures actually act to make such storms tamer.   
  
Maue goes on to add that it is “easy to make case that global warming weakened this blizzard significantly due to warmer [sea surface temperatures].”   
  
While Ryan is probably being a bit optimistic here, the reality is that this blizzard (in fact pretty much _all_ storm events) are the result of a very complex system of physical interactions—the precise behavior of each one of which is not completely understood, much less perfectly predictable. This makes ascertaining the influence of human-caused climate change virtually (if not entirely) impossible.   
  




  
  
Blizzards affecting New York City are perfect examples of this.   
  
A couple years back, during another New York City blizzard, we looked at some of the confounding factors at play in determining how much it snows in Central Park. Our conclusion after reviewing the cases for both more and less snowfall there?   




Which leaves natural variability as the primary driver of just how white New York City’s winters are.



Figure 1 will give you some idea of what we were talking about. It shows the winter snowfall history from New York’s Central Park since the late 1800s.   






  
  
_Figure 1. Winter snowfall totals from New York City’s Central Park._   
  
Kudos to you if you can pick out the patterns formed by global warming. And if you can, please write them up for scientific publication somewhere. The world awaits the definitive answer.   
  
In the meantime, don't belive the hype.

"Speech by Hon Václav Klaus, President of the Czech Republic. March 4, 2008.
Mr. Chairman, ladies and gentlemen,
I would like first of all to thank the organizers of this important conference for making it possible and also for inviting one politically incorrect politician from Central Europe to come and speak here. This meeting will undoubtedly make a significant contribution to the moving away from the irrational climate alarmism to the much needed climate realism.

I know it is difficult to say anything interesting after two days of speeches and discussions here. If I am not wrong, I am the only speaker from a former communist country and I have to use this as a comparative – paradoxically – advantage. Each one of us has his or her experiences, prejudices and preferences. The ones that I have are – quite inevitably – connected with the fact that I have spent most of my life under the communist regime. A week ago, I gave a speech at an official gathering at the Prague Castle commemorating the 60th anniversary of the 1948 communist putsch in the former Czechoslovakia. One of the arguments of my speech there, quoted in all the leading newspapers in the country the next morning, went as follows: “Future dangers will not come from the same source. The ideology will be different. Its essence will, nevertheless, be identical – the attractive, pathetic, at first sight noble idea that transcends the individual in the name of the common good, and the enormous self-confidence on the side of its proponents about their right to sacrifice the man and his freedom in order to make this idea reality.” What I had in mind was, of course, environmentalism and its currently strongest version, climate alarmism.
This fear of mine is the driving force behind my active involvement in the Climate Change Debate and behind my being the only head of state who in September 2007 at the UN Climate Change Conference, only a few blocks away from here, openly and explicitly challenged the current global warming hysteria. My central argument was – in a condensed form – formulated in the subtitle of my recently published book devoted to this topic which asks: “What is Endangered: Climate or Freedom?” My answer is clear and resolute: “it is our freedom.” I may also add “and our prosperity.”
What frustrates me is the feeling that everything has already been said and published, that all rational arguments have been used, yet it still does not help. Global warming alarmism is marching on. We have to therefore concentrate (here and elsewhere) not only on adding new arguments to the already existing ones, but also on the winning of additional supporters of our views. The insurmountable problem as I see it lies in the political populism of its exponents and in their unwillingness to listen to arguments. They – in spite of their public roles – maximize their own private utility function where utility is not any public good but their own private good – power, prestige, career, income, etc. It is difficult to motivate them differently. The only way out is to make the domain of their power over our lives much more limited. But this will be a different discussion.
We have to repeatedly deal with the simple questions that have been many times discussed here and elsewhere:
1) Is there a statistically significant global warming?
2) If so, is it man-made?
3) If we decide to stop it, is there anything a man can do about it?
4) Should an eventual moderate temperature increase bother us?
We have our answers to these questions and are fortunate to have many well-known and respected experts here who have made important contributions in answering them. Yet, I am not sure this is enough. People tend to blindly believe in the IPCC’s conclusions (especially in the easier to understand formulations presented in the “Summaries for Policymakers”) despite the fact that from the very beginning, the IPCC has been a political rather than a scientific undertaking.
Many politicians, media commentators, public intellectuals, bureaucrats in more and more influential international organizations not only accept them but use them without qualifications which exist even in the IPCC documents. There are sometimes unexpected and for me unexplainable believers in these views. Few days ago, I have come across a lecture given by a very respected German economist (H. W. Sinn, “Global Warming: The Neglected Supply Side, in: The EEAG Report, CESifo, Munich, 2008) who is in his other writings very critical of the German interventionist economic policies and statist institutions. His acceptance of the “conventional IPCC wisdom” (perhaps unwisdom) is striking. His words:
– “the scientific evidence is overwhelming”;
– “the facts are undeniable”;
– “the temperature is extremely sensitive to even small variations in greenhouse gas concentration”;
– “if greenhouse gases were absent from the atmosphere, average temperature of the Earth’s surface would be -6°C. With the greenhouse gases, the present average temperature is +15°C. Therefore, the impact of CO2 is enormous”;
– he was even surprised that “in spite of all the measures taken, emissions have accelerated in recent years. This poses a puzzle for economic theory!” he said.
To make it less of a puzzle, let me make two brief comments.
As an economist, I have to start by stressing the obvious. Carbon dioxide emissions do not fall from heaven. Their volume (ECO2) is a function of GDP per capita (which means of the size of economic activity, SEA), of the number of people (POP) and of the emissions intensity (EI), which is the amount of CO2 emissions per dollar of GDP. This is usually expressed in a simple relationship which is, of course, a tautological identity:
ECO2= EI x SEA x POP
but with some assumption about causality it can be turned into a structural equation. What this relationship tells is simple: If we really want to decrease ECO2 (which most of us assembled here today probably do not consider necessary), we have to either stop the economic growth and thus block further rise in the standard of living, or stop the population growth, or make miracles with the emissions intensity.
I am afraid there are people who want to stop the economic growth, the rise in the standard of living (though not their own) and the ability of man to use the expanding wealth, science and technology for solving the actual pressing problems of mankind, especially of the developing countries. This ambition goes very much against the past human experience which has always been connected with a strong motivation to go ahead and to better human conditions. There is no reason to make the, from above orchestrated, change just now – especially with arguments based on such an incomplete and faulty science as is demonstrated by the IPCC. Human wants are unlimited and should stay so. Asceticism is a respectable individual attitude but should not be forcefully imposed upon the rest of us.
I am also afraid that the same people, imprisoned in the Malthusian tenets and in their own megalomaniac ambitions, want to regulate and constrain the demographic development, which is something only the totalitarian regimes have until now dared to think about or experiment with. Without resisting it we would find ourselves on the slippery “road to serfdom.” The freedom to have children without regulation and control is one of the undisputable human rights and we have to say very loudly that we do respect it and will do so in the future as well.
There are people among the global warming alarmists who would protest against being included in any of these categories, but who do call for a radical decrease in carbon dioxide emissions. It can be achieved only by means of a radical decline in the emissions intensity. This is surprising because we probably believe in technical progress more than our opponents. We know, however, that such revolutions in economic efficiency (and emissions intensity is part of it) have never been realized in the past and will not happen in the future either. To expect anything like that is a non-serious speculation.
I recently looked at the European CO2 emissions data covering the period 1990-2005, which means the Kyoto Protocol era. My conclusion is that in spite of many opposite statements the very robust relationship between CO2 emissions and the rate of economic growth can’t be disputed, at least in a relevant and meaningful time horizon. You don’t need huge computer models to very easily distinguish three different types of countries in Europe:
– the EU less developed countries – Greece, Ireland, Portugal and Spain – which during this very period tried to catch up with the economic performance of the more developed EU countries. Their rapid economic growth led to the increase of their CO2 emissions in 15 years (in which they signed Kyoto) by 53%;
– the European post-communist countries which after the fall of communism went through a fundamental, voluntarily unorganizable transformation shake-out and an inevitable radical economic restructuring with the heavy industry disappearing (not stagnating or retreating) practically over night. Their GDP drastically declined. These countries decreased their CO2 emissions in the same period by 32%;
– the “normal” EU, slow-growing if not stagnating countries (excluding Germany where it’s difficult to eliminate the impact of the fact that the East German economy almost ceased to exist in that period) increased their CO2 emissions by 4%.
The huge differences in these three figures – +53%, -32% and +4% – are almost fascinating. And yet, there is a dream among European politicians to reduce CO2 emissions for the entire EU by 30 per cent in the next 13 years (compared to the 1990 level). What does it mean? Do they assume that all countries would undergo a similar economic shock as was experienced by the Central and Eastern European countries after the fall of communism? Now in the whole of Europe? Do they assume that European economically weaker countries would stop their catching-up process? Or do they intend to organize a decrease in the number of people living in Europe? Or do they expect a miracle in the development of the emissions/GDP ratio, which would require a technological revolution of unheard-of proportions? With the help of a – from Brussels organized – scientific and technological revolution?
What I see in Europe (and in the U.S. and other countries as well) is a powerful combination of irresponsibility, of wishful thinking, of implicit believing in some form of Malthusianism, of cynical approach of those who themselves are sufficiently well-off, together with the strong belief in the possibility of changing the economic nature of things through a radical political project.
This brings me to politics. As a politician who personally experienced communist central planning of all kinds of human activities, I feel obliged to bring back the already almost forgotten arguments used in the famous plan-versus-market debate in the 1930s in economic theory (between Mises and Hayek on the one side and Lange and Lerner on the other), the arguments we had been using for decades – till the moment of the fall of communism. Then they were quickly forgotten. The innocence with which climate alarmists and their fellow-travelers in politics and media now present and justify their ambitions to mastermind human society belongs to the same “fatal conceit.” To my great despair, this is not sufficiently challenged neither in the field of social sciences, nor in the field of climatology. Especially the social sciences are suspiciously silent.
The climate alarmists believe in their own omnipotency, in knowing better than millions of rationally behaving men and women what is right or wrong, in their own ability to assembly all relevant data into their Central Climate Change Regulatory Office (CCCRO) equipped with huge supercomputers, in the possibility to give adequate instructions to hundreds of millions of individuals and institutions and in the non-existence of an incentive problem (and the resulting compliance or non-compliance of those who are supposed to follow these instructions).
We have to restart the discussion about the very nature of government and about the relationship between the individual and society. Now it concerns the whole mankind, not just the citizens of one particular country. To discuss this means to look at the canonically structured theoretical discussion about socialism (or communism) and to learn the uncompromising lesson from the inevitable collapse of communism 18 years ago. It is not about climatology. It is about freedom. This should be the main message of our conference.

"**Ethiopia's Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed says government forces are now ""fully in control"" of Mekelle, the capital of the northern Tigray region.**
He said the army had entered the city in the ""last phase"" of the conflict with the Tigray People's Liberation Front - but details are hard to confirm as there is a communications blackout.
The TPLF leader vowed to ""fight... to the last"" in a statement to Reuters.
Hundreds have reportedly been killed in the conflict and thousands displaced.
It began earlier this month after Mr Abiy announced an operation against the TPLF, the regional party, accusing it of attacking the Ethiopian army's northern command HQ in Mekelle.
Federal security forces are now searching for the TPLF leaders.
The BBC managed to briefly speak to one contact in Mekelle who said that federal soldiers were in the city and he had heard sporadic gunshots on Sunday morning. Some residents had earlier fled to the city's outskirts, he added.
Meanwhile, the US embassy in neighbouring Eritrea said six explosions were heard in the capital Asmara late on Saturday. Tigrayan forces have previously fired rockets at Eritrea, which they accuse of backing Ethiopian government forces in the weeks-long conflict. It is not clear if the latest incidents in Asmara are linked to the fighting in Tigray.
In a statement on Twitter, Mr Abiy said the army was in full control of Mekelle and that this ""marks the completion of the [military's] last phase"".
""I am pleased to share that we have completed and ceased the military operations in the Tigray region,"" he said.
The army had released thousands of soldiers taken by the TPLF and was in control of the airport and regional offices, Mr Abiy said, adding that the operation had been carried out with ""due care for citizens"".
There have been fears for the safety of the 500,000 people living in the city.
Mr Abiy's statement said federal forces would ""continue their task of apprehending TPLF criminals and bring them to the court of law"".
Confirming details from Tigray is very hard as telephone and internet lines have been down during the conflict.
In a text message to Reuters, TPLF leader Debretsion Gebremichael did not directly comment on the situation on the ground, but said of the government forces: ""Their brutality can only add [to] our resolve to fight these invaders to the last.""
He added: ""This is about defending our right to self-determination.""
Mr Debretsion's whereabouts are unknown.
A TPLF statement read out on regional Tigray TV said: ""Fascistic bombings have caused civilian deaths and injuries. The Tigray government has vowed that it would take retaliatory actions against the barbaric bombings"".
It also accused the Eritrean government of involvement in the attack on Mekelle.
Tigray TV and another station from the region are now off air.
Analysts say the TPLF could now be preparing to return to the mountains to launch a guerrilla war against the federal government.
The UN had warned of possible war crimes if the Ethiopian army attacked Mekelle.
It has also expressed concerns about the lack of access for humanitarian workers.
The Ethiopian authorities said on Thursday that ""a humanitarian access route"" overseen by the government would be opened, adding they were ""committed to work with UN agencies... to protect civilians and those who need it"".
Also on Thursday, Ethiopian troops were deployed along Tigray's border with Sudan, preventing people fleeing the violence from leaving the country, according to refugees.
The BBC's Anne Soy, on the Sudanese side of the border, saw at least a dozen members of the Ethiopian military, leading to a marked decrease in the number of people crossing into Sudan.
In a meeting on Friday, Mr Abiy told African peace envoys that civilians would be protected.
However, there was no mention of potential peace talks and the envoys were not allowed to visit Tigray.
The TPLF fighters, drawn mostly from a paramilitary unit and a well-drilled local militia, are thought to number about 250,000. Some analysts fear the situation could turn into a guerrilla conflict - with the TPLF continuing to mount attacks on government forces even if they take Mekelle.
Mr Debretsion has said Tigray forces were ""ready to die in defence of our right to administer our region"".
Aid groups fear the conflict could trigger a humanitarian crisis and destabilise the Horn of Africa region.
Ethiopia's state-appointed Human Rights Commission has accused a Tigrayan youth group of being behind a massacre this month in which it says more than 600 non-Tigrayan civilians in the town of Mai-Kadra were killed. The TPLF denied involvement.
The conflict is rooted in longstanding tension between Ethiopia's government and the TPLF, which was the dominant political force in the country until Mr Abiy came to power in 2018 and introduced far-reaching reforms.
When Mr Abiy postponed a national election because of coronavirus in June, relations further deteriorated.

"Question:
I think that companies that are making millions of dollars should be forced to use renewable energy, and/or invest in it; they should be doing their bit for the planet. The government should not be forcing householders to pay a tax or more for living, food, electricity etc., especially when they can’t stop what big business does to the environment, or what the government spends the carbon money on.
You can’t be serious that the burning of fossil fuels doesn’t hurt the environment; even if you don’t believe in climate change, this would be one point that I don’t agree with. Also I don’t agree that the planet needs more emissions to be able to grow food, as plants were growing on this planet long before companies started burning fossil fuels to fuel factories.

Answer:
The key thing to grasp is that carbon dioxide is not a pollutant, not poisonous and is a beneficial gas in the atmosphere. It is colourless, odourless and non-toxic. It is the holes in your bread and the bubbles in your beer. And it is present in the atmosphere in minute quantities. Over 99.9% of the atmosphere is other gases, but every living creature relies on there being enough CO2 in the air to survive.
People who run greenhouses pump CO2 into them to help the plants grow. More CO2 in the air has allowed us to produce more food, and makes plants stronger and more resistant to heat, cold and drought. People have done careful experiments on this, and warmer temperatures and more CO2 are significant factors in all plant growth.
You are of course correct that plants grew long before we started to burn coal and oil, but food production (and population) were far, far lower then. Aerial fertilisation by man-made CO2 is a significant factor in allowing the growth in world population (as is in-ground fertilisation by nitrogen fertilisers from the same fossil carbon industry). No doubt people will say our population is too large, and in places that may be true, but it is not sustainable without carbon fuels and the food they help to produce and transport. That is the ugly truth, which will be illustrated in several countries soon.
There is also no essential difference between wood, grass, natural gas and coal – all are natural non-toxic hydro-carbon materials with all the elements of life in their structure. Ethanol and whiskey are man-made versions of the same things. Burning any one of them will produce mainly two harmless gases – water vapour (which is what you can see emitting from power stations) and carbon dioxide (which is invisible).
That is not to say that burning these materials in open fires does not cause addition of some gases that are noxious to humans in heavy concentrations (like oxides of sulphur, nitrogen, metals, ash and other particles, or even the poisonous carbon monoxide). The cause of the bad pollution in Asia is not coal fired power stations (modern ones remove almost everything except the beneficial gases of life: water and carbon dioxide). The clouds of pollution choking Asian cities is caused by bushfires in Indonesia, cow dung cooking fires in India, dirty smelters and open fires in China and North Korea and the occasional volcano. Most of these problems have been largely solved in the rich developed world by using clean silent invisible electricity in our cities. Cars are the big polluters in our cities, but even they improve every year.
It always seems attractive to tax the hell out of those rich corporations. But corporations are just people at the end. Our biggest coal company in Queensland is BHP, owned by millions of little people like public servants via pension funds, your parents via savings, and lots of other little people.
And we cannot contain taxes – they keep spreading around – if we tax more heavily every tonne of coal burnt, one of two things will happen (probably a bit of both) – power prices will rise, or some power stations will close down (the huge brown coal stations in Victoria, who supply massive power to the Australian electricity grid will be the first to close). Again, blackouts or increases in power costs will follow (and both are already happening because of carbon hysteria in several countries). And the share prices for coal mines and power stations will fall, making it difficult to raise more money to build wind farms, solar cities or anything else. (Why do you think the government of NSW is desperate to sell their power stations?)
There are direct taxes and sneaky taxes.
If I decide to reduce pollution in the city of Brisbane, I could put a toll gate on every main road, collecting a central city pollution tax from every vehicle. That is a direct tax. Everyone can see what it is for and what it achieves. If you don’t pollute the city with car fumes, you don’t pay it. Honest and open.
Or I could decide to force Energex to get 18% of their power from “renewables”. That costs them money for wind farms and things. There are only two places for them to get the money – from consumers like you via increased electricity charges or from shareholders like your parents via reduced dividends. These are the sneaky taxes which only one person in a hundred will recognise. And the posturing politicians who levy them can blame the increased costs on wicked corporations. (As an aside, the government of Queensland does force Energex and other suppliers to get 18% of electricity from expensive “renewables”.)
But no matter how much we wish for it, wind and solar will never supply the quantity of electricity we are using now for our survival and comfort. There is just not enough sun, wind or geothermal where we need it. Solar is good for hot water systems, but not for powering processing plants, factories and big cities. The carbon cutting goals can only be achieved by either a massive switch to nuclear power, which seems politically unlikely in Australia, or a severe reduction in power use per person.
And what about the cars, trucks, planes and ships that supply us all with daily food, travel and goods? There is no feasible option for replacing carbon fuels in less than decades, and then the only real option yet visible is hydrogen fuel generated by coal or nuclear power!
So, we cannot cut carbon usage significantly, or punish carbon using companies, without punishing ourselves severely and in unexpected ways. Already the costs of food and power are spiralling up, and the major cause is fear of carbon taxes, or subsidies that are diverting food to produce motor fuel or using up other resources to produce renewable energy.
It is a long complicated story, and most people do not go past catchy slogans. Chanting the slogans are people with other agendas, which do not include our prosperity or jobs for our kids.
Lots of people also think, deep down, that “we are a wasteful society and some good may come of all this”. Everyone thinks those other people are wasteful. But waste is a value judgement. I do not drink beer or eat bread, unless there are no polite options. Therefore the massive resources devoted to making bread and beer are “waste” in my eyes. We could turn those fields of wheat and barley to native grasses and “waste” would be reduced.
Other people do not eat meat, and thus believe people like us who breed cattle and sheep should be closed down and the land restored to national parks. What is “waste” and what is “essential” industry is a value judgement and we will never agree on any government enforced measure to “reduce waste”. In fact every law will create more waste, as it will stop some things that some people value and encourage other things that other people consider waste – no one will be completely happy. The total “waste” in society is a reflection of the amount to which government distorts things. Left to ourselves, liable for the full cost of every thing we choose to use, and not taxed for a single thing we do not want, we will minimise the total waste in society.

"My wife and I have been warned we may need to evacuate our cabin in the hills north of San Francisco, because of fires ravaging the Bay Area.  Climate change is largely to blame for these fires, which are growing in number and intensity every year. It’s also to blame for the increasing number and virulence of hurricanes hitting the Gulf and south-east, flash floods along the eastern seaboard, and fierce winds across middle America. Two tropical storms are developing in the Gulf of Mexico. The Gulf has never before had two hurricanes at the same time. Both are moving toward Louisiana. In early August, Illinois and Iowa were hit with winds of up to 110mph. Homes were leveled. At least 10 million acres of crops were destroyed. Many are still without power. Trump isn’t singularly responsible for climate change, of course. But he’s done nothing to stop it. In fact, he’s done everything he can to accelerate it. This coming week, he’ll be nominated for a second term. I doubt he or anyone else at the Republican convention will mention his abandonment of the Paris agreement, his rollback of environmental regulations or his boundless generosity to the fossil fuel industry. Yet I’ll be thinking about all this, and in a newly personal way. So will many others, including, I suspect, some who voted for Trump last time, who reside in the Gulf states, the eastern seaboard and the Midwest. It’s one thing to understand climate change in the abstract. It’s another to live inside it. I recently got an email from a woman living in North Carolina whose house was destroyed in a flash flood. She describes herself as a lifelong Republican who’s now a “born-again environmentalist”. She said she’ll be voting for Joe Biden. It’s much the same with the coronavirus. The gross numbers tell a horrible story. Last Thursday alone, the virus killed 1,090 Americans. Only five died from the virus in Canada the same day, six in the UK, 12 in France, 16 in Japan, 16 in Spain and 10 in Germany. Yet not even these numbers hit home the way it does when you know someone who has perished or nearly perished from this disease. I know two who have died. A good friend came close. Like me, a growing number of Americans are experiencing the coronavirus personally. Trump isn’t solely responsible. America’s public health system was never up to the task of dealing with a pandemic. But Trump’s stream of lies, denials and refusals to take responsibility have allowed the disease to ravage America. If he mentions the pandemic at all during the Republican convention, he’ll probably blame China and claim the official numbers are exaggerated. Many of his followers will believe him. But just as with the floods and windstorms and fires, an increasing number who have experienced Covid-19 personally have become hardened against his lies. So, too, with the economic devastation that has come in the wake of the pandemic. Tens of millions are unemployed. Many are growing desperate. Almost everyone knows someone who has lost a job, or whose wages have been cut. There’s an old saying that “the personal is political”. People understand politics most profoundly when it’s connected to their own lived experience. At the Republican convention, Trump and his enablers can be expected to claim Democrats want to turn America into a socialist state. They’ll issue racist dogwhistles about “rioters and looters” in American cities. They’ll conjure up “deep state” conspiracies. They’ll lie about Biden. Some Americans will believe this drivel, but I suspect the lived experience of most others – including many who voted for Trump in 2016 – will be more convincing. After almost four years, we’ve felt the consequences of his rotten presidency first-hand. Trump’s malfeasance is now more palpable than his fearmongering. The personal is political. Robert Reich, a former US secretary of labor, is professor of public policy at the University of California at Berkeley and the author of Saving Capitalism: For the Many, Not the Few and The Common Good.

The financial health of the savings and loan industry has drastically deteriorated. The industry has a negative net worth in excess of $70 billion, and it is experiencing significant liquidity problems. Through regulation and subsidy, government has caused large distortions in the financial markets. Regardless of changes in the economic climate, numerous S&Ls will be unable to meet their financial obligations. The federal government has three choices in dealing with the S&Ls: (1) Continue short‐​term “patching” policies, (2) Regulate other financial industries and/​or fully support the S&L industry, or (3) Deregulate the S&Ls. Adopting the first will create additional misallocations in the financial system, and the industry will ultimately default on many of its obligations. Adopting option (2) will detrimentally affect other sectors of the financial community without addressing the fundamental problems of the associations. Again, the misallocations will grow. The third option will allow the healthy S&Ls to adapt, integrating themselves into the financial community. Most importantly, past mistakes will not be perpetuated, and insolvent institutions will be liquidated. Government’s responsibility is to recognize its past mistakes before they become even more expensive to rectify. 



Originally, savings and loan associations were formed in small towns by citizens interested in acquiring a source of capital for financing home building. Before the 1929 Depression, S&Ls lent individuals money only for a short period of time, usually no more than five years. Lenders felt that the risk of longer term mortgages could not be justified by the returns. During the first years of the Depression, the character of the associations was fundamentally‐​altered. In 1932, the Federal Home Loan Bank Act established the Federal Home Loan Bank (FHLB) system with 12 regional banks. The Home Owners Loan Act, passed in 1933, authorized a federal charter system. In 1934, the National Housing Act was passed, which established the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corporation (FSLIC). 



The Home Owners Loan Corporation made 15‐​year mortgages possible and with the National Housing Act, 20‐​year mortgages became economical to issue. Risk was transferred from the mortgage lender to the government. Eventually, the standard 30‐​year mortgage came into existence. FSLIC insurance gave depositors confidence in the safety of their funds. A myriad of regulatory rulings by the FHLB Board set the associations’ operations: They borrowed money from depositors through passbook accounts and lent it to home buyers in the form of 30‐​year fixed rate mortgages. The system seemed to work well, and few voices were raised against the regulatory restrictions. Home ownership became a part of the American way of life. Then the decade of the seventies shattered the mirage. 



Volatility increased in the credit markets. For the first time in memory, the economy experienced both inflation and stagnation. Most economists, influenced by the ideas of John Maynard Keynes, had not foreseen these developments and could not explain them.[1] The health of the S&L industry slowly deteriorated. Interest rates reached levels above 15 percent. Then in 1980 the financial community began to buzz with talk of the industry’s mounting problems. Now a campaign is being waged by regulators and industry officials to obscure the dangers facing the industry. Financial publications claim that “the FSLIC has more than adequate resources to prevent any loss to depositors,” that “when interest rates fall to more ‘reasonable’ levels, the industry will return to profitability,” and “(the industry’s) strong net worth position … shows its capacity to absorb considerable periods of adverse economic conditions” (from the U.S. League of Savings Associations’ 1981 Sourcebook). None of these contentions is true.

President Obama is neither a committed free‐​trader nor a hard‐​core protectionist. But his continuing failure to commit to a pro‐​trade agenda amounts to de facto protectionism and subverts his economic and foreign policy objectives. 



Reacting recently to a provision in the climate change bill that would impose trade penalties against nations that do not limit carbon emissions enough, the president said, “At a time when the economy worldwide is still deep in recession and we’ve seen a significant drop in global trade, I think we have to be very careful about sending any protectionist signals.” 



In that mild rebuke of protectionism lingers the essence of the administration’s nascent trade policy: conditional, ambiguous and not particularly reassuring. 



Earlier this year, the president suggested that Congress avoid language in the stimulus bill that could provoke a trade war. Congress responded by pruning the bill’s most overtly protectionist provisions. But “buy American” fever has nonetheless permeated the government procurement market. Uncertainty surrounding the arcane rules has caused contractors to render their own judgments about what qualifies. Not only have eligible foreign firms been excluded from the market, but U.S. firms that use imported raw materials (including California’s entire steel industry) also have been shut out.





The president speaks of a renewed internationalism and multilateralism in foreign policy, yet his trade policy whiffs of nationalism and unilateralism. 



Canadian municipalities have responded with “don’t buy American” rules, while the Chinese and others have introduced their own buy‐​local provisions, all to the chagrin of U.S. exporters and the general economy. 



One would expect the president to respond with dispatch, at the very least issuing clear implementing guidelines. Instead, the Obama administration has done nothing but “seek comment.” Our comment is this: The president’s disregard for the matter is slowing economic recovery, tempting further escalation by our trade partners and cementing the United States’ reputation as an international trade scofflaw. 



Likewise, when Congress defunded a program that enabled Mexican trucks to operate on our roads — placing the U.S. in violation of the North American Free Trade Agreement, Obama offered assurances of a quick resolution. Five months later, there is no fix in sight. To hasten a resolution, the Mexican government imposed $2.4 billion in retaliatory duties on about 90 U.S. exports, and a Mexican trucking association filed a $6‐​billion lawsuit against the U.S. government. 



The reduction in cross‐​border trade and investment cannot be the economic elixir the president had in mind, nor is the dispute his preferred launching point for diplomatic relations with Mexico. Yet the administration is content, after five months, to just study the problem. How much study is needed to conclude that blatant violation of our NAFTA obligations, plus potentially $8.4 billion in direct costs, plus higher transportation costs on the entire North American supply chain for the benefit of the Teamsters, is a bad idea? 



Meanwhile, despite claims that the administration would work with Congress to pass long‐​pending trade agreements with Panama, Colombia and South Korea, those deals remain hostage to cynical politics. 



The president speaks of a renewed internationalism and multilateralism in foreign policy, yet his trade policy whiffs of nationalism and unilateralism. That won’t help restore America’s image abroad, where most countries regard U.S. trade policy as the face of U.S. foreign policy. 



The inconsistency between the president’s words and deeds betrays a man concerned with politics above all else. But the politics of trade are changing, and Obama has an opportunity to shepherd his party back from the fringe. 



Recent polls indicate that Americans are shedding their skepticism about trade’s benefits. The founding of the Congressional Pro‐​Trade Caucus by Rep. Henry Cuellar (D‐​Texas) this year suggests that protectionism is not the Democratic Party’s creed but rather that of a loud minority led by Sen. Sherrod Brown (D‐​Ohio) and Rep. Michael Michaud (D‐​Maine). 



Democrats who seek to restrict trade must be held accountable when they also claim to speak for Main Street. Middle‐​income Americans spend more of their paychecks on imports than do wealthy Americans. Lower‐​income families spend a higher percentage of their budgets on necessities such as food, clothing and shelter (steel, lumber, cement), all of which face above‐​average import duties because of the efforts of unions and other protectionist lobbies. Tariffs are a highly regressive tax, which is supposed to be anathema to every card‐​carrying Democrat. 



In the coming days, Obama will make his first major speech on the future of U.S. trade policy. If he really wants to bring his party into the 21st century and is truly committed to economic recovery and diplomatic fence‐​mending, he must ditch the flaccid rhetoric and launch an unabashedly pro‐​trade agenda now.

Sen. John Kerry (D, MA) made an, er, _interesting_ rhetorical case yesterday (as reported on E2 Wire, _The Hill_ ’s Energy and Environment blog) that borrows heavily from the Bush playbook: your patriotism hinges on voting for his favored policy — in this case, a climate change bill. Not that the bill is really about climate change, of course. It’s about a list of goodies completely unrelated to the changing political winds: 



What we are talking about is a jobs bill. It is not a climate bill. It is a jobs bill, and it is a clean air bill. It is a national security, energy independence bill,” he told reporters in the Capitol…   
  
  
“And **people are going to have to decide whether they are going to vote for America or against it** ,” he concluded.

In an exceptionally brilliant piece of bluff calling, Professor Andrew Parker of St John’s College at Oxford University trolled the idiotic students at one of the UK’s most prestigious educational establishments.



Two students at St John’s College wrote to Andrew Parker, the principal bursar, this week requesting a meeting to discuss the protesters’ demands, which are that the college “ **declares a climate emergency and immediately divests from fossil fuels** ”. They say that the college, the richest in Oxford, has £8 million of its £551 million endowment fund invested in BP and Shell.



Professor Parker responded with a provocative offer. “I am not able to arrange any divestment at short notice,” he wrote. “ **But I can arrange for the gas central heating in college to be switched off with immediate effect. Please let me know if you support this proposal**.”



Oh dear, oh dear, 1.45% of the college endowment fund is invested in evil fossil fuels. HOW DARE YOU?



Apparently the students were not amused with the professor’s response and suggested that he was not taking their concerns seriously enough.



Professor Parker responded to that note saying, “You are right that I am being provocative but I am provoking some clear thinking, I hope. It is all too easy to request others to do things that carry no personal cost to yourself. The question is whether you and others are prepared to make personal sacrifices to achieve the goals of environmental improvement (which I support as a goal).”



How very dare you mock us like that, professor?



So **Fergus Green** , the organiser of the wider protest, who is studying for a master’s degree in physics and philosophy at Balliol College, got on his high horse and responded, “This is an inappropriate and flippant response by the bursar to what we were hoping would be a **mature discussion**. It’s January _[winter in the UK]_ and it would be borderline dangerous to switch off the central heating.”



This wonderful exchange beautifully illustrates the shallow thinking of the Gretas of the world, her mates in **Extinction Rebellion** and the **Greens** , **Labour** , **NZ First** and **National** politicians here at home.



They are all demanding [climate emergencies](https://thebfd.co.nz/2019/11/there-is-no-climate-emergency/) and zero emissions and [zero carbon](https://thebfd.co.nz/2019/12/zero-carbon-zero-farms/) etc. We even had our very own [Captain’s Call.](https://thebfd.co.nz/2019/05/ardern-is-destroying-taranaki/) But when it finally bites and the heating and lighting (and powering the internet) is threatened, these very same idiots are going to declare that it is “ **borderline dangerous**.”



And it will be. 



It will be catastrophic for millions of people, and someone studying physics at one of the top universities in the world seemingly does not have the intelligence to work this out. Fergus wants a “mature discussion.” Well, come back when you have grown up, Fergus.



This is not about bumper sticker slogans, and the professor’s response illustrates the reality of the situation. Our modern society simply cannot eliminate fossil fuels in the short term (If ever).



There are significant costs to real people associated with turning off the gas (or oil) tap and many people could suffer as a result.



The professor has used the only logical and rational response to those demanding an end to fossil fuels: 



**You first**.

The Historical Thesaurus of the Oxford English Dictionary defines progress as “advancement to a further or higher stage, or to further or higher stages successively; growth; development, usually to a better state or condition; improvement… applied especially to manifestations of social and economic change or reform.”



In a world where we are constantly bombarded with bad news, it can sometimes be difficult to think of “progress” and “humanity” in the same sentence. Are there not wars taking place, people going hungry, children at work, women being abused, and mass poverty around the world?



In fact, for most of human history, life was very difficult for most people. People lacked basic medicines and died relatively young. They had no painkillers and people with ailments spent much of their lives in agonizing pain. Entire families lived in bug‐​infested dwellings that offered neither comfort nor privacy. They worked in the fields from sunrise to sunset, yet hunger and famines were commonplace. Transportation was primitive and most people never traveled beyond their native villages or nearest towns. Ignorance and illiteracy were rife. The “good old days” were, by and large, very bad for the great majority of humankind.





We haven’t achieved utopia, but a new website documents the enormous progress humanity has made, especially over the last two centuries.



Average global life expectancy at birth hovered around 30 years from the Upper Paleolithic to 1900. Even in the richest countries, like those of Western Europe, life expectancy at the start of the 20th century rarely exceeded 50 years. Incomes were quite stagnant, too. At the beginning of the Christian era, annual incomes per person around the world ranged from $1,073 to $1,431. As late as 1820, average global income was only $1,274 per person. (Angus Maddison, whose income estimates I use here, gives his data in 1990 dollars. I have adjusted Maddison’s figures for inflation.)



Humanity has made enormous progress—especially over the course of the last two centuries. For example, average life expectancy in the world today is 67.9 years. In 2010, global per capita income stood at $13,037—over 10 times what it was two centuries ago.



It is not only income and life expectancy that are improving. Harvard’s Steven Pinker has documented a propitious decline in physical violence. He writes,



Tribal warfare was nine times as deadly as war and genocide in the 20th century. The murder rate in medieval Europe was more than thirty times what it is today. Slavery, sadistic punishments, and frivolous executions were unexceptionable features of life for millennia, then were suddenly abolished. Wars between developed countries have vanished, and even in the developing world, wars kill a fraction of the numbers they did a few decades ago. Rape, hate crimes, deadly riots, child abuse—all substantially down.



If anything, the speed of human progress seems to be accelerating. As Charles Kenny of the Center for Global Development writes,



4.9 billion people—the considerable majority of the planet – [live]… in countries where GDP has increased more than fivefold over 50 years. Those countries include India, with an economy nearly 10 times larger than it was in 1960, Indonesia (13 times), China (17 times), and Thailand (22 times larger than in 1960). Around 5.1 billion people live in countries where we know incomes have more than doubled since 1960, and 4.1 billion—well more than half the planet—live in countries where average incomes have tripled or more.…



According to a 2011 paper by Brookings Institution researchers Laurence Chandy and Geoffrey Gertz,



the rise of emerging economies has led to a dramatic fall in global poverty… [The authors] estimate that between 2005 and 2010, the total number of poor people around the world fell by nearly half a billion, from over 1.3 billion in 2005 to under 900 million in 2010. Poverty reduction of this magnitude is unparalleled in history: never before have so many people been lifted out of poverty over such a brief period of time. And using forecasts of per capita consumption growth, they estimate that by 2015 fewer than 600 million people will remain in poverty.



Similarly, the world’s daily caloric intake per person, an indirect measure of well‐​being, has increased from an average of 2,600 in 1990 to 2,840 in 2012. In sub‐​Saharan Africa, the caloric intake increased from 2,180 to 2,380. To put these figures in perspective, the U.S. Department of Agriculture recommends that moderately active adult men consume between 2,200 and 2,800 calories a day and moderately active women consume between 1,800 and 2,000 calories a day.



The Internet, cell phones, and air travel are connecting ever more people—even in poor countries. More children, including girls, attend schools at all levels of education. There are more women holding political office and more female CEOs. In wealthy countries, the wage gap between genders is declining. Our lives are not only longer, but also healthier. The global prevalence rate of people infected with HIV/AIDS has been stable since 2001 and deaths from the disease are declining due to the increasing availability of anti‐​retroviral drugs. In wealthy countries, some cancer rates have started to fall. That is quite an accomplishment considering that people are living much longer and the risk of cancer increases with longevity. Our dwellings are larger and, in many ways, of better quality. Workers tend to work fewer hours and suffer from fewer injuries. Shops are bursting with a mindboggling array of goods that are, normally, less expensive and of higher quality than in the past. We enjoy more leisure and travel to more exotic destinations. To top it off, we enjoy more political freedom and economic freedom.



Yet progress can sometimes be derailed. Europe, for example, experienced an unprecedented period of peace and rapidly improving standards of living between the conclusion of the Napoleonic Wars in 1815 and the outbreak of World War I in 1914. Between 1820 and 1914, real or inflation‐​adjusted income per person rose by 127 percent in Western Europe. In Great Britain, for example, life expectancy at birth rose from 41 years 1818 to 52 years in 1914. In Sweden, the improvement was even more dramatic, with life expectancy rising from 39 years in 1814 to 58 years in 1914.



The period between the start of the 20th century and the outbreak of World War I saw the introduction of such life‐​changing technologies as the radio, the vacuum cleaner, air conditioning, the neon light, the airplane, sonar, the first plastics, the Model T motorcar and more.



On June 28, 1914, the heir to the throne of the Austro‐​Hungarian Empire, Archduke Franz Ferdinand, was assassinated in Sarajevo, Bosnia‐​Herzegovina. The murder led to the outbreak of World War I, in which some 39 million people lost their lives. Incomes in Western Europe fell by 11 percent between 1916 and 1919. Life expectancy in Great Britain, one of the war’s main participants, collapsed from 52 years in 1914 to 40 years in 1918.



Other horrors followed. The devastation of World War I undermined the Russian monarchy, leading to the rise of communism and the establishment of the USSR. Globally, well over 100 million people died because of purges and socialist economic mismanagement in communist countries. Defeat in World War I and harsh reparation demands led to resentment in Germany. That contributed to the rise of National Socialism, the outbreak of World War II, and the subsequent Holocaust. Some 73 million people died in World War II. After the war ended, communist dictatorships and free‐​market democracies fought in a variety of proxy conflicts as part of the Cold War, including the Korean Warand the Vietnam War.



In spite of all that suffering, people’s lives continued to improve. New technologies were introduced. They included the microwave oven, the mobile phone, the transistor, the video recorder, the credit card, the television, solar cells, optic fiber, microchips, lasers, the calculator, fuel cells, the World Wide Web and the computer. Medical advances included penicillin, cortisone, the pacemaker, artificial hearts, the MRI scan, HIV protease inhibitor, and vaccines for hepatitis, smallpox, and polio.



Over the course of the 20th century, the income of an average Western European rose by 517 percent. In terms of life expectancy, a typical Frenchman could expect to live 34 years longer in 1999 than in 1900.



The United States escaped much of the devastation of the two world wars, but suffered the Great Depression and carried many of the burdens of the Cold War. Between 1929 and 1933, the average U.S. income declined by 31 percent. It was not until 1940 that incomes returned to their pre‐​Depression levels. Over the course of the 20th century, however, average American income rose by 581 percent and life expectancy by 28 years.



In Asia, average per capita income rose by 473 percent between 1913 and 1999. Chinese incomes rose by 427 percent between 1820 and 1999. Indian incomes rose by 212 percent between 1821 and 1999. In China, life expectancy rose from 32 years in 1924 to 71 years in 1999—an increase of 39 years. Indian life expectancy increased from 24 years in 1901 to 61 years in 1999—an increase of 37 years.



The story of Africa is more complex and disheartening, but still, on balance, positive. Between the time of the European colonization in 1870 and African independence in 1960, a typical inhabitant of the African continent saw his or her income rise by 63 percent. Incomes increased by a further 41 percent between 1960 and 1999. While Africa had underperformed relative to the rest of the world, Africans were better off at the end of the 20th century than they were at the beginning. Moreover, since the start of the new millennium, Africa has been making up for lost time. In the 12 years from 1999 to 2010, African incomes rose by 36 percent.



When it comes to life expectancy, Africa has experienced serious progress. However, increases in life expectancy vary, mostly depending on the harm caused by the spread of AIDS. Life expectancy in South Africa rose from 34 years in 1930 to an all‐​time high of 62 years in 1990. But by 2011, life expectancy declined to 52 years. Ghana was less affected by the epidemic, which allowed life expectancy in the country to increase from 28 years in 1921 to 64 years in 2011.



The Great Recession reminds us that progress is uneven. In the United States, a country that was both originator and victim of the recession, per capita income, adjusted for inflation and purchasing power parity, decreased by 3.1 percent, from $46,760 in 2008 to $45,305 in 2009. This relatively small fall in average income does not make the suffering of millions of Americans, especially those who lost their jobs and homes, any less real. Thankfully, at the time of writing, the economy appears to be on the mend, with average incomes rising of an all‐​time high of $49,965 in 2012.



 **Progress Is Not Inevitable**



We must keep human development in proper perspective. The present, for all of its imperfections, is a vast improvement on the past. Understanding and appreciating the progress that humanity has made does not mean that we stop trying to make the future even better than the present. That said, we should avoid making two mistakes.



First, we should correctly identify, preserve, and expand those policies and institutions that have made human progress possible. If we misidentify the causes of human progress, we could put the well‐​being of future generations at risk. One way of avoiding serious policy mistakes in the future is to avoid concentrating power in a single pair of hands or in the hands of a small elite. Instead, we should trust in the choices made by free‐​acting individuals. No doubt, some of those individual choices will turn out to be bad, but the aggregate wisdom of millions of free‐​acting individuals is more likely to be correct than incorrect.



Second, we should beware of utopian idealism. Utopians compare the present with what might be called the future perfect, not the past imperfect. Instead of seeing the present as a vast improvement on the past, they see the present as failing to live up to some sort of an imagined utopia. Unfortunately, the world will never be a perfect place because the human beings who inhabit it are themselves imperfect. Today, it is difficult to imagine the emergence of a powerful new utopian movement. But few people in 1900 foresaw the destruction brought on by communism and Nazism. We cannot rule out that utopian demagogues akin to Lenin, Stalin, Hitler, Mao Zedong, or Pol Pot will emerge in the future.



When it comes to global standards of living, human history resembles a hockey stick resting on its side, with a long straight shaft and an upward facing blade. For most of our existence, progress was painfully slow (resembling that long straight shaft). At the start of the 19th century, however, the speed of human progress rapidly accelerated (resembling that upward facing blade). What was responsible for that acceleration? Many books have been written on this subject and it is beyond the scope of this essay to provide a full answer. That said, few scholars deny the central role played by two forces that are routinely demonized: industrialization and globalization.



 _Industrial Revolution_



First, let us look at the industrial revolution. According to the Encyclopedia Britannica, the industrial revolution was “the process of change from an agrarian, handicraft economy to one dominated by industry and machine manufacture.” It started in Great Britain in the 18th century and then spread to other parts of the world.



The technological changes included the following: the use of new basic materials, chiefly iron and steel, the use of new energy sources, including both fuels and motive power, such as coal, the steam engine, electricity, petroleum, and the internal‐​combustion engine, the invention of new machines, such as the spinning jenny and the power loom that permitted increased production with a smaller expenditure of human energy, a new organization of work known as the factory system, which entailed increased division of labor and specialization of function.… These technological changes made possible a tremendously increased use of natural resources and the mass production of manufactured goods.… There were also many new developments in nonindustrial spheres, including the following: agricultural improvements that made possible the provision of food for a larger nonagricultural population, economic changes that resulted in a wider distribution of wealth, the decline of land as a source of wealth in the face of rising industrial production, and increased international trade, political changes reflecting the shift in economic power, as well as new state policies corresponding to the needs of an industrialized society, sweeping social changes, including the growth of cities, the development of working‐​class movements, and the emergence of new patterns of authority, and cultural transformations of a broad order.



The Industrial Revolution had many contemporary critics. Observers like Charles Dickens commented on the squalor of 19th‐​century cities and the backbreaking labor of the people, including children, in the factories in much the same way that our journalists today comment on the squalor of the rapidly industrializing Indian cities and backbreaking labor of people, including children, in Bangladeshi factories.



But things should be kept in a proper perspective. Life on an 18th‐​century farm was extremely difficult, and the city offered the former country dwellers higher wages and new opportunities. In time, sanitation, healthcare and other benefits of civilized life caught up with the cities’ rising population, giving us the modern metropolis. In a similar vein, legislation caught up with rising standards of living and codified in law what was happening already in practice—as productivity increased and wages rose, fewer children were needed to supplement their parents’ incomes. Increased productivity of workers led to greater competition for workers, and factory owners started taking better care of their employees. Working conditions improved and work injuries declined.



Another major criticism of the industrial revolution concerns the spoliation of the environment and exploitation of natural resources. Who can forget William Blake’s condemnation of industrialization in his 1808 poem Jerusalem?



And did those feet in ancient time  
Walk upon England’s mountains green?  
And was the holy Lamb of God   
And did the Countenance Divine  
Shine forth upon our clouded hills?  
And was Jerusalem builded here  
Among these dark Satanic mills?



Blake’s “satanic mills” refer to factories that in his view pockmarked the bucolic face of the English countryside. As was the case with other writers of the Romantic era, Blake’s description of pre‐​industrial society was highly idealized. The reality, alas, was much less appealing. Most pre‐​industrial societies, Great Britain included, were heavily dependent on agricultural output. Agricultural production was labor intensive, but productivity was very low. Before the arrival of machines powered by steam and combustion engines, agriculture depended on much less efficient human and animal labor. People and animals had to be fed, which meant that most of the calories produced on the farm were immediately consumed by the laborers. Prior to the industrial revolution, there were no synthetic fertilizers, such as nitrogen, and crop yields were much lower than what they are today. As a consequence, more land was required to feed people and pack animals. Land clearing was usually accomplished by burning of forests. Yet more trees were cut down to heat houses and cook food. Environmental damage aside, a major reason for switching from wood to coal was the simple fact that there were very few trees left. Thanks to the use of fossil fuels, global forest coverage has stabilized and is expanding in the world’s richest and most industrialized countries.



 _Globalization_



Second, let us consider globalization, which the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) defines as “an increasing internationalization of markets for goods and services, the means of production, financial systems, competition, corporations, technology and industries. Amongst other things this gives rise to increased mobility of capital, faster propagation of technological innovations and an increasing interdependency and uniformity of national markets.”



Contrary to the common misperception, globalization is not a new phenomenon. The tradel inks between the Sumer and Indus Valley civilizations go back to the third millennium BC. Later, tere was the Silk Road between Europe and Asia, and European voyages into India and the Americas. Clearly, trade has been fundamental to the process of globalization from antiquity. But why do people trade?



Trade delivers goods and services to people who value them most. An additional ton of corn produced in Kansas may be of little importance to the people in the American Midwest, but it can be crucial to the people living in the drought‐​stricken East Africa. Trade, to use economic jargon, improves efficiency in the allocation of scarce resources. Another reason for trade is the principle of comparative advantage. As the Nobel Prize‐​winning economist Paul Samuelson noted,



The gains from trade follow from allowing an economy to specialize. If a country is relatively better at making wine than wool, it makes sense to put more resources into wine, and to export some of the wine to pay for imports of wool. This is even true if that country is the world’s best wool producer, since the country will have more of both wool and wine than it would have without trade. A country does not have to be best at anything to gain from trade. The gains follow from specializing in those activities which, at world prices, the country is relatively better at, even though it may not have an absolute advantage in them. Because it is relative advantage that matters, it is meaningless to say a country has a comparative advantage in nothing. The term is one of the most misunderstood ideas in economics, and is often wrongly assumed to mean an absolute advantage compared with other countries.



Moreover, trade allows consumers to benefit from more efficient production methods. For example, without large markets for goods and services, large production runs would not be economical. Large production runs are instrumental to reducing product costs. For example, early cars had to be individually hand crafted. The Model T assembly line revolutionized car manufacturing and allowed the Ford Motor Company to slash the price of the Model T from $850 in 1909 to $260 in the 1920s in nominal dollars (in 2013 dollars, the drop would be from $20,000 to about $4,000). Lower production costs, in other words, lead to cheaper goods and services, and that raises real living standards.



Besides better resource allocation, and greater specialization and economies of scale, trade encourages technological and cultural exchanges between previously disconnected civilizations. It is for those reasons that great commercial cities like Florence and Venice during the Renaissance, and London and New York today, also tend to be centers of cultural life and technological progress.



The development of the steam engine and the opening of the Suez Canal in the 19th century made seafaring faster and cheaper. The volume of traded goods greatly increased. Through the process of price convergence, prices fell and consumers benefited. The gold standard and the invention of the telegraph – and later telephone – also allowed for massive transfers of capital. Attracted by higher profits, capital flowed from more developed to less developed countries, thus stimulating global economic development. As the British economist John Maynard Keynes recalled, before World War I,



The inhabitant of London could order by telephone, sipping his morning tea in bed, the various products of the whole earth.… He could at the same moment and by the same means adventure his wealth in the natural resources and new enterprises of any quarter of the world, and share, without exertion or even trouble, in their prospective fruits and advantages… He could secure … cheap and comfortable means of transit to any country or climate without passport or other formality.



This earlier era of globalization ended with the outbreak of World War I and the concomitant disruption of world trade. By some estimates, globalization did not reach its pre–World War I levels until the 1970s or even 1980s. In fact, it was the 1980s that marked the beginning of the period of globalization that we live in today. Spurred by economic deregulation within countries, trade liberalization between countries, privatization of state‐​owned companies, further improvements in transport and the arrival of the Internet, globalization got a new lease on life. As important—and in keeping with the dramatic decreases in violence and conflict noted above—past episodes of often‐​violent colonization and mercantilist economics has been mostly replaced by positive‐​sum exchanges among countries and individuals.



 **The World Is Getting Better, But There Is an Abundance of Skepticism**



As we can see, Europe and America, and, later, other regions of the world, experienced previously unimaginable improvements in standards of living. The process of rapid improvement that started in the early 1800s continues to this day. Accordingly, historical evidence makes a potent case for optimism. Yet optimism about the current state and future well‐​being of humankind is difficult to come by. As author Matt Ridley writes in his book, _The Rational Optimist_ ,



If… you say catastrophe is imminent, you may expect a McArthur genius award or even the Nobel Peace Prize. The bookshops are groaning under ziggurats of pessimism. The airwaves are crammed with doom. In my own adult lifetime, I have listened to the implacable predictions of growing poverty, coming famines, expanding deserts, imminent plagues, impending water wars, inevitable oil exhaustion, mineral shortages, falling sperm counts, thinning ozone, acidifying rain, nuclear winters, mad‐​cow epidemics, Y2K computer bugs, killer bees, sex‐​change fish, global warming, ocean acidification and even asteroid impacts that would presently bring this happy interlude to a terrible end. I cannot recall a time when one or other of these scares was not solemnly espoused by sober, distinguished and serious elites and hysterically echoed by the media. I cannot recall a time when I was not being urged by somebody that the world could only survive if it abandoned the foolish goal of economic growth. The fashionable reason for pessimism changed, but the pessimism was constant. In the 1960s the population explosion and global famine were top of the charts, in the 1970s the exhaustion of resources, in the 1980s acid rain, in the 1990s pandemics, in the 2000s global warming. One by one these scares came and (all but the last) went. Were we just lucky? Are we, in the memorable image of the old joke, like the man who falls past the first floor of the skyscraper and thinks ‘So far so good!’? Or was it the pessimism that was unrealistic?



Ridley’s recollection raises an interesting question: Why are we as a species so willing to believe in doomsday scenarios that never quite materialize in practice?



In their 2012 book, _Abundance: The Future is Better than You Think_ , Peter H. Diamandis and Steven Kotler offer one plausible explanation. Human beings are constantly bombarded with information. Because our brains have a limited computing power, they have to separate what is important—such as a lion running toward us—from what is mundane. Because survival is more important than all other considerations, most information enters our brains through the amygdala—a part of the brain that is “responsible for primal emotions like rage, hate and fear.” Information relating to those primal emotions gets our attention first because the amygdala “is always looking for something to fear.” Our species has evolved to prioritize bad news. Pessimists survived, while optimists got eaten by lions.



Newspapers and other media have long since recognized that pessimism sells. According to one analysis, about 90 percent of all articles in _The Washington Post_ tend to be pessimistic in tone. As the old saying among journalists goes, “If it bleeds, it leads.” Politicians, too, have realized that banging on about “crises” increases their power and can get them reelected, and may also lead to prestigious prizes and lucrative speaking engagements. Thus politicians on both left and right play on our fears—from crime supposedly caused by playing violent computer games to health maladies supposedly caused by the consumption of genetically modified foods.



More than the physical structure of the human brain may be at play, of course. Take, for example, the role of ideology in shaping our perception of the world around us. If we start from a premise that the dominant economic system in the world today (i.e., some combination of private ownership, competition, free trade, deregulation, and moves toward liberalization) is either immoral or destructive, then it is difficult to reconcile that system with good news about human development. In other words, to maintain skepticism about the “system,” one is forced to ignore or discount positive developments in human well‐​being.



The dominant economic system in the world today is, of course, capitalism or, to use less ideologically loaded terminology, free enterprise or the free market. Just how “free” the free market really is, is debatable. In many supposedly free‐​market societies, like Europe and the United States, local and national governments tend to redistribute between 40 percent and 50 percent of the gross national product.



Where does the skepticism about free market come from? The late Harvard University philosopher Robert Nozick provides one plausible answer. The intellectual elite (i.e., the wordsmiths who occupy many positions within academia, the media, and government bureaucracies) tend to take a more negative view of free market than the one presented here. These individuals shape society’s language and access to information. As such, the anti‐​free‐​market sentiment of the intellectual elite carries great weight.



“From the beginnings of recorded thought,” Nozick writes, “intellectuals have told us their activity is most valuable. Plato valued the rational faculty above courage and the appetites and deemed that philosophers should rule; Aristotle held that intellectual contemplation was the highest activity.” Intellectuals have thus come to think of themselves as the “most valuable” members of society and “feel entitled to the highest rewards their society has to offer.” The markets, however, tend to reward “economic contribution.” Consequently, intellectuals tend not to be the most rewarded members of a free‐​market society. That runs counter to the intellectuals’ expectations. When they socialize with the most rewarded individuals in society, the intellectuals resent that they are not compensated to the same degree. To rectify this perceived injustice, intellectuals advocate for a society that distributes compensation in line with their expectations, rather than economic contribution.



It is perhaps best to start by explaining what the Human Progress website is not trying to accomplish. It will not try to convince you that the world is a perfect place. As long as there are people who go hungry or die from preventable diseases, there will always be room for improvement. To that end, we all have a role to play in helping the destitute in our communities and beyond.



Our goal, then, is not to paint a rosy picture of the state of humanity, but a realistic one. A realistic account of the world should focus on long‐​term trends, comparing living standards between two or more generations. Crucially, it should compare the imperfect present with a much more imperfect past, rather than with an imagined utopia in the future.



As such, this website has two main aims. First is to inform you about the many ways in which the world has become a better place. Second is to allow you to search for reasons that brought that improvement about. While we think that policies and institutions compatible with freedom and openness are important factors in promoting human progress, we let the evidence speak for itself and hope the website stimulates an intelligent debate on the drivers of human progress.

"LIKE it or not, winter is coming. Apart from layering up, you can turn to your phone to help you brave the rain, wind or snow ahead. Weather apps are abundant in mobile app stores, and my new favorite is Fire + Rain. Unlike many other weather apps, it keeps weather data simple. Built on information from the Weather Network, the app’s display is streamlined and easy to understand. The screen’s color corresponds with the forecast, and the temperature is displayed in large type. Alongside this are a small icon and a simple phrase describing the weather, like “light rain” or “cloudy with showers. ” You get, at a glance, everything you need to know about the coming weather where you are. Swipe down the screen to see hourly and daily forecasts tap to swap between a   detailed forecast and a   forecast. If you see the words “heavy snow” in tomorrow morning’s forecast, you’ll know to make the necessary preparations tonight. Fire + Rain is free on iOS. For people who like detailed weather forecasts, there is RainAware. This app belongs to the new breed of weather apps that try to deliver extremely accurate weather data based on the time and your precise location. The app uses GPS to detect where you are, and then it pulls forecast data from its system, including detailed radar scans. Instead of the typical approximation other weather apps might offer, like “50 percent chance of storms,” RainAware has concrete alerts, like “It’s going to rain in 30 minutes. ” The app’s radar maps are also neat: They show how rain clouds are moving near you and predict where they will go next, so you can see how the weather is going to change. RainAware has a lot of features, including a weather clock showing the forecast in   increments, so it may take some getting used to. But it’s an excellent option. It costs $5 on iOS and $4 on Android. Another app, Storm Radar from Weather Underground, is a source that television weather forecasters consult before they step in front of the camera. This weather app has   radar maps and   algorithms to figure out if you are in the path of a nearby weather event. It even has lightning alerts for a   radius around your location. Data on variables like dew point and humidity can be viewed as colored patterns on a map, or as graphs or charts. You can also get highly localized weather alerts  —   for example, the app told me there were two “coastal event” alerts as high winds and high tides threatened the seafront zone near my home. If you prefer a   forecast, Storm Radar offers that too. There is a lot to discover in this app, and if you plan to use it you may need to spend some time on Google to get a full understanding of what all the data means. But it is free on iOS, and its interface is both attractive and easy to interact with. MeteoEarth, another scientific weather forecast app, shows animated maps that contain a wealth of forecasting information for your location. The maps can show data on rainfall, wind, temperature and pressure, and can even track tropical storms. The app also offers access to live weather webcams around the world that give a sense of the conditions in a particular location. MeteoEarth takes some figuring out, but its slick graphical interface is satisfying to use. It’s free on iOS and Android. Lastly, it may be worth keeping the free FEMA app (iOS, Android) on your phone in case your home is subjected to the worst of the winter weather. In addition to an alert system from the National Weather Service, the app offers guidance about what to do before, during and after a disaster. The naturalist Sir David Attenborough has been making television programs about the wonders of life for 60 years, and now over 1, 000 clips from his body of work are available in a new app: Attenborough’s Story of Life (free on iOS, Android). Browse it with your children and enjoy learning about nature from the soothing voice of Sir David himself."

From the “settled science” department and former chief alarmist Jay Zwally, who for years had said the Arctic was in big trouble (only to have his prediction falsified), comes this Emily Litella moment in climate science: “Never mind!”. Curiously, WUWT reported back in 2012 about an ICEsat study by Zwally that said: ICESAT Data Shows Mass Gains of the Antarctic Ice Sheet Exceed Losses. I surmise that with the publication of this second study, the original is now confirmed. I suppose John Cook will have to revise his “Denial 101” video on Antarctica now.
This map shows the rates of mass changes from ICESat 2003-2008 over Antarctica. Sums are for all of Antarctica: East Antarctica (EA, 2-17); interior West Antarctica (WA2, 1, 18, 19, and 23); coastal West Antarctica (WA1, 20-21); and the Antarctic Peninsula (24-27). A gigaton (Gt) corresponds to a billion metric tons, or 1.1 billion U.S. tons. CREDIT: Jay Zwally/ Journal of Glaciology
From the NASA/GODDARD SPACE FLIGHT CENTER via press release:
NASA study: Mass gains of Antarctic Ice Sheet greater than losses
A new NASA study says that an increase in Antarctic snow accumulation that began 10,000 years ago is currently adding enough ice to the continent to outweigh the increased losses from its thinning glaciers.
The research challenges the conclusions of other studies, including the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change’s (IPCC) 2013 report, which says that Antarctica is overall losing land ice.
According to the new analysis of satellite data, the Antarctic ice sheet showed a net gain of 112 billion tons of ice a year from 1992 to 2001. That net gain slowed to 82 billion tons of ice per year between 2003 and 2008.
“We’re essentially in agreement with other studies that show an increase in ice discharge in the Antarctic Peninsula and the Thwaites and Pine Island region of West Antarctica,” said Jay Zwally, a glaciologist with NASA Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland, and lead author of the study, which was published on Oct. 30 in the Journal of Glaciology. “Our main disagreement is for East Antarctica and the interior of West Antarctica – there, we see an ice gain that exceeds the losses in the other areas.” Zwally added that his team “measured small height changes over large areas, as well as the large changes observed over smaller areas.”
Scientists calculate how much the ice sheet is growing or shrinking from the changes in surface height that are measured by the satellite altimeters. In locations where the amount of new snowfall accumulating on an ice sheet is not equal to the ice flow downward and outward to the ocean, the surface height changes and the ice-sheet mass grows or shrinks.
But it might only take a few decades for Antarctica’s growth to reverse, according to Zwally.
“If the losses of the Antarctic Peninsula and parts of West Antarctica continue to increase at the same rate they’ve been increasing for the last two decades, the losses will catch up with the long-term gain in East Antarctica in 20 or 30 years — I don’t think there will be enough snowfall increase to offset these losses.”
The study analyzed changes in the surface height of the Antarctic ice sheet measured by radar altimeters on two European Space Agency European Remote Sensing (ERS) satellites, spanning from 1992 to 2001, and by the laser altimeter on NASA’s Ice, Cloud, and land Elevation Satellite (ICESat) from 2003 to 2008.
Zwally said that while other scientists have assumed that the gains in elevation seen in East Antarctica are due to recent increases in snow accumulation, his team used meteorological data beginning in 1979 to show that the snowfall in East Antarctica actually decreased by 11 billion tons per year during both the ERS and ICESat periods. They also used information on snow accumulation for tens of thousands of years, derived by other scientists from ice cores, to conclude that East Antarctica has been thickening for a very long time.
“At the end of the last Ice Age, the air became warmer and carried more moisture across the continent, doubling the amount of snow dropped on the ice sheet,” Zwally said.
The extra snowfall that began 10,000 years ago has been slowly accumulating on the ice sheet and compacting into solid ice over millennia, thickening the ice in East Antarctica and the interior of West Antarctica by an average of 0.7 inches (1.7 centimeters) per year. This small thickening, sustained over thousands of years and spread over the vast expanse of these sectors of Antarctica, corresponds to a very large gain of ice – enough to outweigh the losses from fast-flowing glaciers in other parts of the continent and reduce global sea level rise.
Zwally’s team calculated that the mass gain from the thickening of East Antarctica remained steady from 1992 to 2008 at 200 billion tons per year, while the ice losses from the coastal regions of West Antarctica and the Antarctic Peninsula increased by 65 billion tons per year.
“The good news is that Antarctica is not currently contributing to sea level rise, but is taking 0.23 millimeters per year away,” Zwally said. “But this is also bad news. If the 0.27 millimeters per year of sea level rise attributed to Antarctica in the IPCC report is not really coming from Antarctica, there must be some other contribution to sea level rise that is not accounted for.”
“The new study highlights the difficulties of measuring the small changes in ice height happening in East Antarctica,” said Ben Smith, a glaciologist with the University of Washington in Seattle who was not involved in Zwally’s study.
“Doing altimetry accurately for very large areas is extraordinarily difficult, and there are measurements of snow accumulation that need to be done independently to understand what’s happening in these places,” Smith said.
To help accurately measure changes in Antarctica, NASA is developing the successor to the ICESat mission, ICESat-2, which is scheduled to launch in 2018. “ICESat-2 will measure changes in the ice sheet within the thickness of a No. 2 pencil,” said Tom Neumann, a glaciologist at Goddard and deputy project scientist for ICESat-2. “It will contribute to solving the problem of Antarctica’s mass balance by providing a long-term record of elevation changes.”

In a piece at Nature News, Zwally has said:

“Parts of Antarctica are losing mass faster than before,” says Jay Zwally, a glaciologist at NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland, and lead author of a paper to appear in theJournal of Glaciology1. “But large parts have been gaining mass, and they’ve been doing that for a very long time.”

The findings do not mean that Antarctica is not in trouble, Zwally notes.

“I know some of the climate deniers will jump on this, and say this means we don’t have to worry as much as some people have been making out,” he says. “It should not take away from the concern about climate warming.” As global temperatures rise, Antarctica is expected to contribute more to sea-level rise, though when exactly that effect will kick in, and to what extent, remains unclear.

Gee, thanks.

Abstract:
Mass changes of the Antarctic ice sheet impact sea-level rise as climate changes, but recent rates have been uncertain. Ice, Cloud and land Elevation Satellite (ICESat) data (2003–08) show mass gains from snow accumulation exceeded discharge losses by 82 ± 25 Gt a–1, reducing global sea-level rise by 0.23 mm a–1. European Remote-sensing Satellite (ERS) data (1992–2001) give a similar gain of 112 ± 61 Gt a–1. Gains of 136 Gt a–1 in East Antarctica (EA) and 72 Gt a–1 in four drainage systems (WA2) in West Antarctic (WA) exceed losses of 97 Gt a–1 from three coastal drainage systems (WA1) and 29 Gt a–1 from the Antarctic Peninsula (AP). EA dynamic thickening of 147 Gt a–1 is a continuing response to increased accumulation (>50%) since the early Holocene. Recent accumulation loss of 11 Gt a–1 in EA indicates thickening is not from contemporaneous snowfall increases. Similarly, the WA2 gain is mainly (60 Gt a–1) dynamic thickening. In WA1 and the AP, increased losses of 66 ± 16 Gt a–1 from increased dynamic thinning from accelerating glaciers are 50% offset by greater WA snowfall. The decadal increase in dynamic thinning in WA1 and the AP is approximately one-third of the long-term dynamic thickening in EA and WA2, which should buffer additional dynamic thinning for decades.

"When progressive Seattle decided last year to wipe out its climate pollution within the decade, the city council vote in favor was unsurprisingly unanimous, and the easiest first step on that path was clear. About one-third of the city’s climate footprint comes from buildings, in large part from burning “natural” gas for heating and cooking. Gas is a fossil fuel that releases carbon dioxide and far more potent methane into the atmosphere and heats the planet. It is plentiful and cheap, and it’s also a huge and increasing part of America’s climate challenge. So, a city councilman drafted legislation to stop the problem from growing by banning gas hookups in new buildings. Suddenly, the first step didn’t look so easy. “From there, we just ran into a wall of opposition,” said Alec Connon, a campaigner with the climate group 350 Seattle. Local plumbers and pipe fitters warned of job losses. Realtors complained their clients would still want gas fireplaces. Building owners feared utility bills could soar. The effort died. The ban wasn’t politically tenable, it seemed. But internal records obtained by the Guardian show the measure’s defeat and the “wall of opposition” that advocates experienced were part of a sophisticated pushback plan from Seattle’s gas supplier, Puget Sound Energy. Seattle’s story isn’t unique. In fact, it’s representative of a nationwide blitz by gas companies and their allies to beat back climate action they consider an existential threat to their business, according to emails, meeting agendas and public records reviewed by the Guardian. The documents show the multibillion-dollar gas industry has built crucial local coalitions and hired high-powered operatives to torpedo cities’ anti-gas policies – sometimes assisted by money those same cities have paid into gas trade associations. In historically conservative states, the gas industry has convinced legislatures to pass laws prohibiting cities from following in Seattle’s footsteps and trying to ban new gas hookups. In the digital world, it has carefully cultivated the fuel’s image, paying Instagram influencers to cook with gas stoves. In the media, it has sought to be quoted in important stories in news outlets like Reuters, according to internal records. In Washington DC, where the industry has strong support from the Trump administration, it has lobbied the federal government on everything from environmental reviews to appliance standards. “The gas utilities are facing an existential threat, and instead of approaching a decarbonizing economy as an opportunity to reinvent themselves, they’re digging their heels in and going back to the age-old tactics of [the fossil fuel industry],” said Charlie Spatz, a researcher at the Climate Investigations Center. “These public records show just a fraction of a much larger effort to slow down critical climate solutions.” In the Seattle battle, Puget Sound Energy hired a lobbying firm that had previously defeated a proposed tax on sugary drinks. The firm, CBE Strategic, was asked to “develop an action plan targeted at countering 350.org’s efforts” and “stopping local governments” from enacting restrictions on gas, according to a summary document of the work.  CBE’s responsibilities included “coalition building, lobbying strategy, communications, and research”. “We have been able to stop the fast track the proposal was on by deploying a strong coalition of labor and business,” the summary said. CBE planned to “shape an alternative” to the ban. The firm would create an “inclusive stakeholder process” and analyze possible economic impacts on customers. In other words, the opponents would band together and stall. Other industry documents confirm Puget Sound Energy’s mobilizing efforts. One document from a gas appliance industry group – the Hearth, Patio and Barbecue Association (HPBA) – noted that Puget Sound Energy and the local chamber of commerce had “formed a coalition to counter the Seattle City Council and similar efforts in Bellingham and Everett”, and would continue to monitor new anti-gas proposals. Puget Sound Energy opposed the climate proposals despite its stated mission of “deep decarbonization and greenhouse gas emissions reduction” and goal of a carbon-neutral electric system by 2030. Neither Puget Sound Energy nor its lobbying firm CBE responded to requests for comment. After the gas ban was beaten back in Seattle, Caleb Heeringa, a spokesman for the Sierra Club in the city, said advocates saw coordinated industry and union pushback against gas-related climate efforts grow. A new group called the Partnership for Energy Progress (PEP) was taking root. The partnership is an organization of western utilities, labor unions and businesses that plans to spend $2.8m in 2020 convincing consumers that “natural gas is part of a clean energy future”, and fighting state and local climate restrictions on gas, according to records reviewed by the Guardian. The partnership’s target demographic, what it calls “flight risks” that could turn on the gas industry, is Democratic women between the ages of 35 and 54 who own homes and have college degrees, according to polling used by the group. Unions are instrumental to the partnership, contributing about one-sixth of its budget. Leanne Guier – the political director of the Seattle plumbers and pipefitters union that opposed the gas ban – is the group’s president. Advertisements from the coalition show photos of mothers with their babies next to gas stoves and fireplaces, with the words: “Reliable. Affordable. Natural Gas. Here for You.” “It’s kind of unlike anything we’ve seen up here,” Heeringa said. The partnership did not respond to specific inquiries about its work but said in an emailed statement from Guier that its goal was “to communicate the work we do to provide reliable, affordable energy to homes and businesses, and highlight the progress we’re making to address climate change”. *** Puget Sound Energy and the Partnership for Energy Progress are using the same strategies that the gas industry and its trade groups are employing at the national level. The group that represents gas fireplace and stove companies, HPBA, said in one document obtained by the Guardian that “it has become clear in the last six months that electrification is an existential issue that will be with the industry for a long time, often playing out in smaller communities and with very little advance warning”. To “help address this growing threat”, HPBA said it would pay to join local coalitions, including the partnership in the north-west. HPBA has also connected with the midwest utility Dominion to fight electrification in Ohio and supported testimony about a pro-gas law in Arizona. The American Gas Association (AGA), which represents mainly investor-owned gas providers, now convenes monthly calls “that bring together appliance, homebuilder, fuel, and other associations to compare notes and support efforts to push back on decarbonization and electrification issues”, according to the same document. An April AGA meeting planned to feature officials from Puget Sound Energy and another power company, Dominion Energy, in a discussion of “activities underway at the state or regional level to combat attempts to remove natural gas from communities”, according to the group’s agenda, which was released as a state public record. An AGA spokesman, Jake Rubin, said the group did not have state chapters operating at the local level, but “members present past and current opportunities and challenges so that other companies may learn from their experiences”. As the public learns more about the harms of natural gas, the industry is playing both defense and offense. Burning natural gas produces less planet-heating carbon dioxide than burning coal or oil. Gas advocates have positioned it as a smart alternative to those dirtier fossil fuels. Even the Obama administration backed gas as a “bridge fuel”. But the extraction and transportation of natural gas leaks methane: a climate pollutant with a short-term warming potential far more powerful than carbon dioxide. Scientists are revealing we have greatly underestimated the methane emitted by the gas industry. Fossil gas is responsible for 42% of the US greenhouse gas emissions that come from burning fossil fuels, according to data from the Department of Energy interpreted by Robert Howarth, who researches methane at Cornell University. “Gas is one of the biggest drivers of emissions growth both in the US and globally, and the future trends for expansion on the system are really worrying,” said Sheryl Carter, director of the power sector climate program at the Natural Resources Defense Council. “The infrastructure investments that are being made right now … they last for 40 to 60 years. So that really locks in those emissions increases.” Progressive local governments have recognized the significant impact of gas and are trying to phase it out, at the same time as the Trump administration has halted essentially all of the national government’s climate work. More than 30 cities in California and a town in Massachusetts have pursued similar steps to discourage or eliminate gas use in new buildings. In San Luis Obispo, California, the city tried to disincentivize gas hookups, rather than ban them outright. The utility company there, Southern California Gas Co, hired consultants who helped postpone a vote on the measure, according to the Los Angeles Times. In Sacramento, the city is trying to ban fossil fuel use in new buildings by 2023 and transition a quarter of residential and small commercial buildings away from fossil fuel use by 2030 but faces opposition from a gas utility group trying to “to push back against these with other trade associations”, according to a June email from the American Public Gas Association, which represents municipal utilities. *** Fearing more local climate efforts, the gas industry has supported legislation in four states to ban cities from doing what Seattle, San Luis Obispo and Sacramento have tried to do, according to emails between trade group officials and companies. These so-called “pre-emption laws passed in Arizona in February, in Tennessee in March, and in Oklahoma and Louisiana in May. Similar bills were considered in Kansas, Minnesota and New Jersey. A ballot initiative was pursued in Colorado. Legislation in Mississippi and Georgia died early in the session. There are at least 250 bills in state legislatures that a coalition of more than a dozen gas-related organizations are fighting because they “present threats to the industry involving electrification/decarbonization”, according to one document from the National Propane Gas Association. In a presentation in June, an official with the American Public Gas Association (APGA) said the group would “continue to monitor and engage” with legislation as appropriate. APGA is funded with public money from the cities whose municipal gas utilities it represents. So, ironically, the industry fight against electrification is often being paid for in part by progressive cities. Members of APGA include utilities in cities pursuing climate action: San Antonio; Philadelphia; Tallahassee; Richmond, Virginia; and Palo Alto, California. Philadelphia wants to cut city emissions 80% by 2050, yet its utility paid hundreds of thousands of dollars over the past few years to gas trade groups, according to invoices obtained by the Climate Investigation Center records. Palo Alto has a climate goal that is even more ambitious than the state of California’s. It wants to slash greenhouse gases 80% by 2030. But its city utility paid APGA $20,902 last year, the Center found. “If you have a climate policy and you’re serious about that in your city, you need to pull out because they are working to undermine it every day,” said Matt Vespa, an attorney for Earthjustice in San Francisco. “You can’t fund a fossil fuel advocacy group and claim climate commitments.” APGA’s president, Dave Schryver, said the group was “a strong advocate for the key role its members and natural gas plays in a sustainable energy future”. He argued policy-driven electrification could increase annual energy costs by at least $750 per household, according to an analysis paid for by the industry. *** APGA has been fighting electrification since at least 2013 when it established a taskforce to “counter the regulatory and legislative threats to the direct use of natural gas”, according to an internal presentation obtained with a public records request by the center. This year, APGA is spending at least $127,000 on anti-electrification initiatives and $200,000 for media monitoring, engagement with reporters, letters to the editor, op-eds and social media efforts. It is also launching a $300,000 “gas genius” campaign to bolster public opinion of gas on social media. APGA declined to comment on its specific efforts. The other gas trade group – AGA – is paying Instagram influencers to popularize gas stoves with a #CookingWithGas campaign. AGA declined to disclose its spending on the campaign but said it would “continue to share recipes and ideas from a variety of chefs and people who like to cook at home as this content is interesting and well received”. The elimination of gas from buildings is just the first looming threat for the industry. To fight the climate crisis, the US will need to phase out the gas it burns for electricity and the petroleum it burns in cars – both of which are produced by the same industry. Carter said the industry needs to prepare for the US to move away from relying on fossil gas as a “bridge”. “Instead of continuing to build the bridge, which I think a lot of this new investment in infrastructure is about, we need to work to get off the bridge,” Carter said. “In order to create the net-zero carbon future we need to reach to deal with the climate crisis, it requires us to move away from fossil gas.”"
"Lakes and ponds are the final resting place for many of the Earth’s plants. Rivers collect much of the planet’s dead organic matter, transporting it to rest in calmer waters. But on a microscopic scale, lakes are anything but calm. An invisible metropolis of microbes feeds on these logs and leaves, producing greenhouse gases as a byproduct. As a result, lakes may be responsible for as much as a quarter of the carbon in the atmosphere – and rising. New research conducted with my colleagues in Cambridge, Germany and Canada suggests that emissions from freshwater lakes could double in the coming decades because of climate change. All known life on Earth is made of carbon. When plants and animals reach the end of their lives, microorganisms such as bacteria and fungi come to feast. They feed on the carbon-based remains of other organisms and their waste products — collectively known as organic matter. As a byproduct of this never-ending feast, microbes release gases such as carbon dioxide and methane into the environment. While each individual microbe releases a minuscule amount of gas, they are the most abundant organisms on Earth, so it adds up. Energy from sunlight can also break the chemical bonds between molecules of organic matter, releasing smaller molecules, such as carbon dioxide, into the environment. Some of this degradation happens on the forest floor. But much of the organic matter that falls to the ground ends up in the water. Winds, rain and snow transport it into lakes, or more often into the rivers that feed them. The amount of greenhouse gases released from lakes by microbes and sunlight is huge. Initial estimates were about 9% of the net carbon released from the Earth’s surface to the atmosphere – that is, the amount released over and above the Earth’s carbon-storing processes. But, thanks to improved measurements, recent research has revised the figure to as high as 25%. These numbers are substantial given that that lakes only comprise about 4% of the global land surface. In the coming years, lakes will receive more and more organic matter for microbes to digest. A warming climate will bring more forest cover around lakes and a greater proportion of broad-leaved trees, such as maples and oaks, as compared to needle-leaved trees, such as pines. To understand how changes to forests will alter the role that lakes play in the carbon cycle, we performed an experiment in two Canadian lakes. We filled plastic containers with rocks, sand, clay and different amounts and types of organic matter from nearby forests. This was intended to mimic the change in forest cover and composition expected from climate change. We then submerged the containers in shallow lake waters where organic matter is most likely to accumulate and monitored them for three years. Using new techniques to analyse the carbon chemistry of water, we found that those containers simulating a level of forest growth expected in the next few decades led to between 1.5 and 2.7 times more greenhouse gases in the water than conditions simulating today’s forest conditions. The invisible diversity of organic compounds in the water was the most important factor causing this rise – even more important than the diversity of microbes and the overall amount of organic matter. The likely explanation for this result is that the same microbes can feed on many different types of molecule. So as the number of carbon-based compounds in the water increases, there are more ways for microbes to feed and release greenhouse gases. The increase in diversity of organic matter alone was enough to raise greenhouse gas concentrations by about 50%. But the size of this effect nearly doubled in containers with darker overlying waters – a scenario expected in most lakes as climate change brings increased tree cover. Accurately tracing how carbon makes its journey from land to atmosphere is vital to predict the pace of climate change and mitigate its effects. By better understanding how the vegetation around lakes controls greenhouse gas concentrations in waters, our research can inform whether changing the way we manage land near lakes could help reduce carbon emissions. For example, we might want to plant fewer aquatic plants such as cattails in lakeside areas, because they produce much higher concentrations of greenhouse gases than organic matter from forests. Work also remains to understand fully the role lakes play in the carbon cycle. Not all organic matter that reaches lakes is digested by microbes. Some sinks to the lake floor to form muddy sediment, locking away carbon. The amount of sediment formed will also increase with climate change, but we don’t yet know by how much – and so to what degree this increase in stored carbon will offset the increased greenhouse gas emissions from lakes. Answering this question will be crucial in improving the accuracy of carbon accounts – and assessing how much time humanity has to balance them.

"People who directly depend on the natural world for their livelihoods, like farmers and fishers, will be among the greatest victims of the climate crisis. In vulnerable hotspots, such as the arid lands of Kenya and Ethiopia, farming communities are already struggling with droughts and water scarcity that kill their cattle and threaten their very survival. The glacial-fed river basins of the Himalayan mountains, or the deltas of Bangladesh, India and Ghana, are increasingly prone to floods, landslides and powerful cyclones. As a result, men are often migrating further to keep their families going, looking for casual work in neighbouring towns or villages for a few days or weeks at a time, or to cities further away. Many try to return home when they can, with whatever they have earned. But during their absence, the entire burden of maintaining the family is on women.

      COP24 climate talks had a 'people’s voice', but did anyone listen?


 Researchers are in a race against time to predict how climate change will affect these communities and help them adapt, with drought and flood resistant crops and cattle breeds for example. But it’s often overlooked that climate change will affect one half of humanity significantly more than the other. Longstanding gender inequality means that within regions of the world that are particularly vulnerable to climate change, women are likely to suffer more than men. In a recent study, we found that extreme weather and unpredictable seasons disproportionately weaken the agency of women to find well paid work and rise above rigid gender roles, even when these appear to be bending after decades of reform and activism. Without support in the form of assured drinking water, energy, childcare or credit, women end up working harder and in poorer conditions for lower wages. Women already in poverty are increasingly finding themselves in a vicious cycle of low productivity, indebtedness and food insecurity as crops and livestock fail, as we found particularly in semi-arid parts of Africa and India. Women in northern Kenya complained that they could no longer afford meat, so ate rice and potatoes instead, even when this wasn’t enough to satisfy their hunger.

 As environmental stresses accumulate, community support networks break down. When people are displaced and have to settle elsewhere, men search for work and women are left behind at home, often in unfamiliar surroundings and lacking support from friends and relatives. But even if they do know people, with all the challenges of running the household in a strange environment, there is little time to help others.  With full responsibility for household chores, farming and caring for the children and elderly, women have less time to socialise or take part in community events, including meetings of the elected village government. If the state or charities can help, there’s often competition for securing those benefits. In Namibia, people tend to stick with their ethnic groups to guarantee access through collective effort, but this means that ethnic minorities in the region are often excluded. In Mali, heavier burdens are placed on women who are young and less educated. In India or Pakistan, women belonging to a lower social class or marginal caste suffer the most. Gender relations differ in each place and according to each situation – they’re often too variable to emerge in broad national and global assessments. We tried to find a way to generalise our findings across 25 very diverse locations, in Asia and Africa, without losing the nuance of each woman’s experiences. If much of the problem is structural, then short-term solutions like cyclone shelters or drought relief won’t address the underlying causes of poverty and precariousness. Social safety nets that can ensure the basic necessities of food and shelter are needed, like the public distribution system for cereals in India, or the pensions and social grants available in Namibia.  To ensure that the health of people in these places doesn’t irreversibly decline, women need to be supported with child and healthcare services, but also drinking water and cooking fuel. The role of community support is crucial during crises, but there’s little that women can do to help themselves without resources and skills.  Competitive labour markets are also undervaluing the labour of poor women. Ensuring minimum wages and fair working conditions would help, but these are hard to implement across borders. As climate change causes traditional livelihoods to collapse, migrant men are similarly exploited by new employers. Deprived of adequate food and rest, many end up sick and spend their earnings on medical treatment.

 Tackling the climate emergency and making sure these women and men live meaningful lives will take more than overcoming gender stereotypes. If given support, they can find creative solutions to the disruption that climate change has brought. But this support must mean the guarantee of universal access to food, shelter and basic services. At COP25 in Madrid, world leaders should help vulnerable communities to adapt to climate change with resources and solidarity, not warm words and rhetoric.

I can think of very few events in life that would be more painful than having to bury your own child (or children) and with that in mind, I offer my sincerest and heartfelt condolences to **Jason Alexander** in Christchurch, who lost both of his daughters, aged 15 and 17, to a horrible, fiery car crash on Christchurch’s Port Hills.



“Teenagers Tayla Alexander, 17, and her sister Sunmara Alexander, 15 at the time, were in a car reportedly driven by a 19-year-old man, when it crashed in the Port Hills about 11pm on November 27.”



I can also appreciate the sentiments expressed by Mr Alexander that he doesn’t want to see any other parent go through the nightmare he has had to face.



“Alexander presented a petition, signed by 6400 people, to the council calling for more sturdy barriers along Summit Rd. 



Alexander also wants the road closed on weekend nights to prevent “needless racing or speeding” around the hills.” 



Alexander said he was not doing this only as a grieving father. “I am doing this because unfortunately our younger generation are using this road as a place to burn rubber at the top and then race down the bottom with undoubtedly bald tyres and it’s not just a few, it’s many. 



I am also doing this for the safety of everyone who uses this road, today tomorrow and in the future.” 



“The speed limit on the road from Godley Head to Gebbies Pass Rd was reduced last year from 70kmh and 100kmh, to 60kmh, but Alexander said it was clear the new limit was not being enforced.”



According to the “Stuffed” report, Christchurch Mayor **Lianne Dalziel** has told the grieving father that the council will do all it can to help in his quest to make Summit Rd safer.



I have a great deal of sympathy for Mr Alexander and the well-meaning 6400 people who signed his petition. Mayor Dalziel? Not so much.



Saying that the council will do all it can to make Summit Road safer is just nonsense. You don’t have a magic wand Ms Dalziel and where does your fairy tale nonsense begin and end. Whatever interventions you can deliver will only move the problem, not solve it. Today Summit Road. Tomorrow – what will it be? Will council do “all it can” to make motorways safer? Will council do “all it can” to make ALL Christchurch suburban streets safer? Will you also deal with natural disasters? Oh, and of course climate change?



There’s no silver bullet and it’s wrong to suggest improved barriers, closing roads, reducing limits or other interventions will do anything more than make the proponents feel better and move the problem elsewhere.



Stationary vehicles don’t have crashes. Is that where we’re headed?



Youngsters see themselves as bullet proof. It’s part of growing up. We did it when we were younger. Despite all the obstacles we’ve tried to put in place, they’re still doing it. We can’t keep them off the monkey bars, the swings or the seesaws. We do the best we can to guide them but they will do their own thing in their own way and in their own time. Sometimes they will make mistakes. Sometimes those mistakes will be tragic. That, sadly, is how life is.

Despite our geographical and cultural proximity, it’s always instructive to realise just how little most Australians really know about New Zealand politics. I must include myself in this: prior to becoming part of the _BFD_ family, I knew barely anything beyond the names of a few prime ministers and that there was some bloke called **Winston Peters** who seemed to grab a lot of headlines. 



Even those Australians whom it might be thought have a professional obligation to cultivate an in-depth understanding of New Zealand politics often seem to have a curious facile grasp. But, while _The Project_ ’s fawning over **Jacinda Ardern** was uninformed and nauseating, even the supposedly conservative newspaper of record, _The Australian_ , looks across the Tasman through a rose-tinted Telescope of Superficiality. Nowhere is this better shown than by its analysis of what it supposes are the key issues in New Zealand’s forthcoming election.



In Jacinda Ardern, New Zealand has a modern, likeable, capable prime minister. Her effort to soothe a hurting nation following the March 15 terrorist attack was authentic and appreciated by the nation […]The alternative prime minister, **Simon Bridges** , regularly paints Ardern as a ditherer, as all compassion and no action, and incapable of landing major policies. So far it isn’t working…



While the above is mostly accurate, insofar as it goes, it almost completely ignores the most glaring issue: not Ardern, but Bridges himself. Ardern is a paper princess: the slightest puff of wind from a determined opposition leader with an ounce of political mongrel would see her vanish in a puff of fairy dust. But Bridges is neither.



 **Julia Gillard** was as beloved by the media-elite class as Ardern, but **Tony Abbott** ruthlessly demolished her prime ministership.



National’s most effective line of attack on Labour has been on infrastructure. Ardern’s government has abandoned a pledge to build 100,000 homes in 10 years – known as Kiwbuild – after falling embarrassingly short of targets. Roads and transport links, particularly in Auckland, fall well below expectations […] Labour’s counter, a trite “nine years of neglect” referring to the previous government, doesn’t bite, but a $NZ12 billion ($A11.6 billion) infrastructure announcement in January aims to address this.



Again, while kinda-sorta correct, this fails to convey **just how embarrassingly bad Labour in government have been**. Kiwibuild was not just “embarrassing”, it was farcical. Auckland’s roads are choked car-parks. Labour’s performance has been so abysmal that even the starry-eyed legacy media couldn’t avoid pointing out the lie of Ardern’s[ “Year of Delivery”](https://thebfd.co.nz/2019/07/jacindas-year-of-delivery/). Does anyone seriously believe that the new infrastructure announcement will be any different?



Fiscally and economically, New Zealand is in rude health […] but many Kiwis are being left behind […]The government has tinkered with family support and tax settings rather than increasing welfare despite calls to do so.



As with infrastructure, this completely ignores just how big an issue this is – or at least, should be – for Labour, and Ardern especially. **Ardern owns this problem: she specifically appointed herself “Minister for Child Poverty Reduction”. She has conspicuously failed.** There is simply no excuse for the media, even in Australia, not to take notice and hang that millstone around her neck for all to see.



At least _The Australian_ is informed enough to mention Winston Peters. Most Australian media barely even seem to know that he exists, let alone what he could mean to the election.



Peters loves to take centrestage and antagonise […] But polling isn’t good for Peters’ populists; they need to poll above five per cent to retain their numbers in parliament and they are skirting dangerously close to that figure. So expect some vintage Winston this year.



Now we come to the truly ridiculous, though:



The level-headedness of New Zealand’s climate politics is quite apart from Australia.



Clearly, this journalist has never paid attention to the witterings of Ardern, or the shrill hysterics of her coalition partners, the Greens.



This analysis also completely ignores what will surely be an issue for many New Zealanders: the gun buyback and its [associated failures](https://thebfd.co.nz/2020/01/breaking-the-raids-have-begun-all-for-a-22-bunny-gun/) of police, government and the rule of law.

"**Two people are in critical condition after another day of violent demonstrations in Hong Kong.**
A protester was injured on Monday morning when he was shot at close range by a police officer.
He was the third person shot by police since the protests began 24 weeks ago.
Later on Monday a pro-Beijing supporter was doused in flammable liquid and set alight after arguing with protesters, who are demanding greater democracy and police accountability in Hong Kong.
The territory's Chief Executive Carrie Lam, speaking at a news conference on Monday evening, called the demonstrators enemies of the people.
""If there's still any wishful thinking that by escalating violence, the Hong Kong government will yield to pressure, to satisfy the so-called political demands, I'm making this statement clear and loud here: that will not happen,"" she said.
There were clashes across Hong Kong on Monday between protesters and police, who fired rubber bullets and tear gas. At one point, tear gas was fired in the central business district - a rare occurrence during working hours on a weekday.
The violence also prompted a warning from a senior Chinese newspaper editor at a tabloid published by the state-owned People's Daily.
Addressing Hong Kong police, Hu Xijin wrote: ""You have the backing of not only the Hong Kong and Chinese people, but also Chinese soldiers and the People's Liberation Army in Hong Kong,"" Reuters news agency reported. ""They can go into Hong Kong to provide support at any time.""
Monday's violence followed a weekend of vigils and protests after a 22-year-old student protester died on Friday. Alex Chow had been in hospital since he fell from the ledge of a car park during a police operation a week ago.
The protests started in June against a now-withdrawn plan to allow extradition to mainland China, but have since morphed into wider demonstrations.
The shooting occurred as protesters tried to block a junction at Sai Wan Ho on the north-east of Hong Kong Island. Police confirmed that one officer ""discharged his service revolver"" and that a man was shot.
Footage posted on Facebook showed the officer drawing his gun before grappling with a man at a roadblock. When another man approached wearing a face mask, the officer fired at him, hitting him in the torso. The officer fired twice more, but there were no injuries.
After the shooting, footage showed the 21-year old protester lying with his eyes wide open and with blood around him.
He has undergone surgery and remains in a critical condition, a Hospital Authority spokesman told the BBC.
The police said officers also drew firearms from their holsters in two other places.
But they denied what they called ""totally false and malicious"" reports that officers were ordered to ""recklessly use their firearms"" in Monday's operations.
It was the third time a police officer had shot someone with live rounds. The first incident was during protests on 1 October when China was celebrating 70 years of communist rule. The second case was a teenage boy shot in the leg on 4 October.
**Stephen McDonell, BBC China correspondent, at the scene**
The pedestrian crossing in Sai Wan Ho, where the young protester was shot, has become a site of considerable tension.
Activists have built barricades across the junction - and when riot police come they face a torrent of abuse from bystanders of all ages.
Blood can still be seen on the street - and next to it graffiti reading ""we shall never surrender"".
Each time the riot police leave, the demonstrators return to erect their barricades again.
Hong Kong's political crisis - now in its fifth month - continues to become more violent.
The unnamed man was doused in a flammable liquid after getting into a dispute with protesters in Ma On Shan, about 20km (12 miles) north of the business district. It is unclear what started the argument, news agency AFP reported.
Video being shared online shows the man, who is wearing green, tell the protesters ""none of you are Chinese"". The protesters respond by telling him to ""go back to the Greater Bay Area"", which is a part of the Chinese mainland across the border from Hong Kong.
The man was then set alight in what Chief Supt John Tse said was the ""most shocking incident"".
""The man is now admitted to hospital in critical condition and the case is under investigation by the regional crime unit of New Territories South,"" he told reporters.
Most protests have taken place at weekends, but pro-democracy activists have called out all workers for a general strike on Monday.
Other incidents have included:
Police described the activists as ""radical protesters"", conducting ""extensive illegal acts"" and urged them to stop any actions that threatened safety and obstructed the police.
Several universities have cancelled their classes for the day.
Hong Kong is part of China but as a former British colony it has some autonomy and people have more rights.
The protests started in June against plans to allow extradition to the mainland - which many feared would undermine the city's freedoms.
The bill was withdrawn in September but demonstrations continued and now call for full democracy and an inquiry into police behaviour.
Clashes between police and activists have become increasingly violent and in October the city banned all face masks.

Share this...FacebookTwitterRenowned climate scientist Prof. Mojib Latif used to often appears on television, radio and speeches all over Germany to spread the word of an impending human-made climate catastrophe.
Hat-tip Dr. Sebastian Lüning and Prof. Fritz Vahrenholt
One of the highlights of Latif’s many appearances was the CO2 “fingerprint” in the atmosphere, which according to Latif is supposed to confirm the greenhouse effect. Up in the stratosphere it is supposed to cool because heat would be trapped by CO2 in the troposphere below. This of course always impressed his gullible audiences.
Profound reversal
However, it now appears that the distinguished German scientist is now changing his mind profoundly. In a recent press release he and his fellow co-scientists in Kiel, Germany, conceded that the cooling is likely more a part of the 60-year PDO ocean cycle.
What follows is the press release from the Kiel-based Geomar research institute dated 26 July 2016:

Middle atmosphere in sync with the ocean
Relationship between decadal variations in temperatures in the Pacific and the tropopause identified.
26 July 2016/Kiel. In the late 20th century scientists observed a cooling at the transition between the troposphere and stratosphere at an altitude of about 15 kilometers. They believed this development in the so-called tropopause was caused by human influences. Climate scientists from Kiel and Bergen (Norway) have now published a study in the international journal Scientific Reports showing that the cooling could also be part of a natural decadal variation which is controlled by the water temperature of the Pacific.
Water plays a major role for our planet not only in its liquid form at the surface. In the atmosphere too, it considerably affects our lives as well as weather and climate. Clouds and rainfall are one example. Water vapor, the gaseous form of water, also plays a prominent role on Earth. It is the most important greenhouse gas in the atmosphere, without it the Earth would be a frozen planet. For climate variations, water vapor is particularly important in the stratosphere at altitudes between 15 and 50 kilometers. How much of the gas actually reaches the stratosphere mainly depends on the temperature at the transition between the lowest atmospheric layer, the troposphere, and the overlying stratosphere. This boundary layer is called the tropopause.

 Now scientists of the GEOMAR Helmholtz Centre for Ocean Research Kiel, together with a colleague from Bergen (Norway), were able to demonstrate for the first time that natural fluctuations in water temperatures of the Pacific – which occur on decadal timescales – are directly related to the temperature of the tropical tropopause. “It has long been thought that human influences already affected the tropopause. However, it seems that natural variability is still the dominating factor,” says Dr. Wuke Wang from GEOMAR, lead author of the study just published in the international journal Scientific Reports.
For their study, the researchers used observations for the period 1979-2013 and also climate models. “We were thus able to extend the study period to nearly 150 years. The model allows us to easily look at both human and natural influences and to separate their impacts from each other,” explains Prof. Dr. Katja Matthes, climate researcher at GEOMAR and co-author of the study.
A well-known climatic phenomenon is the so-called Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO). “This natural variation with decadal timescale leads to anomalously high or low water temperatures of the Pacific,” explained Dr. Wang. The PDO influences the climate and ecosystems in the Pacific region and also the global mean temperature of the Earth.
The model simulations show that the fluctuations in water temperatures also affect the wind systems over the tropical and subtropical Pacific. This in turn also alters the air transport between the lower and upper layers of the troposphere, ultimately regulating the temperatures at the boundary to the stratosphere. “We were now able to demonstrate these relationships for the first time,” said Dr. Wang.
Thus, the current study contradicts earlier hypotheses about the temperature variability of the tropical tropopause. As early as in the late 20th century, scientists had seen a cooling trend there which began in the 1970s. They traced this observation back to anthropogenic causes, in particular the increase in greenhouse gases. “However, this assumption was based on a rather patchy data base and simplified climate models. Our study shows that the cooling of the tropical tropopause does not have to be a one-way street but could also be part of a natural fluctuation which extends over several decades,” Professor Matthes emphasized.
This knowledge is also of paramount importance for the general climate research. The temperature of the tropopause decides on the input of water vapor into the stratosphere: The higher the water vapor content in the stratosphere, the higher the increase in surface temperatures. Anthropogenic climate change also has an effect on the temperature of the tropopause, and this effect could become more evident in the coming decades. “Only if we can clearly distinguish natural variability from anthropogenic influences, we can make reliable forecasts for the future development of our climate,” Prof. Matthes summarizes.

"In the near future, global warming is expected to create millions of climate refugees, and individuals and organisations are already searching for ways to help them. Some ideas are obvious, such as improving conditions in refugee camps. But there are also more high-tech projects such as using algorithms to forecast where displaced people will travel to. Such forecasts are crucial. They can help support organisations prepare in the right places, they can evaluate current policy (by assessing a counterfactual “what if” scenario) and they can also help predict refugee populations in remote or dangerous areas where there is little empirical data. So we can predict where climate refugees will go, right? No. Despite bold and excitable claims that refugee forecasting is largely resolved, we are not convinced. As computer scientists who work on this exact problem, such claims seem like a painful example of running before we can walk.  Almost four years ago, we started to research how people fled from armed conflicts. Many people were displaced due to the Arab Spring and the Syrian War, but little work had been done to predict where they could end up.  With our colleague David Bell, we created a tool that could help, and published our work in Nature Scientific Reports. Our tool represents every person as an independent agent, and then uses simple rules-of-thumb derived from scientific insights – for instance “people tend to avoid travelling through mountains when it is raining” – to determine when they will move next, and to where. This is different from “machine learning” approaches, which use historical data to “train” the algorithm to generate rules and thus predictions. So, for example, machine learning might be given this sort of data: “the number of people that arrived in a refugee camp close to a mountainous area in a conflict that occurred perhaps many years ago, or more recently but in a different country.” The main issue is that historical data used for machine learning is always quantitative, and never is about the conflict that the simulation is directly developed for. To see how our method worked in practice, we tested our tool against UNHCR data from three recent conflicts in Burundi, the Central African Republic and Mali. Our tool correctly predicted where more than 75% of the refugees would go. We have since applied our analysis to refugees fleeing conflict in South Sudan, as part of the HiDALGO project. In this study, forthcoming in the Journal of Artificial Societies and Social Simulation, we also looked at how policy decisions like border closures affected the movement of refugees into neighbouring countries, such as Ethiopia or Uganda.  We found there was indeed a link – closing the Uganda border in our model causes 40% fewer “agents” to arrive in camps after 300 days, and that effect lingers even after we reopened the border on day 301. Our tool correctly predicted where 75% of the refugees would actually go in real life. But doing a correct “retrodiction” in these historical cases does not mean that you can do a forecast. Forecasting where people will go is much harder than predicting a historical situation, for three reasons. Every model makes assumptions. For instance, a model that forecasts where refugees go might makes assumptions about their mode of transport, or the likelihood that they stay overnight in a place where violence has previously occurred. When forecasting, we need to know what happens when we give these assumptions a little shake (we examine this in the VECMA project). The less evidence we have for an assumption, the more we need to shake it and analyse how our model responds. Machine learning models generate implicit (and ill-justified) assumptions automatically when they are trained – for example, chosen destinations correlate with the stock value of company X. In agent-based models, these assumptions come from physical factors like the presence of mountains or armed groups, and are explicitly testable.  Forecasting one thing requires you to forecast many other things as well. When we forecast how people escape conflict, we must forecast how the conflict will evolve. And that could depend on future market prices, weather/climate effects, or political changes, all of which would need forecasting too. To be clear: we did not require any of these models when we validated our predictions against a historical situation, so we are building new models just to make forecasts possible. Forcibly displaced people are usually fleeing from unexpected and disruptive events. Here the data upon which the machine learning algorithms are “trained” is incomplete, biased or often non-existent. We argue that agent-based models are more effective because they do not need training data, and benefit from understanding the processes that drive forced displacement. So we have not cracked it. Yes, forecasting is hard. We do not yet know where climate refugees and other forcibly displaced people are going. We still need huge supercomputers just to forecast next week’s weather.  So it pays to be suspicious of the idea that refugee forecasting is already solved, especially if linked to claims that the “next frontier” for computer scientists is in (controversially) extracting data from vulnerable refugees who are often unaware of the privacy and security risks. Given how hard it remains to predict where the millions of climate refugees will go, the “next frontier” is still the last frontier."

Share this...FacebookTwitterA climate scientist brought my attention to a recent article reporting how one site has identified 13 beers that are climatically and environmentally correct to drink. I’m pretty sure his main objective was to show just how nutty the movement has become.
Photo: Public domain.
So I thought readers here might enjoy finding out how the climate trend has even swept over parts of the US beer industry: Drinking responsibly now also includes drinking to protect the environment!
Such rubbish.
Personally in Germany I really do admire the beer culture they have long developed here over the centuries. Many beers are still brewed according to the German Purity Law of 1516 (Happy Birthday, by the way!). What’s even better is that Central Europe qualifies as a true paradise for beer fans and connoisseurs, offering a great selection, premium quality and at prices which are in fact very low relative to other countries. For example a case of 24 glass bottles (0.33 l) of great quality beer can be easily picked up for about 10 euros (11 dollars) in Germany – and even less in the Czech Republic – and packaged in real, heavy dark glass bottles! Compare that to prices in Scandinavia or even the USA.
Now it appears that the the target of brewing beer has, for some breweries at least, strayed, going from producing a premium quality brew to making one that purports to protect the global climate, and so possibly sacrificing quality for the sake of an illusion. This is not serious business. It’s a marketing gimmick. I’d never drink such beer.
The brand of beer I drink depends solely on whether the taste suits me, and not if it’s organic, green, politically correct, or for saving some rainforest somewhere. To enjoy a beer, it has to be of good quality, on draught, put in a proper glass, be at the right temperature, with a have head of foam, fulfill the Purity Law, and especially be enjoyed in good company. See more here.
So have an uncompromised beer. Cheers!

"**China's state broadcaster has scrapped plans to show two US NBA basketball pre-season exhibition games, as the row over a team executive's tweet in support of Hong Kong protesters grows.**
Houston Rockets boss Daryl Morey apologised after his tweet, from which the club and NBA distanced themselves.
In response, Chinese broadcasters said they would stop showing Rockets games.
But now China Central Television says it will ""immediately suspend"" plans to show the LA Lakers-Brooklyn Nets games.
""We believe that any comments that challenge national sovereignty and social stability are not within the scope of freedom of speech,"" the station said on its social media account.
It added that as well not showing the pre-season matches it would ""immediately investigate all co-operation and communication involving the NBA"".
The matches are due to take place in Shanghai on Thursday and Shenzhen on Saturday.
Meanwhile, a publicity event at a Shanghai primary school, at which Nets players and executives were set to appear on Tuesday afternoon, was cancelled two hours before its scheduled start. No explanation was given for the cancellation.
In a statement on Monday, the NBA described Mr Morey's comments as ""regrettable"" and acknowledged he had ""deeply offended many of our friends and fans in China"".
It added: ""We have great respect for the history and culture of China and hope that sports and the NBA can be used as a unifying force.""
However, on Tuesday NBA commissioner Adam Silver appeared to back the Houston coach. He told a Chinese news agency that his organisation wanted to make it clear that ""Daryl Morey is supported in terms of his ability to exercise his freedom of expression"".
Mr Silver added: ""I accept that it is also Chinese government's and Chinese businesses' right to react to those words and, at least from my long-time experience in the NBA, it will take some time to heal some of these issues.""
In response to criticism of the NBA's initial response to the incident, Mr Silver added in a statement: ""I recognise our initial statement left people angered, confused or unclear on who we are or what the NBA stands for.
""Over the last three decades, the NBA has developed a great affinity for the people of China. We have seen how basketball can be an important form of people-to-people exchange that deepens ties between the United States and China.
""It is inevitable that people around the world - including from America and China - will have different viewpoints over different issues. It is not the role of the NBA to adjudicate those differences.
""However, the NBA will not put itself in a position of regulating what players, employees and team owners say or will not say on these issues. We simply could not operate that way.""
NBA games draw huge numbers of viewers in China, with millions watching games primarily through streaming platforms. In May this year, the NBA opened its largest store outside North America in Beijing.
The new NBA season starts on 22 October."

While this section will feature all of the areas of interest that we are emphasizing, the prominence of the climate issue is driving a tremendous amount of web traffic. Here we post a few of the best in recent days, along with our color commentary._   
  
__



  
  
Over the past couple of days, several articles have caught our eyes that we thought worthy of a mention in these pages.   
  
First up is a pair of papers, one by Swiss researcher Peter Landschützer and colleagues and the other by a team led by University of Colorado’s David Munro, that examined trends in the rate of carbon dioxide uptake in the Southern Ocean. In each case, the authors report that carbon uptake has been increasing there during the 21st century. This is good news.   
  
Carbon dioxide uptake is basically the opposite of carbon dioxide emissions. As emissions increase and the atmospheric concentration grows, this puts a pressure on some carbon sinks to expand—notably the standing biomass of vegetation (through carbon fertilization) and the carbon content in the oceans (through Henry’s Law). In fact, the proportion of human carbon dioxide emissions that are being taken up by carbon sinks has been pretty constant for the past 150 years—meaning the sinks are expanding to offset a significant portion of our growing emissions.   
  
Even though the behavior found in the new research paper is confirming expectations, it is worth highlighting in that over the past couple of years several papers were published and subsequently rose to prominence suggesting that the rate of carbon dioxide uptake by the Southern Ocean was slowing down and this was an indication that the carbon sink there was saturating. This had some segments of the climate alarmosphere in a tizzy (google “ocean carbon sink saturating” for some examples). The worry spiral went like this: CO2 emissions were leading to climate changes that were leading to less carbon update by the oceans which was leading to more CO2 in the atmosphere which was leading to more climate change which… you get the point. Uncontrolled positive feedback.   
  
The new findings pretty much stamp out this overheated concern.   
  
From Landschützer et al.:   




Several studies have suggested that the carbon sink in the Southern Ocean—the ocean’s strongest region for the uptake of anthropogenic CO2—has weakened in recent decades. We demonstrated, on the basis of multidecadal analyses of surface ocean CO2 observations, that this weakening trend stopped around 2002, and by 2012 the Southern Ocean had regained its expected strength based on the growth of atmospheric CO2.



And from Munro et al:   




Overall, [our results are] suggesting that the Southern Ocean is playing an ever-increasing role in taking up atmospheric CO2.



So it seems that the apparent slowdown in the rate of carbon dioxide uptake in the Southern Ocean was most likely just a passing blip in what is natural variability—the level of which was previously underestimated. No cause for alarm.   
  
Next up is a new paper by hurricane forecasters/researchers Phil Klotzbach, Bill Gray and Chris Fogarty examining the trends and natural variability in a key indicator of Atlantic hurricane behavior. The Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation, or AMO, has long been identified as a dominant influence on the frequency of hurricanes that form in the Atlantic Ocean. As its name suggests, the AMO “oscillates” back and forth between its positive and negative states with a time period of several decades. The AMO had been in a “positive” state—one that is conducive for hurricane development--since 1995. In their new paper, Klotzbach and colleagues present evidence that the AMO may have recently switched to a “negative” state—one that tends to hinder hurricane development. This would explain the dearth of hurricanes in the Atlantic Ocean for the past couple of years and would suggest that we are entering a prolonged period of below average activity.   
  
Klotzbach goes into the details of what they found in a great article hosted by _Washington Post_ ’s Capital Weather Gang. That article begins:   




Floyd, Katrina, Wilma, Ike and Sandy — just a few of the devastating hurricanes we’ve seen in the years since 1995. It’s been an astonishingly active hurricane period of the Atlantic Ocean, costing the U.S. over $500 billion in damages. But there’s evidence to suggest that the painfully memorable, two-decade era that brought some of the most intense hurricanes on record — and some the most active hurricane seasons — is coming to a close.



Not everyone is sold on the idea that the AMO is a real phenomenon and/or that it exerts a major influence on Atlantic hurricane activity. For example, is association with the extremely active hurricane seasons of 2004 and 2005, several research papers were published and subsequently rose to great prominence, that suggested that rising sea surface temperatures caused by human greenhouse gas emissions were the cause of the observed upswing of hurricane activity—with things only to get worse in the future. The subsequent downturn of hurricane activity, including the on-going (and expanding) record period of time between major hurricane landfalls in the U.S. (which is fast approaching 10 years) has vindicated the AMO and those researchers, like Klotzbach and Gray, who have identified its influence (although there are still some holdouts, as MIT’s Kerry Emanuel, who told AP reporter Seth Borenstein in regards to the new study “I think they're pretty much wrong about this”).   
  
Klotzbach says that time will tell for certain.   
  
And finally, we come across what we think has to be the most unusual suggestions as to how to handle the climate change issue—ask aliens.   
  
Apparently there is something called the Breakthrough Message contest in which a million dollars in prizes will be awarded for “messages that could be read by an advanced civilization.” The Breakthrough Message sponsors want to “encourage debate about how and what to communicate with possible intelligent beings beyond earth.”   
  
In response to the contest, a group of U.K. researchers dedicated to the search for extraterrestrial intelligence (SETI) have decided to submit an entry. They have yet to agree on what their message will contain, but the group’s spokesman told the BCC:   




“[We] also know that our own civilisation is in a fair bit of trouble. We face some pretty big threats. That means it might be a good idea to gamble, and hope there is someone slightly older and wiser out there. If aliens told us something about how to handle our climate, or artificial intelligence, we might want to listen.""



We resist any comparison to the Papal Encyclical.

We sign in this week with a look at how this year’s global temperature is evolving as the big Pacific El Niño begins to wane. The temporary rise in global temperature that accompanies El Niño events is timed differently at the surface than it is in the lower atmosphere. Thus, while El Niño-boosted warmth led to a record high value in the 2015 global average _surface_ temperature record, it did not fully manifest itself in the lower atmosphere (where the 2015 temperatures remained well below record levels).   




But now that warmth is being fully felt aloft. The figure below is the satellite-measured global average temperature history of the lower atmosphere as compiled from the University of Alabama-Huntsville (UAH). The El Niño-spiked temperatures are clearly obvious in the first four months of 2016 (the rightmost points in the graph).   






_Figure 1. Global average satellite-based temperatures of the lower atmosphere from January 1979 through April 2016, as compiled by researchers at the University of Alabama-Huntsville._



Dr. Roy Spencer, who along with Dr. John Christy, curates the UAH satellite temperature record, has this to say on his blog regarding what to expect for the rest of the year and how the 2016 annual temperatures may ultimately rank:   




I expect average cooling to continue throughout the year as El Nino weakens and is replaced with La Nina, now expected by mid-summer or early fall. Nevertheless, 2016 could still end up as a record warm year in the satellite record…it all depends upon how fast the warmth from the El Nino dissipates and La Nina sets in.



Early indications are also that global average surface temperature are continuing to feel the effect of the big, but dying, El Niño, and remain elevated into record territory.   
  
So, it won’t be too surprising to be reading headlines the end of the year screaming “2016 Hottest Year Ever”—but it’s probably too much to hope that the authors of the underlying story correctly attribute the cause. But, we’re sure their memory will be jogged, and they’ll be full of excuses, when the La Nina cooling sets in and post-El Nino temperatures drop below record levels in 2017 (and likely many years thereafter).   
  
Next up is a quick look at the updated numbers from the United Nations in regards to just how much global greenhouse gas emissions will be impacted if all nations of the world abide by the emissions reductions scheduled promised in their Intended Nationally Determined Contributions (INDC) that they submitted under the Paris Climate Agreement. There is only a slim possibility that these schedules will be adhered to—for instance, in the U.S., all indications are that we overpromised. Unkept promises aside, the U.N. reports that total global emissions of greenhouse gases will be 55.0 Gt (Metric gigatons) CO2eq (equivalent emissions scaling all greenhouse gas absorption to the value for carbon dioxide) in 2025 and 56.2 GtCO2eq in 2030.   
  
In the figure below, we superimpose those expectations on the U.N.’s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) depictions of business-as-usual (“baseline”) projections described by the IPCC as “projections of GHG [greenhouse gas] emissions and their key drivers as they might evolve in a future in which no explicit actions are taken to reduce GHG emissions.” It should be clear from this graph, that, as we have been fond of saying all along, the sum total of all the INDCs under the Paris Climate Agreement amounts to little more than business-as-usual expectations. But now, to make it look like everyone is “doing something” about climate change, the expected evolution of economic systems is being rebranded as “climate action.” Maybe that makes everyone feel better. In reality, only the US and the EU have proposed significant (and significantly expensive) reductions.

Next we turn to an enlightening piece by a team of analysts at the Mercatus Center at George Mason University examining the cumulative cost of government regulations—and it isn’t pretty. They calculate that that federal regulations retard economic growth in the U.S. by about 0.8% per year—or to the tune of a GDP that is $4 trillion less in 2012 than it would have been absent new regulation imposed since 1980, adding that “[i]f the cost of regulatory accumulation were a country, it could have the 4th largest GDP in the world.” Here is an excerpt from the summary:   




Using a 22-industry dataset that covers 1977 through 2012, the study finds that regulation—by distorting the investment choices that lead to innovation—has created a considerable drag on the economy, amounting to an average reduction in the annual growth rate of the US gross domestic product (GDP) of 0.8 percent.   
  
Federal regulations have accumulated over many decades, piling up over time. When regulators add more rules to the pile, analysts often consider the likely benefits and compliance costs of the additional rules.   
  
But regulations have a greater effect on the economy than analysis of a single rule in isolation can convey. The buildup of regulations over time leads to duplicative, obsolete, conflicting, and even contradictory rules, and the multiplicity of regulatory constraints complicates and distorts the decision-making processes of firms operating in the economy. Firms respond to both individual regulations and regulatory accumulation by altering their plans for research and development, for expansion, and for updating equipment and processes. Because of the important role innovation and productivity growth play in an economy, these distortions have consequences for the growth of the economy in the long run.   
  
Economic growth in the United States has, on average, been slowed by 0.8 percent per year since 1980 owing to the cumulative effects of regulation:   
  
● If regulation had been held constant at levels observed in 1980, the US economy would have been about 25 percent larger than it actually was as of 2012.   
  
● This means that in 2012, the economy was $4 trillion smaller than it would have been in the absence of regulatory growth since 1980.   
  
● This amounts to a loss of approximately $13,000 per capita, a significant amount of money for most American workers.



The gory details are provided in the full report authored by Bentley Coffey, Patrick A. McLaughlin, and Pietro Peretto.   
  
And, finally, before signing off, we want to make sure that if you are looking for _rational_ looks at the allegations of climate change-driven catastrophes in the news this week, you’ll know where to find them. Here is a good story from the A Chemist in Langley blog that throws water on the claims that anthropogenic climate change is behind Canada’s Ft. McMurray fire, and here’s some good background from the New Orleans Geological Society on the myriad of non-climate forces behind the drowning Isle de Jean Charles (telling the story that the _New York Times_ didn’t).

Guest essay by Eric Worrall
Entrepreneur Bill Gates has announced a one billion dollar green tech fund, to try to make renewables fit for purpose.
According to the Sydney Morning Herald;
If successful, the Paris meeting could spur a fundamental shift away from the use of oil, coal and gas to the use of renewable energy sources such as wind and solar power. But that transition would require major breakthroughs in technology and huge infrastructure investments by governments and industry.
Where that money would come from has been a question leading up to the Paris talks. Developing countries like India, the third-largest fossil-fuel polluter, have pushed for commitments by developed nations to pay for their energy transition, either through direct government spending or through inexpensive access to new technology.
India has emerged as a pivotal player in the Paris talks. The announcement by Mr Gates appears intended to help secure India’s support of a deal.
As US secretary of state, Hillary Clinton pledged that developed countries would send $US100 billion ($139 billion) annually to poor countries by 2020 to help them pay for the energy transition. Indian officials have demanded that the Paris deal lock in language that the money would come from public funds — a dealbreaker for rich countries.
This summer, Mr Gates pledged to spend $US 1 billion of his personal fortune on researching and deploying clean energy technology, but the people with knowledge of his plans said the new fund would include larger commitments.

This isn’t the first time a project to make renewables viable has been attempted. Back in 2014, WUWT reported about a similar attempt led by Google, which was a total failure.
At the start of RE<C, we had shared the attitude of many stalwart environmentalists: We felt that with steady improvements to today’s renewable energy technologies, our society could stave off catastrophic climate change. We now know that to be a false hope … Renewable energy technologies simply won’t work; we need a fundamentally different approach.”

I applaud Bill’s enthusiasm – who wouldn’t want cheap magic solar panels, which eliminated the need to ever pay another electricity bill. But if the Google experience is any guide, it seems unlikely that another billion dollars will make a significant difference.

"Approximately 60% of Antarctica’s ice shelves could be vulnerable to fracture, accelerating the loss of the Antarctic ice sheet and increasing sea-level rise, according to a paper. Antarctica’s ice shelves, floating extensions of the ice sheet, help slow the flow of ice into the ocean. But if these shelves fracture and then collapse, the flow of melting glaciers into the oceans accelerates.  A study published in the journal Nature has mapped areas where ice shelves hold back upstream ice and are susceptible to “hydrofracture”, where meltwater flows into crevasses and fissures in the ice and enlarges them, potentially triggering the collapse of the ice shelf. This process could accelerate the loss of Antarctic ice more than some climatic models predict as atmospheric warming increases. The study follows scientists’ recent announcement that Earth has lost 28tn tonnes of ice from its surface since 1994. Most climatic models do not include the impact of hydrofracturing in their calculations, although one 2016 paper did account for them in a simpler way than the new study. Hydrofracturing can only occur if the surface of an ice shelf is inundated with meltwater. Large pools of meltwater have existed in many areas of Antarctica for decades without causing the collapse of an ice shelf because the flow of water into surface fissures is slow or refreezes. While some areas are not susceptible to fracture, Ching-Yao Lai of the Earth Institute at Columbia University and colleagues identified that 60% of the Antarctic ice shelf was both slowing the flow of ice into the ocean and also vulnerable to fracture. While fractures in the ice are visible in satellite imagery, manual mapping is impractical because of the extent of the ice. So Lai and colleagues used machine learning to identify fracture-like features in satellite pictures of Antarctica, before modelling which fractures were vulnerable to hydrofracturing. They developed a model to predict where fractures could form and found close agreement with the fractures mapped by their machine learning algorithm. Lai said: “We predicted that the ice-shelves areas that can collapse due to hydrofracture are mostly the crucial part of ice shelves that hold back the upstream flow of ice sheets. Thus the loss of these ice-shelf areas due to hydrofracture can substantially affect the flow of ice sheets into the ocean. “But predicting how much and how fast the loss of Antarctic ice and sea-level rise will occur due to the hydrofracturing process will require coupling our new fracture model with an ice-sheet and climate model, which is an important next step.” The researchers hope their fracture model can help create more accurate models of the fate of the ice sheets, which together with climatic modelling will produce more accurate predictions of sea-level rise, which scientists believe could exceed one metre by the century’s end. The researchers warned that while many areas of Antarctic meltwater were not currently likely to cause the hydrofracture of the ice beneath, with global heating these areas could become newly at risk in the future. “Increased meltwater ponding in resilient locations will not lead to widespread hydrofracturing according to our analysis,” the authors wrote. “However, predictions of future melt suggest that melt rates seen in locations that experience meltwater ponding today could become widespread by 2100 under high-emissions scenarios.”"

So, the Australian Greens have yet another fairy king trying on the party’s coveted golden clown shoes. When the party’s Oberon, **Bob Brown** , abdicated the toadstool throne, he was replaced by **Richard di Natale** , the ass-headed Nick Bottom of Australian politics. Eschewing the chance to show their progressive credentials and install a Titania as queen of the fairy parade, the party has opted for yet another white male, **Adam Bandt**.



Bandt was quick to show that he’s as far away with the fairies as the party faithful could desire.



New Greens leader Adam Bandt has stood by his accusations that Scott Morrison and big business are responsible for “killing people.”



After replacing Richard Di Natale on Tuesday, Mr Bandt said the Prime Minister’s climate change approach would lead to “three times as many deaths” as the 2019-20 bushfires.



Like all little pixies, Bandt pipes a merry tune about “science”, while demonstrating unequivocally that he doesn’t know science from fairy dust.



On Wednesday, the Greens leader said he was “just stating the science.”



“My point is that Scott Morrison, when he says that we are on track to meet our emissions targets, we are on track for more than three times as much warming as we’ve witnessed so far,” he told ABC News.



“And that means more than three times as much devastation.”



Almost none of that is remotely true. The only factual statement in Bandt’s farrago of nonsense is that PM Morrison – correctly – states that Australia is more than meeting the targets set by the **Paris Agreement**.



When Bandt excitedly babbles that “we are on track for more than three times as much warming”, he merely shows that he can’t comprehend the difference between a fairy tale and a science textbook. “Three times as much warming” is something even the IPCC admits is a far-fetched, worst-case scenario which is almost certain not to occur. The IPCC regularly publishes a range of scenarios, from best to worst-case. As history shows, its worst-cases have never come to pass; in fact, what climate alarmists have characterised as wild optimism has actually been the real-world case.



Pixie Bandt’s claim that three times as much warming means “three times as much devastation” only further demonstrates his idiotic failure to comprehend that climate is a non-linear system.



Still, Bandt has a long history of subscribing to leftist fairy tales. After all, his PhD thesis (which he tried to [hide from public scrutiny](https://www.heraldsun.com.au/news/national/how-greens-deputy-leader-adam-bandt-hid-his-phd-thesis/news-story/19665bd3193cb8f57f70660fc2749989)) was on **Marxism** , and praised “the divine violence of the revolutionary general strike”. It was during his university days that Bandt also opined that the Greens were just another “bourgeois party”, albeit one that was ripe for a Marxist takeover.



Of course, the idea that a supposedly environmentalist party would be used by shadowy Marxists as a catspaw for their radical, far-left agenda is just another of Bandt’s fairy-tales, surely?

"**US lawmakers have supported Hong Kong protesters by passing a bill aimed at upholding human rights in the city.**
The bill - which still needs to pass the upper house, the Senate - would mandate an annual review, to see whether Hong Kong had sufficient autonomy from the rest of China to justify its special trading status.
The lower chamber also approved stopping tear gas exports to Hong Kong.
On Monday, Hong Kong protesters took to the streets to support the US bill.
The bill passed by the House of Representatives - which was introduced in June as Hong Kong's protests took hold \- says Hong Kong enjoys ""unique treatment under US law"".
""Hong Kong is part of China but has a largely separate legal and economic system,"" it says.
""The [annual review] shall assess whether China has eroded Hong Kong's civil liberties and rule of law as protected by Hong Kong's Basic Law.""
Among other things, Hong Kong's special trading status means it is not affected by US sanctions or tariffs placed on the mainland.
The bill also says the US should allow Hong Kong residents to obtain US visas, even if they have been arrested for being part of non-violent protests.
And it says anyone ""responsible for abducting and torturing people for exercising internationally-recognized human rights"" should be barred from the US - and have sanctions imposed.
The bill was supported by Republicans and Democrats and was passed by a ""voice vote"" in the House of Representatives, meaning a recorded vote was not needed.
""If America does not speak out for human rights in China because of commercial interest, then we lose all moral authority to speak out for human rights anyplace in the world,"" said house speaker Nancy Pelosi.
Ben Ray Lujan, a Democrat, said: ""The house just sent a strong message to the people of Hong Kong: we stand with you in the fight for democracy and justice.""
The so-called ""PROTECT Hong Kong Act"" is designed to stop US exports of non-lethal crowd control weapons, such as tear gas and rubber bullets.
The bill says such items have been used ""unnecessarily and disproportionately"" by Hong Kong police.
It also needs to be approved by the Senate.
Lawmakers also approved a non-binding resolution recognising Hong Kong's relationship to the United States, which condemns Beijing's ""interference"".
After the bill was passed, Beijing called for Washington to ""stop meddling"".
""We express our strong indignation and firm opposition to the US House of Representatives' insistence on passing the so-called 'Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act',"" said foreign ministry spokesman Geng Shuang.
China's relationship with the United States would be damaged should the bill become law, the spokesman added.
Hong Kong's protests started in June against a proposed law to allow extradition to mainland China but it has since transformed into a larger pro-democracy movement.
The protests have also seen increasingly violent clashes, with police being attacked, and officers firing live bullets.
Protesters have thrown petrol bombs and attacked businesses seen as being pro-Beijing.
The protesters, meanwhile, have accused police of brutality."
"My good mate, Colin, was in a shopping plaza recently, and there was a Qantas stall offering free ‘environmentally friendly’ light bulbs. This is apparently part of their carbon offset program for which they charge extra to those passengers who believe this stuff to ‘save the planet’ when they fly. This ‘carbon neutral’ surcharge is voluntary.
Now the light bulbs were not only offered free, but these would be installed free.
So Colin signed up, and the light bulbs were duly delivered and installed.
The installation team also took away all of the offending old light bulbs.
After the first night of walking around in semi-darkness, Colin is now buying proper bulbs and replacing the free ones which were supplied and installed by Qantas.
I wonder if Qantas shareholders approve of this quaint activity?

"“Global warming” is not a global crisis
We, the scientists and researchers in climate and related fields, economists, policymakers, and business leaders, assembled at Times Square, New York City, participating in the 2008 International Conference on Climate Change,

Resolving that scientific questions should be evaluated solely by the scientific method;
Affirming that global climate has always changed and always will, independent of the actions of humans, and that carbon dioxide (CO2) is not a pollutant but rather a necessity for all life;
Recognising that the causes and extent of recently observed climatic change are the subject of intense debates in the climate science community and that oft-repeated assertions of a supposed ‘consensus’ among climate experts are false;
Affirming that attempts by governments to legislate costly regulations on industry and individual citizens to encourage CO2 emission reduction will slow development while having no appreciable impact on the future trajectory of global climate change. Such policies will markedly diminish future prosperity and so reduce the ability of societies to adapt to inevitable climate change, thereby increasing, not decreasing, human suffering;
Noting that warmer weather is generally less harmful to life on Earth than colder:
Hereby declare:
That current plans to restrict anthropogenic CO2 emissions are a dangerous misallocation of intellectual capital and resources that should be dedicated to solving humanity’s real and serious problems.
That there is no convincing evidence that CO2 emissions from modern industrial activity has in the past, is now, or will in the future cause catastrophic climate change.
That attempts by governments to inflict taxes and costly regulations on industry and individual citizens with the aim of reducing emissions of CO2 will pointlessly curtail the prosperity of the West and progress of developing nations without affecting climate.
That adaptation as needed is massively more cost-effective than any attempted mitigation and that a focus on such mitigation will divert the attention and resources of governments away from addressing the real problems of their peoples.
That human-caused climate change is not a global crisis.
Now, therefore, we recommend —
That world leaders reject the views expressed by the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change as well as popular, but misguided works such as “An Inconvenient Truth.”
That all taxes, regulations, and other interventions intended to reduce emissions of CO2 be abandoned forthwith.
Agreed at New York, 4 March 2008

Susquehanna steam electric nuclear power station
Guest essay by Eric Worrall
The nuclear industry has announced plans to lobby the Australian government, to advocate nuclear power as an affordable, practical alternative to renewables.
According to The Guardian;
The Australian Nuclear Association (ANA) will accompany Danny Roderick, chief executive of the leading US nuclear technology firm Westinghouse, to talk to government ministers and business leaders in Canberra and Sydney next week.
Roderick said nuclear power could help produce “clean, reliable, affordable electricity for more people”.
“We’d like to help Australia explore ways to create jobs and economic opportunity that are also good for the environment,” he said.
…
“My concern is that renewables won’t get us across the line in terms of emissions reduction,” said Rob Parker, the president of the ANA. “Nuclear is more reliable and it has a smaller resources footprint than renewables.
“Until we approach the issue of carbon abatement honestly, we won’t replace coal because it is the cheapest fuel we have. Nuclear is dead until we acknowledge carbon abatement is the main issue. We already pay a premium for renewables but we need to go further or we’ll just keep burning coal.”
Read more: http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/sep/29/nuclear-industry-to-push-for-australia-to-adopt-clean-affordable-power
In my opinion, the last thing Australia needs is any form of new energy infrastructure investment, except where driven by economic demand. In one decade, Australia went from paying one of the cheapest electricity rates in the world, to paying some of the most expensive rates in the world, thanks largely to government green energy initiatives.
If Australia’s newly greened government is determined to waste taxpayer’s money on CO2 emissions reduction, nuclear power at least has the advantage that it works. You can convert a modern economy to nuclear power without ruining it. France for example, generates around 75% of their electricity from nuclear power.
By contrast, spending money on renewables is unlikely to deliver any value whatsoever. According to a report produced by top Google engineers, major scientific advances would be required to make renewable energy useful.

 **[Gabriel Popkin](https://undark.org/undark-author/gabriel-popkin/)**  
[undark.org](https://undark.org/2019/04/11/trump-war-against-science/)



 _By endorsing the overblown rhetoric that science is under siege, we play into the narrative that the media is just another partisan actor._



It may surprise you to learn that the Trump administration has, on quite a number of occasions, championed or advanced science. It has strongly backed increased funding for [quantum computing](https://www.technologyreview.com/the-download/612679/president-trump-has-signed-a-12-billon-law-to-boost-us-quantum-tech/) and promoted artificial intelligence [research](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/11/business/ai-artificial-intelligence-trump.html). The Trump Food and Drug Administration has [sought to](https://www.vox.com/2019/3/6/18252176/scott-gottlieb-fda-vaping-tobacco) regulate e-cigarettes based on scientific findings about their addictive potential. The National Cancer Institute under Trump has [pushed for](https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2019/03/nci-director-norman-sharpless-named-acting-fda-chief) increased data sharing and shifted more funding to external researchers. NASA has launched multiple science instruments just this year and has more in the [pipeline](https://www.nasa.gov/press-release/nasa-selects-experiments-for-possible-lunar-flights-in-2019). The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration is [rolling out](https://www.washingtonpost.com/weather/2019/02/26/noaa-delays-launch-next-generation-weather-forecast-model-names-new-acting-head/?utm_term=.e75f44c354eb) a new weather model.



But the dominant narrative is that the administration is conducting a “[war on science](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/jan/16/trumps-war-on-science-how-the-us-is-putting-politics-above-evidence)” and that science is “[under siege](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-05706-9).” As a science journalist, I often get asked questions like, “Wow, it’s a really bad time for science, isn’t it?” I find myself explaining that, actually, American science is better-funded, by some measures, than it has ever been, and the U.S. federal science workforce remains probably the most impressive scientific organization the planet has ever seen. A feared exodus of scientists out of the government or even the country has hardly amounted to a trickle at most agencies. (At the Environmental Protection Agency — probably the most politically embattled science agency — more than 250 scientists have retired, taken buyouts, or quit, but several non-science agencies have seen larger staff reductions.)



Many decry proposed science agency budget cuts that sprout reliably under the Trump administration each year, like mushrooms after a spring rain. While such cuts would be drastic if enacted, the administration proposes similar cuts to many other discretionary programs — food stamps and public housing, for example — as well as Medicare and Medicaid. There doesn’t seem to be an anti-science agenda per se; there seems to be an agenda to cut spending on almost everything not related to the military or security. Similarly, while science and scientists definitely suffered during the recent government shutdown, they were collateral damage, not direct targets. And of course, Congress has rejected all these cuts; science agency budgets have generally remained steady or increased since Trump was elected.



The American conversation around science is much bigger than any president. Much of the science we taxpayers fund involves long-timeline activities that cannot be supported at universities. Did you know, for example, that since the 1930s, through Republican and Democrat administrations and even a world war, U.S. Forest Service scientists have designed and conducted a forest inventory that is the envy of the world? It’s unglamorous, non-breaking-news work, but it provides a crucial baseline for all kinds of research and decision making, and it has been replicated by other countries. By the way, the inventory is continuing under Trump — in fact, it’s improving, thanks to innovative uses of new technology. Government scientists continue to do lots of climate science, too, even if the administration doesn’t want to talk about it.



Of course, every president likes some science more and other science less. President Obama clearly was very interested in climate science, because he was interested in tackling climate change. He was less interested in space, cancelling a troubled program to return humans to the moon without putting in place a comparably visionary program, and allowing us to become dependent on other countries to shuttle our astronauts. Yet no one accused Obama of a war on space science. As a less visible example, the Obama Department of Energy tried to quietly kill a research program on the health impacts of radiation, despite protests from some scientists that we still don’t understand whether or not low levels of radiation from nuclear power plants, medical equipment, and other sources are harmful.



And, [as I have written](https://www.washingtonpost.com/outlook/trump-doesnt-want-the-public-to-know-what-government-scientists-are-doing/2018/12/11/b9ff5770-e69e-11e8-a939-9469f1166f9d_story.html), the Obama administration was often oddly averse to talking about the science it was doing, throwing up barriers to communication between its scientists and the media. (The Trump administration has generally kept these barriers in place and added new ones.)



But since Obama invited students to present at White House science fairs, addressed scientific society meetings, and staffed a robust Office of Science and Technology Policy, he mostly got a pass for the times his administration defunded science or suppressed scientific information access, and retained his sterling reputation as a science champion. The main difference today is that the man in the White House doesn’t even pretend to care what scientists are learning.



Even when an opportunity presents itself, [such as the December signing of the National Quantum Initiative Act](https://www.aip.org/fyi/2019/national-quantum-initiative-signed-law), he does not seem to have much to say on the subject — a rarity for Trump. And scientists clearly don’t like the cold shoulder they’re getting from this administration after the warmth they grew used to from the previous one. Hence, rhetoric suggesting that science is under [“relentless assault”](https://www.whistleblower.org/event-calendar/sunshine-week-2019-assaults-on-science-in-the-trump-era/) arises from groups like the Union of Concerned Scientists.



There’s no question that the Trump administration often ignores or downplays science when weighing policy decisions that scientists could clearly contribute to. But that is very different from assaulting or fighting a war against science. Remember how the coal industry and right-wing politicians accused the Obama administration of carrying out a “war on coal” as it tried to reduce air and water pollution and emissions from the electricity sector? Science advocates are now doing something similar.



Fine: It’s an advocate’s job to advocate. But journalists should not. It is not the media’s role to take sides in a political fight, or to decide that certain science, such as environmental or public health science, gets to represent all science. It is the media’s job to report what is happening, as comprehensively as possible, so that readers can make the best decisions possible. The science media have done part of this job well. They’ve reported exhaustively on the Trump administration’s efforts to cut climate science programs, disband science advisory panels at the Environmental Protection Agency and the Department of the Interior, and to suppress scientists’ findings that certain chemicals such as chlorpyrifos and PFAS harm health. Science journalists’ stories helped get Scott Pruitt and Ryan Zinke — two ethically compromised agency heads — ousted. Kudos for that.



But we have done a less stellar job of covering the science agencies that Trump has not directly interfered with, and of painting a complete picture that can help Americans understand what their $86.5-billion-a-year investment in science is getting them. As in so many areas, we have let Donald Trump drive the agenda.



I implore my fellow science journalists to avoid getting dragged into political fights against the present administration. Doing so just plays into Trump’s narrative that the media are aligned against him. It makes it even harder to reach those who we most need to reach — people who have fallen under the sway of false narratives and conspiracy theories on climate change, vaccines, and other issues. And it makes all our readers less informed and less able to participate effectively in our democracy.

"**Basketball superstar LeBron James has weighed in on a row between the NBA and China, saying a team manager who caused uproar with a tweet about Hong Kong ""wasn't educated"" on the situation.**
In a now-deleted tweet, Houston Rockets' Daryl Morey expressed support for pro-democracy protests in Hong Kong. He later apologised.
Mr James, the NBA's best-known player, often speaks out on social issues.
His latest comments were praised in China but drew ire in the US.
During a pre-game interview in Los Angeles on Monday, Mr James told reporters he believed Mr Morey was ""misinformed"".
""I don't want to get into a word or sentence feud with Daryl Morey,"" he said, ""but I believe he wasn't educated on the situation at hand and he spoke.""
Mr James added: ""We do all have freedom of speech, but at times there are ramifications for the negative that can happen when you're not thinking about others and you're only thinking about yourself.""
Mr James' remarks sparked outrage from activists in Hong Kong, some US politicians and people on social media, with many users reposting one of his tweets from 2018 that quoted the civil rights leader Martin Luther King Jr.
One Republican senator, Ben Sasse of Nebraska, accused the athlete of ""parroting communist propaganda"".
In a clarifying tweet, Mr James said he was referring to the consequences of Mr Morey's comment, rather than the substance.
Chinese officials and media responded with outrage to Mr Morey's original tweet, which referred to months of pro-democracy protests that have consumed Hong Kong, a territory that is part of China but enjoys unique freedoms.
The NBA - which is hugely popular in China - has struggled to respond to the situation, with some Chinese partners suspending relations with the league by cancelling broadcasts and sponsorships.
Mr James has spoken out in the past on issues concerning race and police brutality and the NBA has been praised for accepting protest among its players.
Mr James has significant financial interests in China, through his lifetime endorsement deal with Nike and via millions of fans."

What is it about lefty types that they seem to imagine that Australia’s suburbs are as dark and distant as central Africa in the 19th century? When former prime minister **Julia Gillard** made the gruelling journey to Rooty Hill (50 kms, 40 minutes by car), she packed enough luggage for an Edwardian heiress doing a Grand Tour. As she and her entourage swanned into the local RSL club, all that was missing was a train of porters and a small boy waving a palm frond.



Likewise, nothing could have demonstrated in more stark terms the ABC’s elitism than last year’s trek by its senior management and journalists, in search of the great mystery of What Does Australia Think? Gamely leaving behind their Sherpas, the intrepid team of taxpayer-funded discoverers travelled all the way from inner-city Ultimo to…Bankstown. A whopping 20 kms away.



But, if the ABC’s great voyage of discovery (not to mention the billion-plus in taxpayer money they gobble every year) gave them any insight into what the poor, unwashed masses are interested in, we’re yet to see the evidence.



The ABC are still sticking to their trite, left-wing talking points, ordinary Australians be damned.



7.30…report[ed] on a climate change demonstration in Sydney.



This time ABC reporter Tracy Bowden did not make it to the southwest suburbs. She did not even go north over the Harbour Bridge. Instead the 7.30 crew travelled a few suburbs from Ultimo to Edge­cliff, which abuts Double Bay — one of the most fashionable, and expensive, parts of Sydney’s eastern suburbs.



Well, ABC types already know for a fact that anyone who doesn’t live with a harbour view is by definition an uncultured, uneducated redneck who probably didn’t even study Arts at Sydney University.



You’ve heard about the doctors’ wives phenomenon, used to portray the wealthy spouses of professional men who do not vote in accordance with their perceived economic interests but flirt with green-left causes. On Wednesday, 7.30 came across the phenomenon of doctors’ husbands.



It turned out that 7.30 was interested in a planned silent vigil for climate action scheduled for 9.30am last Saturday outside the Edgecliff office of Dave Sharma, the Liberal Party member for Wentworth. The organisers were semi-retired lawyer Rod Cunich and his medical doctor wife Margot Cunich.



Well, if an inner-city lawyer and a doctor aren’t representative of the **real** Australia, who is? Certainly not some bogan plumber or, shudder, shop assistant from Punchbowl.



On Wednesday’s 7.30, Sales also introduced a segment on the Prime Minister’s address to the National Press Club earlier that day by saying Tingle would explain that “in the short term Prime Minister Morrison has some pressing matters to deal with”. Tingle mentioned the response to the bushfire emergency and climate change, then showed footage of herself cross-examining Morrison on the sports grants controversy.



Certainly the bushfires are pressing matters. But so is the coronavirus outbreak, which has the capacity to adversely affect not only the health of Australians but also Australia’s mineral and service industries. Tingle did not mention this in her report of Morrison’s address, even though he had covered the issue in detail.



ABC journalists only expressed the most passing interest in Morrison’s outline of the government’s plans for bushfire recovery. For the whole address, only one journalist even bothered asking about the **coronavirus** and Australia’s response – but that was one of the wicked Murdoch press, so it’s obviously just a right-wing conspiracy.



Once again, so many of Australia’s leading journalists are out of touch with the public’s interest in matters such as how to clean up after a disaster and how to prevent a possible medical emergency.

As previously noted at WUWT, over at the COLA/IGES website, they had this response to the disappeared letter to the Obama administration calling for RICO act investigations of climate skeptics:

WUWT reader Dean P. writes in comments on the WUWT story from earlier today:
The updated website says that they’ve been planning to shut down IGES for over two years now. That makes no sense since in October 2013 they were awarded NSF Grant #1338427, which started in May 2014 and is expected to continue into 2017. Does that mean they were planning to shutter the doors while they were still applying for grants? Did they tell the NSF that they planned on shutting down?
As others have said – something smells fishy…
Fishy? I’ll say, that award was updated in June 2015, to the tune of over 4 million dollars (yellow highlights mine):

It seems this is an active grant, good for another two years. It is important to note the name James Kinter in that NSF page, who is part of the Shukla nepotism empire:
IGES Personnel:
President Shukla, Jagadish
Business Manager Shukla, Anastasia
Assistant Business Manager Shukla, Sonia
Director, COLA Kinter, James
Assistant to the President Shukla, Sonia

…and so far, that four million dollar plus NSF grant has produced only one paper. From the NSF grant page:

ABSTRACT

This award provides continued funding for the Center for Ocean-Land-Atmosphere Studies (COLA). COLA is a climate science research center established to explore, establish and quantify the variability and predictability of Earth’s climate variations on seasonal to decadal time scales, and to harvest this predictability for societally beneficial predictions. The Center is jointly funded by NSF, NOAA and NASA.
Work supported through this award includes activities devoted to 1) basic research on predictability on intraseasonal, seasonal, interannual, and decadal timescales; 2) evaluation of the predictability, skill, and fidelity of US national climate models; and 3) contributions to the development of next generation seamless prediction systems. Research performed under item 1 includes testing of land data assimilation schemes in multiple models, performing hindcasts of El Nino/Southern Oscillation (ENSO) events investigate inter-event diversity of ENSO, performing dynamical prediction experiments for the Indian monsoon, and determining the dependence of drought probability on surface boundary conditions including land cover change. Work under item 2 focuses on the use of optimal spatial structures derived from information theoretic analysis, which represent the most predictable modes, or modes for which predictability differs the most between two models. This activity is intended to support climate prediction efforts at US national centers and contribute to COLA’s research-to-operations effort. Work under item 3 involves collaborators at the NOAA National Centers for Environmental Prediction (NCEP) and includes the development of optimal methods of initializing high-resolution coupled models including version 2 of the Coupled Forecast System (CFSv2), a model used operationally at NCEP.
The work has broader impacts due to its focus on research leading to improved climate prediction, given the substantial societal consequences of climate variability and change. In addition, COLA benefits the US climate research enterprise through community integration, education, seminars, workshops, and software and information services. COLA also serves an important function in transferring the results of basic climate science research on predictability and prediction into operational use.
PUBLICATIONS PRODUCED AS A RESULT OF THIS RESEARCH

Now, you might say that COLA isn’t the same as the IGES organization, and that might be true on paper, but the fact is that the http://iges.org website, soon to be “decommissioned” according to them, shows clearly that COLA and IGES are part of the same group, all under George mason University: (yellow highlight mine)


Note the COLA page is a sub-page of the IGES website:
http://www.iges.org/cola.html
With 4 million dollars and counting, good to 2017 according to NSF’s own grant page, the claim of the IGES/COLA website being “decommissioned” just doesn’t make any sense. It doesn’t wash. And, with a web page that still looks like it was designed in 1995, one wonders why Shukla’s clan didn’t put some of that money towards making a decent web page. After all, they only were able to make ONE paper with that 4 million dollars, according to NSF.
It gets better. Have a look at their staff page:

Source: http://www.iges.org/people/people.html
Lest Shukla and associates try to claim that IGES and COLA are somehow separate, their own COLA staff web page puts the issue to rest.
COLA appears to be a subset of the Shukla family run IGES. So if the IGES website was going to be “decommissioned”,  and so by shutting down IGES, it would seem that would affect COLA too. I can’t find any plans or announcements on their website that says COLA is going to supplant/survive IGES.
A Google search yields no other “new” web pages for COLA. It only yields the IGES web page and COLA subset and the COLA webpage at George Mason University, which is an exact copy of the IGES/COLA front page:

Then there’s this symposium advert page at GMU:

Source: http://cola.gmu.edu/symposium/
Gosh, a COLA symposium and Shukla’s photo is prominently featured on it? It seems that IGES and COLA are indistinguishable when it comes to Shukla involvement. I wonder if Shukla predicted at that symposium on chaos, the current chaos he’s in the middle of as a result of the now disappeared RICO20 letter?
Let’s go back to the claim they uploaded in place of the disappeared RICO20 letter yesterday.

If COLA is a subset of IGES, and it appears to be so, with the same people running the outfit, their claim of “all research projects were completed in July 2015” seems more than a bit unbelievable. It also seems unbelievable to me that they’d “decommission” the only website (IGES.org) that represents COLA while it is receiving active NSF grants.
There’s quite a gravy train going on there it seems, and as Steve McIntyre pointed out in Shukla’s Gold, it seems there’s quite a bit of double dipping going on, despite GMU policy to the contrary:
Before discussing Shukla’s structure, I’ll first quickly comment on institutional policies, as both the federal agencies (NSF, NOAA, NASA) and the university (George Mason) purport to have policies that prevent double-dipping.
Perhaps the Shukla gravy train is about to be derailed once the true accounting is done. Read McIntyre’s excellent piece Shukla’s Gold, the monetary tentacles run deep and wide on this one, and I’m betting there are a lot of people at GMU, NASA, NOAA, and NSF fretting over damage control right about now.
Note: within about 10 minutes of publication, this article was edited for a spelling correction and a text formatting correction.
UPDATE:
If you search Shukla’s name on the NSF grants database it turns up 2039 results…
http://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/simpleSearchResult?queryText=Jagadish+Shukla

How many millions has this Shukla family organization taken from the American Taxpayer? How much of that money did they spend to create the RICO charge against climate skeptics?

You Ought to Have a Look _is a feature from the Center for the Study of Science posted by Patrick J. Michaels and Paul C. (“Chip”) Knappenberger. While this section will feature all of the areas of interest that we are emphasizing, the prominence of the climate issue is driving a tremendous amount of web traffic. Here we post a few of the best in recent days, along with our color commentary._   
  
_\---_   
  
We’ve put together an interesting collection of articles this week for your consideration.   
  
First up is a shout out to lukewarming from Bloomberg View columnist Megan McArdle. In her piece “Global Warming Alarmists, You’re Doing It Wrong,” McArdle suggests that lukewarmers have a lot to bring to the climate change table, but are turned away by the entrenched establishment and tarred with labels like climate “denier”—a label which couldn’t be further from the truth. McArdle writes:   




Naturally, proponents of climate-change models have welcomed the lukewarmists' constructive input by carefully considering their points and by advancing counterarguments firmly couched in the scientific method.   
  
No, of course I’m just kidding. The reaction to these mild assertions is often to brand the lukewarmists “deniers” and treat them as if what they were saying was morally and logically equivalent to suggesting that the Holocaust never happened.



In her article, McArdle calls for less name calling and less heel digging and more open, constructive discussion:   




There is a huge range of possible beliefs that go into assessing the various complicated theories about how the climate works, and the global-warming predictions generated by those theories range from “could well be catastrophic” to “probably not a big deal.” I know very smart, well-informed, decent people who fall at either end of the spectrum, and others who are somewhere in between. Then there are folks like me who aren’t sure enough to make a prediction, but are very sure we wouldn’t like to find out, too late, that the answer is “oops, catastrophic.”   
  
These are not differences that can be resolved by name calling. Nor has the presumed object of this name calling -- to delegitimize thoughtful opposition, and thereby increase the consensus in favor of desired policy proposals -- been a notable political success, at least in the U.S. It has certainly rallied the tribe, and produced a lot of patronizing talk about science by people who aren’t actually all that familiar with the underlying scientific questions. Other than that, we remain pretty much where we were 25 years ago: holding summits, followed by the dismayed realization that we haven’t, you know, really done all that much except burn a lot of hydrocarbons flying people to summits. Maybe last year's Paris talks will turn out to be the actual moment when things started to change -- but having spent the last 15 years as a reporter listening to people tell me that no, really, we’re about to turn the corner, I retain a bit of skepticism.



How was this bit of advice from McArdle received by some of the loudest name-callers? Not well, as she describes in this follow-up:



In response, climate scientist Michael Mann tweeted this:   






Then he blocked me. You will correctly infer that I was also inundated with other interlocutors on social media and e-mail. Many of them were respectful. Others were … less so. At worst, they suggested, I was a paid shill for fossil fuel interests. (Not so. I accept no pay from anyone other than Bloomberg.) At best, they said, I was a fool who was giving aid and comfort to the enemy. My editor was thusly chided for the column: “shame on you for publishing it, especially if you have children.”



This should come as a big surprise to no one.   
  
Next, we point you to Judith Curry’s (herself no stranger to treatment like McArdle's, and worse) excellent blog post in which she provides a 21st-century update to Michael Polanyi’s 1962 essay titled “The Republic of Science: Its Political and Economic Theory.” Curry delivers an introduction to his work (“Polanyi provides an interesting perspective from the mid 20th century, as the U.S. and Europe were contemplating massive public investments in science. Polanyi’s perspective was colored by his early years in Hungary, which led him to oppose central planning in the sciences.”) and excerpts from Polanyi’s work and then follows with an offering of comments as to how Polanyi’s perspective stands up some half a century later. For instance [embedded links in original]:   




Polanyi’s analogy of the scientific process with markets captures the pure incentives that drive scientists – search of truth, intellectual satisfaction and individual ego. What happens when the externalities of the Republic of Science produce perverse incentives, and careerism becomes a dominant incentive that requires publishing a lot of papers rapidly and producing headline-worthy results (who even cares if these papers don’t survive scrutiny beyond their press release)? (see What is the measure of scientific success?) What happens is that you get increasing incidence of scientific fraud (see Science: in the doghouse?), cherry picking and meaningless papers on headline grabbing topics that don’t stand up to the test of time (see Trust and don’t bother to verify).   
  
And what happens when the ‘hand’ guiding science isn’t ‘invisible’, i.e. science is driven by politics, such as a political imperative to move away from fossil fuels and towards renewable energy? Federal funding can bias science, particularly in terms of selecting which scientific problems receive attention (link).   
  
And what of Polanyi’s statement: “ _Such self-coordination of independent initiatives leads to a joint result which is unpremeditated by any of those who bring it about.”_ The ‘result’ of dangerous anthropogenic climate change and the harms of dietary fat were hardly unpremeditated.



We also have our own humble opinion on Polanyi, and how he influenced Thomas Kuhn, who, as a result of Polanyi’s view, noted that the intellectual market may not be all that fluid. From “Lukewarming: The New Climate Science that Changes Everything”:   




…Polanyi…recognized the horrors of government intervention in science and the pernicious influence of central planning. He argued that science should be considered a free market with spontaneous order a perspective akin to [a list of libertarian economist luminaries]. Thomas Kuhn, a physicist and philosopher who attended several of Polanyi’s lectures, went him one better and argued in his classic _The Structure of Scientific Revolutions_ that order created paradigms, or encompassing philosophical strucures, that lie at the core of science. 



We went on to demonstrate that paradigms must become even more entrenched when the government becomes the monopoly provider of funding for science with political and policy consequences.   
  
Curry offers up these suggestions as to how to improve on the current sad state of scientific affairs [again, links in original]:   




So, what should the Republic of Science look like in the 21st century? The overwhelming issue for the health of science is to reassert the importance of intellectual and political diversity in science, and to respect and even nurture scientific mavericks. The tension between pure (curiosity driven) science and use-inspired and applied science [see Pasteur’s quadrant] needs to be resolved in a way that supports all three, with appropriate roles for universities, government and the private sector. And finally, the reward structure for university scientists need to change to reward more meaningful science that stands the test of time, versus counting papers and press releases, which may not survive even superficial scrutiny even after being published in prestigious journals that are more interested in impact than in rigorous methods and appropriate conclusions.   
  
Failure to give serious thought to these issues risks losing the public trust and support for elite university science (at least in certain fields). Scientists are becoming their own worst enemy when they play into the hands of politicians and others seeking to politicize their science.



We urge you to read the whole thing. As always, Curry is insightful, interesting, informative, and right on target.   
  
And finally, we suggest that you ought to have a look at Julie Kelly’s “The EPA vs. Science” in _National Review_. In this article, Kelly looks at recent developments in the long-running controversy surrounding the use of the herbicide glyphosate (i.e., Roundup) and EPA’s recent released and then withdrawn report on glyphosate’s health effects. Here’s a teaser:   




On April 29, the EPA posted a report concluding that glyphosate (the active ingredient in Roundup herbicide and other products) is “not likely to be carcinogenic.” The committee found no relationship between glyphosate exposure and a number of cancers, including leukemia, multiple myeloma, and Hodgkin lymphoma. The 86-page assessment was signed by the EPA’s cancer review committee back in October 2015 and marked “final.”   
  
_But the EPA took it down on May 2, claiming the documents were “inadvertently” posted and only a preliminary report. “EPA has not completed our cancer review. We will look at the work of other governments. . . . our assessment will be peer reviewed and completed by end of 2016,” said an EPA spokeswoman.  
_



Kelly notes “GMO foes are now targeting glyphosate in their ongoing campaign against genetically engineered crops” and “[a]ctivists are also using the court system to punish companies that use glyphosate” and adds “[i]t seems that the EPA may be taking some cues from these anti-GMO activists.”   
  
House Science Committee chairman Lamar Smith (R-TX) is looking into what prompted the rather unusual move by the EPA. According to Kelly:   




Chairman Smith also senses that EPA foot-dragging might be based more on politics than on science: “That the EPA would remove a report, which was marked as a ‘Final Report’ and signed by thirteen scientists, appears to be yet another example of this agency’s attempt to allow politics rather than science [to] drive its decision making. Sound, transparent science should always be the basis for EPA’s decisions.”



Kelly smartly concludes:   




If the science indeed shows (again) that glyphosate does not cause cancer, the anti-pesticide Center for Biological Diversity says it will be a “major roadblock” for the anti-GMO movement, which wants to ban genetically engineered crops worldwide. It will be a blow the anti-GMO movement richly deserves.

"**Hong Kong's leader Carrie Lam said the territory is likely to record negative growth for the year as months of protests have knocked the economy.**
The unrest has disrupted businesses and dealt a particularly heavy blow to the tourism and retail sectors.
The warning comes ahead of preliminary gross domestic product figures due on Thursday that are expected to show Hong Kong entered a technical recession.
That is defined as two consecutive quarters of negative growth.
In a briefing in Hong Kong on Tuesday, Ms Lam said the third quarter growth numbers are likely to show that outcome.
To combat the slowdown, she said the city has so far injected more than HK$20bn ($2.6bn; Â£2bn) to support the economy including the transport, tourism and retail sectors.
Ms Lam said the government will deliver more relief measures, without giving specific details.
Her comments follow a similar warning from the territory's Finance Secretary Paul Chan over the weekend. He said it would be ""extremely difficult"" to hit the government's pre-protest forecast of growth of between 0% and 1% for 2019.
""The blow to our economy [from the protests] is comprehensive,"" Mr Chan said.
The demonstrations began over a proposed extradition bill between the territory and mainland China, and have evolved into demands for greater freedoms.
Hong Kong is part of China, but its citizens have more autonomy than those on the mainland.
Clashes between police and activists have become increasingly violent, with police using tear gas and protesters storming parliament.
Those protests have led to a sharp decline in tourist arrivals, with visitor numbers expected to have slumped 50% in October.
Retailers have also been hard hit. Some shops have been forced to shorten trading hours, while workers report fears over their safety as well as getting to work.
Mr Chan said in August that retail sales had plunged more than 25% - the biggest monthly drop on record."
"

The Aussies apparently want to take our PM to run their country. There are many here who would also like Ardern to be running another country but we are too kind to wish this on our Aussie ‘cousins’. Nevertheless, if those across the Tasman really want her, then I suggest we swap for Queensland Senator **Malcolm Roberts.**



Roberts recently tore **Michael Mann** a new one in a Senate speech.



Here is the transcript of the video:



How dare you, Michael Mann. I used tonight’s adjournment speech to challenge Michael Mann to a debate on climate science. Michael Mann is the fabricator of the completely discredited hockey stick temperature graph and is in Australia at the moment so logistics shouldn’t be a problem.



You come down here pretending you have evidence that CO2 from HUMAN activity affects climate and needs to be cut – when you have no such evidence. How do I know? Easy. You released papers that led to the infamous hockey-stick graph falsely fabricating high temperatures. Despite repeated requests from scientists you refused to hand over your data.



No evidence.



Scientifically, your claims should’ve been immediately dismissed. The state of Virginia’s Attorney General asked for your data from the University of Virginia because your research was reportedly taxpayer-funded. Your Uni refused. No evidence. You sued Prof Tim Ball – a real scientist – and then in court refused to provide evidence to support your case.



No evidence.



Didn’t the court find you in contempt?



Regardless, your claim was dismissed. And you failed to provide any evidence yet Prof Ball’s team provided plenty of solid statements from internationally reputable scientists. You are the one in the Climategate scandals who wanted to hide the temperature decline, aren’t you?



Hide the evidence?



You have sued any person that dared to question you – to shut them down. To stop the evidence.



You now say Senator Molan as a policymaker should ask some unnamed great Australian scientists for their opinion – name any with evidence proving HUMAN CO2 affects climate variability.



After 21 years you still have not released data for your hockey stick graph fabricating high temps yet many people have debunked it.



My understanding is that fraud can include the presentation of something that is not true with the intention of personal gain. You claim you were awarded a Nobel Prize.



That is false.



You contributed to the UN’s climate body the IPCC that was awarded a Nobel Peace Prize. Note that was not for science. After the UN IPCC was awarded a Nobel Peace Prize it dropped your graph. And if that shonky political body dropped it, that really kills your credibility.



You have a record of serially misrepresenting climate, serially misrepresenting science and serially misrepresenting humanity. The use of hydrocarbon fuels such as gas, coal and oil has liberated humanity and saved the forests and whales that previously fuelled civilisation and human progress.



Your advocacy to stop their use is anti-human and anti-environment. It hurts our security and our sovereignty. Your host, the ABC, has been a blind supporter of, and advocate for, others misrepresenting climate and science – including Al Gore, Rajendra Pachauri, Gavin Schmidt.



People advocating for cutting hydrocarbon fuels have branded those who dissent from your advocacy as climate criminals. I believe that in the very near future it is people like you, who misrepresent science and climate, who the public will see as climate criminals.



None of you have ever presented the empirical evidence proving HUMAN production of CO2 from our use of hydrocarbon fuels hurts our environment and future. You’re here in Australia now so I challenge you to a public debate on climate science and the corruption of climate science.



All you need do is provide me with the specific location of the empirical scientific evidence, the hard validated data, within a logical scientific framework that proves cause and effect, and I will retract this speech.



I need publication title, specific page numbers. No entity anywhere in the world has provided this: Don’t bother to smear me or get someone to smear me. That not only has no effect on me, I love it. I use it to prove that those who smear only do so because they lack hard scientific evidence.



How dare you Michael Mann. Provide the evidence.

"An autocratic leader has won the vote. He has charm, yes, and smarts of a kind, but also a cruel streak. Beatings are frequent, and assassination  —   foreign and domestic  —   has become commonplace. His cultural pronouncements have had a chilling effect on the arts, theater in particular. Take your seat for “Evening at the Talk House,” an   comedy by the playwright and actor Wallace Shawn (“The Designated Mourner,” “Aunt Dan and Lemon”) for the New Group that begins performances at the Signature Center on Tuesday, Jan. 31. Though written years before Donald J. Trump announced his candidacy, and first produced in London in the fall of 2015, the play may strike some as oddly prescient. Set in the course of one night, it eavesdrops on several people who worked together on “Midnight in a Clearing With Moon and Stars,” a fictitious flop from a decade ago. They have gathered for a reunion at a rundown club. As they snack and sip and reminisce, they reveal the brutality of the world outside and the ways that artists can abet it, resist it and ignore it. The London production stoked controversy, with The Independent approvingly describing a “disturbing, balefully hilarious new play,” while many other critics attacked its tone, pace and politics. More than a year later, in the wake of Brexit and the presidential election, that controversy is likely to resonate anew. On the morning of President Trump’s inauguration, Mr. Shawn, who also appears in the play, the director Scott Elliott and the other members of the cast  —   Matthew Broderick, Jill Eikenberry, John Epperson, Larry Pine, Claudia Shear, Annapurna Sriram and Michael Tucker  —   gathered at a rehearsal space to discuss drama as protest and whether or not to invite the president. These are edited excerpts from the conversation. Is this a political play? MICHAEL TUCKER Yes. It’s other things, too. But it’s most certainly political. JILL EIKENBERRY I felt when I first read it that it was extremely relevant to our situation in this world, in this country. After the election, it felt way more relevant, chillingly relevant. SCOTT ELLIOTT I decided to do it way before the election. Many people say Wally’s a prescient artist, and I’ve seen it. And then all of a sudden on election night, it was this feeling of, oh my God, this play crossed over from fiction to  —   —   EIKENBERRY True. LARRY PINE If the election had gone the other way, this play would still be very relevant. WALLACE SHAWN Plays began as political. The Greek plays were about communities and cities and kings and queens and how a country was run. We went through a brief period in the United States of somehow being so prosperous and secure that we forgot that we lived in the world, and plays were about what was happening in somebody’s kitchen. Have you ever been a part of a play that failed unjustly? PINE Oh God, yes. Every play. SHAWN Most of my projects have been unsuccessful, so I’m a kind of expert on it. Most actors are very courageous people, and my experience is their commitment increases when it becomes clear that the show is not going to get universal approval. It’s an honorable role to be committing yourself to the unpopular play.  Is there anything wrong with apolitical plays, entertainment that simply comforts? CLAUDIA SHEAR I think there’s a place for “Guys and Dolls” until the last splinter of light dies out on the planet. JOHN EPPERSON I never liked that show. But I like “The Unsinkable Molly Brown. ” SHAWN Speaking as someone who has devoted a lot of his life to doing some things that would certainly fit into the category of pure entertainment, that’s how I have lived. I’ve been paid for that. But complacency is a very serious problem. Too much soothing entertainment isn’t good for a person. If you admit that a play or a TV show or a movie can wake somebody up, you have to at least admit that possibly some plays or TV shows or movies might put people to sleep and help them in their quest for total oblivion. Personally, I would rather go to bed and have someone bring me a cup of tea. I don’t have a desire to go out and get arrested or something like that. But it may be necessary. MATTHEW BRODERICK It’s a play it’s not an essay. It’s not like we’re all sitting around saying, “Let’s change the world and its politics while we’re doing it. ” We’re creating a human world. EIKENBERRY And there’s a lot of irony, a lot of funny stuff. That’s another great way to tell a political story. In the play, theater has died out. Is this likely? ANNAPURNA SRIRAM A lot of friends my age don’t go to theater. I have one friend who will probably come, and this will be his second play. His first was another play I did. I definitely wonder what the next generation of theatergoers will look like. SHEAR They’re all outside of “Hamilton. ” BRODERICK When I first did a play, I was absolutely sure that Broadway was dead. And now every time I’m in a play, you can’t get a theater. Your young friends are going to start watching plays at some point. SRIRAM I hope so. If it did die, would that be so bad? BRODERICK I would be fine with that. We would get paid more. TUCKER It would be a great loss. When it works, there’s nothing like it. If there were no theaters, no one could ever say, “I saw that, I was there, that moment. ” EIKENBERRY It’s been around for an awful long time it’s hard to imagine that even this administration could do away with it. People don’t go to church that much anymore. They need collective experience. EPPERSON I thought the election in 2000 would spur people to make more interesting work, but it didn’t seem like it did. And then after   it seemed like audiences wanted   stuff. Maybe this election will make more interesting work. Scott, you said you already have things on your desk. ELLIOTT A lot of screeches. A lot of screams. In the world of the play, assassination has become the norm. Do you feel we’re moving toward a more violent world? TUCKER There’s been slaughter, genocide since history began. But this is different. SRIRAM It’s been going on for a long time, but it hasn’t been as public. SHAWN Under Bush, torture became normal and most Americans accepted it. First they were shocked, and then they accepted it. And sadly, under the very likable Obama, these assassinations have become normal, and people have accepted that. In the case of killing Bin Laden, it was boasted about by apparently nice people. I’m not sure we understand the implications of that yet, the normalization of killing individuals. What does it mean if apparently nice people just go on eating snacks and drinking cocktails and making art while these things are happening? EIKENBERRY That’s the question of the play. SRIRAM I feel grateful in real life just for the privilege of getting to be an actor, that I have the kind of sometimes insane work of putting on costumes and playing pretend, for a living! But what is my responsibility other than just trying to achieve and have ambition and success? SHAWN Our complacency is dangerous to other people. Have you always made it a point to do work that has political dimensions?  TUCKER Most of us don’t have that much of a choice. There are only a few actors who can choose what they want to do. There are actors who are very political who will join or form a company that only does political work. But I’m not much of a joiner. It’s really something that we have to think about individually. EPPERSON I have a list of selfish reasons for doing it, too. My career has been a kind of trap: Performing in female clothing is one trap, and   is another trap. It’s always good for me to do a job where people can realize, oh, he can do something else. BRODERICK But I think we’re going to record all of your dialogue. The reaction to this play in London a year ago was mixed to negative. Will it be received differently now? TUCKER There will be negative responses, too, I imagine. People don’t like to be confronted. EIKENBERRY Wally, do you have a fantasy  —   I think it happened to Sean O’Casey  —   that everyone gets up in the entire audience and starts throwing things at the stage? Would that make you happy? SHAWN I don’t actually enjoy that. Nobody ever says, “I hated your play, because I happen to be very conservative, and I disagree with all of your ideas. ” They say: “You’re a bad writer. We were bored. It’s not a good play. ” What about the “Waiting for Lefty” model, where the audience joins the resistance? SHAWN I’m available. If the audience is inspired to activism, I’m thrilled and I’ll join in, but things don’t really happen quite that way. Our president has a lot of strong opinions on art. How would you feel if he liked this play? BRODERICK That should happen! A fan’s a fan. PINE I don’t think he’s interested in plays. EPPERSON I saw him at a fashion show once. SHEAR I saw him at a party. ELLIOTT He was in one of my plays in the ’90s. This play called “The Monogamist. ” I videotaped prominent New York figures for the scenic transitions. Will you invite him? ELLIOTT Why not? Let him see it. SHAWN I don’t know if it could influence Trump. It’s only 90 minutes long, but he’s one of those people who’s interested in himself, and when the topic goes off of him he becomes bored. We don’t mention him in the play. Maybe we should change that."

You Ought to Have a Look _is a feature from the Center for the Study of Science posted by Patrick J. Michaels and Paul C. (“Chip”) Knappenberger. While this section will feature all of the areas of interest that we are emphasizing, the prominence of the climate issue is driving a tremendous amount of web traffic. Here we post a few of the best in recent days, along with our color commentary._   




The average citizen of Nepal consumes about 100 kilowatt-hours of electricity in a year. Cambodians make do with 160. Bangladeshis are better off, consuming, on average, 260.   
  
Then there is the fridge in your kitchen. A typical 20-cubic-foot refrigerator—Energy Star-certified, to fit our environmentally conscious times—runs through 300 to 600 kilowatt-hours a year.   
  
American diplomats are upset that dozens of countries—including Nepal, Cambodia and Bangladesh—have flocked to join China’s new infrastructure investment bank, a potential rival to the World Bank and other financial institutions backed by the United States.   
  
The reason for the defiance is not hard to find: The West’s environmental priorities are blocking their access to energy.



Porter’s article announced the release of “An Ecomodernist Manifesto”—a work by a collection of “scholars, scientists, campaigners, and citizens” who “write with the conviction that knowledge and technology, applied with wisdom, might allow for a good, or even great, Anthropocene.”   
  
Sounds interesting.   




The main concept behind the Ecomodernist Manifesto is that “sustainability” is the wrong approach. Porter describes it this way in his article:   




The “eco-modernists” propose economic development as an indispensable precondition to preserving the environment. Achieving it requires dropping the goal of “sustainable development,” supposedly in harmonious interaction with nature, and replacing it with a strategy to shrink humanity’s footprint by using nature more intensively.



Aware of the pitfalls of gross generalities, we’ll offer that the Ecomodernists see technology as humankind’s greatest tool and our way forward rather than inevitably leading to our downfall.   
  
While we think the Ecomodernists are a bit overly optimistic in the pace of development/deployment of new energy technologies, overplay the climate change-related urgency of such development, and see too much involvement of the state, their general take on the issue of humanity’s association with the earth’s environment resonates well. Consider this:   




Modernization has liberated ever more people from lives of poverty and hard agricultural labor, women from chattel status, children and ethnic minorities from oppression, and societies from capricious and arbitrary governance. Greater resource productivity associated with modern socio-technological systems has allowed human societies to meet human needs with fewer resource inputs and less impact on the environment. More-productive economies are wealthier economies, capable of better meeting human needs while committing more of their economic surplus to non-economic amenities, including better human health, greater human freedom and opportunity, arts, culture, and the conservation of nature.



The Ecomodernists recognize that the “modernization process is far from complete” but emphasize that it requires decoupling, rather than re-coupling, with the environment (the latter being the goal of many “sustainable” ideals).   
  
We’re only brushing the surface here, so to really get into the philosophy that they are laying out, you ought to have a look at the whole Manifesto. If nothing else, it’ll be the start of an interesting conversation. For us, it seems to lay out a much better course, although imperfect in some details, for “environmentalism” to follow—one in which the current feeling of pessimism is replaced by optimism (born from history).   
  
Also expressing a disdain for the “sustainability” craze this week is George Will. In his _Washington Post_ column, “’Sustainability’ Gone Mad on College Campuses,” he likens the dedication to sustainability to that of religious fundamentalism (perhaps foreshadowing the pope’s announcement). He writes   




Like many religions’ premises, the sustainability movement’s premises are more assumed than demonstrated. Second, weighing the costs of obedience to sustainability’s commandments is considered unworthy. Third, the sustainability crusade supplies acolytes with a worldview that infuses their lives with purpose and meaning. Fourth, the sustainability movement uses apocalyptic rhetoric to express its eschatology. Fifth, the church of sustainability seeks converts, encourages conformity to orthodoxy and regards rival interpretations of reality as heretical impediments to salvation.



Will’s contempt bubbled over as his column discussed a green-backed push for colleges to rid fossil fuel holdings from their endowments. He astutely points out:   




The effect of these decisions on the consumption of fossil fuels will be nil; the effect on the growth of institutions’ endowments will be negative. The effect on alumni giving should be substantial because divesting institutions are proclaiming that the goal of expanding educational resources is less important than the striking of righteous poses—if there can be anything righteous about flamboyant futility.



Not only will their effect on the consumption of fossil fuels be “nil” but so too will their effect on the course of future global warming, as we pointed out in this tweet (in response to Bill McKibben’s attempt to shame Harvard into divesting from fossil fuels):   






  
  
Will ultimately offers up this modest proposal:   




College tuitions are soaring in tandem with thickening layers of administrative bloat. So here is a proposal: Hundreds of millions could be saved, with no cost to any institution’s core educational mission, by eliminating every position whose title contains the word “sustainability”—and, while we are at it, “diversity,” “multicultural” or “inclusivity.” The result would be higher education higher than the propaganda-saturated version we have, and more sustainable.



Be sure the check out his whole column, here.   
  
And finally, on a lighter note, we came across an--uh--interesting article in FirstPost.com, an India-based news site.   
  
Apparently a team of British researchers (with little else to do?) dug through popular song lyrics to determine how our moods were influenced by the weather (through song) and how climate change may alter this in the future. According to FirstPost.com, here’s what they found:   




Climate change is predicted to intrude into almost every area of life—from where we live, to what we eat and whom we war with. Now music can be added to the list.   
  
That's the unusual idea put forward by British researchers on Tuesday, who say the weather has powerfully but discreetly influenced the soundtrack to our lives. And tastes in songs are likely to change as the climate shifts.   
  
Fancy listening to the Beatles' ""Here Comes The Sun"" when you are grinding out yet another long, sweaty heatwave? ""These assumptions we have about certain weather being good and certain weather being bad, like sun being good—that might change,"" researcher Karen Aplin of the University of Oxford said at a European Geosciences Union meeting in Vienna.



The article was headlined “Wonder Why Our Songs Are Getting Worse? It Might Be because of Global Warming.”   
  
That, perhaps, may explain why certain preferences for “oldies"" don't often include disco—after all, the '70s were a relatively cold period!

"DURHAM, N. C.  —   As North Carolina State’s star freshman, Dennis Smith Jr.   down Coach K Court one last time on Monday night to put an exclamation point on the Wolfpack’s   upset of the Blue Devils, many sports fans received an opportunity to take up one of their favorite pastimes: hating Duke. For Duke students and supporters, the reaction to the program’s first loss to N. C. State at Cameron Indoor Stadium since 1995  —   before some of them were born  —   was different. “It was a really tough one,” Richard Liu, a senior who attended the game, wrote in an email, “because N. C. State is a team we really should have beaten, especially at home. ” It has been a rare year of disappointments for Duke. The Blue Devils began the season at No. 1 but lost the top ranking before Thanksgiving. At times, they have been without their best player, Grayson Allen (suspended for tripping an opponent) several promising freshmen from their   recruiting class (injuries) and their Hall of Fame Coach, Mike Krzyzewski (lost to a back operation this month, and still out). Those misfortunes, of course, mean it has also been a rare year of schadenfreude for many outside Duke. But perhaps there is something to be said for what Duke offers its fans. At a time when entire segments of the country have retreated into private echo chambers of elation or fear, sports is not a terrible place to try to put oneself in another’s shoes. Call it sympathy for the Blue Devils. “Imagine how you’d feel if you’d gone to school there or if you played there,” said Jay Bilas, an ESPN commentator who played for Duke in the 1980s and later was an assistant coach for the Blue Devils. “Like, it’s a blast. ” It is true that other fan bases  —   almost all of them, actually  —   are more in need of a   . Since 1985  —   the year the N. C. A. A. tournament expanded to 64 teams and college basketball began its climb to the status of national spectacle  —   Duke has been the country’s most successful program, with 12 Final Four appearances and five national titles. In recent years, at least, it has also been the most popular, according to the Harris Poll. Other polarizing teams’ pitches to casual fans are aggressively inclusive witness the Yankees’ rechristening as America’s team after the Sept. 11 attacks or the Dallas Cowboys’ gargantuan Xanadu, ATT Stadium. But Duke, a tidy private university ranked eighth in U. S. News  World Report’s list of America’s top colleges, with a team led by a coach who moralizes about the realities of college basketball even as he benefits from them, seems to revel in its superiority. (One student’s sign at Monday night’s game read, “North Carolina State is the North Carolina State of basketball. ”) The student section at Duke frequently serves as the university’s   chest to a national audience. The Cameron Crazies, filling up the risers on the western side of the arena, are aggressive in trying to knock opposing players  . Sometimes, as when they chant, “You let the whole team down,” after poor plays, they are fair and funny other times, they have pushed the envelope, even crossed lines. When a sign targeted a North Carolina player with the words “J. R. Can’t Reid” in 1988, Tar Heels Coach Dean Smith argued the taunt had racial undertones. When Duke hosted Michigan State this season, one sign mocked the continuing   crisis in Flint, Mich.: “The water tastes better in North Carolina. ” (A Duke basketball spokesman condemned that sign.) Duke students also continue to produce cheer sheets for games that, on one side, contain   dirt  —   opposition research. Monday night’s dirt sheet included the email address of one Wolfpack player, a past criminal charge against another and the suggestion that a third could be taunted for his first name. Michael Schoenfeld, a Duke spokesman, said the university would not “hesitate to criticize things that legitimately deserve criticism,” but he insisted that college students were roughly the same at all colleges and that   vitriol was a response to the university’s athletic and academic accomplishments. “The people who are supporters of Duke and like Duke understand what this university is and can do,” Schoenfeld said, “and that will inevitably create some friction or backlash. So be it. ” The Duke dynamic has been magnified this season with the blossoming of Allen, the team’s most compelling villain in nearly three decades. His infamy outside Durham is equaled only by that of a player so despised that he became the subject of an ESPN documentary titled “I Hate Christian Laettner. ” Allen is a junior whom some pegged as a strong contender for player of the year. But he has provoked public ire by tripping opponents at least three times in the past two seasons. The most recent incident, against Elon on Dec. 21, prompted a   suspension, the loss of his captaincy and a news media firestorm that longtime Duke observers labeled unprecedented. “I’ve never seen anything like this,” Bilas said. “It feels different. ” Yet to walk past the   tent city of Krzyzewskiville and into the preposterously tiny Cameron on a January evening is to understand why Duke inspires passion not only among its detractors. “Because Duke is a relatively small school, you feel like you are personally invested in it, because when you see the players around campus, they really feel like classmates,” said Tara Bansal, the student government president. The fact that students will put down stakes  —   up to 100 tents  —   for several weeks for a chance at prime seating inside Cameron (particularly for games against North Carolina) is an indisputable testament to the students’ zeal. One must be zealous  —   and drunk on one’s youth (and perhaps other things)  —   to spend dozens of nights in an unheated tent for the sake of a good view. And although one might scoff at the tent city  —   which, given Duke’s demographics, is sort of like an Occupy Wall Street for, rather than against, the 1 percent  —   tent life is rough. According to byzantine rules, tents must be occupied at all times and are subject to   by line monitors. The only bathrooms are in an adjacent gym. On Monday night, the ground near the tents was muddy. Many of the   city’s denizens could be seen huddled in their canvas shelters reading thick textbooks. “We’ve got ” said Evi Alexopoulos, a freshman whose tent’s rules require her to spend several nights there every week. “Outlets are hard to find. ” Among the rewards, though, are the prime seats in Cameron, which, with an official capacity of 9, 314, is half the size of North Carolina’s Dean Smith Center and significantly smaller than the home arenas of nearly every other college program of Duke’s pedigree and popularity. “There isn’t a bad seat,” said Herb Neubauer, who is known as Crazy Towel Guy for his practice of waving a towel to rile the crowd from his seat in the upper deck. Even so, student attendance is down this season, according to The Duke Chronicle  —   most likely part of a general trend in college sports  —   and loyalties have been tested by the furor over Allen. “I have good friends at Syracuse, so I get bullied,” said Kit Devine, a freshman. “Grayson has been a pretty big deal. ” The season is hardly lost. Duke is   and still in the top 25, although it needs to get healthy, both on the court and on the sideline. Allen needs to return to the attacking style that made him a    . Jayson Tatum, Marques Bolden and Harry Giles, the heralded freshmen who missed time with injuries, need to develop a better feel for the college game. But even the prospect of a disappointing season  —   more drama questions about the longevity of Krzyzewski, who turns 70 next month a lackluster postseason performance despite lofty preseason expectations  —   is unlikely to bring the Cameron Crazies back to sanity. “I get what they’re saying,” Alexopoulos, the   freshman, said of the haters. But, she added, “I wouldn’t question my passion. ”"
"When it comes to tackling climate change the UK is still taking baby steps. A lot more needs to be done – and fast – to hit the 2050 net zero carbon emission targets, which involves offsetting any emissions by absorbing an equivalent amount from the atmosphere. While this process can build on future innovations, the technologies are actually already in place to make a real difference – technologies that, of all things, are based on the skills of the oil and gas industry. The world is currently approaching an average global temperature increase of 1ºC compared to pre-industrial times, largely attributed to increasing atmospheric levels of carbon dioxide (CO2). Meanwhile, the BP Energy Outlook predicts a future increase in the use of fossil fuels. The world population is growing and more people will be moving from low incomes to higher ones, resulting in a higher energy demand towards the end of the century. So achieving net zero carbon emissions by 2050 will be a tremendous challenge, requiring engineering solutions at mega-scale.  The world already has effective engineering solutions to manage climate change and to limit global temperatures from rising above 1.5°C – a target set by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). But there is a desperate lack of conviction from politicians and society to address the climate emergency. Morgan Stanley estimated that meeting the 2050 targets requires an investment of US$50 trillion. Put into perspective, that’s about 50 times the company value of Apple. The report states that investments need to be in electric cars, renewables, hydrogen, carbon capture and storage (CCS) and biofuels. Many of these technologies rely on the need to use the geological subsurface for producing heat in the form of geothermal energy, permanently storing carbon dioxide or for temporarily storing hydrogen. For CCS, CO2 is pumped into porous underground formations (such as water-bearing saline formations or depleted oil and gas reservoirs) at a depth of 1km or more, where a tight sealing layer prevents these fluids from leaking towards the surface.  In Australia, for example, oil and gas giant Chevron has started a large-scale CCS project where 3.4-4 million tons of CO2 will be stored beneath the seafloor annually, but this initiative is by no means unique. There are currently around 18 international CCS projects that are removing between 30 and 40 million tons of CO2 each year. While these figures may sound impressive, they only represent about 10% of emissions produced by the UK alone each year. CCS is a technology that can be linked to large-scale fossil fuel combustion for decarbonising the energy sector. It can also be linked to direct CO2 capture from the air or CO2 produced from using biofuels, both having the potential to achieve net negative CO2 emissions.  According to the recent IPCC special report, CCS, when deployed globally, could amount to a reduction of hundreds of billions of tons of CO2 emissions by 2050. The scale of the problem is vast and existing global projects need to be scaled-up between 100 and 1,000 times their current size to be truly effective. Another energy solution – where size is not an issue – is harnessing the tremendous heat that lies beneath the Earth’s surface to generate electricity and heat. Investment in these geothermal energy projects is increasing, but not at the pace required. Geothermal energy can provide decentralised, affordable and continuous energy to heat homes or produce electricity. While this energy is right beneath our feet, progress on adopting it is slow due to a lack of investment and political support compared to other renewable energies such as wind and solar. Read more: Explainer: what is geothermal energy?  While the operational cost of geothermal energy production is competitive with other renewable energies, the downside is that investment costs are high, especially when producing from a greater depth. As a consequence, installed capacity is less than 1% of the global electricity consumption. The same is true of progressing towards a hydrogen economy. Hydrogen can be produced in many ways and used to heat homes, fuel cars or produce electricity. Hydrogen reacts with oxygen to form pure water. It can be produced from renewable energies or from natural gas in a refining process. The drawback of a hydrogen economy is that it produces CO2 as a by-product, which must ultimately be integrated into the CCS chain. Hydrogen consumption is demand-driven while renewable energies produce energy independent of demand. Overproduction can temporarily be stored in geological formations, and back produced when demand is increasing. All these technologies depend on using the subsurface either as a temporary or permanent solution. It requires the expertise of geoscientists and petroleum engineers – highly skilled specialists who have delivered a fossil fuel-based economy in the past, and who will contribute to providing energy in the future. But more than that, it calls for visionary political ideas and legislation. For many people it is a crucial issue in the December general election. But given what is required, society has still not yet fully recognised the urgency required to combat climate change. An energy transition at this scale will change the way people live and work, but it will also require people to properly grasp the scale of the problem. Student activist group Fridays for Future and groundbreaking young campaigners like Greta Thunberg pave the way. But only political leadership, policies and funding can make it happen.

"The news can seem grim. Refugee crises, extreme weather and wars plague the globe. Cellphones have exploded. America is bitterly divided. Mary Tyler Moore died. Even the doomsday clock has been reset. But we thought you could use a break, whatever your politics, your fears, your troubles. The nation’s zoos agree. Welcome to the Great National Cute Animal   of 2017. Over the past two days, zoos and aquariums have dominated the conversation on Twitter with photo after photo of adorable animals. And the world cracked a smile. It all started, according to  The   with a Smithsonian National Zoo announcement on Wednesday of the birth of a female gray seal on Jan. 21, a pup described as “nursing, moving and bonding well with mom. ” The baby’s mother, a    gray seal named Kara, set a record for being the oldest seal of her kind to give birth in a zoo. (The Washington Post even had a Facebook Live presentation of her ultrasound in December.) The seal’s birth was a reminder that gray seals moved from the endangered list to being a species of least concern in 2016 by the International Union for Conservation of Nature. Their numbers rose to more than 600, 000 worldwide. The Smithsonian birth announcement set off a ripple online, and generated a hashtag  —   #CuteAnimalTweetOff  —   which grew into a viral phenomenon as zoos posted photos of cute and fuzzy pandas, otters, orangutans and tiger cubs. There is even a baby turtle, as well as a pun or two, in the fray. “Here we have an otterly adorable submission to #CuteAnimalTweetOff,” the Aquarium of the Pacific said on Twitter with a photo of otters. “Leapin’ Lemurs the #cuteanimaltweetoff is going strong,” the Maryland Zoo wrote with a photo of a lemur. The postings have gone international, suggesting that maybe, just maybe, we can find common ground across borders by looking at cute animals. The ZSL London Zoo raised the bar with a few seconds of video of its tiger cubs Karis and Achilles, born in June. Sarah Janet Hill, a host at Radio Free Radio in Hampton, Va. has been credited with giving the Smithsonian announcement the online bump it needed to spread. “I thought, ‘Our seals are cuter than that,’ ” Ms. Hill is quoted as saying in The  . So she retweeted the announcement to the Virginia Aquarium and Marine Science Center, which took up the challenge. The viral response to the pup’s birth announcement has been a pleasant surprise for the Smithsonian Zoo. Annalisa Meyer, a spokeswoman, said on Thursday that the seal pup had not yet been given a name, a process that includes taking suggestions from the public or giving a sponsor the opportunity to come up with one. “We have never set off a cute animal challenge,” Ms. Meyer said. “Will it be the last? Maybe not. We are open to more cute  . ” But to what end? Maybe the point is just relief from the drumbeat of sober news. “It’s been a really fun day, and I’m just glad there was something light to talk about today,” Ms. Hill told The  . “There’s been some heavy news lately, and it’s been fun to distract people with this fun stuff. ” “Everyone wants their zoo to win,” she added, but really, there were no winners or losers in the standoff. Just cute animals."
"**As if piling up sandbags before a flood, Apple was well prepared to face a backlash over its decision to remove an app used by Hong Kong protesters.**
But the firmâs carefully-worded statement offering its reasoning has left China watchers, politicians - and some famed Apple supporters - wholly unconvinced.
âAppleâs decision to cave to Communist Chinaâs demands is unacceptable,â tweeted Rick Scott, a Republican senator for Florida.
âPutting profits above the human rights and dignity of the people of Hong Kong is wrong. No ifs, ands or buts about it.â
Late on Wednesday, the firm started briefing journalists on the move, pushing its view that the HKmap.live was being âused in ways that endanger law enforcement and residentsâ.
On Thursday morning, Apple chief executive Tim Cook posted an internal memo.
âItâs out of my great respect for the work you do every day that I want to share the way we went about making this decision,â he wrote.
âOver the past several days we received credible information, from the Hong Kong Cybersecurity and Technology Crime Bureau, as well as from users in Hong Kong, that the app was being used maliciously to target individual officers for violence and to victimize individuals and property where no police are present. This use put the app in violation of Hong Kong law.
âSimilarly, widespread abuse clearly violates our App Store guidelines barring personal harm.â
Long-time Apple commentator John Gruber wrote of Mr Cookâs email: âI canât recall an Apple memo or statement that crumbles so quickly under scrutiny.â
Apple has yet to provide any additional information about those claimed incidents. Charles Mok, a Hong Kong legislator who represents the IT industry in the territory, posted a letter to Mr Cook on Twitter.
âThere are numerous cases of innocent passers-by in the neighbourhood injured by the Kong Kong Police Forceâs excessive force in crowd dispersal operations,â he wrote.
âThe user-generated information shared using HKmap.live in fact helps citizens avoid areas where pedestrians not involved in any criminal activities might be subjected to police brutality which many human rights organisations such as Amnesty International have observed.â
Mr Mok went on to argue that users on major social networks, such as Facebook or Twitter, also share information about police activity - but were not being held to the same standard.
âWe Hongkongers will definitely look closely at whether Apple chooses to uphold its commitment to free expression and other basic human rights, or become an accomplice for Chinese censorship and oppression.â
Apple has not responded to the letter.
Appleâs decision comes against a backdrop of major American firms being seen as bowing to political pressure from Beijing.
In just the past week, the NBA grovelled its way around a tweet from a team executive supporting the protests, while video games published Activision Blizzard banned e-sports competitor Ng Wai ""Blitzchung"" Chung for showing his support for the movement.
And Google removed a role-playing game called âRevolution of Our Timesâ from its app store after deeming it violated its policies on depicting âsensitive eventsâ (the player plays the role of a Hong Kong protester). According to the Wall Street Journal, Hong Kong authorities had contacted Google with concerns about that app - though the company has said it decided to take action before any communication took place.
One bucking of the trend, however, came via Tim Sweeney, chief executive of Epic Games, the firm behind online multiplayer game Fortnite.
âEpic supports everyoneâs right to speak freely,â he wrote on Twitter, in response to a question about gamers voicing support for Hong Kong protesters. Chinese tech giant Tencent owns 40% of the firm.
âChina players of Fortnite are free to criticize the US or criticize Epic just as equally as all others,â Mr Sweeney said.
In characteristically astute timing, an episode of Comedy Centralâs South Park earlier this month led Chinese censors to âdelete virtually every clip, episode and online discussion of the show from Chinese streaming services, social media and even fan pagesâ, according to the Hollywood Reporter.
The episode featured four of the showâs main characters working on a film script that gets constantly altered so that it could be distributed in China.
âWell you know what they say,â the filmâs director in the show says, âYou gotta lower your ideals of freedom if you wanna suck on the warm teat of China.â
In Appleâs case that means revenues that are on course to exceed $40bn this year - almost a fifth of the firmâs total global sales. Appleâs reliance on Chinese manufacturing means the relationship goes far deeper than just local sales. The firm has 10,000 direct employees in the firm; the economy around Appleâs presence in China is responsible for around 5m jobs.
What happens next depends on the extent to which China feels its hardline stance is working - and there are indications officials are becoming wary. According to reporting in the New York Times, Beijing is concerned its actions are drawing more attention to the protests and harming the countryâs standing on the global stage, adding yet more tension to relations with the US as trade talks restart in Washington.
The rows have also bolstered concerns that China has few qualms when it comes to making demands of companies both based in the Communist state, as well as those who merely want to do business there.
âWhat would Huawei do if they were the dominant 5G provider for a country, and that countryâs leaders said the wrong thing?â speculated Elliott Zaagman, who covers Chinese business and investment,

"The Republican national convention, dominated by veneration of Donald Trump and bleak warnings of the dangers of socialism, has completely ignored the climate crisis, an omission that has disturbed some conservatives who warn the party risks being left behind by voters. Convention speeches have included Eric Trump praising the beauty of the Grand Canyon, a region his father’s administration has proposed opening to mining for uranium, while several speakers have attacked Joe Biden, the Democratic presidential nominee, as a threat to oil and gas worker jobs. But Trump’s renomination event has not laid out any plan for the climate crisis, nor even any acknowledgment of it. “It is disappointing,” said Danielle Butcher, chief operating officer of the American Conservation Coalition, an organization of young conservatives. “To see no mention of climate change at the RNC, no update in the official platform? It feels unrepresentative of science [and] of the progress we have made as a party.” Butcher said the Republican party’s base has shifted to become more concerned by the climate crisis, with young conservatives placing particular importance upon the issue. “Trump may not be on board yet, but there is movement, and we’d love for him to join us,” she said. The convention has taken place to a jarring news backdrop of hundreds of wildfires torching California, burning an area the size of Rhode Island and forcing tens of thousands of people to evacuate while shrouding millions more in harmful smoke. Meanwhile, Hurricane Laura has torn through the Gulf of Mexico and is set to bring an “unsurvivable storm surge” to Texas and Louisiana that may reach 30 miles inland. Climate scientists have found that hot, dry conditions caused by climate change are helpful fuel wildfire conditions, with global heating doubling the area burned in the US west since the 1980s. Similarly, rising ocean temperatures are aiding the formation of more powerful hurricanes in the Atlantic. The severity of such disasters – along with record heatwaves that have baked regions from the Arctic to Death Valley, increasingly dire scientific reports and a roiling youth protest movement – have helped spur growing alarm among US voters over the climate crisis. Pollsters have been surprised to find that concern over climate has remained robust even as the Covid-19 pandemic emerged as an immediate, deadly threat to Americans. Over the past decade, climate has become a deeply divisive issue between Democrats and Republicans but polls have shown moderate and independent voters increasingly accept the science of climate change and want action while there is now solid support for regulating carbon dioxide even among Republican voters. Some Republicans fret this growing bloc of voters is being surrendered to the Democrats, with Biden’s $2tn plan to cut greenhouse gas emissions contrasting sharply with Trump, who has long disparaged climate science, triggered the US withdrawal from the Paris climate agreement and overseen the rollback of dozens of climate and other environmental protections. “Trump believes he can scare people in the suburbs about marauding Black Lives Matter protesters coming to burn their house down, but people in the suburbs actually want to talk about climate change,” said Bob Inglis, a South Carolina Republican former member of Congress. “There’s a fear in the party of contradicting Trump but there will be a reappraisal at some point because we won’t be able win without talking about climate. Trump may be able to eke out an electoral college victory this time, but that won’t happen again with four more years of demographic change.” Kevin McCarthy, the minority House leader who has warned of the dangers of Republican irrelevancy on climate, in January unveiled a plan to help capture carbon dioxide emissions from coal-fired power plants and an effort to plant billions more trees to suck CO2 from the air. The plan failed to get resounding support from other Republicans, however, and was derided by environmentalists as woefully insufficient for the massive emissions cuts needed to avoid disastrous climate change. “People are coming round to this but we don’t have the luxury of time,” Inglis said. “We are seeing the whites of climate change’s eyes as it is charging at us and we have to take a shot. The greatest consequence isn’t lost elections, it’s that real people are going to be hurt.”"

We’d be remiss if we didn’t acknowledge Winter Storm “Cato” is probably going to do a pretty good job limiting the government tomorrow, as well as shortening tempers throughout the country if it jams up the BosNYWash flyway on the day before Thanksgiving. Surely many climate alarmists will blame this garden‐​variety coastal cyclone on global warming.   
  
  
Rational minds should know that these types of storms are largely powered by the midlatitude jet stream. The jet is nature’s way of dissipating the difference in energy between warm tropical air and polar cold on a rotating earth—the larger the temperature difference is between the tropics and the North Pole, the more powerful it is. Greenhouse gas‐​induced climate change warms the poles much more than the tropics, which reduces the temperature difference and should make storms of Cato’s ilk _less_ powerful and/​or frequent.   
  
  
Many pundits are fond of blaming these storms on changes in the “polar vortex” (which itself has existed ever since the earth acquired an atmosphere) caused by global warming, a notion that was thoroughly debunked by Colorado State’s Elizabeth Barnes last year in _Geophysical Research Letters_.
"
"Earth Hour is a sacred rite of the global warming religion whose message is: confess, do penance (turn out the lights for an hour once a year), and your sins will be forgiven.

The harsh reality is that if we must cut CO2 emissions by 90%, then we have to cut our energy use by about 70%. The only proven alternative to fossil fuels is nuclear, but reactors are expensive, take years to build and have been ruled out by the Rudd government. While “dam” is a dirty word, there will be no more hydro power. Using gas for base load electricity generation is a criminal waste. Only the dangerously deluded believe that solar and wind will ever supply more than a small fraction of energy demand. It will be decades before geothermal “hot fractured rock” power is contributing significantly to the grid – if technical problems and the tyranny of distance can be overcome. “Bio-fuels” are environmentally devastating; incur a carbon-debt that won’t be repaid for decades; and are already causing global food shortages. Nuclear Fusion’s promise of unlimited clean energy could be a century away – if it is ever economically viable. “Clean coal” is expensive, unproven, and faces significant opposition from the environmental movement.
Earth Hour should be expanded to Earth Month. Electric lighting, television, computers, home heating and air-conditioning, private motor vehicles and air transportation would be banned. All energy-intensive industries would be shut down and affected workers stood down without pay.
By giving people a small taste of life under future energy rationing, and testing their resolve, Earth Month would be more than just empty, feel-good symbolism.

"**Ethiopia took the lead in creating Africa's continental organisation, the African Union (AU), but Ethiopia analyst Alex de Waal argues that its actions are now jeopardising the body's founding principles.**
Shortly before three former African heads of state arrived in Ethiopia's capital, Addis Ababa, to seek a peaceful resolution to the conflict in the northern Tigray region, Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed ordered what he called the ""final phase of our rule of law operations"".
This was a remarkable rebuff.
Former Presidents Ellen Johnson Sirleaf of Liberia, Joachim Chissano of Mozambique and Kgalema Motlanthe of South Africa met Mr Abiy on Friday, but were told that the Ethiopian government would continue its military operations.
Mr Abiy also said that they could not meet any representatives of the group Ethiopia is fighting in Tigray, the Tigray People's Liberation Front (TPLF), which the prime minister has dismissed as a ""criminal clique"".
Citing the Charter of the United Nations in a statement earlier in the week, the prime minister insisted that the federal government was engaged in a domestic law-enforcement operation and the principle of non-interference in the internal affairs of a sovereign nation applied.
But Nigerian legal expert Chidi Odinkalu argues that Ethiopia is using the charter to escalate a war, the opposite of its pacific intent, saying that the ""audacity of this position is disconcerting"".
He points out that the conflict is already internationalised, because Eritrea is entangled and refugees are crossing into Sudan.
Also, the United Nations has adopted principles to prevent states abusing the doctrine of non-interference to give themselves impunity to commit atrocities.
Since 1981, conflict resolution has been a duty and a right. Since 2005, states have had the responsibility to protect civilians in conflict.
In rebuffing the African mediators, Mr Abiy is not just turning down a peace initiative. He is challenging the foundational principles of the African Union itself.
Article 4(g) of the AU's Constitutive Act - to which Ethiopia acceded in 2002 - does specify ""non-interference by any member state in the internal affairs of another"".
But this is immediately followed by Article 4(h), which gives the AU the right ""to intervene in a member stateâ¦ in respect of grave circumstances, namely: war crimes, genocide and crimes against humanity"".
This so-called ""duty of non-indifference"" was adopted in the wake of the 1994 genocide in Rwanda.
It was first formulated by an International Panel of Eminent Personalities, strongly supported by Ethiopia, which was brought together to recommend how Africa should prevent such atrocities in the future. ""Non-indifference"" is Africa's version of the UN's ""responsibility to protect"".
The Ethiopian government has itself accused the TPLF of carrying out atrocities, and observers fear that when the news blackout is lifted, evidence of war crimes by both sides will come to light.
There are unconfirmed reports that Eritrean troops have crossed the border and rounded up Eritrean refugees in United Nations camps in Tigray, which would be a violation of the United Nations convention on refugees.
The Organisation of African Unity (OAU) was founded in 1963, with its headquarters in Addis Ababa, with the aim of consolidating the newly won independence of African states.
Locating the OAU in Ethiopia was a diplomatic triumph for Emperor Haile Selassie, who had long championed international law.
Famously, his 1936 speech at the League of Nations predicted that if Italy's invasion of Ethiopia were to go unpunished, the world would be bathed in blood.
The OAU was a common front for Africa's liberation from colonial and racist rule.
But it also served as a club of autocrats, who held to their common interest of staying in power no matter what. Tanzania's founding President, Julius Nyerere, lamented that it had become ""a trade union of heads of state"".
By the 1990s it was clear that the OAU needed to be refashioned to be able to respond to Africa's wars, coups and atrocities, and in 2002 the AU was created with a far more ambitious agenda of promoting peace and democracy.
Since then it has developed a set of mechanisms that include suspending countries where there is an unconstitutional change in government, and offering help to mediate conflicts, along with an obligation for conflict-afflicted countries to welcome good-faith peacemaking efforts.
Mr Abiy himself intervened in the Sudanese crisis last year when he sought a peaceful resolution to the confrontation between the pro-democracy movement and the military, which had unseated President Omar al-Bashir.
The formula for Sudan's transition to democracy was drawn up on the AU's template.
But the AU is not a strong institution. It has a low budget and cannot impose its will.
More powerful states and organisations can overrule it - as Nato did when the AU sought a negotiated settlement to the Libya conflict in 2011, but the United States, European and Arab countries pursued regime change.
The AU's real value lies in its soft power: it articulates the norms of peace and cooperation and persuades African leaders to go along, knowing that they rise together and sink together.
Over time, it has proven its value: Africa has become more democratic and peaceable.
A generation ago, African diplomatic efforts to avoid conflicts or resolve them were rare. Today, they are standard practice.
In a statement announcing the three envoys' mission, South African President Cyril Ramaphosa, who is the current AU chairperson, reaffirmed the organisation's position that the conflict ""should be brought to an end through dialogue"".
But it was couched in standard diplomatic courtesies and lacked bite.
In comparable situations - such as Libya or Sudan - the AU chair has convened a special heads of state meeting of the AU's Peace and Security Council. Mr Ramaphosa has not done that.
South Africa - which is currently one of three African nations on the UN Security Council - postponed a discussion on Ethiopia at the UN on Monday, citing the need to hear the envoys' report first.
Because it hosts its headquarters, Ethiopia has an outsized influence on the day-to-day affairs of the AU.
Other African countries have long suspected that it has a double standard, giving Ethiopia leeway that it does not accord to other countries. That did not matter so much when Ethiopia was active in supporting mediation efforts and peacekeeping operations, especially in Somalia, South Sudan and Sudan.
Now, many are asking if it has brazenly crossed a red line.
The Ethiopian government has purged Tigrayan officers from AU and UN peacekeeping missions, according to a report in Foreign Policy magazine quoting a UN document. It also demanded that the AU Commission dismiss its head of security, who was a Tigrayan and whose loyalties were questioned because of the conflict.
And now Mr Abiy has effectively rejected Africa's highest-level mediators, politely recording only that they ""imparted their wisdom, insights and readiness to support in any way they are needed"".
After Ethiopian federal troops occupied the Tigrayan capital Mekelle on Saturday, Mr Abiy declared his operation complete - implying that he doesn't need peacemakers. But the African mediators - all from countries that have long experience of armed conflicts - are not likely to be so confident.
The AU headquarters was built on the site of Ethiopia's notorious central prison, known as Alem Bekagn - meaning ""farewell to the world"" in Amharic.
Thousands of political prisoners were imprisoned there, many tortured and executed, during the military dictatorship of the 1970s and 1980s. That symbolism is not lost on African civil society activists, who wonder if they are becoming prisoners of their Ethiopian hosts.
A senior AU diplomat remarked on Friday: ""Abiy thinks that the AU is for others, not for Ethiopia.""
Mr Abiy's rejection of mediation harkens back to an earlier era in which African civil wars were ended by force of arms, not peace agreements - leaving grievances to fester.
It threatens to make a mockery of the African Union's hard-won norms and principles of peacemaking.
Alex de Waal is the executive director of the World Peace Foundation at the Fletcher School of Global Affairs at Tufts University in the US. He worked for the AU on Sudan in different capacities from 2005 to 2012."
"**Shaquille O'Neal has spoken out in support of a basketball executive's comments that sparked a row between the NBA and China.**
The basketball legend said Houston Rockets manager Daryl Morey ""was right"" to tweet support for pro-democracy protesters in Hong Kong.
The NBA is hugely popular in China and Mr Morey's comments unleashed a wave of anger in the country.
Sponsorship and telecast deals have been cut in the lucrative market.
Speaking on TNT Television's Inside the NBA show on Tuesday, O'Neal defended the Houston Rockets manager's tweet that ignited the dispute.
""Daryl Morey was right,"" he said.
""Whenever you see something wrong going on anywhere in the world, you should have the right to say 'That's not right' and that's what he did,"" O'Neal said.
Mr Morey tweeted an image earlier this month captioned ""Fight For Freedom. Stand With Hong Kong"". He later apologised for the post.
It came in the midst of months of protests in Hong Kong sparked by proposed changes to an extradition bill.
Though the changes have been abandoned, the unrest has continued, expanding into demands for greater democracy.
Basketball is among the most popular sports in China with 300 million people playing the game, according to the NBA.
The league has around 800 million fans in the country supporting millions of dollars of business.
NBA hall of famer O'Neal noted the significance of the Chinese market to the US and pointed to ""free speech"" in his defence of Mr Morey's comments.
""We as American people do a lot of business in China. And one of our best values here in America is free speech.
""We're allowed to say what we want to say and we're allowed to speak up about injustices, and that's just how it goes.
""And if people don't understand that, that's something that they have to deal with.""
O'Neal is not the first basketball star to speak out on the feud.
Earlier this month the NBA's best-known player LeBron James weighed in on the row, saying Mr Morey ""wasn't educated"" on the situation.

Guest essay by Jim Steele
Director emeritus Sierra Nevada Field Campus, San Francisco State University
A recent Guardian article “Wild bees on the decline in key US agricultural ecosystems” adds further support to my analysis that debunked an earlier claim by Kerr 2015 that climate change had been killing wild bees. I had argued that an agricultural trend where increasing acreage of natural and agricultural habitats have been increasingly converted to corn for silage and biofuels in addition to the importation of exotic European diseases. Using corn for biofuel makes no sense in terms of CO2 reduction or energy efficiency, et due to global warming hysteria government agencies have subsidized the spread of corn fields. Corn is wind pollinated and provides no nectar resources for pollinators. Corn has been steadily replacing pollinator friendly wild plants and pollinator friendly agricultural plants like soybean.
Cornfields also require irrigation that has also increased the extraction of groundwater. Groundwater extraction has now been projected to raise sea level by 0.87 mm/year, accounting for 25% of the estimate current sea level rise.
According to the Guradian, “The study estimated that wild bee numbers diminished in 23% of the continental United States between 2008 and 2013 in a trend driven by conversion of their natural habitat into farmland including corn for biofuel production.” [Emphasis mine]
“The study followed a 2014 memorandum by Barack Obama creating a task force to study pollinator losses. The task force in May called for preserving wide swathes of pollinator habitats.”
Inappropriate biofuel subsidies are driven by CO2 alarmism. As I continue to warn, bad climate science will only lead to bad environmental stewardship!

"After 10am, it’s too hot for Hajar Logan to work upstairs, so she moves her home office to the basement. By 11am, she can’t leave her house until the sun sets. The heat is too “suffocating”, she says, in her mostly tree-less neighborhood of Dorchester in Boston. Logan is diabetic, so she’s prone to dehydration. The heat makes it harder for her body to cool off, retain water and manage insulin. She doesn’t have air conditioning because it would be too expensive to cool her entire home. She uses fans instead. “When it gets hot through July and August, there are weeks where I can’t do anything, I can’t think,” she said. “The only way to survive is to stay in the basement.” During the day, her kids are shut in too. Dorchester – a majority-black area where roughly half of the population makes under $50,000 a year – lacks shaded green spaces within walking distance for them to play. Logan, who is a climate and transit development director at the Boston environmental justice non-profit Alternatives for Community and Environment, is also concerned for her friends whose health conditions are worsening as the summers get hotter in the face of the global climate crisis. One recently had a third stroke, and another was diagnosed with heart failure. “Especially the elderly,” she said. “Their bodies can’t handle it.” But there is one simple thing that might help. As American cities cope with rising temperatures and the public health burdens they impose, some are starting to invest millions of dollars to plant and maintain trees to keep communities cooler as the world warms. In fact, increasing tree coverage is one of the best solutions cities have for fighting the “urban heat island effect” in neighborhoods that are often blanketed with pavement and lack greenery. Those heat islands can experience temperatures that are up to 10C hotter than more canopied spaces. For example, Washington DC plans to cover 40% of the city with trees by 2032. Seattle’s goal, which it has already almost achieved, is 30% coverage by 2037. But experts warn that unless city blueprints emphasize racial equity in their plans for more trees, they may benefit wealthy neighborhoods rather than the poorer ones that need them the most. Tree equity is about more than just planting more trees. You can plant more trees and not achieve equity “Tree equity is about more than just planting more trees. You can plant more trees and not achieve equity,” said Eric Candela, senior manager of the Community ReLeaf program at the not-for-profit American Forests. “The question is, what are municipalities willing and prepared to do about it now that they’ve identified the problem?” Discriminatory practices like redlining – when banks refused or limited loans and mortgages within inner-city neighborhoods – are among the biggest predicting factors for heat inequities, Candela said. In a study of 108 US urban areas, formerly redlined neighborhoods were hotter than their non-redlined neighbors 94% of the time. Research shows low-income areas are particularly tree-less. An NPR analysis of 97 of the most populous US cities found that in three-quarters of cities the hotter areas tend to be poorer. The heat makes it more expensive for people who are already on stretched budgets to cool their homes too, especially in the midst of coronavirus stay-at-home orders. Extreme heat already kills more Americans than all other extreme weather events combined, and projections show that by 2100 deaths from heat may surpass the current rate of deaths from all infectious diseases combined. As that death toll rises, it is likely to be highest among people of color who are disproportionately affected by heat-related illnesses like worsened asthma and pregnancy difficulties, and who are more likely to live in hotter neighborhoods. ••• In Baltimore, the tree inequity is starkly apparent. The high-income neighborhood of Roland Park is two-thirds covered with canopy, while the lower-income Broadway East has about 10% tree coverage, according to an analysis by the Howard Center for Investigative Journalism. In San Diego, the neighborhoods most affected by redlining are the hottest. Paradise Hills, which has 91% minority homeowners, experiences temperatures 3.4C above the city average. The majority white Heritage Park neighborhood is 3C below the city average. A review of tree coverage in Tampa, Florida, also found fewer trees in majority-black neighborhoods. Cities with tree coverage goals are racing against a warming climate simply for the sheer length of time it takes trees to grow. After planting, it can take 20 to 30 years for trees to mature enough to temper heat. Meanwhile, the heat is getting worse. Climate projections show the world is on track to be 3C hotter than before industrialization by the end of the century, with heatwaves that are longer and stronger. The Green Seattle Partnership, a city-non-profit collaboration, has recruited volunteers who spent more than 1m hours planting 306,779 trees since 2005. Seattle also uses a policy checklist, the Racial Equity Toolkit, to prioritize communities with lower canopy coverage, engage citizens in planning discussions and mitigate environmental injustice. Sandra Pinto de Bader, Seattle’s urban forest policy adviser, said in an email that “the city’s urban forestry team conducted outreach and engagement efforts to intentionally engage people of color, immigrant, refugee, Native Americans and low-income populations to participate in the process, provide input, help shape policies, strategies and actions in support of the urban forest.” Houston sent 75 community scientists out to track and map heat islands across a 300 sq mile radius, which the city will then overlay with tree canopy records to inform their planting goal of 4.6m trees by 2030. Houston is then sharing its censors and gear with Austin and El Paso for their own heat projects. ••• Even with their best efforts, cities face a number of setbacks. Trees can have a high mortality rate with experts citing figures from 15% to 40% or even as high as 50%. In many cities, the greatest potential for correcting inequities is by planting trees on private property. That’s because the public property between roads and sidewalks often has obstacles, like underground pipes that constrict roots. Landlords aren’t willing to put trees on their property. Their response usually is, ‘Who’s going to take care of that tree when you move out?’ Washington DC is nearly at capacity for street trees, meaning there is a tree next to the street in every place possible, said Jessica Sanders, director of science and policy at Casey Trees in DC. The local department of transportation is finding new places for street trees – even by eliminating parking spaces where possible. Tree non-profits have turned to encouraging residents to increase tree canopy in their own yards, but they are meeting resistance. “The hardest part is getting trees on private land,” Jessica Sanders, Casey Tree’s director of science and policy, said. “Especially for renters, landlords aren’t willing to put trees on their property. Their response usually is, ‘Who’s going to take care of that tree when you move out?’” As some cities wrestle with those challenges, many more have not even begun to seriously consider how to increase tree coverage to prepare for rising heat. Logan, the Boston climate justice advocate, said time is against the efforts. “It can take years for a tree to be effective, and no politician is around long enough to make sure those trees grow,” Logan said. “There’s not enough political incentive.”"
"

If one was to consider writing a manifesto the first rule would be to minimize the usage of clichés. When clichés were first uttered they were created by literary geniuses, but now they are phrases which are overused and betray the lack of an original thought. Just like the National Opposition. To paraphrase Winston Churchill, “Never has so little been said by so many to benefit so few”. We have the leaders of the minor parties, including ACT, grabbing most of the headlines whilst the most supported party within the New Zealand electorate has paralysis of the larynx.



Why has the National Opposition to this Coalition rabble become so ineffective? There is something seriously wrong. This COLs has provided the **National Party** with endless opportunities to annihilate their credibility, but instead of outright attack, there appears to be passive resistance and even support for the many autocratic and oppressive pieces of legislation that are being forced upon the populace. Where the hell are the politicians we elected to safeguard us from, or at the very least, mount a constructive challenge to all this?



I could go on and on, there is so much wrong with this Labour-led administration that you, as our representative, should have shielded us from, but you haven’t. Rampant socialism is their aim and you are allowing it to happen. Everything they had promised in their manifesto has resulted in catastrophic failure.



ACT MP **David Seymour** has shown us centre-right leadership that was once the exclusive domain of National. We have two votes. When are you going to convince us that you offer a legitimate alternative? My votes, and those of many others **cannot be taken for granted.** You have a lot of work to do this year so it’s up to you. 



USA, Great Britain and Australia scuttled socialism in spite of the MSM’s relentless support of the left. It would be an embarrassing tragedy if New Zealand was the exception. Would you want that as your legacy?

The following is an example in Germany.
=============================
German public television TV host/science journalist Harald Lesch (astrophysicist) attacks climate skepticism
By Carl-Otto Weiss, Physicist PhD

German public television science journalist Harald Lesch plays it loose with the facts to mislead the public. Image cropped from ZDF, Fair Use.
Many opposition parties in Europe, the GOP party in the US, as well as governments of various countries like Australia, Poland, etc. view “global warming” with healthy amount of scepticism, or even as a “hoax”.  In Germany the newly minted AfD protest party added to its programme that the party does not support so-called “climate protection” schemes. The AfD is to Germany what the UKIP is to the UK, i.e. a very inconvenient thorn in the side of the splintering euro-political establishment.
The AfD justifies its opposition to climate protection initiatives based on three factors: 1) all predictions of global warming rest solely on model calculations which have failed all tests, 2) there is no single scientific result published proving significant global warming by man-made CO2, and 3) there is a large number of publications definitely disproving any possibility of a sizeable influence of CO2 on the Earth’s temperature.
On ZDF German public television, Harald Lesch one-sidedly challenged the AfD’s climate science position. On the argument that the models are unsuitable for predictions, he stated bluntly:
No model that has not stood the test against measurements or experiments can be published in the scientific literature.”
Mr. Lesch, an astrophysicist, is surely familiar with scientific literature, and thus really must know that any number of model calculations are published without being tested by experiments/measurements. Every natural scientist knows this. Very often a model rests on a new idea or insight, something, which in itself is certainly worth publishing, and, consequently, gets published.
Thus Lesch’s statement is, to say the least, quite surprising. Would any experienced scientist really have no idea of the scientific publication process – even of his own field?
Readers may find it of interest that the AfD is right now the only political party in Germany that is expressly against action to “fight climate change”, and has been very successful in convincing plenty of voters, thus making the other parties very nervous.
Lesch in fact never contacted EIKE

Next Leach attacked the climate science critics:
It is always the same people who try to undermine the credibility of trusted experts.”
Here the trusted experts are in fact not trusted by everyone – rather only by much of the mainstream media, and of course the governments who happen to pay the experts.
Here Lesch points the finger at EIKE (European Institute for Climate and Energy), which operates the most widely viewed German speaking website (here) on issues concerning climate science and energy policy and is the only independent German association of scientists that discusses climate questions. Lesch added:
Of course I try to discuss this with them. I even tried to get in contact with them by phone, but they do not answer.”
This is untrue. A check among all EIKE members reveals that no EIKE member has ever received any inquiry from Leash in any way, shape or form. In return, however, EIKE requested the ZDF TV station to arrange contact with Lesch. Sadly the public-funded ZDF TV station refused to let EIKE contact Lesch.
ZDF refuses to give sceptics time
Requests for a public discussion between EIKE and the publicly-paid Mr. Lesch continue to go unanswered.

"[A journalist (“Louise”) asked recently who funds the Carbon Sense Coalition.]
I and a few friends around Australia and overseas founded the Coalition. I have paid for the business registrations, web servers and all such related matters. No one has reimbursed me. A computer friend built the web site and has not sent a bill. He maintains our web site and has not sent a bill.
Other members have helped with research, editing and writing, and none have been paid for it.

My wife and I have paid for all email, phone, copying, postage and printing costs. And I have never sent a bill or been paid for my considerable contribution of time. Carbon Sense occupies an office under our home on a farm at Rosevale in Queensland. You are very welcome to visit, inspect and chat if you wish. We have never submitted a bill for office rent.
One long acquaintance provided us, gratis, a second hand colour printer.
A cousin who is a farmer sent two donations, totalling $1,500 to cover general expenses. A long term friend, who is a retired engineer, sent a donation of $250. There have been no other donations of any sort since Carbon Sense was formed. And we have not asked for them.
So, in summary, funding to date for the Carbon Sense Coalition is $1,750 cash and a second hand colour printer. 
(I notice on this morning’s news that Al Gore has raised $150 million of a planned $300 million for a campaign against carbon. It looks like he will outspend us. I wonder who is looking at where that big money is coming from?)
 Volunteers
You see, Louise, for committed people, reading, thinking and writing do not cost much. On this issue, the key requirement is a logical mind and a good scientific education. Many of our activists were lucky to be educated in the days when science education was a serious subject, not yet another excuse to promote some sociological agenda.
We rely on a world-wide band of volunteers, members and correspondents who assist with ideas, editing, and distributing our reports. We rely heavily on the people’s media, the internet. Our latest report was distributed in Europe, America, South Africa and New Zealand by an enthusiastic and growing band of supporters. With our network of web sites, blogs and contacts, we are dodging past the media monoliths like rabbits racing thru a mob of dozing elephants.
None of our growing band of contact managers are paid. They are motivated by their concern for the future and desire to use their knowledge to expose the truth. This coalition continues to grow and its numbers and geographical reach extend as people start to see the reality. We collaborate with about 50 other such bodies in almost every country of the world.
However, since you have raised the subject of funding, it is time we raised some funds. Should anyone offer funds with no strings attached, we would take them, even from newspaper barons. My truthfulness, opinion, or reputation is not for sale.  
Vested Interests
Funding touches on the subject of vested interests. I cannot think of a single person in Australia who has no vested interest in the Global Warming debate.
Every tax payer is being slugged for the hundreds of millions already being spent by federal, state and local governments on what we believe is a totally wasted cause. Should I be gagged because I am a taxpayer?
Every farmer faces huge increases in power and fuel costs and also carbon taxes on animal emissions. Should all farmers be prevented from speaking out? If farmers cannot speak out about their industry, who has a better right, or more knowledge?
Every person who eats food faces huge increases in food costs because of the increasing fuel and transport costs and the competition for food and land from subsidised ethanol production and carbon-credit plantations.  (I assume that you are aware of the growing international alarm about increasing food prices due largely to grains being diverted from food to fuel production?) Should I be prevented from commenting because I have a continuing interest in consuming food?
The shareholders of every coal company face bankruptcy if Bob Brown achieves his aim of closure of every coal fired power station and every coal mine. Should I be prevented from speaking out because among my investments for retirement, my wife and I hold a small shareholding in a coal mining company? Have you checked where your super-fund invests its money?
Every mining company faces huge increases in costs for power and transport if “Emissions Trading” is introduced. Should every shareholder, employee, contractor and executive in Australia’s most important industry be muzzled? 
I still earn part time money from mining and farming. I always have, long before Global Warming became a media tart. I have never hidden that fact – I am proud of it. Does this disqualify me because mining and farming are the primary targets of the anti-carbon crowd?
I travel occasionally, and the cost of travel will increase hugely because of proposed taxes on fuel. Does this disqualify me from speaking out if I believe this policy harms all travellers and tourists? 
Look Also on the Dark Side
Do not forget to look at the other side. Al Gore is earning millions from lecturing and shareholdings in companies set to benefit directly from the Cap and Trade policies he promotes. 
Moreover, every official and representative who contributes to or attends IPCC regular meetings (in remote unattractive spots like Bali, Kyoto and Rio) gets paid to do so by some poor taxpayer, as does every grandstanding politician. They are all off again on another junket right now. Have you revealed their vested interest in maintaining the rage?
Another vested interest is that large body of climate “researchers” who have received a huge slice of the $50 billion spent on this scam to date by governments around the world. Many of them are unlikely to bite the hand that feeds them (although, as a farmer producing some of their food, I see they are doing just that.)
A closely related vested interest is that of the large body of dedicated environmental journalists who need daily environmental scares to keep the papers selling.
And of course do not forget the banks, merchant banks, regulators, lawyers and auditors looking forward to the enormous profit or growth possibilities in Emissions Trading. Look to the money trail – who’s going to benefit? I hope you ask them the same question you ask me.
In case you are interested and want to start digging into a story of real conflict of interests, I suggest you check these web sites:

www.worldnetdaily.com/news/article.asp?ARTICLE_ID=54450
www.worldnetdaily.com/news/article.asp?ARTICLE_ID=48807
Look for the Big News
So, Louise, I’m sorry there is no big story in the funding of the Carbon Sense Coalition.
However, there is big news in the Global Warming scam.
Have you as a citizen explored the fact that CO2 is the world’s plant food and the basis for all food on earth? Have you looked at what could happen to world food supply if we did indeed manage to significantly reduce CO2 in the atmosphere?
Are you aware that a colourless, odourless, non-toxic gas comprising a miniscule 0.038% of earth’s atmosphere and which is the source of all food on earth has been labelled a pollutant by unthinking zealots in the EPA?
Have you realised that the famed “Hockey Stick Graph” that started this whole hysteria has been proved a fabrication?
Have you reported the fact that global temperatures have plateaued for the last ten years, despite continual increases in man’s emissions of CO2?
Have your readers been told that because of the very steep fall in temperature in 2007, the average global temperature in January 2008 was the same as in January 1900?
Are you aware of the work on past climate history of the world that indicates that we have had several warm benign periods like today, but they are generally short lived. We have more to fear from barren ice ages than from today’s flourishing warm world?
Are you aware of the fascinating research by Danish scientists on the way the sun controls the formation of low level clouds, thus playing a major role in controlling surface temperature?
Have you checked out whether producing ethanol does reduce greenhouse gases?
Have you looked at what would happen to your lifestyle if we did manage to eliminate man-made CO2 emissions?
Well Louise, I hope I have given you enough material. Sorry this letter went on so long, but there is much to say. I hope to see you say more and am happy to be prompted by more questions.
If you would like to talk to some local representative of Carbon Sense in Perth, please let me know.  We may lack funds, but we do not lack people.
And remember, “David did slay Goliath”.
Yours sincerely

By Dr. Sebastian Lüning and Prof. Fritz Vahrenholt
(German text translated by P Gosselin)
On June 14, 2016, Swiss flagship daily Neue Zürcher Zeitung (NZZ) reported on an imminent record ice melt in the Arctic:
Record ice melt in the Arctic: ‘heat wave ‘ over Greenland
Arctic sea ice is headed for a new record summer minimum. The disappearance of the ice sheet can initiate decisive climatic events. Arctic sea ice is currently melting faster than the record 2012 year. According to data from the Snow and Ice Data Center (NSIDC) the polar ice cover this May (completely frozen or with a sea ice concentration of at least 15 percent) was about 580,000 square kilometers less than 2004; that corresponds to the size of France. The total sea ice area is still at 12 million aquare kilometers, or about one and half times the area of Australia. A new minimum is forseeable.”
Continue reading at the Neuen Zürcher Zeitung.
Was the alarmism justified? Looking at the official data from the NSIDC (Figure 1), the dotted green line depicts the sea ice extent for the record melt year 2012, the red line depicts 2016. In the first half of this year the melt rate was in fact at a record pace. In July, however, the melt slowed down. The fact is: Since July 2016 there is a lot more sea ice than at the same time in 2012. In mid September, when the ice typically reaches its minimum, we will have the final result.
 

Figure 1: Arctic sea ice extent. Source: NSIDC
On August 19, 2016, NASA issued a press release that foresaw the failure of reaching a new record minimum:
NASA Monitors the ‘New Normal’ of Sea Ice
This year’s melt season in the Arctic Ocean and surrounding seas started with a bang, with a record low maximum extent in March and relatively rapid ice loss through May. The melt slowed down in June, however, making it highly unlikely that this year’s summertime sea ice minimum extent will set a new record. “Even when it’s likely that we won’t have a record low, the sea ice is not showing any kind of recovery. It’s still in a continued decline over the long term,” said Walt Meier, a sea ice scientist at NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland. “It’s just not going to be as extreme as other years because the weather conditions in the Arctic were not as extreme as in other years.” “A decade ago, this year’s sea ice extent would have set a new record low and by a fair amount. Now, we’re kind of used to these low levels of sea ice – it’s the new normal.”
This year’s sea ice cover of the Barents and Kara seas north of Russia opened up early, in April, exposing the surface ocean waters to the energy from the sun weeks ahead of schedule. By May 31, the extent of the Arctic sea ice cover was comparable to end-of-June average levels. But the Arctic weather changed in June and slowed the sea ice loss. A persistent area of low atmospheric pressure, accompanied by cloudiness, winds that dispersed ice and lower-than-average temperatures, didn’t favor melt.
The rate of ice loss picked up again during the first two weeks of August, and is now greater than average for this time of the year. A strong cyclone is moving through the Arctic, similar to one that occurred in early August 2012. Four years ago, the storm caused an accelerated loss of ice during a period when the decline in sea ice is normally slowing because the sun is setting in the Arctic. However, the current storm doesn’t appear to be as strong as the 2012 cyclone and ice conditions are less vulnerable than four years ago, Meier said.”

But curiously, the British daily The Guardian just a day earlier (18 August 2016) wrote that the Arctic sea ice was caught in the midst of a “death spiral”:
Time to listen to the ice scientists about the Arctic death spiral
The Arctic’s ice is disappearing. We must reduce emissions, fast, or the human castastrophe predicted by ocean scientist Peter Wadhams will become reality […] Because Wadhams says what other scientists will not, he has been widely slandered, attacked and vilified by denialists and politicians who have advised caution or non-action. But now he returns their fire, exhorting people to counter what he calls “the sewage flow of lies and deceit” emitted by the deniers. Above all, he says, people who study climate change should speak up and be prepared to risk the blighting of their careers and absence of honours. But he joins other climate researchers to cross lines that the public may still find unacceptable. He wants global action to find new ways to remove carbon from the atmosphere, and is not afraid of nuclear power – both of which answers can be swallowed – but he also argues for a colossal, global research programme in geo- engineering. […]”
It certainly is a strange “death spiral” when there hasn’t been an increased melting in 4 years.
Also the reminder that we should be listening much more closely to sea ice scientist Peter Wadhams also sounds comical, especially when one closely considers the earlier forecasting performance of the climate-alarmism-prone scientist. In the following chart we find 30 different estimates for last year’s Arctic minimum issued before the ice melt season began (Figure 2).

Figure 2: Estimate forecast for the 2015 Arctic sea ice minimum from 30 different scientific groups. Source: SIPN.
Result: By a huge margin Peter Wadhams comes in as a straggler in last place, miles away from the real value of 4.5 million square kilometers. How embarassing.
And we’re supposed to be listening more closely to Wadhams?
Scientific colleague Ed Hawkins of the University of Reading was outraged about how the Guardian could hype up this scientific fringe position. At Twitter he expressed his irritation:
 

 
It doesn’t surprise us that science fringe Wadhams gladly cooperates with the no lesser extremist Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research (PIK). Among others, Wadhams also appears in a publication together with Anders Levermann, who belongs to the hard core of the PIK climate alarmism group.

"**Hong Kong's leader Carrie Lam said the territory is likely to record negative growth for the year as months of protests have knocked the economy.**
The unrest has disrupted businesses and dealt a particularly heavy blow to the tourism and retail sectors.
The warning comes ahead of preliminary gross domestic product figures due on Thursday that are expected to show Hong Kong entered a technical recession.
That is defined as two consecutive quarters of negative growth.
In a briefing in Hong Kong on Tuesday, Ms Lam said the third quarter growth numbers are likely to show that outcome.
To combat the slowdown, she said the city has so far injected more than HK$20bn ($2.6bn; Â£2bn) to support the economy including the transport, tourism and retail sectors.
Ms Lam said the government will deliver more relief measures, without giving specific details.
Her comments follow a similar warning from the territory's Finance Secretary Paul Chan over the weekend. He said it would be ""extremely difficult"" to hit the government's pre-protest forecast of growth of between 0% and 1% for 2019.
""The blow to our economy [from the protests] is comprehensive,"" Mr Chan said.
The demonstrations began over a proposed extradition bill between the territory and mainland China, and have evolved into demands for greater freedoms.
Hong Kong is part of China, but its citizens have more autonomy than those on the mainland.
Clashes between police and activists have become increasingly violent, with police using tear gas and protesters storming parliament.
Those protests have led to a sharp decline in tourist arrivals, with visitor numbers expected to have slumped 50% in October.
Retailers have also been hard hit. Some shops have been forced to shorten trading hours, while workers report fears over their safety as well as getting to work.
Mr Chan said in August that retail sales had plunged more than 25% - the biggest monthly drop on record."
"LONDON  —   As American allies across Europe and Asia brace for President Trump, Britain stands out for the degree to which it is proceeding as if little has changed. The country, consumed with managing “Brexit” and its associated domestic political dramas, appears to have taken relatively few steps to prepare for the geopolitical earthquakes that Mr. Trump could bring to the international and European orders on which Britain relies, and that his proposals would undermine. “The people at the top of our system, whether they’re politicians or officials or journalists or think tankers like me, we’re all totally focused on Brexit,” said Charles Grant, who heads the   Center for European Reform. “We haven’t thought about Trump as much as we should have. ” It is possible that Prime Minister Theresa May, by throwing in her lot with Mr. Trump, could ride out any changes to the international order. But if that approach does not succeed, it could have severe consequences both for her nation and for the world that Britain plays a role in keeping together. Mrs. May has sought to win over Mr. Trump, whom she will visit this week, just as her European counterparts are exploring more fundamental questions about American reliability. “The British debate on Trump is over very trivial stuff, like who Trump spoke to before May, and the German debate is over the future of the liberal order in the West,” said Mark Leonard, the director of the   European Council on Foreign Relations.   Steinmeier, the German foreign minister, wrote in a column this week for the German newspaper Bild that, with Mr. Trump’s election, “the old world of the 20th century is gone” and that Germany could confront drastic changes. François Hollande, the French president, said last month that Mr. Trump’s election “opens a period of uncertainty. ” British leaders, Mr. Leonard said, have not accepted the view, growing in other European governments, “that our prosperity and security are based on an international architecture that’s now being threatened. ” “There’s an assumption that’s all going to remain,” he continued. Since Britain’s decline from a global power in the years just after World War II, the country’s foreign policy has rested on two pillars. First is the   partnership, which allows Britain to project its power and safeguard its interests globally. Second is European unity, which is essential for Britain’s economic prosperity and, by removing the   diversions of European conflict, frees up Britain to act on the world stage. But both of those pillars could now be crumbling under the strain of European populism, Russian resurgence and particularly Mr. Trump’s threats to step away from Europe. Britain’s challenge is not just that each of those elements is coming under strain. Mr. Trump’s avowed opposition to the European Union has put them in direct conflict. For instance, Mr. Trump offered to reward Britain’s exit from the European Union with a speedy trade deal. But this risks encouraging more exits from the bloc and possibly its disintegration. The resulting turmoil on the Continent, which includes several top British trading partners, could risk harming Britain’s economy far more than an American trade deal would help. Mr. Trump’s proposed alignment with Russia poses a similar quandary. Germany and other leading European powers oppose such a realignment, which they fear would open the way for Russia to dominate Eastern Europe, breaking the Continent’s unity on security matters. Mrs. May remains hawkish on Russia. But it is unclear whether she would oppose Mr. Trump on the matter, particularly as she more fully ties her fate to the alliance. “If America eases up on Russia, Britain will be under heavy pressure to pick the United States, not to side with Merkel,” said Robin Niblett, the director of Chatham House, a   think tank, referring to Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany. Mrs. May is increasingly focused on maintaining the alliance with the United States, the world’s largest economy and military power. Whereas leaders such as Ms. Merkel have responded sharply to criticism from Mr. Trump, Mrs. May has been more forgiving. For example, she overlooked Mr. Trump’s decision to meet with Nigel Farage, a former leader of the fringe U. K. Independence Party, before speaking with her. Even if Mrs. May succeeds in upholding the alliance, it is unclear that her government is preparing for the range of more seismic changes that Mr. Trump’s election and other events could bring. Jeremy Shapiro, an American and the research director for the European Council on Foreign Relations, said he had struggled to convince British officials that the old order is “eroding all around them. ” Mr. Shapiro paraphrased the “dominant” British view of Mr. Trump as, “We didn’t want him, but pressures of the presidency, checks and balances, our expert tutelage will socialize him, and it’ll be O. K. ” British hopes, he added, often rest on Senator John McCain’s persuading of Mr. Trump to drop his controversial plans and revert to traditional positions such as upholding European unity. Mr. Shapiro said he had been unable to convince British officials that Mr. McCain, whom Mr. Trump has publicly mocked, was an unlikely savior. Lawrence Freedman, emeritus professor of war studies at King’s College London, said there was a simple reason that British leaders never seemed to discuss their backup plan should they fail to moderate Mr. Trump. “There isn’t a Plan B,” he said. Preparing for life without American support, British leaders worry, could send the message that the United States can safely withdraw, risking exactly the outcome Britain wishes to avoid. “This has always been the problem,” Mr. Freedman said, because it leaves Britain unprepared for a situation that could be deeply destabilizing  —   much as it failed to prepare for Brexit. Brexit has focused attention inward, on    political dramas and on the countless challenges of negotiating Britain’s exit from the European Union. “We’re going through a very solipsistic moment,” Mr. Leonard said. This has led the British to behave “as if the only independent variable is Britain leaving the E. U. and the manner in which it’s done. ” This is shaping British foreign policy in other ways. “There’s always going to be a question of whether we’re better off using our political capital to advance the international security order or to try to get a good trade deal,” Mr. Leonard said. Britain’s party politics also distract. Mrs. May is only barely holding together the governing Conservative Party, leaving her overwhelmingly focused on managing divisions that are mostly about Brexit and migration. Both she and her foreign secretary, Boris Johnson, have spent their careers focused on domestic issues. The opposition Labour Party is riven by its own divisions. Its leader, Jeremy Corbyn, tends to be skeptical toward Britain’s global role. As a result, there are no major voices in British politics who have an interest, either ideological or political, in addressing the country’s foreign policy challenges. Britons’ view of their country as a pillar of a European and world order, rooted in their experience of standing up to fascism and militarism in World War II, is also shifting. “Until quite recently, we saw ourselves as   of the European order, but we don’t sort of see ourselves in that way anymore,” said Mr. Freedman, the King’s College professor. This has accelerated with the enmity toward immigration, which has focused politics inward and portrayed the outside world as something to guard against rather than to protect and uphold. That has ramifications beyond Britain. Even after Brexit, the country remains important for upholding the postwar order in Europe, where it is the largest economy after Germany and the biggest military spender after Russia. If its horizons continue to narrow, that will contribute to the Continent’s continuing fracturing on economics and opposition to Russian power. Mr. Niblett, the Chatham House chief, said he was worried Britain would become the “weak link” on European sanctions on Russia for its annexation of Crimea. “The U. K. which traditionally sees itself as upholding the spine of Europe toward Russia, is pulling itself out of that role,” Mr. Niblett said. Other European states are already preparing for the possibility that the Continent can no longer rely on Britain, Mr. Leonard said, on issues from Russia to the Iran nuclear deal to global free trade. “They don’t know if Britain’s going to be there or not,” he said."

By Dr. Sebastian Lüning and Prof. Fritz Vahrenholt
(German text translated/edited by P. Gosselin)
Climate skeptics have been accused over and over again of fabricating the climate warming hiatus of the past 15 years. A poor argument because the hiatus has been established as an area of research on which a number of scientific groups are working.
The latest study on the subject comes from a group of the British Antarctic Survey (Turner et al. 2016) that was published on July 21, 2016, in the journal Nature. It is a study on the warming hiatus of the Antarctic Peninsula. Yes, you heard it correctly – also here it appears there has been a hiatus.
The surprise is justified – as the German media and authorities claim on a regular basis that the Antarctic Peninsula is among the most rapidly warming regions on earth.
For example on the website of the German Environment Office Umweltbundesamtes (UBA) of July 23, 2013:
The climate of Antarctica
Antarctica is the driest and coldest continent on earth. Temperatures reach the freezing point in the west during the warmest month of January, otherwise they are far below the mean temperature of -55°C. Also Antarctica is impacted by global climate change and it is foremost warming at the Antarctic Peninsula more than the rest of the world. […] Only a few areas of the Antarctic Peninsula reach temperatures above the freezing point on a regular basis during the summer. However, it is the Antarctic Peninsula on the west side of the continent that is strongly hit by global climate change. No region on earth is currently warming faster. The temperature data of a research station on the Antarctic Peninsula run by Oak Ridge National Laboratory shows an annual mean warming of up to 2°C over the past 50 years. For the entire continent a warming of about 0.12°C per decade has been shown.”
John Turner and his colleagues of the British Antarctic Survey (BAS) have combined and evaluated the temperature data from various research stations on the Antarctic Peninsula. Using the data it was possible to divide the trend into a warming phase of 1979-1997 and a cooling phase 1999-2014, the latter being the hiatus. The authors even write the result in the title of their Nature study:
Absence of 21st century warming on Antarctic Peninsula consistent with natural variability
Since the 1950s, research stations on the Antarctic Peninsula have recorded some of the largest increases in near-surface air temperature in the Southern Hemisphere1. This warming has contributed to the regional retreat of glaciers2, disintegration of floating ice shelves3 and a ‘greening’ through the expansion in range of various flora4. Several interlinked processes have been suggested as contributing to the warming, including stratospheric ozone depletion5, local sea-ice loss6, an increase in westerly winds5, 7, and changes in the strength and location of low–high-latitude atmospheric teleconnections8, 9. Here we use a stacked temperature record to show an absence of regional warming since the late 1990s. The annual mean temperature has decreased at a statistically significant rate, with the most rapid cooling during the Austral summer. Temperatures have decreased as a consequence of a greater frequency of cold, east-to-southeasterly winds, resulting from more cyclonic conditions in the northern Weddell Sea associated with a strengthening mid-latitude jet. These circulation changes have also increased the advection of sea ice towards the east coast of the peninsula, amplifying their effects. Our findings cover only 1% of the Antarctic continent and emphasize that decadal temperature changes in this region are not primarily associated with the drivers of global temperature change but, rather, reflect the extreme natural internal variability of the regional atmospheric circulation.”

Turner and his colleagues clearly show that a strong natural variability governs on the Antarctic Peninsula and that it goes far beyond the anthropogenic signal. The change from natural warming phases over to cooling phases is a well-known phenomenon that is shown by ice core studies on the climate development over the past 1000 years.
The BAS scientists warn of simplistic views on warming in the late 20th century. In addition to natural variability (ocean cycles) and CO2, here also the ozone hole could have played a role. The main part of the text in the study states:
The recent change in SAT [surface air temperature] trend can be set in a longer-term perspective through examination of regional ice core records. An ice core from James Ross Island, which is close to Marambio station, showed that the region experienced several periods of rapid warming and cooling in the last 1,000 years, and that the warming trend over the last 100 years was ‘highly unusual’, although not unprecedented. However, the period since the late 1970s includes the ozone hole, which is unique in the record.”
The warming rate of the Antarctic Peninsula indeed was high in the late 20th century, however according to ice core measurements, there was a 50-year interval when temperatures rose even faster than 1979-1997:
The Ferrigno ice core from the coast of West Antarctica shows a warming from the 1950s to the early twenty-first century that agrees well with the warming observed at Vernadsky. In the longer term, this record revealed marked decadal variability and, importantly, resolved a 50-year period in the eighteenth century when SATs increased at a faster rate than observed at Vernadsky over the second half of the twentieth century.”
The most important finding of the study: The alleged extraordinarily strong warming of the Antarctic Peninsula in the late 20th century is well within the range of natural fluctuations. The paper states:
Therefore all these studies suggest that the rapid warming on the AP since the 1950s and subsequent cooling since the late-1990s are both within the bounds of the large natural decadalscale climate variability of the region.

Share this...FacebookTwitterAccording to scientists de Freitas, Dedekind, and Brill (2015), removing “contaminated data” from New Zealand’s  nation-wide temperature record — and using updated measurement techniques rather than error-ridden outdated ones — reduces the long-term (1909 to 2009) New Zealand warming trend from today’s +0.91°C to +0.28°C, a 325% change.
de Freitas et al., 2015
New Zealand’s national record for the period 1909 to 2009 is analysed and the data homogenized. Current New Zealand century-long climatology based on 1981 methods produces a trend of 0.91 °C per century. Our analysis, which uses updated measurement techniques and corrects for shelter-contaminated data, produces a trend of 0.28 °C per century.
Here is what 0.28°C of warming over the course of 100 years looks like:

 
From the internals of the paper, however, we find that the national average temperature for New Zealand was 13.1 °C in the late 1860s (10-year average), but by 2010, New Zealand’s average temperature had declined to 12.74 °C (30-year average).  The overall temperature average for the 1860s to present (150 years) remained stable at 12.6°C.  In other words, there has effectively been no change in New Zealand average surface temperatures in the last 150 years.
de Freitas et al., 2015
New Zealand was one of the first countries in the Southern Hemisphere to establish an official nationwide system of weather records. These records provide a rare long time series for temperatures in the Pacific Ocean, informing the data sparse interpolations required for early temperature series. Extant 1868 archives record the national normal mean surface temperature at 13.1 °C (when converted from degrees Fahrenheit) being the average of 10+ years read at six representative weather stations. Another major compilation, covering 35 years and based on nine stations, was published by the Dominion Meteorologist in 1920, which showed that the country’s average temperature has remained remarkably stable since records began. In 2010, the National Institute for Water and Atmospheric Research (NIWA) assessed the current national normal at 12.74 °C being the average of 30 years read at seven stations.
On the face of it, New Zealand’s long-term mean temperature has remained relatively stable at 12.6 °C over the past 150 years.
Here’s what the 1860s mean temperatures look like compared to the 1909-2009 period, with the latter trend line removed:

Getting back to the contamination that has artificially amplified temperatures by 325%, the authors continue their analysis by pointing out that the non-climatic +0.91°C per century trend in use today (and obviously preferred by those who wish to portray modern warming as dangerous and unprecedented) was obtained by using temperature-measuring techniques from a 1980 paper (Salinger, 1980, herein dubbed “S81”) that conducted no checks for sheltering (which has been found to artificially warm daily maximum temperatures by 1°C over a 6-year period) or the Urban Heat Island effect (which demonstrably and artificially warms up temperatures in cities and on airport sites relative to rural stations).  The authors replace S81 with a superior statistical method for more accurate climatic temperature measurement gleaned from a 1993 paper authored by Rhoades and Salinger (hereafter, “RS93”).  RS93 was concerned with “the detection and elimination of temperature data movements that are of non-meteorological origin,” advising that “for studies of climate change, it is best to choose stations that are unlikely to be affected by gradual changes in shading or urbanisation.”   By utilizing these checks on artificial or non-climatic warming, de Freitas et al. (2015) conclude that “no ‘important’ change in mean temperature occurred over the period 1909–2009 once the known contamination is corrected.”
de Freitas et al., 2014, continued:
(a) We will hereafter use the term “S81” to refer to the published 1980 paper [Salinas, 1980] in conjunction with the unpublished thesis elaborations.  Notably, S81 had conducted no tests for “creeping” inhomogeneities such as sheltering or UHI and consequently made no attempt to correct the 7SS [New Zealand temperature record “Seven Station Series”] for site effects* 
(b) McAneney et al. [1990] found that sheltering by nearby trees can increase daily maximum temperatures by 1 °C per 10 m of shelter growth over a 6-year period. After examining a range of New Zealand stations, [Hessell, 1980] determined that two of the stations used in the 7SS were climatically unrepresentative and assessed them “to increased sheltering from trees … and/or significant urbanisation and/or screen changes”. The sites are Albert Park in Auckland and Kelburn in Wellington. These sites, within the central business districts of two of New Zealand’s largest form the major portion of the Auckland and Wellington temperature series.   
(c) Hessell [1980] also finds a strong temperature trend bias in the data “unlikely to be due to a broad scale climatic effect”.   A 12-year comparison suggested that Albert Park had warmed 0.6 °C more than a rural counterpart 10 km distant.
(d) The two rural stations (Hokitika and Lincoln) show average warming of 0.2 °C/century in contrast to the 0.32 °C/century of the five city stations. A concern … is that all seven datasets have not yet been thoroughly screened for possible UHI effects or other undocumented changes.
(e) From 1976, Auckland data are drawn from the Mangere treatment plant, sited amongst newly commissioned settling ponds (Fig. 2). In 1998, the site moved a short distance to Auckland Aero, the country’s principal international/domestic airport. Apparent warming trends in the dataset for Auckland Aero (southwest of Auckland) were de-trended by reference to two other less urban airports on the metropolitan fringes, namely, Whenuapai (27 km to the northwest) and Ardmore (17 km to the southeast). The station histories for these two stations reveal no significant site changes during1976–2009, and screening disclosed no abrupt shifts. For the period 1962–1993, Auckland Aero [urban, airport] warmed 0.96 °C/century faster than Whenuapai [rural], and over 1969–2011 it warmed 0.97 °C/century faster than [rural] Ardmore (Table 2). The Mangere station was compared with the same two airports and showed a similar relative warming, implying that the overall Mangere region was greatly affected by UHI, as the population grew by 1,200 % from 15,700 in 1957 to 190,000 in 1981.
(f) In 1993, in collaboration with a statistician D. A. Rhoades, Salinger published “Adjustment of Temperature and Rainfall Records for Site Changes”  or RS93.  This paper was accepted locally as a seminal authority for the statistical techniques to be used in measuring differences between the temperatures of compared stations. … [I]n every case the S81 station adjustments greatly increased the individual trends, while the RS93 method resulted in equal numbers of increases and decreases.  As noted previously, S81 did not account for gradual effects such as sheltering or UHI.
(g) By making adjustments which are not statistically significant, S81 may have allowed too many “false positives” to occur. In addition, using long comparison time periods may have allowed creeping inhomogeneities and undocumented shifts at reference sites to skew the individual adjustments.
(h) Hessell [1980] examined apparent continuous warming over New Zealand since 1930 but concluded: “… no important change in annual mean temperature since 1930 has been found in stations where these factors [changes in shelter, screenage, and/or urbanization] are negligible.”  
(i) Our study similarly concludes that no “important” change in mean temperature occurred over the period 1909–2009 once the known contamination is corrected.
A few days ago, a compilation of over 50 temperature graphs from peer-reviewed scientific papers  revealed that large regions of the Earth have not been warming in recent decades, and that modern temperatures are still some of the coldest of the last 10,000 years.  Apparently the nation of New Zealand can now be added to this list as a region where no significant changes in temperature have taken place within the last 150 years.

"Few natural products are as maligned as palm oil, the vegetable oil that’s in everything from chocolate spread to washing up liquid. On the island of Borneo, oil palm plantations have replaced nearly 40% of the native forest cover since 2000. Deforestation releases CO₂ into the atmosphere and deprives rare and endangered species with the complex habitats they need to thrive. A new study has tried to find out if this valuable crop can be grown without destroying more forests, by converting existing pastureland into new oil palm plantations instead. Could growing more oil palm on land with already scarce wildlife be a solution to the deforestation crisis? The oil palm tree produces two types of vegetable oil. Palm oil from the fruit is used in cooking and baking and helps feed over three billion people, mostly in Asia. The other oil comes from the palm kernel, or seed, which is used around the world to make most of our detergents, soaps and other cleaning products. The relentless increase in global demand for vegetable oil has driven the logging and draining of forests and peatland to grow soybeans in South America and oil palm in Asia. About 85% of oil palm is grown in just two countries: Indonesia and Malaysia. But other tropical countries, particularly in South America and West Africa, are establishing their own oil palm plantations. These are vast monocultures that very few species can inhabit, especially compared with the tropical forest they replace. In the recent study, researchers measured how much carbon – previously locked up in trees and other vegetation – was lost to the atmosphere when either pastureland or rainforest was converted to oil palm plantation.  The good news is that turning pastureland into oil palm plantations reduced how much carbon was released by 99.7%, compared to when rainforest was converted. Another bonus of using pastureland might be that its starting biodiversity is relatively low anyway, so the plantation may actually have a greater diversity of wildlife than the previous ecosystem.  Converting grassland ecosystems like the Llanos in South America to oil palm plantations also released less carbon than converting forests. But in this case, the researchers found there were significant losses for biodiversity. If we have to produce more palm oil, the best outcome for wildlife and the climate would be to make former pastureland the first choice for future plantations. But would it not be better to ban palm oil altogether? Campaigns have urged consumers to switch to products that don’t contain palm oil, while some retailers have announced plans to exclude such items from their own-brand products.

      Replanting oil palm may be driving a second wave of biodiversity loss


 Oil palm plantations produce 73.5 million tonnes of vegetable oil from a total land area of 27 million hectares worldwide. This might seem like a large area, but the second most important vegetable oil crop, soybean, produces 56 million tonnes from 97 million hectares – more than 3.6 times the oil palm area. This means that oil palm actually uses much less land than other crops, which is one reason why it’s so popular with growers.  So boycotting palm oil could actually increase deforestation, since alternative tropical oil crops tend to use much more land. A better approach is to ensure that all the palm oil used in food and other products has been obtained from a “sustainable” source, and not from recently logged forests.  That’s why it’s important to base our decisions on sound scientific evidence. Oil palm will continue to be a vital crop for many developing countries in the future. Using former pastureland to grow the crop could ensure the product’s development isn’t at the expense of vulnerable ecosystems. Given how bad red meat production is for the planet, a switch from cattle pasture to oil palm plantation in the tropics could well be a marked improvement.

The former U.S. vice president, Al Gore, is now urging civil disobedience to stop coal plants. He told a New York audience recently, “If you’re a young person looking at the future of this planet and looking at what is being done right now, and not done, I believe we have reached the stage where it is time for civil disobedience to prevent the construction of new coal plants that do not have carbon capture and sequestration.”

"In the age of FOMO (fear of missing out) and YOLO (you only live once), people are pursuing sensations and memories over material products more than ever.  Statistics from Barclaycard show that in the UK, spending on theme parks, tourist attractions, garden centres, pubs and restaurants is on the up, while sales for department stores, clothing, gifts and appliances are falling. Similar trends are in motion elsewhere.   The passing of “peak stuff” has the potential to be good news for the planet. As society becomes increasingly aware that consumption is putting intolerable strain on the planet, sharing experiences can be a more sustainable way to show appreciation for ourselves, our friends, and our family.  But this is not a given. Many businesses are capitalising on the rise in experiential consumption with new and expensive ways to make memories – and many of them are just as damaging for the planet. To avoid these pitfalls, we need to think local. Shifting our focus from product to process has many ethical positives. Taking part in something, such as a pottery class, is both mentally and physically rewarding. For example, engagement in creative arts and crafts can enhance well-being, self-expression, and community involvement.  This involvement also creates an awareness and sense of responsibility for what we use in a way that passively clicking and collecting doesn’t. When we put together a holiday for example, we are much more conscious of the elements that go into this than when picking one off the shelf.  This heightened awareness can help address the green consumption gap – wherein a majority of consumers are concerned about environmental issues, but only a minority choose more sustainable options. Education is recognised by organisations such as UNESCO as one of the most powerful tools to support us in making more responsible choices. Involving ourselves in the process of consuming generates a sense of ownership over it too. This is important, because it empowers people to feel that they can control how and what they consume. This creates opportunities for the popular perception that it is too hard to be green to be shattered – especially if the experiences teach skills that can reduce a person’s ecological footprint. But experiential consumption can have a dark side that encourages consumers to ignore rather than engage with sustainability. It is often particularly hedonistic – in place of material exchange, it encourages indulgence in the moment. Businesses have been quick to realise the commercial potential of this. Rather than showing off how much stuff we own, we can show off how active our lives are. For example, increasingly popular extreme fitness challenges let participants show off their prowess in a competitive world. This might not always result in environmental harm. But in the case of tourism, a sector where the potential of the experience economy was recognised early, the increasing demand for new and far-flung experiences has contributed to a doubling of transport emissions in the past 40 years and is straining ecosystems in popular destinations. New fashionable destinations arise every few years and waves of tourists, often denude a location and then move on leaving problems in their wake. Maya Bay in Thailand, made famous by popular film The Beach, received such heavy footfall that most of the area’s coral died, forcing authorities to close the area for three years to allow ecosystems to recover. The Arctic is now experiencing a similar boom in tourism, bringing new stresses to already fragile ecosystems.  Even if experiences are sold as sustainable, the hedonistic nature of holidays can overwhelm good intentions. Knowing that an experience is sustainable can actually increase consumption. For example, people staying at ecolodges can end up using more water and energy than they otherwise would. Even planning to do good in future gives people licence to be bad now.  If we are to marry experience-seeking with sustainability, we need to be conscious of these tendencies. We also need to redefine our ideas of rewarding experience away from the expensive and far-flung and towards the local. Some of the best memories come from new and unexpected encounters and exchanges with others – but their distance from home doesn’t need to be important. If we are travelling far, it helps to choose experiences that actively involve local residents, who have a greater interest in looking after the local environment and can ensure problems arising from tourism are resolved. As for the journeys to these destinations, the more we can stick to slower but lower-carbon forms of travel, the better. Shared with loved ones, the journey can be just as fun as the destination. Throwing in the nine to five and moving into a converted van to travel the world – the “#vanlife” lifestyle – can be a more sustainable way to live and travel if moving at a slow pace, and is currently one of the most popular hashtags on social media. Long-distance cycles and walking treks are an even better way to turn the destination into the journey and experience the world without harming it. Of course, the increasing popularity of experiences over products does not automatically mean that consumption is in decline. Even established product manufacturers are findings ways to put an experiential spin on things. Hurom, a Korean manufacturer of high-end juicers markets their machines as making users’ lives healthier and more meaningful to go beyond the product itself and evoke sense experience. It has even set up juice cafes to offer consumers the experience of sampling the juice and juicer before making a purchase. Indeed, the latest sales figures from China’s “singles day”, Black Friday, and Cyber Monday suggest that overall consumption is still rising. Ultimately, whether its products or experiences we’re buying, there’s no escaping the reality that we need to be buying less – and to be conscious of the impacts of those we do buy. This may not be popular with businesses keen to push us towards expensive activities to protect their bottom line. But its exactly what the planet needs.

"**Google has removed from its app store a mobile game that lets people role play as a Hong Kong protester.**
The tech giant says the app violated a policy against cashing in on conflicts, and the decision was not the result of a request to take it down.
A number of gaming companies have become embroiled in the Hong Kong protests.
Many are reluctant to offend Chinese consumers, but they have also drawn criticism from gamers over free speech.
The choice-based game, Revolution of Our Times, allowed users to play the part of a Hong Kong protestor.
Like real protestors, players could buy protective gear and weapons, but they could also be arrested and even extradited to China.
Hong Kong's protests started in June against proposals to allow extradition to mainland China, a move many feared would undermine the city's judicial independence and endanger dissidents.
The Chinese government has condemned the protests, and official media has often criticised companies overseas that appear to endorse them.
Protestors, on the other hand, have targeted businesses they perceive to be pro-Beijing.
Many companies worry about offending Chinese consumers, or falling foul of the government's sensibilities, because it could affect sales in a huge market.
That is particularly true for the gaming industry. Gaming market research firm Newzoo puts the global market for gaming at $152.1bn, with China ($36.5bn) and the US ($36.9bn) together accounting for nearly half of that total.
In a statement, Google said the game was removed because it violated Google Play's policies.
""We have a longstanding policy prohibiting developers from capitalising on sensitive events such as attempting to make money from serious ongoing conflicts or tragedies through a game,"" Google said.
Google noted it had pulled apps previously for attempting to profit from other high-profile events such as earthquakes, crises, suicides and conflicts.
The move comes just days after an online gamer from Hong Kong was removed from an international tournament for the game Hearthstone because he expressed support for the protestors during a livestream.
Activision Blizzard said the gamer, identified as ""Blitzchung"", had violated rules and would not be allowed to play in any Hearthstone e-sports games for the next 12 months.
The company said the competition rules banned any behaviour that might cause public disrepute or offend a portion or group of the public.
The official Chinese publication the Global Times said Chinese social media users thought Activision Blizzard's move was an example of ""how to be responsible in the Chinese market,"" but move has drawn protest on social media elsewhere, with many gamers calling for a boycott of Blizzard.
The boycott has been trending on Twitter and in some cases former fans have posted pictures of their cancelled subscriptions on the Reddit gaming thread.
On the Hong Kong subreddit a number of players have suggested turning Mei, a Chinese hero in the game Overwatch, into a pro-Hong Kong character.
They hope the move would hit Activision Blizzard's sales by getting the game banned in China.
Despite the boycott, a mobile version of Activision Blizzard's Call of Duty video game has been downloaded more than 100 million times in its first week.
Chinese tech company Tencent owns a stake in Activision Blizzard, which generated $7.5bn in revenue last year."
"Last summer’s bushfire disaster was so unusual that traditional firefighting methods, such as hazard reduction burning, failed in some instances, an inquiry into the crisis heard. The final report of the New South Wales bushfire inquiry, published on Tuesday, said the 2019-20 bushfire season brought fires in forested regions on a scale not seen in recorded history in Australia.   “The season showed us what damage megafires can do, and how dangerous they can be for our communities and firefighters,” the inquiry chairs, former NSW police deputy commissioner Dave Owens and former NSW chief scientist Mary O’Kane, said in their opening summary.’ “And it is clear that we should expect fire seasons like 2019-20 or potentially worse to happen again.” The NSW government said on Tuesday it would be adopting all of the report’s 76 recommendations, which include the establishment of a major new centre for bushfire research and technology, new training to increase the capacity of fire authorities to deal with disasters of the scale seen in 2019-20, and examination of existing preparedness strategies to determine the best approach to increasingly frequent, extreme fire seasons. The inquiry found climate change and rising greenhouse gas emissions “clearly played a role in the conditions that led up to the fires and in the unrelenting conditions that supported the fires to spread” but climate change alone “does not explain everything that happened”. “The 2019-20 bush fire season challenged conventional assumptions. For example, it appears that the extreme dryness of forested regions over large continuous areas was the determining factor in the size of the fires,” it read.  The report said that extreme conditions of the kind seen last summer are likely to happen again and dangerous fires will become more frequent, meaning state and local authorities would need to do more to prepare. Former fire chiefs who have called for an urgent response from governments to the climate crisis said the findings of the review supported their position. During the fire season, former fire chiefs from several states said their advice to the Morrison government that the climate crisis was making fire seasons worse had been ignored. “The NSW bushfire inquiry has echoed what the experts have said all along: climate change is driving longer, hotter and more dangerous bushfire seasons, including our Black Summer,” said Greg Mullins, a former fire and NSW rescue commissioner. Mullins said Australia was in a new era of climate-driven bushfires in which fires were more likely to develop dangerous pyroconvection events. He said governments needed to do more to address the underlying cause. “Immediate steps the NSW state government can take to drive down emissions include: rejecting all new coal and gas projects like Santos’ Narrabri project, and accelerating its net-zero plan to create clean, long-term jobs in sectors like renewable energy,” he said. The report said the scale of the disaster meant fire services were stretched in their capacity to respond, even with interstate and international support. Authorities could not get to all fires fast enough and fires started by lightning in remote areas made suppression difficult. The inquiry found the total tally of fire-generated thunderstorms in south-eastern Australia since the early 1980s until 2018-19 was 60. That number jumped to 90 by the end of the last summer, an increase of 50% in a single fire season. Taken together with dangerous weather conditions, the fires had become extreme, rendering some traditional fire-fighting methods ineffective. “Previous prescribed burning and hazard reduction activity appears to have reduced fire spread in some instances, but in others it appears to have had no effect on the severity of the fires,” the report said. It also found that the 2019-20 season could have been even worse if conditions had combined to affect more population centres or if the drought had not caused a decline in grass fuel loads.  In the face of such megafires, governments, authorities and communities needed to know more about fire suppression methods and how effective they were, the report added. The authors also recommended immediate improvements to communications in fire-prone communities, safety equipment and systems for firefighters, increased aerial firefighting at night and a reexamination of traditional firefighting techniques, including backburning. The NSW premier, Gladys Berejiklian, said on Tuesday the scars left by the fires season would be long-lasting. “We’re not going to pretend that we have managed firstly to deal with all the physical issues and secondly, of course, the ongoing trauma of those directly impacted and, of course, those who have lost loved ones,” she said. “That is why the government is there to continue to support those communities but I also appreciate very much that there is a sense of urgency and the next fire season is already upon us.” She said the government had taken every action it could to respond to the recommendations and the emergency services minister, David Elliott, would be tasked with coordinating the government’s response and any measures that could be expedited. “We have to accept also our climate is changing and those who wrote the report acknowledge that,” she said. “Coupled with the drought, coupled with fuel loads in some areas but, moreover, the climate is changing. “We have to expect and accept that part of the ferocity we saw was a combination of all those things and our government is working as hard as we can, as fast as we can and as efficiently as we can to resource up our agencies but also to do everything we can to mitigate the risks.”"
"■ President Trump would not say whether he favors lifting sanctions imposed on Russia for its invasion of Ukraine and meddling in the election, as his British counterpart rejected such a move. ■ Battle lines are forming within the Republican Party ahead of Mr. Trump’s phone call Saturday with Russia’s president, Vladimir V. Putin. ■ The commander in chief said his defense secretary will “override” his views in favor of torture. President Trump said on Friday that it was “very early” to be talking about lifting sanctions on Russia, deflecting a question about whether he would raise the issue with Russian President Vladimir V. Putin on Saturday morning even as his British counterpart flatly rejected such a move. Speaking to reporters after a meeting with Theresa May, the British prime minister, Mr. Trump did not say whether he supports keeping sanctions that were put in place following Russia’s military involvement in Ukraine and its interference in the 2016 election. But he said he hoped to have a good relationship with Mr. Putin. “If we could have a great relationship with Russia and with China and with all countries, I’m all for that,” Mr. Trump said in a brief answer to the question. Ms. May was more direct in her answer to the question about sanctions on Russia. She said the United Kingdom “believes that the sanctions should continue. ” The answers highlight what could be one of the differences between the two leaders, even as both of them insisted Friday that they plan to continue the close working relationship that has long existed between the two nations. President Trump’s phone call scheduled on Saturday with Russia’s president  —   their first conversation since Mr. Trump took office  —   has Republicans on edge. As one of his last acts as president, Barack Obama imposed sanctions on Russia for interfering in the election to help install Mr. Trump in the Oval Office. Senator John McCain of Arizona, chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, warned Mr. Trump on Friday against lifting the sanctions. What came next was a list of Russian abuses: its invasion of Ukraine, its annexation of Crimea and its support of “the murderous Assad regime as it has waged war on the Syrian people and killed more than 400, 000 civilians. ” Then came this: “And in the most flagrant demonstration of Putin’s disdain and disrespect for our nation, Russia deliberately interfered in our recent election with cyberattacks and a disinformation campaign designed to weaken America and discredit Western values. ” UPDATE: Another Republican senator, Rob Portman of Ohio, joins in: President Trump said Friday that he will let his secretary of defense “override” him by banning torture even though he believes the tactics do work in getting information out of terror suspects. In a remarkable show of deference to his own subordinate, Mr. Trump noted that Jim Mattis, the Pentagon chief, does not believe torture is effective. The president, who serves as the commander in chief and usually makes the final call on military action, said he will let Mr. Mattis decide. “I don’t necessarily agree, but I will tell you that he will override because I’m giving him that power,” Mr. Trump said. “I’m going to rely on him. I happen to feel that it does work. ” Mr. Trump appeared to be struggling about the issue even as he spoke, returning several times to his own belief in torture’s effectiveness even as he stated several times that he would let Mr. Mattis would decide. “But I’m going with our leaders,” he said. “We are going to win, with or without. ” Then he added: “But I do disagree. ” President Trump spoke by phone on Friday with Enrique Peña Nieto, the president of Mexico, White House officials said, less than 24 hours after the Mexican president canceled a White House meeting over anger about Mr. Trump’s intentions to build a border wall. A senior White House official confirmed Friday that the call had taken place and said that an official description of what the two leaders said will be released soon. In the wake of the deepening diplomatic tensions on Thurdsday, aides to Mr. Trump had said they still intended to keep lines of communications between the two governments open. The call suggests that the two leaders may be attempting to reschedule the planned meeting. That could begin to repair the relationship in the short term, though differences will likely remain about construction of the border wall and who will finance it. Then again, Mr. Trump tweeted another salvo on Friday morning. Mr. Mattis on Friday ordered the review of the controversial   fighter jet program, which has been criticized by President Trump for its cost overruns. Mr. Mattis also ordered that plans for a new Air Force One  —   which has also come under fire from Mr. Trump  —  should be reviewed, “with the specific objective of identifying means to substantially reduce the programs costs while delivering needed capabilities. ” The   review, Mr. Mattis said in a memo, will also look at how to reduce costs while still meeting requirements set out for the fighter jet program. During his confirmation hearings earlier this month, Mr. Mattis defended tweets from Mr. Trump criticizing the   program. Mr. Mattis said at the time that Mr. Trump had “in no way shown a lack of support for the program. He just wants more bang for the buck. ” The cost of building the   fighter jet, the   Joint Strike Fighter, has been an issue at the Pentagon for several years. At an estimated $400 billion over 15 years for 2, 443 planes, the fighter jet is the military largest weapons project. Mr. Trump is just not going to give up his claim that 3 million to 5 million illegal immigrants voted for Hillary Clinton, but he’s grasping for evidence. On Friday morning, he looked to VoteStand, which calls itself “America’s first online fraud reporting app” for the smartphone but does not appear to actually exist beyond the Twitter account of its founder, Gregg Phillips. The president seemed to be responding to an interview with Mr. Phillips on CNN Friday morning that was, shall we say, inconclusive. Mr. Phillips at once said 3 million illegal immigrants voted and said he is still working to prove that. “You can reach a conclusion and still verify it,” he maintained. Mr. Phillips began pressing his case that 3 million illegal votes were cast shortly after Election Day in November, but pressed repeatedly, Mr. Phillips has never produced any evidence. As the debunking site Snopes. com wrote: Mr. Phillips has been adamant on Twitter of course. But as PolitiFact wrote, “There is no report. ” And that is not all Mr. Phillips has asserted. He now has an endorsement from the president of the United States. Mr. Trump’s fallacious argument that he lost the popular vote by nearly 3 million because of illegal immigrant ballots started as the stuff of wonderment and ridicule. Now that the Trump administration has shifted to an investigation of the voter rolls, things have gotten serious. Democrats appear to be girding for battle, but if, as is likely, Senator Jeff Sessions, a conservative from Alabama, becomes the attorney general, it does not appear to be a fight that the minority can win. The Democrats fear the hunt for illegal voters will become a pretext to tighten voting requirements nationwide and bar many minority voters who tend to side with the Democrats. Even moderate Democrats are alarmed. Word from Politico is that President Trump will not be attending the fancy,   Alfalfa Club dinner Saturday night, a chummy gathering with many of Washington’s politicians, journalists and every president since Ronald Reagan. Lest we get too excited  —   could the White House Correspondents Association dinner be next? Please?  —   we should wait and see. It is true that every president since Mr. Reagan has attended the annual roast and silly cabaret dinner of the Alfalfa Club, a     Washington clique that seems like it was hatched from a bygone era. But not many of those presidents have attended each year. Mr. Trump may yet keep the soiree alive. Mr. Trump traveled to the City of Brotherly Love on Thursday to decry Philadelphia’s rising murder rate  —   “I mean, just terribly increasing. ” But it isn’t. Last year’s 277 homicides was down from 280 in 2015. That is up from 2014, when 248 were murdered, and in 2013, when 246 were killed. But recent years are markedly down from 2007 to 2012 when Philadelphia had more than 300 killings, 391 in 2007 alone. “President Trump’s false statements today were an insult to the men and women of the Philadelphia police force  —   the very same men and women who are working long hours today to ensure his safety,” Mayor Jim Kenney said in a statement Thursday. Of course, in the era of alternative facts, Mayor Kenney may be spitting in the wind. The Trump administration’s decision to drop advertisements encouraging people to sign up for health insurance under the Affordable Care Act was greeted with anger and alarm by supporters of the law  —   and a recognition that Mr. Trump wants the law crippled. “This is sabotage, pure and simple,” fumed Leslie Dach, a senior official in President Barack Obama’s Department of Health and Human Services who now heads a coalition to save the law. “This proves that this administration doesn’t care about people who need health coverage. And it clearly shows that they now own the consequences of their efforts to undermine the health care system. ” The ads were to have run only for a few more days, until the annual open enrollment period ends on Tuesday. In the last few years, large numbers of consumers signed up just before the deadline. But Mr. Trump and Republicans in Congress are determined to repeal Mr. Obama’s signature domestic achievement. Since Nov. 1, more than 11. 5 million people have signed up for insurance or had their coverage automatically renewed. And when the enrollment period ends, it’s anyone’s guess who will announce the total number of people who would lose their insurance if the law is repealed. The leading candidate to be the Pentagon’s new spokesman is John Ullyot, a former Marine Corps intelligence officer and veteran of Capitol Hill. Mr. Ullyot served as spokesman and deputy chief of staff for two Republican senators, John W. Warner of Virginia and Arlen Specter of Pennsylvania, and as spokesman for the Senate Armed Services Committee from 2003 to 2007."

The Australian government is obviously heartily sick of being finger-wagged by the holier-than-thou Ardern government. Especially over **climate change.**



At last year’s Pacific Island Forum, **Jacinda Ardern** repeatedly threw pointed sneers at Australia, and PM **Scott Morrison** in particular. Ardern smugly declared that _“Australia has to answer to the Pacific”_ on climate change. With her unrivalled penchant for self-righteousness, Ardern further asserted that _“we will continue to say that New Zealand will do our bit…we have to”._



Yeah, about that…



Coalition MPs have accused New Zealand of hypocrisy over climate change, as the Ardern government looks set to use carry-over credits to hit its 2020 Kyoto target despite its opposition to Australia using the credits to meet its Paris reductions target.



 **So, who’s really doing their bit?**



New Zealand plans to use 27.7 million tonnes worth of credits from outperforming the 2012 target to meet this year’s Kyoto deadline of reducing emissions by 5 per cent on 1990 levels. While New Zealand must use credits to meet its 2020 target, Australia is forecast to beat its 2020 target by 287 million tonnes without the use of the carry-over mechanism.



So, New Zealand is resorting to doing what was derided as dodgy double-counting by the Green lobby, when Australia did it. The only way New Zealand can even pretend to meet its present obligations is by borrowing from the legacy work done long before Ardern came to power. Green-flag-waving Ardern is failing to produce any meaningful action on emissions, while supposed “denier” Morrison is easily beating Australia’s targets.



New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern, who said Australia had “to ­answer to the Pacific” for its ­climate change position, piled pressure on Prime Minister Scott Morrison at last year’s ­Pacific Islands Forum to back a UN commitment to a carbon-­neutral economy by 2050, which her government has agreed to do.



 **But New Zealand government figures show the country is forecast to fail to meet its Paris target to ­reduce emissions by 30 per cent of 2005 levels by 2030.**



New Zealand Climate Change Minister **James Shaw** said last week there was an “allergic reaction” to using carry-over credits to meet 2030 Paris targets despite NZ’s use of carry-over credits to meet its 2020 target.



Speaking to Sky News, Mr Shaw said he was opposed to countries using Kyoto credits to meet their Paris targets.



 **Yet, that is exactly what his government is going to do.**



Australian politicians are lining up to kick back at the sanctimonious Kiwi lefties.



 **Barnaby Joyce** was also among government MPs who took aim at the New Zealand comments.



“They say in the country when your neighbour starts quoting the Bible, start counting your sheep,” Mr Joyce said.



 **“And when New Zealand starts quoting environmental policy, start counting your carbon credits.**



Other government ministers were even less forgiving, after enduring two years of sanctimony from the Ardern government.



LNP senator **Gerard Rennick** declared Australia could reduce its domestic emissions by deporting the more than 600,000 New Zealanders living in Australia.



New Zealand, on the other hand, might more easily meet the obligations it so hypocritically touts, simply by putting an end to the stinking clouds of methane its livestock emit.



I’m not talking farming, by the way: cows and sheep actually serve a useful purpose. I’m referring to the endless gaseous outpourings from the Beehive.

"By the time Donald Glover puzzled Hollywood’s finest by thanking Migos, the trendsetting Atlanta rap trio, during his Golden Globes acceptance speech this month, the group had already locked up its first No. 1 hit on the Billboard chart. Not that you would have known it by the behavior of the music industry’s mainstream gatekeepers. While “Bad and Boujee,” which Mr. Glover, the star and creator of “Atlanta” on FX, unexpectedly called “the best song   …     ever” onstage, had been building in clubs and online since its August release, it had only recently reached radio and was far from the   of other more anodyne (and, notably, whiter) streaming smashes. For weeks, as the song turned into a sensation through a torrent of internet memes and listens on YouTube and Spotify (with now more than 250 million combined streams) representatives for Migos had been trying to book the roguish group  —   made up of the rappers Quavo, Offset and Takeoff  —   a performance on   television, a rite of passage for rising acts. They were repeatedly brushed off. “They gave all kinds of excuses  —   not the right time, it’s not this, it’s not that,” recalled Pierre Thomas, better known as Pee, the chief executive of Quality Control Music, Migos’s label. “But as soon as Donald Glover did that, the next day, all the people who had just denied us wanted them on their show. ” The very next week, Migos took “Bad and Boujee” to “Jimmy Kimmel Live!” Battling fickle tastes has been a constant for Migos since the trio stormed the   firmament in 2013, bringing a Gucci bag full of flashy new tricks, including their trademark stuttering,   triplet flow and an endless series of sticky catchphrases,   and vocal tics (“Grrr,” “That way! ”). But those who start trends don’t always reap the rewards. “Versace,” the group’s breakout song, was lifted, but then eclipsed, by Drake’s faithful remix, while “dabbing,” once Migos lingo, morphed into a   dance craze. As repeated arrests sidelined Migos’s members at crucial moments, like the   to their debut album, “Yung Rich Nation”  —   a commercial flop in 2015, selling just 15, 000 copies its first week  —   the group risked becoming another casualty of rap’s      culture, where younger viral artists are always bubbling, especially in Atlanta. With a refined strategy for harnessing the rise of streaming, where young listeners flock to rap, Migos is now zooming at an even higher level. With the release of its second album, “Culture,” out digitally on Friday, the trio focused its exuberant songwriting. It is choosing more airy, ornate trap beats and taming its staccato verbal onslaught to make better use of empty space, while tending to both its online and      boosters. In New York this week, Takeoff, 22, the group’s most reserved member, compared the album   to Christmas Eve, his sleepy eyes lighting up. “You just know that everything you asked for is going to be there up under that Christmas tree,” he said. “It’s our time now. ” Migos’s de facto leader, Quavo, 25, is its most alluring presence and a melodic songwriter. He was defiant about the group’s sometimes samey or excessive output, which has included more than a dozen free online mixtapes since 2011. “We’re doing the same thing we’ve been doing, making the same music,” he said “I feel like the world just caught up. ” The group’s business team is more realistic  —   and, by necessity, more strategic. “Truth be told, we did have a minor setback for a major comeback,” Kevin Lee, the Quality Control executive known as Coach K, said. After a rocky 2015, which, amid legal issues, still included the release of five   Migos projects with middling effect, 2016 was about slowing down and spreading out. Though Migos released just one official mixtape last year, its members appeared as guests on an unfathomable number of tracks by other artists, pop and street, expanding their sonic palette and fans’ understanding of their individual attributes. “I applaud them in stretching their tentacles and bringing it back to the nucleus,” said Kevin Liles, the veteran   executive whose label, 300 Entertainment, distributes Migos’s music in partnership with Quality Control. “That only made the nucleus stronger. ” Coach K said that Quavo’s blistering solo run, especially  —   honored in the hourlong D. J. mix “Featuring Quavo”  —   motivated Offset and Takeoff, adding, “Once it all came back together, it was an explosion. ” It’s fitting, then, that the group’s crowning achievement thus far was started by Offset  —   who spent two monthslong stints in jail on weapons charges and probation violations during Migos’s rise  —   one night while he was home alone. After creating the “  top” hook for “Bad and Boujee” that would go on to fuel endless Twitter chatter,  he sent it to the team for completion, certain it could be a hit. The Platonic ideal of a Migos song, the track mixes sensational    talk with an overriding sense of personal uplift. “Some opportunities were probably lost because of my situation, but I was fortunate to have brothers that could keep the train moving,” Offset, 25, said. “This song is like a rebirth. ” Migos’s labels put “Bad and Boujee” in the best position to succeed with a few deliberate distribution tweaks, giving it its premiere only on SoundCloud  —   “where the kids live,” Coach K said  —   to build buzz, and timing its wider release to Labor Day weekend, when rap radio relies on D. J. mix shows instead of more fixed playlists, leaving the door open for emerging sounds. (The next single, “” was released with similar precision, first with a majestic, arctic video, and then the official audio ahead of Martin Luther King’s Birthday.) Quality Control also sent Migos back to basics  —   working the Atlanta strip club scene  —   to build momentum and “get the vibe of the people,” Pee said. “When you see girls on that stage singing the words, you know you got a hit on your hands. ” Migos’s zealous army of online supporters (see the earlier “better than the Beatles” meme) also did its part, disseminating everything from an impromptu jingle for potato chips to a clip of the group performing “Bad and Boujee” live in Nigeria. Crucially, there has never been a dearth of Migos content to spread, even during seemingly fallow periods, thanks to the group’s commitment to creating constantly. In Manhattan on Tuesday, the trio had about three hours of downtime in between promotional obligations, but as the members pulled up to their Times Square hotel, they noted that the famed   recording space Quad Studios was just across the street. There was little discussion before a decision was reached. (When the group’s handlers called me to find out where the rappers were, a member of Migos’s inner circle grabbed the phone to hang up.) “Wake up,” Quavo said. “Time to work. ” Once inside, after some finagling, the group rolled weed and ate pepperoni pizzas as its recording engineer, who travels with the trio, set up. Alone in front of the microwave, Takeoff counted comically large stacks of money as Quavo changed into a fuzzy pair of “lucky studio socks. ” “What’s the point of going to sit at the hotel?” he said before entering the vocal booth. Four hours later, a   new song was done, but then Migos was late to a listening party for its own album. The rappers had been too busy making more music, refusing to leave the studio until all three had finished their verses."

Share this...FacebookTwitterAccording to scientists, ocean temperatures have fluctuated up and down within a range of around 1 to 2°C for the last 1,000 years.
During the Medieval Warm Period (~800 to 1,000 years ago) ocean temperatures were as warm or warmer than they are now.  This centennial-scale warming occurred during a period of high solar activity, or during the Medieval Maximum.
During the Little Ice Age (1400 to 1900 AD), ocean temperatures plummeted relative to the Medieval Warm Period.  This dramatic ocean cooling occurred during several long periods of low solar activity – the Oort, Wolf, Spörer, Maunder, and Dalton Minimums.
During the Modern Warming Period (1900-present), ocean temperatures have risen again.  This warming has coincided with a period of very high solar activity, the Modern Grand Maximum.
Below are several papers indicating that ocean temperatures have risen and fallen for the last 1,000 years in concert with solar activity, including the 20th Century Modern Grand Maximum.  As Sejrup et al. (2010) cogently write in the conclusion of their paper:
“The associated decade- to century-scale variation of estimated nSST [near sea surface temperature] ranges from 1 to 2°C, significantly larger than expected based on thermodynamic considerations alone. We suggest that this is due to a solar influence on the regional modes of atmospheric variability which, in turn, control the poleward transport and temperature of warm Atlantic surface waters. Our findings beg the question of why such a clear connection has not been detected previously.”

The Medieval Maximum, Little Ice Age Minimums, and Modern Grand Maximum
Rigozo et al., 2001
“[I]n the last 1000 years solar activity displayed a Great Medieval Maximum, 1100 – 1250 AD, followed by a period of lower solar activity until the start of the 20th century. … The Oort, Wolf, Spörer, Maunder, and Dalton Minimums have been identified, as have the Medieval Maximum and the so-called Modern Maximum, starting near 1900.”

“The longest direct observation of solar activity is the 400-year sunspot-number series, which depicts a dramatic contrast between the almost spotless Maunder and Dalton minima, andthe period of very high activity in the most recent 5 cycles [1950s – 2000s], prior to cycle 24. … The records show that solar activity in the current cycle 24 is much lower than in the previous three cycles 21–23 revealing more than a two-year minimum period between cycles 23 and 24. This reduced activity in cycle 24 was very surprising because the previous five cycles were extremely active and sunspot productive forming the Modern Maximum.  … We predict correctly many features from the past, such as: 1) an increase in solar activity during the Medieval Warm period; 2) a clear decrease in the activity during the Little Ice Age, the Maunder Minimum and the Dalton Minimum; 3) an increase in solar activity during a modern maximum in 20th century.”

“[T]he Sun has been unusually active over recent decades (Solanki et al. 2004; Vonmoos et al. 2006; Muscheler et al. 2007; Steinhilber et al. 2008). Solanki et al. (2004) used the 14C isotope abundance found in tree trunks and concluded that the Sun has been more active recently than at any time in the previous 8000 years and that it was as active as in recent decades for only 10% of the past 11000 years.”

Usoskin et al., 2014
“[T]he modern Grand maximum (which occurred during solar cycles 19–23, i.e., 1950–2009) was a rare or even unique event, in both magnitude and duration, in the past three millennia. Except for these extreme cases, our reconstruction otherwise reveals that solar activity is well confined within a relatively narrow range.”

Wang et al., 2010
“It is seen that a very active period that began in 1920, the so-called ‘current grand solar maximum’, will probably end during 2011-2027 … The current grand solar maximum started in 1920 and lasted for eight 11-year solar cycles.”

Robust Correlation: Ocean Temperatures and Solar Activity
Sejrup et al., 2010   (Norwegian Sea)
Response of Norwegian Sea temperature to solar forcing since 1000 A.D.
“Here we present an exceptionally well-dated marine sediment sequence in the eastern Norwegian Sea which records 1–2°C variations of temperature in northward flowing Atlantic waters that are robustly correlated with various estimates of solar activity spanning the last 1000 years. The temperature and solar proxy variations appear to be synchronous within dating errors, which, together with the large amplitude of the temperature signal and its correlation into central Europe, suggests strong coupling of the regional atmospheric and oceanic responses to the Sun. … Lowest isotope values (highest temperatures) of the last millennium are seen ∼1100–1300 A.D., during the Medieval Climate Anomaly, and again after ∼1950 A.D. The largest and most sustained isotopic increases (coolings) are centered at ∼1500 A.D. and ∼1700 A.D., corresponding to the regional Little Ice Age. … The presence of medieval and 20th century warmth and Little Ice Age cooling in our records suggests a possible connection to known solar variations at these times (i.e., the Spører and Maunder minima and medieval and modern maxima, respectively). …  For the period after 1500 A.D., during which we have greatest confidence in the sediment age model, correlations with the various solar proxies range from ∣R∣ = 0.71 to 0.87 (all significant at >99%). … On balance, the observed relationship of nSST and solar proxies suggests a climate response to the Sun within the characteristic inertial timescale of the upper ocean, which is one to several decades. Recurrent, episodic volcanic forcing may also influence the ocean climate signal at this timescale, however, our results indicate that approximately 50–70% of the observed multidecadal to century-scale δ18O variation may be explained by solar forcing alone.”
Conclusion: “We have presented an oxygen isotopic proxy record of near-surface temperature of Atlantic waters from the area of their primary flow into the eastern Norwegian Sea and find that it is robustly and near-synchronously correlated with various proxies of solar variability spanning the last millennium. The associated decade- to century-scale variation of estimated nSST ranges from 1 to 2°C, significantly larger than expected based on thermodynamic considerations alone. We suggest that this is due to a solar influence on the regional modes of atmospheric variability which, in turn, control the poleward transport and temperature of warm Atlantic surface waters. Our findings beg the question of why such a clear connection has not been detected previously.”

Richey et al., 2007  (Gulf of Mexico)
“[C]entennial-scale sea surface temperature (SST) oscillations of 2–3 °C occurred during the past 1–2 [thousand years].  Two multidecadal intervals of sustained high Mg/Ca indicate that Gulf of Mexico sea surface temperatures (SSTs) were as warm or warmer than near modern conditions between 1000 and 1400 yr B.P. [before present] Foraminiferal Mg/Ca during the coolest interval of the Little Ice Age (ca. 250 yr B.P.) indicate that SST was 2–2.5 °C below modern SST.“
“Four minima in the Mg/Ca record between 900 and 250 yr B.P. correspond with the Maunder, Spörer, Wolf, and Oort sunspot minima, suggesting a link between changes in solar insolation and SST variability in the Gulf of Mexico.”

Dramatic Variation in Ocean Temperature During MWP, LIA
Bertler et al., 2011  (Southern Ocean)
“Here we present new data from the Ross Sea, Antarctica, that indicates surface temperatures were ~ 2 °C colder during the LIA, with colder sea surface temperatures in the Southern Ocean and/or increased sea-ice extent, stronger katabatic winds, and decreased snow accumulation.   The McMurdo Dry Valleys [Antarctica] were 0.35°C warmer during the MWP than during ME [modern era], accompanied by warmer conditions in the Ross Sea.”

“[S]ea surface temperature and salinity records from the Makassar Strait, Indonesia, show a long-term cooling and freshening trend, as well as considerable centennial-scale variability during the last millennium. The warmest temperatures and highest salinities occurred during the Medieval Warm Period (MWP), while the coolest temperatures and lowest salinities occurred during the Little Ice Age (LIA).“

Here we present a decadally resolved continuous sea surface temperature (SST) reconstruction from the IPWP that spans the past two millennia and overlaps the instrumental record.  Reconstructed SST was, however, within error of modern values from about ad 1000 to ad 1250, towards the end of the Medieval Warm Period. SSTs during the Little Ice Age (approximately ad 1550–1850) were variable, and 0.5 to 1 °C colder than modern values during the coldest intervals.”

Sepulveda et al., 2009 (Tropical Pacific)
“We observed two different regimes of climate variability in our record [Patagoina, Chile]: a relatively dry/warm period before 900 cal yr BP (lower runoff and average SST 1°C warmer than present day [Medieval Warm Period]) and a wet/cold period after 750 cal yr BP (higher runoff and average SST 1°C colder than present day). Relatively colder SSTs were found during 750–600 and 450–250 cal yr BP, where the latter period roughly corresponds to the interval defined for the Little Ice Age (LIA).”

Ran et al., 2011 (Greenland Sea)
“Warm and stable conditions with relatively strong influence of the Irminger Current on the North Icelandic shelf are indicated during the interval AD 940–1300, corresponding in time to the Medieval Warm Period (MWP). A considerable cooling at ∼ AD 1300 indicates the transition to the Little Ice Age (LIA) with increased influence of Polar and Arctic water masses deriving from the East Greenland and East Icelandic currents. An extended cooling period between AD 1300 and 1910 is characterized by approximately century-scale oscillations, with marked cold intervals at AD 1325–1375, AD 1460–1500, AD 1610–1670 and AD 1810–1910, separated by relatively mild spells. A two-step warming during the last 100 years is interrupted by three cool events around AD 1920, in the AD 1960s and in the late AD 1990s.”

Yesterday I happened to watch Germany’s ARD 8 pm news, and was a bit surprised by its reporting on the GOP Convention.
According to Wikipedia, the ARD is the “world’s largest public broadcaster with a budget of €6.5 billion and 20,616.5 employees”.
The ARD 8 pm news is in fact such an institution, that one of the first unwritten rules one learns when moving to the country is that you do not call anyone at their home between 8 and 8:15 pm because you risk disturbing them as they loyally watch their ARD evening news.
Over the years, however, the ARD has become glaringly one-sided politically, and an avid purveyor of political correctness. It can be argued that elements of elitism have long seeped into leading network heads over time, as is the case with much of the established German media.
Lately all-out Trump and GOP bashing has become a full-time sport not only at the ARD, but throughout the massive German public media complex. Hillary Clinton, the scandal-fraught Democrat candidate, gets a free pass.
White network labels Republicans racist?
What caught my eye yesterday was the degree of zealousness and lengths that the network went to, to portray the RNC in Cleveland as racially tinged, telling viewers near the 12-minute mark that only among the “overly white event” only 18 of the over 2472 delegates are black (skipping the fact that a number of minorities made speeches at the convention, and that the party in fact is ethnically diverse, i.e. see the original GOP candidate field).
Grotesquely distorted, blind journalism
The ARD’s portrayal of the GOP was a carefully crafted and designed to grotesquely distort and discredit the true spirit of the party.
As Germany takes in immigrants of other cultures and countries, and as the country over the past decades has changed to one of having a greatly increased share of minorities, one might think that by now, in the year 2016, at least the country’s flagship media board of directors, especially at the flagship ARD, would reflect the public it serves. But looking at their own boards, we see it is virtually all snow-white.

Of the 8 ARD top board members, see image above, zero are non-white:
The same is true of their other supervisory boards, whose structures I’m not going to get into. Here we see pure vanilla.
Things are not any better at ZDF, the other leading network.
Or at renowned centre-left weekly Der Spiegel.
In the USA any major organization of that scale with such a lack of diversity would have had their pants sued off long ago.
German media far less diversified than GOP
So what could the GOP possibly learn from the ARD on ethnic representation and diversity? Nothing….except for what one should not do. And what excuse does Germany’s media have for employing so few minorities? Silence.
It’s of low human character to go around accusing others of a practice that you yourself are far more guilty of doing, and it is equally deplorable to falsely and deceptively portray the USA’s other major party as intolerant and to imply it is racist. Stunningly there even appears to be 2 members of clergy on the board here.
All white. Perhaps the ARD should rename itself to AFD
The ARD and most of German media are the very last who should be preaching others on ethnic diversity. It’s disgusting and offensive that they are attempting to cast half of the USA’s political spectrum as being tainted with racism when they themselves cannot be bothered to place any minorities on their very own boards.
Moreover, when ones looks at the boards at most major German corporations, the story is much the same. The reality is that corporate Germany, which likes to fancy itself as progressive and hip, is at least 30 years behind the USA or Scandinavia on affirmative action.
Those German institutions and organizations, who seem to like branding others as intolerant, really first need to look at themselves before passing judgement.

“‘Global Warming’ is, and always was, a policy for genocidal reduction of the world’s population. The preposterous claim that human-produced carbon dioxide will broil the Earth, melt the ice caps, and destroy human life, came out of a 1975 conference in Research Triangle Park, North Carolina, organized by the influential anthropologist Margaret Mead, president of the American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS), in 1974.”

"From Sudan to Syria to Bangladesh, climate change is often presented as a powerful and simple root cause of violent conflict and mass migration. These narratives can be dangerous. Directly linking climate change with aggression and mass migration risks dehumanising those vulnerable to environmental stresses, and casts their attempts to escape a problem caused by mainly rich nations as a security threat. It promotes fear and isolation, rather than compassion and assistance. It also frames conflicts as “natural”, ignoring myriad preventable causes. The truth is more complicated than a hotter planet inevitably meaning more violence, war and chaos. Research uncovering the individual life experiences of vulnerable people on the ground show that the link between climate and conflict is not simple, nor linear. A destabilising climate merely adds extra pressure to a great many pre-existing difficulties. My research in Bangladesh, and the story of one man in particular – 55-year-old Muzaffar from Babupur in the north-east of the country – perfectly illustrates this complexity. In order to truly defend his future, and that of countless others in similar positions, we must understand and tackle structural and social causes of conflict. Muzaffar’s story begins like so many others here: with a difficult past. Poverty forced Muzaffar to work as a child and he never had a chance to attend school. The day he got a family of his own, his main concern was putting food on the table. At the time, food in the area was scarce due to the lack of rain and, as the local climate became less stable, his village struggled increasingly with drought. It was difficult to make money in the village, so Muzaffar decided to leave his wife and eight children behind and migrated to the capital, Dhaka. Here, he worked as a day labourer in the harbour, carrying sand and stones on his head. Unable to afford a house, he lived in a shared dormitory shed made of tin, and full of mosquitoes and ants. I suffered a lot. We were about 50-60 people stuck in there … As I was not educated I could not really change my profession or build up a career. I just made sure to care for my family. That was all that kept me going. After deciding to return home, Muzaffar settled down close to a pond on government-owned land. The local government reassured him that he could stay there. However, powerful men, who had already filed a claim to the land in the local court, showed up one day planting trees next to his house – a common land-grabbing strategy in the area. Muzaffar described their encounter: I told the man … If you win, you will get the land, but for now I will not allow you to plant trees on my land. You can plant [your trees] in the open land instead … They did not want to listen and kept on planting trees. So after a while I went over there to reason with him and pulled away his hand to stop him. He stood up abruptly, and hit me with his spade. I tried to protect myself with my hand, but it cut straight through my hand into my face, here, right next to my eye. Muzaffar fainted as soon as the spade hit his head. His landless indigenous neighbours tried to help him and put him into a taxi to the hospital but his attackers tried to stop him from getting into the vehicle. They would not allow the taxi to leave until Muzaffar’s uncle screamed: “If you want him dead, you better kill him now!”. The police came to the village to investigate what had happened, but Muzaffar could not afford the payment or bribe commonly required for their service. Unable to pay the police, the case is still running in the regional high court, decades later. In the words of Muzaffar, “he who is poor cannot afford to pay the price for justice”. Thankfully, Muzaffar’s life took a positive change. He did not get justice in court, but a few years ago a local NGO gave him a few goats and a sheep, and Bangladesh’s largest NGO gave him a cow. Muzaffar decided to sell his animals, using the money to get a loan, buy a harvester machine, and start a small business.  These days he keeps livestock, harvests other people’s land, rents out his machine, and does share cropping – a collective form of agriculture in which a landowner allows people to farm their land in return for a share of the crops. He has already started to pay back his loans. His eyes were filled with pride during my last visit as he shared the news that his youngest daughter had just finished her bachelor’s degree. Others, of course, are not so lucky. Some are unable to pay their loans, some are forced to sell their land and assets to pay them off – and some lose their livelihoods or end up in jail. The loss of natural resources in the area due to climatic stress played a role in the conflict Muzaffar faced. However, so did land politics and power dynamics, social stigmatisation, discrimination, and the legacy of colonialism. Muzaffar was poor. He was landless. He was not protected by the law. The justice system made it easy for those with more power to take his land. The men who attacked him had powerful connections in the village. Many of these power relations, both in Bangladesh and elsewhere, owe their existence to decisions made during colonial rule. For example, while colonial laws governing the division of land no longer apply, they entrenched inequality in access to resources and influence that still persists today, giving rise to conflict that may never had occurred had countries developed autonomously. Muzaffar is a man of working age, but many in similar positions suffer added structural barriers. Women, the elderly, and children suffer more from the impacts of both conflict and climate change. Unless we address the social power structures responsible for these inequalities, they will continue to be disproportionately affected. We have surprisingly little empirical evidence of how social, psychological, financial, geographical, and political factors contribute to conflict, and how climate change interacts with them. We need much more diverse and interdisciplinary research to better understand how to protect vulnerable people from both conflict and climate change. Arenas such as COP25, the latest iteration of the UN’s annual climate change summit, have the capacity to advance these research efforts. Our children recognise the urgency and are demanding that we look at the science. It is time to listen. Click here to subscribe to our climate action newsletter. Climate change is inevitable.

"The Greenland ice sheet lost a record amount of ice in 2019, equivalent to a million tonnes per minute across the year, satellite data shows. The climate crisis is heating the Arctic at double the rate in lower latitudes, and the ice cap is the biggest single contributor to sea level rise, which already imperils coasts around the world. The ice sheet shrank by 532bn tonnes last year as its surface melted and glaciers fell into the ocean and would have filled seven Olympic-sized swimming pools per second.  The satellite data has been collected since 2003. The 2019 loss was double the annual average since then of 255bn tonnes. Almost that amount was lost in July 2019 alone. Scientists knew that ice loss from Greenland had been accelerating fast in recent decades and that there had been high rates of melting in 2019. But the satellite data accounts for new snowfall and allows the net loss to be calculated. The researchers said the scale of the 2019 loss was shocking and was likely to be the biggest in centuries or even millennia. If the entire Greenland ice sheet melts, sea level would rise by six metres. But the researchers said it was not certain that the sheet had passed the point of no return and that cutting carbon emissions will slow the melting, which would take centuries to complete. The scientists attributed the extreme ice loss in 2019 to “blocking patterns” of weather that kept warm air over Greenland for longer periods. These are becoming increasingly frequent as the world heats up. Almost 96% of the ice sheet underwent melting at some point in 2019, compared with an average of 64% between 1981 and 2010. “[2019 was] really shocking and depressing in terms of the numbers,” said Ingo Sasgen, of the Alfred Wegener Institute in Bremerhaven, Germany, who led the analysis. “But it’s also not very surprising, because we had other strong melt years in 2010 and 2012, and I expect we will see more and more.” Snowfall in Greenland was low in 2019, also due to the blocking pattern, meaning relatively little new ice was added. “The real message is that the ice sheet is strongly out of balance,” Sasgen said. Weather data and computer models allow for losses to be calculated back to 1948. “If we look at the record melt years, the top five occurred in the last 10 years, and that is a concern. But we know what to do about it: reduce CO2 emissions.” Sasgen said a further worry was feedback mechanisms that increase ice loss, including meltwater weakening the ice sheet and speeding its fall into the ocean. Hotter weather also melts the white snow on top of the sheet, revealing darker ice below, which absorbs more of the sun’s heat. “These results come at a crucial time,” said Yara Mohajerani, of the University of California Irvine in the US, who was not part of the study team. “2019 broke the previous record of 2012 by 15%, itself an unmatched record over the past several centuries to millennia.” He said the heating of the Arctic was likely to increase further in coming years. “So it is crucial to closely monitor the changes in [ice] mass of the sheet, and Sasgen and his colleagues have taken an important step in that direction.” The research, published in the journal Communications Earth & Environment, used data from the Nasa’s Grace satellites, which take gravity measurements and in effect weigh the mass of ice in Greenland. The first Grace satellite ended its data collection in June 2017, and its replacement began in May 2018. Data from the second satellite was used to determine how much had been lost in the intervening period. The researchers found 2017 and 2018 had unusually low ice loss, owing to a reversal of the blocking pattern that resulted in cold, snowy conditions fixed over Greenland. But even in these conditions the sheet still lost ice, meaning cold years do not compensate for the hot ones as in the past. “It really shows that we have entered a completely different state,” with a trend of increasing ice losses and more variability each year, Sasgen said. “Greenland has become bipolar in a way.” Prof Stefan Rahmstorf, of the University of Potsdam in Germany, said the new analysis was convincing and showed the transition from the old to the new satellite had worked smoothly. “Since meltwater is freshwater, it dilutes the salt content of the surrounding ocean, which contributes to slowing the Gulf stream system,” Rahmstorf said. “If we wanted to make the 500bn tonnes of freshwater added in 2019 as salty as ocean water, about 200,000 Panamax-class cargo ships full of salt would need to dump their load into the Atlantic.” Despite the rapid melting, the Greenland ice sheet is not necessarily doomed to melt entirely. Firstly, as glaciers retreat they lose contact with warmer ocean waters and therefore melt less. Secondly, the melting of the sheet with warm air takes centuries, during which time the rise in global temperatures might be reversed. “If we reduce CO2, we will reduce Arctic warming and we will therefore also reduce the sea level rise contribution from the Greenland ice sheet,” Sasgen said. “So even though it might eventually disappear in large part, it happens much slower, which would be better as it would allow more time for the 600 million people living near coasts to move away.” • The key on the graph was amended on 21 August 2020 to refer to ice mass change, not loss as an earlier version said."
"Whenever confronted with a tragedy in your life, one of the hardest aspects to deal with is that life goes on – work continues, other events occur, bills need to be paid, the world keeps on turning. It can actually be a struggle to realise that even though you are feeling dreadful, other problems and tasks remain to be addressed. So it is with the Covid-19 pandemic. The world’s economy has been struck by an utterly tragic event that has wrecked lives and businesses. Not surprisingly, it has focused all our attention. It would be nice if, with all the economic destruction, the loss of lives and massive disruption to people’s relationships, the rest of the world’s problems stopped and allowed us to just focus on this one issue. But, as in our own personal life, other issues and problems remain, and first among them is climate change. This week came news of the first major fire of the fire season. Yes, the fire season has already started, and once again we start looking at the “fires near me” app. We also had the record highest temperature ever recorded when Death Valley in the US hit 54.4C. Then came a report on the increasing inability of the Great Barrier Reef to recover from bleaching events. And to top it all off, Nasa’s Goddard Institute for Space Studies estimates that July this year was the second warmest July recorded. To be honest, that is not much of a shock – every month this year has either been the warmest or second warmest on record. As a result the average global air and surface temperature of the first seven months of this year is just below the record warmest year of 2016. The problem is in that year we were experiencing the strongest El Niño this century. By contrast, the Bureau of Meteorology estimates there is around a 70% chance of La Niña forming in 2020 – a state of affairs that should see lower temperatures, not ones previously associated with abnormal weather events. Should scientists develop a vaccine for Covid-19 and should it be taken up well enough around the world to ensure the economy can open up again and return to some sort of normality, the climate crisis will still be there. And even if a vaccine is not developed, the climate crisis will still be there. Yet this crisis brings with it opportunity. Massive government investment is required to fill the chasm left by the private sector, and using it to shift our economy to renewables fits pretty much every goal of providing jobs, investment, research and also attacking climate change. And yet the Morrison government remains focused on a gas-led recovery, which is no recovery at all. It is a kick-the-can-down-the-road approach. It is largely in keeping with this government, which is very good at making announcements – be it about aged care, border force or vaccines – but less able to deliver. The “Scotty from marketing” jibe would be less potent if the prime minister did not provide so many examples that fit. It aligns with a government whose ministers’ offices will be quickly on the phone if you suggest they don’t believe in climate change, but who will resist any policy that actually does something about our emissions. Guardian Australia’s ongoing series on the Green Recovery and news of plans for constructing another large wind, solar and storage project in South Australia highlight just how great are the possibilities for shifting from a fossil fuel-based economy. While the states will do what they can despite the national government’s intransigence, so obvious is the need for large investment and so well does it fit within the scope of economic recovery, that the Morrison government’s failure to take the lead is as damning as its lack of planning for how to deal with the coronavirus in the aged care system. When tragedy strikes, the world doesn’t stop turning, and our current recession has not stopped the world from warming. But it has given governments around the world an opportunity – indeed the perfect excuse – to shift their economies away from fossil fuel. All we need is a government willing to grasp the opportunity."

From the LEIBNIZ INSTITUTE FOR TROPOSPHERIC RESEARCH (TROPOS) and the department of settled science comes this new discovery related to cloud formation.
Surface of the oceans affects climate more than thought
First detected abiotic source of isoprene
More isoprene is apparently produced on the border between ocean and atmosphere than previously thought. The gas contributes to the formation of clouds and has therefore influence on the global climate. Photo: Tilo Arnhold/TROPOS
Lyon/ Leipzig. The oceans seem to produce significantly more isoprene, and consequently affect the climate more than previously thought. This emerges from a study by the Institute of Catalysis and Environment in Lyon (IRCELYON, CNRS / University Lyon 1) and the Leibniz Institute for Tropospheric Research (TROPOS), which had studied samples of the surface film in the laboratory. The results underline the global significance of the chemical processes at the border between ocean and atmosphere, write the researchers in the journal Environmental Science & Technology. Isoprene is a gas that is formed by both the vegetation and the oceans. It is very important for the climate because this gas can form particles that can become clouds and then later affect temperature and precipitation. Previously it was assumed that isoprene is primarily caused by biological processes from plankton in the sea water. The atmospheric chemists from France and Germany, however, could now show that isoprene could also be formed without biological sources in surface film of the oceans by sunlight and so explain the large discrepancy between field measurements and models. The new identified photochemical reaction is therefore important to improve the climate models.
The oceans not only take up heat and carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, they are also sources of various gaseous compounds, thereby affecting the global climate. A key role is played by the so-called surface microlayer (SML), especially at low wind speed. In these few micrometers thin layer different organic substances such as dissolved organic matter, fat and amino acids, proteins, lipids are accumulating as well as trace metals, dust and microorganisms.
For the now published study, the research team took samples from the Norther Atlantic Ocean. The surface film was collected in the Raunefjord near Bergen in Norway. For this purpose, a glass plate is immersed in water and then again carefully pulled from the water. The 200 micron thin film sticks to the glass and is then scraped off with a wiper. The sample thus obtained is analyzed in the laboratory later. At the Institute of Catalysis and Environment in Lyon (IRCELYON), which belongs to the French research organization CNRS and the University of Lyon 1, the team investigated its photochemical properties during which collected samples were irradiated with light and the gases were analyzed: it became clear that isoprene was produced in magtnetudes that were previously attributed solely to plankton. “We were able for the first time trace back the production of this important aerosol precursor to abiotic sources, so far global calculations consider only biological sources,” explains Dr. Christian George from IRCELYON.
In the laboratory of IRCELYON in Lyon the sea water was artificially illuminated by the group led by Dr. George Christian. The resultant gases were analysed to investigate the photochemical processes at the interface between sea water and the atmosphere. Photo: IRCELYON
Thus, it is now possible to estimate more closely the total amounts of isoprene, which are emitted. So far, however, local measurements indicated levels of about 0.3 megatonnes per year, global simulations of around 1.9 megatons per year. But the team of Lyon and Leipzig estimates that the newly discovered photochemical pathway alone contribute 0.2 to 3.5 megatons per year additionally and could explain the recent disagreements. “The existence of the organic films at the ocean surface due to biological activities therefore influences the exchange processes between air and sea in a unexpected strong way. The photochemical processes at this interface could be a very significant source of isoprene”, summarizes Prof. Hartmut Herrmann from TROPOS.
The processes at the boundary between water and air are currently of great interest in science: In August, the team from the CNRS and TROPOS presented evidence in Scientific Reports, the open-access journal of Nature, that dissolved organic material in the surface film is strengthening the chemical conversion of saturated fatty acids into unsaturated gas phase products under the influence of sunlight. For the first time it was realized that these products have to be of biological origin not only, but also abiotic processes at the interface between two media have the potential to produce such molecules. In early September another team from Canada, the US, Great Britain and Germany showed in the journal Nature that organic material from the surface film of the oceans can be an important source for the formation of ice in clouds over remote regions of the North Atlantic, North Pacific and Southern Ocean. The recent publication of the teams from CNRS and TROPOS in Environmental Science & Technology provides indications how the climate models in the important details of the influence of isoprene could be improved. Because of the great importance this paper will be open access as “Editor’s Choice”.

"MOUNT GILEAD, Ohio  —   The challenge Annette Cottrell pondered was how to grade President Trump’s stormy first full week on the job. A trade war bubbling up with Mexico. A divisive border wall. A ban on refugees from   countries. Brawls with the news media and national parks. “I’d give him an ” Ms. Cottrell, 38, said from her salon, Mane Attraction, on Main Street here in the seat of a conservative Ohio county of pastures and maple groves where Mr. Trump won 70 percent of the vote. “He’s doing what he said he was going to be doing. ” So, about that   week. Mr. Trump drew a torrent of criticism after pressing a series of falsehoods about voter fraud, the size of the crowd at his inauguration and his attacks on the intelligence community. His   executive actions reversing years of policy on immigration, abortion and the environment left his critics seething and fearful and liberal opponents preparing a volley of legal challenges to blunt them. But in more than two dozen interviews this week, voters who helped hand Mr. Trump the presidency  —     and reluctant supporters alike  —   were cheering from their living rooms, offices and diners across America as they saw the outlines of a new conservative era in government fast taking shape, even if they were still a little uneasy about the man doing the shaping. Yes, they said, Mr. Trump should tone down his tweets and rein in what they gently called his impulse toward “exaggeration. ” “Honestly, he sometimes needs to shut up,” said Joshua Wade, 24, of Ann Arbor, Mich. a state that had not supported a Republican for president since George Bush in 1988. “Just do what we elected you to do. We won. Drop the inauguration stuff. It’s fine. ” Gun rights top Mr. Wade’s wish list for the new administration. He wants Supreme Court nominees friendly to gun owners and laws that extend   rights across state lines. He said he had been encouraged that Mr. Trump took swift action on some campaign promises during his early days in office. “There’s no doubt: He’s good at showmanship,” said Mr. Wade, a registered Republican. “But I think this first week is proving he’s capable of following through on that with real action. ” But what appeals to supporters may be turning off independents. A Quinnipiac University poll released on Thursday gave Mr. Trump only a 36 percent job approval rating and found that majorities of people surveyed said he was neither honest nor levelheaded. Still, Trump voters interviewed said they cared little if the president spouted off on Twitter because he was issuing the kind of executive actions many had long craved  —   freezing federal grant money for environmental research, banning foreign aid for groups that give abortion counseling and cutting off immigration from several   nations. “Trump’s done more in five days than Obama did in eight years,” said Doug Cooperrider, 58, who works in construction repairing bridges and roads around central Ohio. The bar at Boondocks, where Mr. Cooperrider dug into a B. L. T. sandwich on a sleety morning, sits about 1, 900 miles from the Arizona deserts where sections of the   border wall may rise. The Hispanic population is tiny in this overwhelmingly white county of 35, 000, and it has grown only 0. 3 percent in the past five years. Still, people here said they felt as if immigration had undercut wages for construction workers in the area. One man said he was uneasy about the longstanding Somali community in Columbus, about an hour’s drive south. Several embraced Mr. Trump’s directives that limited new refugees, ordered up the border wall and cut off federal grant money to cities labeled sanctuaries for immigrants. “I’m 100 percent behind the wall,” said Ms. Cottrell, the salon owner. “If he asked me to lay the first brick, I’d sign up. I’m tired of them being here illegally and cutthroating the rest of us. ” She and her husband, Andrew, a Navy veteran, said their views of government had been colored by years spent struggling to get a disability claim approved for him by the Department of Veterans Affairs. They were early and enthusiastic Trump supporters, and when they went on road trips this year, they gauged their candidate’s support by counting up his yard signs and Hillary Clinton’s. Mr. Cottrell, 34, said he supported aid to feed and shelter refugees  —   but he blanched at welcoming them here. “It should be about America first,” Mr. Cottrell said. “We see way too many vets waiting in line, homeless, while we’re helping refugees and immigrants. ” Mr. Cottrell said he had wanted Mr. Trump to gut the   staff of the V. A. and was disappointed when he instead kept on an Obama administration official to oversee the agency. But he said that did not affect his support for Mr. Trump. “I have never seen someone make promises and immediately start keeping them,” he said. Most of those promises are a long way from fulfilled. The Affordable Care Act remains the law of the land. Efforts to build the Keystone XL pipeline or finish the Dakota Access pipeline could become mired in years of litigation. There is no agreement on how to pay for a $20 billion Mexican border wall. But moves like banning funding for overseas health providers who discuss abortion have a more rapid effect. Laura Alexandria, the director of operations for Grand Rapids Right to Life in Michigan, said she hoped to see the federal government soon remove financing for Planned Parenthood in the United States. “We have a   president back in the White House, and that is very encouraging,” she said. Ms. Alexandria said she had been in Washington for the inauguration, and she was back there this week for Friday’s March for Life by abortion opponents. She said her organization had organized 12 buses to take people from Michigan to the march. If President Obama was a   “Rorschach test” for voters in 2008, Mr. Trump’s actions calling for curbing regulations and repealing Obamacare were   sketches. He roughed them out, and his supporters filled in the details. Robert Kersey, 82, the president of an   foundry in Muncie, Ind. said he hoped Mr. Trump would pull back a recent announcement from the Occupational Safety and Health Administration addressing silica dust, which can lead to debilitating and fatal lung diseases. Mr. Kersey said he sees the rule as a burden and does not believe it will make his employees safer. Inside a gift shop in Mount Gilead’s   downtown, Amanda Abdon, 28, said she was eager for a repeal of the health care tax penalty her boyfriend had to pay this year. Eddie Lou Meimer, 70, walking through her family farm south of town, said she wanted the federal government to ease the kind of   regulations that she said had forced her to build a $40, 000 canning room for her   business. “He’s a    person,” Ms. Meimer said of the president. “I wish somebody would grab his phone. But it seems to take the press’s mind off what he’s really doing. ”"
"Climate change, plastic pollution, rising sea levels – environmentalists in developed countries are calling for action on the planetary emergency. But when environmentalists are brave enough to speak out in places like Barrancabermeja, Colombia, they’re often protesting against very local problems. Lack of sanitation, contaminated water, deforestation for palm oil – degradation of the local environment and the direct threat to human health are closely linked and clear to people here.  Barrancabermeja hosts Colombia’s largest petroleum refinery, which has been operating for just over 100 years. Over that time, local industries have contaminated natural water courses with heavy metals, which has been absorbed by the soil and the surrounding vegetation that local cattle eat, which have also showed high levels of heavy metals. The plumbing that is supposed to supply the city with fresh water doesn’t reach all areas, meaning that some places lack running water and sewage treatment. This situation has motivated passionate environmental protests.

      Environmental stress is already causing death – this chaos map shows where


 But these are nothing new. In the general city strike of 1963, pollution and access to water were two of the main issues. Safe drinking water was also a recurrent theme throughout the city strikes of the 1970s. Even during the worst of the Colombian conflict from the 1980s to the early 2000s, the people of Barrancabermeja were brave enough to continue protesting for the right to clean water, and they still do today. Here in the heavy industry heartland of Colombia, environmentalism has old roots and has endured through decades of violence and intimidation. In order to understand how street movements can prosper, it’s worth asking how people here have maintained popular concern for the environment over so many years and under so much pressure. Environmental protests in developing countries in Asia, Latin America, Africa and the Caribbeann can be dangerous. These regions are often collectively called the Global South. Of the 20 countries with the most murders of environmental activists in 2018, 19 are considered to be part of the Global South. The only exception is Ukraine, which ranks 10th with three deaths. Philippines has more registered murders than any other, with 30 killed in 2018. But it’s closely followed by Colombia, with 24.  These are only official numbers that don’t account for disappearances or unregistered assassinations. They also do not accurately capture the atmosphere of persecution and abuse that torments activists. In Barrancabermeja, environmental leaders are slandered, bullied and threatened. Many have had to abandon their home and seek political asylum abroad.

      Defending the environment now more lethal than soldiering in some war zones – and indigenous peoples are suffering most


 The environmental movement gained the support of millions of people in 2019. Extinction Rebellion and the climate strikes have mobilised people who are concerned about climate change but live lives of relative affluence, far from the front lines of battles over fresh water and clean air. This doesn’t diminish their role or invalidate their cause. Standing in solidarity with people less fortunate and calling for coordinated, global action is essential, and it’s great to see the media covering it. But the experiences of people protesting in Barrancabermeja need to be heard too. It’s important to acknowledge the differences between environmental struggles around the world to address the diverse challenges of failing ecosystems and value the contributions of all towards finding solutions. Raising awareness of rising temperatures and shifting coastlines is important – the climate crisis is after all a global problem. But the risks aren’t evenly distributed, and the effects are more localised and pressing for some. Media scrutiny of the powerful in places like  Barrancabermeja could raise pressure to protect the brave work of activists there.  Let’s show that environmentalism is both global and local, and responding to threats both present and future. Let’s show solidarity with the people in Barrancabermeja.

Share this...FacebookTwitterIncredible String of Failures by Rahmstorf Continues: New Study Finds no Robust Relationship Between Shrinking Sea Ice and European Cold Waves
By Dr. Sebastian Lüning and Prof. Fritz Vahrenholt
(German text translated/edited by P Gosselin)
Photo above: by NASA (public domain)
It was some three years ago when Potsdam climate scientist Srtefan Rahmstorf railed against the German DWD National Weather Service at his Klimalounge site. The DWD indeed had dared to contradict Rahmstorf. The issue was about the relationship between Arctic sea ice extent and cold winter weather in Europe. Rahmstorf’s simple model: less Arctic sea ice [from global warming] causes cold European winters.
To back this up, he listed studies and claimed:
In my view, the above studies provide strong evidence for a link between Arctic ice loss due to global warming, more frequent winter high pressure, especially over the Atlantic-European part of the Arctic, and an associated influx of cold air to Europe. As we have often seen in recent winters – for example in a spectacular way in the first half of February 2012.”
Here Rahmstorf made wild assertions and dished out loads of harsh criticism, calling the DWD “embarrassing”, and incompetent with questions concerning climate change, and claiming that it couldn’t even read scientific publications, and that it had made a trivial argument”. That’s an unusually aggressive manner of discussion one seldom sees in science. Rahmstorf tone:
However, the taz quoted [German paper] yesterday the spokesman of the German Weather Service [DWD in German] as saying that if there was a direct relationship with the sea ice cover,  the entire winter would have to be very cold in Germany. I think this trivial argument with which he would like to wipe from the table the climate research results shown above  is pretty embarrassing for the DWD.  Of course open water in the Arctic  does not prevent stochastic weather variability.  There will always be warm and cold periods. In all these studies it comes down to changing probabilities in the prevailing weather patterns: Petoukhov and Semenov estimate that the probability of cold winter extremes could triple, that is even in the Abstract. One wonders whether the DWD representative has read the relevant studies at all – and if not, why he feels the urge to comment on them in the media. Unfortunately, it has a certain tradition that meteorologists dealing with weather, are not familiar with climate science.”
It’s now been three years since Rahmstorf’s outburst. In the meantime research has since looked at the subject professionally and is now able to present the first robust results. On 11 August 2016 a group of scientists led by Hans Chen of Pennsylvania State University presented a paper in the Journal of Climate that will cause some sleepless nights for Stefan Rahmstorf.
Rahmstorf was not even close
The bitter findings: Rahmstorf was not even in the ballpark. He unjustifiably mistreated the DWD. The truth is, according to Chen et al. 2016, there is no robust relationship between Arctic sea ice and the weather at the middle latitudes.
Here are some excerpts of the study:

These results show that the linear relationship between Arctic  sea-ice loss and mid-latitude weather patterns is weak, suggesting that the remote atmospheric  response is small compared with the internal variability, or highly nonlinear with respect to the  sea-ice area anomalies.”
And:
Thus, our results do not show evidence of an unusually elongated jet stream associated with  Arctic sea-ice loss on a monthly time scale.”
And:
We have shown using several different metrics that the remote atmospheric response can be non-robust due to internal dynamics alone,  and leave diagnosis of mechanisms behind this non-robustness for future studies.”
In anutshell: Cold weathers are weather.
Rahmstorf’s attempt to “anthropogenize” winter weather failed big-time. Yet it does reveal a hasty attempt to “climatize” some cold winters. Solid science would never need to stoop to such cheap publicity gags.
What follows is the abstract of the new study by Chen et al. 2016:
The robustness of mid-latitude weather pattern changes due to Arctic sea-ice loss
The significance and robustness of the link between Arctic sea-ice loss and changes in mid-latitude weather patterns is investigated through a series of model simulations in Community Atmosphere Model 5.3 with systematically perturbed sea-ice cover in the Arctic. Using a large ensemble of ten sea-ice scenarios and 550 simulations, it is found that prescribed Arctic sea-ice anomalies produce statistically significant changes for certain metrics of the mid-latitude circulation but not for others. Furthermore, the significant mid-latitude circulation changes do not scale linearly with the sea-ice anomalies, and are not present in all scenarios, indicating that the remote atmospheric response to reduced Arctic sea ice can be statistically significant under certain conditions, but is generally non-robust. Shifts in the Northern Hemisphere polar jet stream and changes in the meridional extent of upper-level large-scale waves due to the sea ice perturbations are generally small and not clearly distinguished from intrinsic variability. Reduced Arctic sea ice may favor a circulation pattern that resembles the negative phase of the Arctic Oscillation, and may increase the risk of cold outbreaks in eastern Asia by almost 50 %, but this response is found in only half of the scenarios with negative sea-ice anomalies. In eastern North America the frequency of extreme cold events decreases almost linearly with decreasing sea-ice cover. Our finding of frequent significant anomalies without a robust linear response suggests interactions between variability and persistence in the coupled system, which may contribute to the lack of convergence among studies of Arctic influences on mid-latitude circulation.”
And how did the German media react to this important publication? Four years ago they reported on Rahmtorf’s visions of cold waves extensively (Zeit, Welt). Today there is silence. Not a single major daily took up the story. Obviously the media did not want to embarrass itself. It is yet another example for our category “Schweigen im Walde” (“inconvenient scientific results that do not get reported on by the German language press or media because its does not fit the solidly established climate alarmism storyline in German journalism.

"The Carbon Sense Coalition today came out in support of “lights out” during Earth Hour (Saturday 29th) but claimed the time should be renamed “Dark Hour” and suggested that consumers should also forgo the consumption of gasoline and diesel during this period.
The chairman of “Carbon Sense”, Mr Viv Forbes, claimed that consumers should spend the hour they sit in the dark with no transport, air conditioning or hot coffee, remembering the contribution that carbon fuels have made to modern society.

“And while contemplating this hour of darkness, they should steel themselves for the hour when, if the Global warming alarmists have their way, this will become a necessity not a nicety.
“The only thing that lifted mankind from the Stone Age was carbon energy from charcoal, coal, oil and gas – for heating; for steam power; for electricity and water; for mining, smelting and refining of metals; for transport on land, sea and air; for lighting, heating, cooling and communications; for production of food and chemicals; and for power for processing and manufacturing.
“All of this comfort, safety, convenience and prosperity is now threatened by hysterical claims that man’s carbon emissions can and should be stopped. Even though the weather records and the science deny the doomsday forecasts, the politicians, like lemmings, are leading us over the Greenhouse Cliff. Without the nuclear parachute, it will not be a pleasant fall. 
“Many other countries have already experienced their own dark days, most caused by silly decisions taken to appease the Greenhouse Gods.
“If we continue down this path, we can no longer assume that electricity will come at the flick of a switch. Consumers need to learn a new vocabulary for these bad new times – “load shedding, demand management, quota allocation, rolling blackouts, brownouts, emission permits, load prioritisation, interruptible customers, emergency customers, zone rota systems, power emergency declarations, priority lines, three-day-week rationing, power outages, grid instability, electricity rationing, operating reserve, maintenance shutdowns . . . ” all the jargon of a power system in crisis, suffering from stagnant or falling capacity and growing demand.
“One of the first places to experience power shortages was, appropriately enough, California in the early 2000’s, where Deep Greens have harassed and delayed every practical method of generating base-load power. The operating reserve margin in California is now about 5% whereas 15% is considered safe. More “Dark Hours” can be expected there. And their Green Tick solar collectors will produce 12 Dark Hours EVERY DAY.
“Then came South Africa, which was forced to shut its big mines for several hours because of insufficient power to guarantee safe operation of the hoists. The South African government has now admitted that demand for electricity will exceed supply until 2013 – five years of dark hours are in prospect there. 
“Then it was China’s turn. The Global Cooling of 2007 plus insufficient generating capacity and inadequate coal stocks caused widespread power failures. Whole regions and millions of people were forced to cope with blizzards without power for days. Power blackouts and brownouts hit 17 Chinese provinces.
“Then one day in Texas recently, the wind dropped, the whirling blades stopped turning, power supply collapsed and load shedding commenced before the old reliables of coal, nuclear or gas could pick up the slack.
“The aging European power grids are now also subject to similar disruptions from the intermittent supply from unreliable sources like wind and solar. However France has been very canny by building large nuclear capacity, then agitating for decarbonisation for their competitors. Foolish Germany got sucked into this caper, but also committed to phase out their nuclear power. It is not possible to cut both nuclear power and carbon emissions at the same time without morbid consequences. Germans can only continue this rot while their accommodating neighbours will sell them the power.
“Across Africa, the Americas and the -stans, the same problem appears – an aging power grid and an orchestrated campaign to delay and deter new power stations.
“Even here in Queensland, the coal capital of the world, a few blackouts in 2004 revealed an over-loaded and under-funded electricity grid. There may be a few more Dark Hours for us, at less convenient times. 
“Australia and New Zealand both live in cuckoo land, believing they can maintain living standards in the face of population growth while drastically cutting carbon emissions and prohibiting nuclear power. Saturday’s “Dark Hour” caper may be just a practice run.
“So, let us all in Australia and New Zealand spend our “Dark Hour” thinking on the realities of life – such as where we will get the electricity, motor fuel, food and jobs for our kids and grandkids if we allow the Deep Greens to destroy our backbone industries, on the false promise that our sacrifice will improve the future climate. 
To steal a phrase from my friend, Rod Bates: “On Saturday night, after they have turned off their lights, I suggest the participants in Earth Hour wander down to the nearest beach, pee into the sea and observe what effect it has on the tide.”
“This will illustrate the effect that cutting man-made carbon emissions will have on future climate.”
Additional Notes:
Both the science and the past records are indicating very strongly that man-made carbon dioxide has negligible consequences for climate change. For a very good summary of the science, by a scientist, in plain language see: www.middlebury.net/op-ed/global-warming-01.html
Given the political momentum for the introduction of damaging policies such as Emissions Trading or Carbon Taxes, Carbon Sense repeats its call for a joint ANZ Royal Commission into the science of man-made global warming.  Carbon Sense strongly believes that only through settling the science will the truth emerge.” See: www.carbon-sense.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/02/royal-commission.pdf

PS. Since the above statement was released I received an email on Monday 31st March 2008 from a South African associate, Will Alexander, a respected water engineer and Professor Emeritus of the Department of Civil and Biosystems Engineering of the University of Pretoria. (His studies of rainfall patterns also demolishes any dominant role for man-made CO2 in climate cycles.) Here is a direct quote from Pretoria, on the future facing all of us unless we wake up:
“The planned electricity blackouts also start on Monday. In our suburb the power will be switched off from 10.00 to 12.30 on alternate days of the week excluding Sundays. In addition, Eskom is urging all of us to make personal sacrifices such as switching off our geysers during daylight hours and hanging up our clothes to dry instead of using clothes driers. Cosatu has threatened to have nation-wide strikes because of the job losses. The Governor of the Reserve Bank has expressed his concern about the effect that the proposed 60% increase in electricity tariff on top of the load shedding will have on our national economy. 
“Looking on the brighter side all that is missing is the air raid sirens and Vera Lynn singing “We’ll meet again” on the battery operated radio set.”

You Ought to Have a Look _is a feature from the Center for the Study of Science posted by Patrick J. Michaels and Paul C. (“Chip”) Knappenberger. While this section will feature all of the areas of interest that we are emphasizing, the prominence of the climate issue is driving a tremendous amount of web traffic. Here we post a few of the best in recent days, along with our color commentary._   
  
_—_   
  
In Paris this December, the U.N. will hold its 21st Conference of the Parties (COP) to the 1992 Rio Treaty (officially known as the UN framework Convention on Climate Change). Like the 20 previous COPs, the goal will be to entice (browbeat) as many countries as possible to commit to reducing greenhouse gas emissions in an attempt to ""stabilize greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere at a level that would prevent dangerous anthropogenic interference with the climate system."" [“Dangerous anthropogenic interference” has been defined to mean a global average temperature rise of more than 2.0°C above the preindustrial global average temperature. We are highly doubtful that a 2.0°C rise (of which we are more than a third of the way there) will actually prove “dangerous” especially when adaptations are factored in, but we digress.]   
  
And like the 20 COPs that have come before, COP 21 will fail—largely because greenhouse gas emissions result primarily from burning fossil fuels to produce the energy which powers the modern economy. Those with a modern economy want to keep it rolling along, and those without, desperately strive for one. Neither group is willing to budge much from these wishes. Consequently global emissions continue to rise.   
  
Even the U.N. now is beginning to realize that meeting a 2.0°C warming target is virtually impossible—this despite rather absurd new calls for the target to be lowered to 1.5°C.   
  
Nevertheless, the U.N. continues to go through the motions (after all, COPs are big business).   
  
At last year’s COP 20, held in Lima, Peru, the best that everyone could agree on was assigning each country some homework along the lines of this: Describe what types of greenhouse gas emissions reductions (with targets and timetables) that you feel you may undertake; justify your answer. The assignment was due on March 31. Most countries are tardy.   
  
Under U.N. terminology, the homework must include a declaration of each country’s “Intended Nationally-Derived Contributions (INDCs)” –that is, what each “intends” to do to reduce their carbon dioxide (and other greenhouse gas) emissions.   
  
A look through some of the work that has been handed in on time reveals a strange mélange on “intentions.”   




For example, Russia’s INDC reveals that its declared intent to the U.N. is less stringent than what it already intends to do via its own existing domestic programs. The chart below points out this rather odd occurrence:   






Basically, if we are understanding this right, Russia is proposing to the U.N. a more lax timetable than required via its existing domestic programs and a reliance to the “maximum possible” extent on carbon credits from carbon dioxide uptake by boreal forests.   
  
The Russian proposal already has enviros wringing their hands.   
  
Let’s move on to Mexico. What they claim they intend to do is virtually impossible.   
  
Mexico says it intends to peak its national CO2 emissions in 2026—just 11 years from now.   
  
That’ll be some trick; the charts below show why. The top one is Mexico’s population projections between 2010 and 2050. The forecast is for a robustly growing population, adding over 30 million people by 2050—all of which presumably will require energy to subsist. The bottom figure shows Mexico’s per capita greenhouse gas emissions history for the past 20 years. Again, robust growth indicating that Mexico is increasingly meeting its growing energy needs via the use of greenhouse gas-emitting fossil fuels.   






Yet Mexico tells the U.N. that it intends, in just over a decade, not only to halt the growth in per capita emissions, but to turn it downwards to such an extent as to offset population increases. And keep it heading that way.   
  
Predictably, environmental activists hailed Mexico’s announcement.   
  
The real world, on the other hand, isn’t so kind, revealing Mexico’s “intention” as being an empty promise.   
  
And what about the U.S.?   
  
The U.S. announced its intentions as:   




The United States intends to achieve an economy-wide target of reducing its greenhouse gas emissions by 26%-28% below its 2005 level in 2025 and to make best efforts to reduce its emissions by 28%.



Turns out that this a bit less than we proposed to do in when we were negotiating at the UN’s 15th COP in Copenhagen in 2009. There we pledged a 30% reduction by 2025 and a 42% reduction by 2030. Our declining pledge is probably is deference to a thing called reality—as depicted in the figure below (taken from the EPA).   






As seen in the figure, in Copenhagen, in 2009, greenhouse gas emissions from the U.S. had been on the decline for about 5 years, and stood at 8% below our emissions in 2005. Now, five years later, the picture isn’t as rosy. Between 2009 and 2013 (the last year in the EPA has made data available), there has been scant change in our emissions (early indications for 2014 are for emissions up a bit from 2013). This despite natural gas replacing some coal-fired electricity generation (natural gas produces only about half the greenhouse gas emissions as does coal) and higher fuel economy cars.   
  
The President is finding that it is hard to grow the economy and reduce greenhouse gas emissions at the same time (something that we have been saying for a long time).   
  
Consequently, he is paring back our emission targets and timetables.   
  
But no matter the details, _any_ U.S. plan will never contribute much to mitigating future global climate change.   
  
Here’s why: even under the assumption we cut our fossil fuel emissions 100% by the year 2050 (the President’s plan only calls for cuts of about 80%), the amount of future global warming that will be averted is about 0.05°C by the year 2050 and 0.14°C by the year 2100. That’s it! Fourteen-hundredths of a degree—that’s what all the hubbub over carbon taxes, power plant emissions restrictions, Keystone XL pipeline, electric cars, ethanol, etc. is all about. _Fourteen-hundredths of a degree._ And even that is being generous, because it assumes a climate sensitivity to greenhouse gas emissions that is a good 50 to 100 percent greater than what many new scientific studies are pointing to. If we do the same calculation using a climate sensitivity of 2°C rather than 3°C, the warming averted by the year 2100 drops to 0.10°C (one-tenth of a degree).   
  
You can see all this for yourself using our global temperature savings calculator—a great tool (based on a model developed in part by EPA funding) that everyone contemplating greenhouse gas emissions limitations ought to have at their fingertips.   
  
To get a sense of the temperature savings from what the U.S. is intending for Paris, use our tool and select a “CO2 Reduction” of 80% from the U.S.—that scenario matches very closely to the current U.S. plan.   
  
You’ll find a grand total of about 0.11°C of temperature savings by the end of the century. Too little to matter. Impossible to verify. Scientifically insignificant.   
  
All in all, pretty much par for the course when compared with the other INDCs.   
  
We’ll continue to track the Road to Paris. But thus far, it is a Road to Nowhere.

Share this...FacebookTwitterI’m short on time today, as will be the case tomorrow as well, and so here’s something way off topic – from last week. Recall I recently wrote about the glaring hypocrisy and deceitfulness of an all-white German media here.
It appears that the heydays of the media are almost over. Their credibility has been rocked. On wide range of issues they have been misleading, outright lying and covering up for too long and it is now all coming home to roost.
They are being exposed in a big way for what they’ve really been over the past couple of decades. The public has woken up. The media is deservedly a despised institution in the eyes of many citizens.
I was really impressed by the powerful speech made by Laura Ingraham. If you’re short on time, start at about the 13:30 mark.
If you have had it with our media, it’ll resonate like, wow!

And here’s one of my favorite politicians (because he actually got things done). Guliani tells how he’s sick and tired of the media defamation of Trump:

He ought to come to Germany and witness the absolute universal bias here. Here they make Hillary look like a shining role model of a law-abiding citizen.

While listening to _Magic Talk_ off and on, I had a bit of a lightbulb moment regarding the Green’s true agenda. I missed a lot of it but the talk was about the use of large furnaces to burn plastics and other rubbish. My understanding of this process is that it is a two-edged sword. The heat from the fire can be converted into energy but equally importantly, mountains of plastic are burnt thereby helping to sort the massive pollution problem. 



According to NZ Green party politician **Eugenie Sage** , the Minister of Conservation, this is a no go and this is the bit I didn’t hear. Apparently her reasons for this were threefold:



Now I’m no brain surgeon but surely the plant could be scaled to suit and if need be we could even import the plastic as countries would be only too happy to ship it over for free. The emissions statement was also debunked by a caller who said that was ‘rubbish’ and that plants used in other countries gave no emissions or such a small amount to be negligible. Surely the small emissions must be better than mountains of plastic going in to landfill or just dumped into rivers and the sea? There has also been discussion of a 44-foot container system which has plastic fed into one end and biofuel comes out the other. The Greens are not interested in that idea either!



My light bulb moment was that the Greens just **don’t want to solve these problems** – probably because they would then have nothing left to do. The left is all about creating mountains out of molehills with no solutions or actually fixing the problem other than to give them money so that the state will fix it. 



A figure I heard this week was the spend in the US last year on climate change research (over 99% of which is for the pro man-made side), was **80 billion US!** Just imagine for a second how many pro-climate change advocates would be out of a job if that trough dried up?

"**In cities around the world, people are taking to the streets.**
Here's a look at seven places that are seeing varying levels of demonstrations - from peaceful marches to violent clashes.
Soldiers and tanks have been deployed on the streets of Chile for the first time since 1990, when the country returned to democracy after years of military dictatorship.
A state of emergency was declared in the capital, Santiago, on Saturday after protests sparked by a now-suspended increase in metro train prices turned violent. The demonstrations have since widened out to include the cost of living and inequality.
At least five people died in protests over the weekend - after looters torched a garment factory and supermarket - with more disruption expected on Monday.
President SebastiÃ¡n PiÃ±era, a billionaire conservative, has described demonstrators who have caused fires, set up barricades and looting as ""criminals"".
""We're at war against a powerful and implacable enemy who doesn't respect anything or anyone, and who's willing to use limitless violence and criminal acts,"" he said.
From South America to the Middle East, where protests about corruption and austerity in Lebanon are moving into their fifth day.
Hundreds of thousands of people have been on the streets angry about proposed new taxes - including one on voice calls via WhatsApp and other messaging services that was quickly scrapped after being announced last Thursday.
Power cuts and uncollected rubbish are also a source of anger for protesters.
The country's coalition government looks likely to approve some economic reforms, like scrapping taxes and halving salaries of top officials, to stop the protests.
The weekend started peacefully in Barcelona, with 500,000 people on five marches gathering together in the city centre. But it later descended into violence with some protesters throwing objects at police - who responded with tear gas, rubber bullets and water cannons.
It follows prison sentences being handed to nine separatist politicians in Spain who want Catalonia - the Spanish region where Barcelona is - to form an independent country.
By Sunday - the seventh day of protests - demonstrators sat in front of the Spanish national police headquarters with their smartphone torches turned on.
Acting Spanish Prime Minister Pedro SÃ¡nchez warned that those who caused disturbances would face justice.
It's not gained as much attention as demonstrations in other countries recently, but Haiti has been going through weeks of protests - not for the first time this year - over an economic crisis unfolding on the Caribbean island.
Haitians are demanding the resignation of President Jovenel MoÃ¯se, who they blame for fuel shortages and worsening inflation - when the cost of living rises, leading to a decline in the value of money.
A prominent journalist who was covering the protests was found dead in his car with gunshot wounds a few weeks ago.
The president previously rejected calls for his resignation, saying he would not leave the country in the ""hands of armed gangs and drug traffickers"".
This one's not ongoing but up to one million people took to London's streets on Saturday, according to organisers of the ""People's Vote march"", to demand a ""final say"" on Brexit.
People from across the UK marched on Parliament Square, with some saying it was the last chance to show how they felt about getting another Brexit referendum, six months on from the last rally of this scale.
Shadow chancellor John McDonnell and Liberal Democrat leader Jo Swinson were among the politicians who addressed the crowd, while inside the House of Commons MPs were voting for another delay to Brexit.
The government is trying hard to get MPs to vote on the prime minister's deal on Monday.
Politicians in Northern Ireland are sitting in the country's parliament, Stormont, for the first time in nearly three years after being recalled in a last-ditch attempt to stop changes to the abortion law.
Northern Ireland has been without a devolved government since January 2017 - with politicians in the House of Commons passing some key laws on behalf of Northern Ireland since that time.
A law which requires the government to liberalise abortion and extend same-sex marriage to Northern Ireland will come in at midnight - something unionist parties don't want to happen.
It's unlikely politicians there will be able to act in time to change anything - but both those for and against abortion laws being relaxed have been out with placards to let their feelings be known.
There couldn't be a round-up of protests without mentioning Hong Kong - where pro-democracy demonstrations have been taking place for the past four months.
Authorities didn't give permission for this latest march, but organisers say 350,000 people went out anyway - partly fuelled by anger over an attack on pro-democracy leader Jimmy Sham last week which left him in hospital.
A hardcore element of the group launched petrol bombs at a police station, although not all of Sunday's demonstrators were violent.
""The government are now refusing to authorise any peaceful protest,"" one person told the BBC at the demo. ""That means anyone who comes out will inherently be breaking the law. So that's the tactic the Hong Kong government is using.""
Hong Kong's leader Carrie Lam called for an end to the protests in parliament last week.

Software engineering whiz Tony Heller makes a presentation on climate change and the data behind it.
If you haven’t watched it already, then do take the time to do so.

“Utter nonsense”
Heller, who goes by the pseudo-name of Steve Goddard at his wildly popular realclimatecience site, calls the idea that it’s getting hotter “utter nonsense”, and shows how US temperatures were much hotter in the 1930s.

According to Heller, the warming in the US is not real, and was created through statistical tricks after 1990. Later he highlights some of the many ridiculous claims climate experts and activist politicians made, and have since turned out to be a complete folly. At this point the presentation rivets your attention and for skeptics it becomes one you don’t want to stop watching.
“Manipulated to increase alarm”
Heller calls the US warming trend “completely fake” and being due to “station data loss and fabrication” and later shows that NASA “erased” the once unanimously agreed cooling from 1940 – 1970:

 
Not only temperature data have been altered, but so has sea level data, Heller later shows. Overall he writes “climate data is being manipulated to increase alarm“.

You Ought to Have a Look _is a feature from the Center for the Study of Science posted by Patrick J. Michaels and Paul C. (“Chip”) Knappenberger. While this section will feature all of the areas of interest that we are emphasizing, the prominence of the climate issue is driving a tremendous amount of web traffic. Here we post a few of the best in recent days, along with our color commentary._   
  
_\---_   
  
There are several notable pieces this week that relate to the social cost of carbon (SCC)—the government’s powerful tool to aid in justifying all manner of rules and regulations. The SCC is supposed to represent the negative externalities (i.e., projected economic damages in a projected society resulting from projected climate change) that are associated with the emissions of each ton of carbon dioxide. It was developed as a way to translate carbon dioxide emission reductions into dollars savings and to make the “benefits” of proposed climate actions hit closer to home for more people.   
  
But as you may guess from the number of “projected”s in the above parenthetical, the SCC is so highly malleable that you can pretty much game it to produce any value desired—the perfect characteristic for an all-purpose economic cost/benefit tool wielded by an opportunistic and activist government.   
  
The situation is well-described by American Enterprise Institute’s Benjamin Zycher in his recent post for _The Hill_ “The magic of the EPA's benefit/cost analysis.”   




Welcome to the fascinating world of EPA benefit/cost analysis… the administration conducted an ""analysis"" of the ""social cost of carbon"" (SCC), in order to generate an estimate of the marginal externality cost of greenhouse gas emissions (GHG). The problems with that analysis are legion, but the central ones are the use of global (rather than national) benefits to drive the benefit/cost comparison; the failure to apply a 7 percent discount rate to the streams of benefits and costs, despite clear direction from the Office of Management and Budget; and — most important — the use of ozone and particulate reductions as ""co-benefits"" of climate policies. The administration's estimate is about $36 per ton in 2015 ($31 per ton in 2010).   
  
And that is how a regulation yielding future changes in temperatures and sea levels approaching zero can be claimed to yield net benefits ""exceeding $100 billion, making this a highly beneficial rule."" In the EPA's benefit/cost framework, the actual effects of the policies literally are irrelevant; just compute the assumed reduction in GHG emissions, multiply by $36, and voila!



Zycher takes us through the absurdities of just how small the impact of Obama’s “climate” actions is on the actual climate and how the actions are enormously magnified they become when they are run through the social cost of carbon. He concludes:   




It is the delegation of legislative powers to the regulatory agencies that has allowed such game-playing in pursuit of an ideological agenda. The only means with which to restore political accountability to the regulatory process is a requirement that all regulations be approved by Congress.



You can check out his entire article, here.



  
  
If you wonder if the government’s SCC of $36/ton of carbon dioxide (as mentioned by Zycher) is scientifically robust: it isn’t.   
  
This embarrassment is shown by some new work from a team led by Heritage Foundation’s Kevin Dayaratna that also included Ross McKitrick and David Kreutzer. These researchers re-ran the models used by the Obama Administration to determine the social cost of carbon with the most recent estimate of the earth’s climate sensitivity (i.e., how much global warming we should expect to result from our carbon dioxide emissions). The estimate they used came from a paper published by Nic Lewis and Judy Curry last year, replacing the climate sensitivity used by the government which was based on the U.N.’s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) estimates from 2011.   
  
What did they find?   




The resulting Social Cost of Carbon (SCC) estimates are much smaller than those from models based on simulated parameters. In the DICE model the average SCC falls by 30-50% depending on the discount rate, while in the FUND model the average SCC falls by over 80%. The span of estimates across discount rates also shrinks considerably, implying less sensitivity to this parameter choice… Moreover FUND, which takes more explicit account of potential regional benefits from CO2 fertilization and increased agricultural productivity, yields a substantial (about 40 percent or more) probability of a negative SCC through the first half of the 21st century.



Did you catch the end? The model that also includes positive externalities of carbon dioxide emissions (e.g., increased agricultural productivity) produces a decent probability that the social cost of carbon is negative for decades to come. In other words, instead of regulations trying to restrict carbon dioxide emissions, the government ought to be encouraging those emissions.   
  
Given the growing evidence for a low climate sensitivity (see here for our latest on this topic) along with the firmly established evidence that carbon dioxide is a plant fertilizer that increases crop yields (among other benefits), you’d think that science organizations would be pushing the federal government to revise their SCC estimates.   
  
Well, some are, like us. But others, with seemingly more clout (and much more government reliance) are pushing for the opposite.   
  
Take the National Academy of Sciences (NAS), for example. This week they released the results of their examination of ways that the government could improve their SCC determination. Judy Curry has the low down. Notably absent from the NAS’s myriad suggestions was using an updated estimate of the climate sensitivity. Curry writes. “I am gobsmacked that they think the current … values of [equilibrium climate sensitivity] are fine.”   
  
As for us, we are hardly surprised and had this to say in her comment section:   




Judy–why are you surprised about not re-examining the ECS distribution? NAS was created to advise the Federal government by Abraham Lincoln and it has not deviated from that mission. The members of this particular committee are pretty much all on the global warming dole, big time. Why would they behave counter to their interests, which would be to admit that the [climate sensitivity] distributions are wrong and that the most likely values are near the low end of the present (AR4) [IPCC] distribution? That would be the end of the dole and an admission that billions were wasted on a minor issue whose solution is best left to private investment rather than public taxation.



Sadly, we can’t foresee the government letting loose its grip on its all-too-powerful social cost of carbon tool so long as we have a ruling Administration that takes an activist’s role in climate change—despite overwhelming evidence that such a role in unjustified. But we’ll keep trying our best to wrest this abusive device from them.

Share this...FacebookTwitterGermany’s DWD national weather service in Offenbach has released data and results for the month of June 2016 in its latest press release.

Germany and much of Europe have seen plenty of rain in June – all flying in the face of earlier computer models that warned climate change would lead to scorchingly hot summers with protracted periods of drought. The opposite has in fact happened since the predictions were made.
Climate models 86% wrong
So far a vast majority (11 of 13) of Central Europe’s last summers over the past 13 years have been normal or wetter than normal. The current one has started off very wet, and is likely to make it 12 of 14 summers that will be normal wet or wetter than normal, thus making the climate models 86% wrong!
Last summer was drier than normal, receiving 85% of the normal rainfall. The current 14-day forecast for Germany sees rainy weather for the first part of July, with no signs of a dry period in sight.

June temperature in the normal range
June came in warmer than normal, as measured by the DWD’s 2000 measurement stations. The preliminary mean for June was 17°C, 1.2°C above the 1981- 2010 mean.
Precipitation was significantly above normal with an average of 115 liters per square meter falling – some 35% above the mean of 85 liters. Numerous severe thunderstorms and hail hit wide areas of the country.
Somewhat less sunshine than normal.
In June 2016 Germany saw a mean of 181 hours of sunshine, which is 9% below the mean of 198 hours. The northeast region of Germany saw the most sunshine – with areas near 300 hours.  The south and the west regions of the country saw far less sun with many areas seeing well below 150 hours of sunshine.

Share this...FacebookTwitterGerman flagship national daily Die Welt has a commentary by Daniel Wetzel on a new report just released in Berlin by Greenpeace Energy, which outlines what Germany needs to do in order to fulfill the Paris Treaty.
“Unrecognizable in just a few years”
So profound would be the ramifications of doing what is necessary to fulfill the Paris Treaty that Wetzel is left with no option but to label it as the “absurd excrescence of climate protection“.
He writes that if carried out, Germany would be “unrecognizable in just a few years“. In other words, following Paris is pure economic lunacy.
For example the Greenpeace Energy report writes that in order for Germany to meet its Paris Treaty targets, the country would have to completely end its production of vehicles with gasoline and diesel engines by the year 2025, and electrify important freight routes and German autobahns, and of course the entire bus and freight traffic industry in the shortest time. Wetzel writes that it would mean the end of the internal combustion in less than a decade, with no planned alternative for replacement in sight.
What that would mean for the German automotive industry, the very backbone of its economy, the country’s competitiveness, jobs and location as a place to do business, Wetzel writes: “The study does not look into it.”
In Germany one of every 6 jobs is connected to the automotive industry.
Cost? Too high to calculate
On that one point, which concerns transportation, Wetzel writes: “Concepts and cost estimates for this are not yet available.”
Gas and oil heating ban by 2020

Implementing the Paris Treaty to the letter would not only have profound consequences for the transport sector, but also for Germany’s other primary major energy consumer: heating. According to the Greenpeace Energy Report, “Because the product lifetime cycle for heating systems is up to 20 years, it is necessary to ban the installation of new gas and oil heating systems beginning in the year 2020 in order to achieve full decarbonization by 2040“.
Wetzel writes: “German furnace manufacturers would have to stop production immediately.”
To accomplish the aimed decarbonization, Wetzel tells readers that Germany would need to increase its current green energy generation capacity some five fold, according to the study, from 600 terawatt-hours to 3120 terawatt-hours by 2040.
Wetzel criticizes Germany’s Energiewende, claiming that a number of highly naïve projections were used earlier to convince the public that somehow it would all work out. For example in 2010, Germany expected to cut electricity demand some 10% by 2020 when in fact electricity consumption has not been cut back at all – despite three recent relatively mild winters.
To replace Germany’s current fossil fuels with green energy, Wetzel writes that the Greenpeace Energy estimates it will be necessary to increase the current number of wind turbines in operation in Germany from 26,000 today to some 80,000 over the coming years! Yet, anyone who knows the public’s current sentiment with respect to littering the landscape with industrial turbines will tell you that this is all pie in the sky.
Already one German state, Bavaria, has made the permitting of new turbines practically impossible.
Already we see the huge widening chasm between the Greens’ demands and reality – making us wonder if they are still in touch. Undeterred and seemingly immune to rationality, they continue clinging to the decarbonization vision despite its growingly apparent absurdity.
Already Germany has put itself on the path to NOT MEETING the Paris climate targets and by a very long shot. The country’s new energy feed-in act scales back (and certainly does not five-fold) the installation of new renewable energy installations in the future, Wetzel points out.
Already the requirements for fulfilling Paris outlined in the Greenpeace Energy report are rendered dustbin material. Yet the Greenpeace Energy report insists that wind and solar energy installations must be ramped up six fold, and even call for consumers to subsidize it all. Currently, Wetzel writes, Germans are already paying 25 billion euros annually in feed in support.
CO2 emissions, by the way, have not fallen in 7 years, some 175 billion euros later. That even goes beyond “absurd”.

"A Nordic hedge fund worth more than $90bn (£68.6bn) has dumped its stocks in some of the world’s biggest oil companies and miners responsible for lobbying against climate action. Storebrand, a Norwegian asset manager, divested from miner Rio Tinto as well as US oil giants ExxonMobil and Chevron as part of a new climate policy targeting companies that use their political clout to block green policies. The investor is one of many major financial institutions divesting from polluting industries, but is understood to be the first to dump shares in companies which use their influence to slow the pace of climate action. Jan Erik Saugestad, the chief executive of Storebrand, said corporate lobbying activity designed to undermine solutions to “the greatest risks facing humanity” is “simply unacceptable”. Storebrand will also divest from German chemicals company BASF and US electricity supplier Southern Company for lobbying against climate regulation, and a string of companies that derive more than 5% of their revenues from coal or oil sands. “We need to accelerate away from oil and gas without deflecting attention on to carbon offsetting and carbon capture and storage. Renewable energy sources like solar and wind power are readily available alternatives,” he said. “The Exxons and Chevrons of the world are holding us back,” he added. “This initial move does not mean that BP, Shell, Equinor and other oil and gas majors can rest easy and continue with business as usual, even though they are performing relatively better than US oil majors.” ExxonMobil lobbyists met key European commission officials in an attempt to water down the European Green Deal in the weeks before it was agreed, according to climate lobbying watchdog InfluenceMap. Saugestad said he expects Storebrand’s investor peers will follow its lead in divesting from companies that support anti-climate lobbying “as part of a logical progression in global fossil fuel divestment”. InfluenceMap has previously found that five of the largest listed oil companies – including Exxon, Chevron, Shell, BP and Total – spend about $200m a year lobbying to delay, control or block policies to tackle climate change. The analysis found that BP spent the most on lobbying activities. The company successfully lobbied US policymakers to weaken a landmark environmental law, clearing the way for new projects, such as oil pipelines and power plants, to move forward with far less federal review of their environmental impact. Under BP’s new chief executive, Bernard Looney, the company has undertaken a major review of its lobby group memberships and severed ties with three associations because of disagreements over their climate-related policies and activities. It has also set ambitious climate targets for the next 10 years, and to 2050."
"**Hong Kong's rule of law has been pushed to the ""brink of total collapse"" after more than five months of protests, police have warned.**
The warning came as protesters clashed with police across the city on Tuesday.
At the Chinese University of Hong Kong, police fired tear gas and rubber bullets at protesters who built barricades on the campus.
Earlier in the day, around 1,000 protesters rallied in central Hong Kong during the lunch hour blocking roads
Protesters, wearing office clothes, were seen chanting: ""Fight for freedom, stand with Hong Kong!""
The demonstrations come just a day after the territory saw a marked escalation in violence, with police shooting one activist in the torso. A pro-Beijing supporter was set on fire by anti-government protesters.
The protests started in June against a now-withdrawn plan to allow extradition to mainland China, but have since morphed into wider demonstrations, with activists demanding greater democracy and police accountability in Hong Kong.
On Tuesday afternoon, police spokesman Kong Wing-cheung hit out at the protesters, saying they had ""countless examples of rioters using random and indiscriminate violence against innocent"" people.
""Hong Kong's rule of law has been pushed to the brink of total collapse as masked rioters recklessly escalate their violence under the hope that they can get away with it,"" he told reporters, adding that Monday's attack on the pro-Beijing supporter was being investigated as attempted murder.
Speaking at the same conference, Supt Li Kwai-wah defended the officer's decision to shoot the protester on Monday.
""We found out that our colleague did not only face threat from one person, instead it was a group of people with an organised plan attempting to steal the gun,"" he said.
""In a situation like this, we believe our police are reacting according to the guideline, to protect themselves as well as the people around them.""
Both the protester and the pro-Beijing supporter remain in hospital, with the latter in a critical condition.
Clashes erupted at the Chinese University of Hong Kong, with police firing tear gas to disperse students, while at City University there was a standoff between students and riot police which continued into the evening.
Police continued to use tear gas to try to disperse the protesters who responded with bricks and petrol bombs. Hundreds of protesters remain at the Chinese University of Hong Kong.
Students built roadblocks on streets in and around City University campus to stop police from entering. At one stage, a van used as part of a street barricade was set on fire.
Students at Hong Kong Polytechnic also tried to disrupt traffic near their campus.
In the morning, suspended railway services and road closures had already led to long traffic jams in the early rush hour. At noon, protesters moved into the city's central business district for a flash mob protest.
Protests continued to intensify throughout the day. A Christmas tree inside Festival Walk shopping mall was set on fire by protesters while others were seen smashing a glass railing with hammers.
Train stations were closed across the city.
Eight universities have announced they will suspend classes on Wednesday.
Monday's protests saw 260 people arrested bringing the number to more than 3,000 since the protests began in June.
**Grace Tsoi, BBC World Service, at the Chinese University of Hong Kong**
The ground was strewn with bricks. The air was filled with the smell of tear gas. Fire was raging on campus. Hundreds of protesters, most of them clad in black, formed human chains to pass bricks and supplies to the front line.
Protesters set up makeshift stations to make petrol bombs using motor oil, flour and detergent non-stop.
One of the best universities in Hong Kong has turned into a battlefield after another day of intense clashes between students, who have been at the forefront of anti-government protests, and police.
The Chinese University students have been putting up resistance since the morning. On Monday, police seemed to change strategy by deploying forces to campuses. Students told me they should not be allowed there.
The university's management has tried to deescalate the situation. Vice-chancellor Rocky Tuan was also tear gassed as he was negotiating with police.
Dozens of students have been injured, including at least one hit in the eye by a projectile. The night is young and students swear they will not surrender.
Hong Kong is part of China but as a former British colony it has some autonomy and people have more rights.
The protests started in June against plans to allow extradition to the mainland - which many feared would undermine the city's freedoms.
The bill was withdrawn in September but demonstrations continued and now call for full democracy and an inquiry into police behaviour.
Clashes between police and activists have become increasingly violent and in October the city banned all face masks."
"**Tourists are staying away and retailers are reeling after nearly five months of protests that have dealt a ""devastating"" blow to businesses in Hong Kong, and pushed the economy to the brink.**
Growth figures issued on Thursday showed Hong Kong has entered a technical recession, defined as two consecutive quarters of negative growth.
In the third quarter, Hong Kong's GDP shrank 3.2% from the previous quarter, which had seen a drop of 0.4%.
Ahead of the numbers, the city's leader Carrie Lam warned of a looming recession. She expects the economy to record negative growth for the year.
DBS economist Samuel Tse agrees the upcoming figures will show Hong Kong has sunk into recession - and expects more pain to come.
""We don't think it will rebound that fast,"" Mr Tse says.
The protests - which began over a proposed extradition bill between the territory and mainland China - have piled pressure on existing economic strains.
Hong Kong has been grappling with the US-China trade war, while a weaker yuan has hit spending from mainland visitors and bruised consumer sentiment.
The controversial extradition bill has been withdrawn, but demonstrations continued and evolved into demands for greater freedoms, and an independent inquiry into alleged police brutality.
Clashes between police and activists have become increasingly violent, with police firing live bullets and protesters attacking officers and throwing petrol bombs.
Those dramatic scenes have kept tourists away.
In August, arrivals to the city - a popular travel destination and transit hub - hit their worst level since the SARS crisis of 2003. Visitor numbers are expected to plunge nearly 50% in October compared to the previous year.
Many hotels are struggling to fill their rooms and Mr Tse says the vacancy rate is sitting around 60%.
Some hotels have slashed prices in the hopes of winning back tourists, while reports suggest many have forced staff to cut work hours or take leave to cope with the slowdown.
Among those to have taken a hit is Ovolo Group. The firm, which operates four hotels in Hong Kong, has seen occupancy rates fall by up to 30% over the past three months.
""It's devastating to see the effect that the recent situation in our city has had on local businesses, particularly those of us in the hospitality industry,"" Ovolo Group's chief executive Girish Jhunjhnuwala says.
Mr Jhunjhnuwala says business is holding up better on weekdays as most guests choose to leave before the weekend, when protests typically kick off. The firm has introduced flexible cancellation policies to help offset uncertainty for guests.
With fewer tourists flying in, airlines have also been knocked. Days of protests at Hong Kong's airport in August, one of the world's busiest transit hubs, led to widespread flight cancelations.
Hong Kong's flagship carrier Cathay Pacific has seen a sharp drop in passenger numbers to the territory in the past two months, while Qantas said the protests would hit first-half earnings by A$25m ($17m; Â£13m).
Lighter tourist flows have weighed on retailers in the city, many already battling with softening consumer sentiment from local shoppers.
Some shops have been forced to shorten trading hours while workers report fears over their safety as protests have turned violent.
Certain businesses have faced direct attacks.
Vandals have targeted big mainland firms like Bank of China and tech company Xiaomi. Stations along Hong Kong's MTR metro system have also repeatedly been attacked, vandalised or even set on fire.
The chaos has led to a sharp fall in retail sales, down 23% in August, the biggest drop on record. The decline in September is expected to be even worse.
Additionally, the long-running unrest has shaken business confidence and frustrated investment. That could have a more lasting impact on the economy, Mr Tse says, as questions and uncertainty remain over Hong Kong's future as a financial hub.
The city has so far injected more than HK$20bn to combat the slowdown including help for the transport, tourism and retail sectors. More relief measures are expected.
But the government argues there's only so much it can do to stem the economic slide.
""To truly cure the problem, we must always work together to stop the violence, stop the destruction of traffic infrastructure and specific target shops, banks and institutionsâ¦ and let the society recover as soon as possible,"" Hong Kong's Financial Secretary Paul Chan said in a blog post.
""Our society and the economy need to take a breather and need to get back on the road."""

"WASHINGTON  —   With Twitter posts, leaks and executive orders, President Trump is moving quickly to show he will make good on some of his key campaign pledges. Within a   period this week, he ordered or signaled significant new policies on border security, terrorism, crime and voting. But as Mr. Trump’s predecessor learned in 2009 when he ordered the military prison at Guantánamo Bay closed, implementing policy is not as easy as the stroke of a pen. Details to carry out security policies exceed Twitter’s   limit and in some cases the public can only infer Mr. Trump’s plans. Here is what he has promised, and what authority he has to carry it out. No political promise came to symbolize Mr. Trump’s candidacy like his pledge to build a wall between the United States and Mexico. The costs and logistical headaches of such a project  —   which would cut through private property  —   have always been daunting, but Mr. Trump’s supporters were unfazed: “Build the wall!” they chanted. On Wednesday, Mr. Trump signed an order to build it and announced that work would begin immediately on a project that is estimated to cost more than $20 billion. He offered few details, including any that would address the fact that Congress, not the White House, writes the checks. The Antideficiency Act prohibits the government from spending money for any reason that Congress has not appropriated. The president can announce whatever plans he wants. But whether the plan is “build a wall” or “close Guantánamo,” if Congress does not go along, it can amount to wishful thinking. As one Republican lawmaker said of Mr. Obama’s 2009 order on Guantánamo, “This is an executive order that places hope ahead of reality. ” Mr. Trump, a real estate developer by trade, seemed undeterred. “We do not need new laws,” he said Wednesday. “We will work within the existing system and framework. ” While that appeared to mean that he intended to shift some already appropriated money to the wall’s construction, it was unclear where the funds would come from. He cannot easily cannibalize one program to pay for the wall. “It doesn’t work out like that,” said William C. Banks, a Syracuse University law professor. So is Mr. Trump’s executive order meaningless? Not entirely. The Department of Homeland Security can start planning and discussing the project now and ask for the bulk of the money later. And if Mr. Trump really wants to break ground immediately and avoid Congress, there is  —   as always in Washington  —   a workaround that would let him do so at least in theory. Two laws, the Economy Act of 1932 and the Feed and Forage Act, give the president some spending wiggle room. The Economy Act allows presidents to move money between departments in some circumstances. The Feed and Forage Act, first enacted in 1799, was intended to allow military leaders in the field to spend money on essential clothing and medical supplies. But presidents have used that power broadly. Former President George H. W. Bush started the first gulf war under that authority, Mr. Banks said. In theory, Mr. Trump could order the military to spend extra money to protect national security, then move around the funding within the bureaucracy to pay for a wall built by the Department of Homeland Security, Mr. Banks said. But such an accounting trick has never been used to go around Congress on such a large scale, Mr. Banks said. Lawsuits would be inevitable. It would be much easier to simply ask Congress for the money. But for now, Mr. Trump gets to say he is making good on a political promise. And if Congress scuttles the plan later or lawsuits hold it up? “He can say he did his part,” Mr. Banks said. He compared the move to the playbook of former President Barack Obama: “It is very Obama. ” Mr. Trump is preparing an executive order that would clear the way for the Central Intelligence Agency to reopen overseas “black site” prisons. According to a draft of the order, Mr. Trump also intends to review the agency’s   interrogation program, in which interrogators tortured some suspected terrorists through waterboarding and extensive sleep deprivation. Other suspects were shackled in painful positions, doused with water and menaced with dogs. Mr. Trump can revoke the current ban on C. I. A. prisons, but it would take much more than his signature to restore the interrogation program. Federal law now restricts interrogation techniques to those authorized by the Army Field Manual. And unlike when the tactics were first authorized  —   when government lawyers said no   harm would come from the tactics  —   it is now clear that many prisoners suffered persistent psychological damage. That would make the program even more difficult to justify under   laws. Mr. Trump could try to ignore all this, saying he has the authority to do so as commander in chief. But his cabinet nominees seemed to reject that theory in their confirmation testimony. As a practical matter, reopening the secret prisons would require finding countries willing to host them. Those who did so for former President George W. Bush have faced a decade of investigations, lawsuits and recriminations. Mr. Trump threatened federal intervention in Chicago if the city does not address violent crime. Chicago saw at least 762 homicides in 2016, the highest figure in two decades  —   more than Los Angeles and New York combined. It was not clear what Mr. Trump meant by “feds. ” But Mr. Trump has wide latitude in this area. The Justice Department could dispatch more agents from the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Drug Enforcement Administration to Chicago. In more extreme situations, presidents and governors have activated the National Guard, but usually to keep the peace during riots and unrest. In a series of Twitter posts, Mr. Trump reiterated his false assertion that Hillary Clinton won the popular vote by 2. 8 million ballots only because undocumented immigrants and others voted illegally. There is no evidence of such widespread fraud (as Mr. Trump’s campaign lawyers have acknowledged) and Mr. Trump offered none. Nor did he say what sort of investigation he had planned. Voter fraud is a crime, so Mr. Trump may have been referring to an F. B. I. investigation. But the president does not have the authority to direct F. B. I. criminal investigations. Those require a criminal predicate, or reasonable suspicion. Generally, though, Mr. Trump has the authority to order a   investigation  —   call it a commission, task force or working group. That would allow the White House to make its findings public."

You Ought to Have a Look _is a feature from the Center for the Study of Science posted by Patrick J. Michaels and Paul C. (“Chip”) Knappenberger. While this section will feature all of the areas of interest that we are emphasizing, the prominence of the climate issue is driving a tremendous amount of web traffic. Here we post a few of the best in recent days, along with our color commentary._   
  
_\---_   
  
We’ll jump right into this week by highlighting an appearance by Manhattan Institute senior fellow Mark Mills on The Federalist’s _Radio Hour_. During his time on the show, Mills explains how the foreseeable future is going to play out when it comes to global energy production and why he says that even if you were concerned about climate change, “there really isn’t anything you can do about it.”   
  
Mills is one of the leading thinkers and analysts on energy systems, energy markets, and energy policy, bringing often overlooked and deeply-buried information to the forefront.   
  
During his nearly hour-long radio segment, Mills discusses topics ranging from climate change, the world’s future energy mix, the role of technological advances, and energy policy as well as giving his opinions on both Bills Gates’ and Pope Francis’ take on all of the above. It is an entertaining and informative interview.   
  
As a taste, here’s a transcript of a small segment:   




In the life we live, and the world we live in, we have to do two things, one is deal with reality [current understanding of physics] and the moral consequences of that, and we can have aspirations. If the aspiration, which Bill Gates’ is, is to use fewer hydrocarbons, we need to support basic research.   
  
We don’t subsidize stuff. The reason we don't subsidize stuff and make energy more expensive, is because, for me, it is morally bankrupt to increase the cost of energy for most people in most of the world. _Energy should be cheaper, not more expensive_. We use energy to make our lives better. We use energy to make our lives safer. We use energy to make our lives more enjoyable. Everything that we care about in the world, safety, convenience, freedom, costs energy. [emphasis added]



Mark Mills’ sentiment closely matches that which Alex Epstein explained to Congress a few weeks back and that we highlighted in our last edition.   
  
If you can find any time to listen to a little or a lot of Mills’ full interview, you’ll probably find that what he says to make a lot of sense. Funny, though, how much of it seems to have escaped some folks.   
  
Next up is an article in the current issue of _First Things_ authored by Walter Wilson titled “Scientific Regress.” If you think the title is provocative, you ought to have a look at the rest of the piece beginning with the first line “The problem with ­science is that so much of it simply isn’t.” Instead, it reflects the results of a gamed system driven by pre-conceived ideas often emanating from the science/political establishment.



In describing the current sad state of science, Wilson reflects our concerns here at the Center for the Study of Science, that external factors (e.g., influence, power, money) act to negatively shape the course of science—a negative influence that is hard to shake.   
  
Wilson writes:   




[O]nce an entire field has been created—with careers, funding, appointments, and prestige all premised upon an experimental result which was utterly false due either to fraud or to plain bad luck—pointing this fact out is not likely to be very popular. Peer review switches from merely useless to actively harmful. It may be ineffective at keeping papers with analytic or methodological flaws from being published, but it can be deadly effective at suppressing criticism of a dominant research paradigm. Even if a critic is able to get his work published, pointing out that the house you’ve built together is situated over a chasm will not endear him to his colleagues or, more importantly, to his mentors and patrons.



Hear! Hear!   
  
Wilson leaves us with this warming:   




At its best, science is a human enterprise with a superhuman aim: the discovery of regularities in the order of nature, and the discerning of the consequences of those regularities. We’ve seen example after example of how the human element of this enterprise harms and damages its progress, through incompetence, fraud, selfishness, prejudice, or the simple combination of an honest oversight or slip with plain bad luck. These failings need not hobble the scientific enterprise broadly conceived, but only if scientists are hyper-aware of and endlessly vigilant about the errors of their colleagues…and of themselves. When cultural trends attempt to render science a sort of religion-less clericalism, scientists are apt to forget that they are made of the same crooked timber as the rest of humanity and will necessarily imperil the work that they do. The greatest friends of the Cult of Science are the worst enemies of science’s actual practice.



The whole piece, including the examples included therein, is an eye-opener. You ought to have a look!   
  
And finally, we’ll leave you with a Friday Funny coming from Cartoons by Josh (a frequent commenter on the often ridiculous goings-on surrounding global warming). In this strip, Josh neatly sums up the reaction when climate gloomsayers are confronted with good news—in this case, new results showing that carbon dioxide emissions from human activities, such as the burning of fossil fuels to produce energy, are leading to a greener, more productive earth (a story that we covered in our piece “A Greening (in a Good Way) Earth”):

"Addressing the climate crisis should matter to all organisations – but universities have a bigger role to play than most, according to Fiona Goodwin, a director at the Environmental Association for Universities and Colleges. “Universities are key in equipping the next generation to have the knowledge, skills, attitudes and values needed to address the climate crisis,” she says. “They cover large expanses of land geographically, and the changes they make on their campuses to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions have an impact on their local vicinity, their country and globally.”  She adds that universities wield considerable power financially, which they can use to support sustainability projects. “Last, but by no means least, they have access to a power bank of academics and research capabilities.” For these reasons, UK universities have found themselves under increasing pressure to improve their own environmental track record. And much of this pressure comes from their own students. In January, half of UK universities agreed to divest from fossil fuels following student campaigns. Thanks to this student pressure, universities are increasingly looking at themselves and their operations, says Richard Jackson, head of environmental sustainability at UCL. When UCL developed its new 2019 strategy on sustainability, the support was astounding, he says. e“The drive, or the need for change came from across the whole university. In the nine years I’ve been in this sector there’s been a growing recognition that sustainability is not just an issue of buildings. It has to be woven right through what we do as an institution, whether that’s the courses we teach, the co-curricular activities we put on, or the innovation and enterprise work we support our students in developing.” There are great examples of universities launching bold sustainability initiatives. The Big Impact programme at Manchester Metropolitan University offers carbon literacy training and paid opportunities for students to become sustainability ambassadors. At the University of Nottingham, student switch-offs encourage halls of residence to save energy. And at the University of Gloucestershire its student-led Live Smart project creates content on how to reduce environmental impact and work with the local community on activities around sustainability. But organisations such as Students Organising for Sustainability UK (SOS-UK), set up by the National Union of Students (NUS) in 2019, still think universities can go a lot further. Take carbon as an example. “Although some universities have progressive carbon reduction targets, most are still aligned to the old sector target of an 80% reduction of 1990 levels by 2050,” points out Zamzam Ibrahim, president of the NUS and SOS-UK. “We need all universities to be committing to net-zero by 2030 right now. Sadly, many vice-chancellors still see sustainability as a nice-to-have, not core business,” she adds."

"From the Amazon to the Australian outback, the world’s forests are on fire. But just as all these trees disappear, politicians are sprouting promises to plant more of them like the dawning of a global spring.  In the run-up to the UK election on December 12, Labour says it will plant two billion new trees on British soil by 2040 – that’s 100m a year. The Conservatives are pledged to 30m a year, while the Liberal Democrats say 60m.  Perhaps the strangest efflorescence is Nigel Farage’s promise to persuade Donald Trump to lead a global afforestation campaign.  These tree-planting pledges are certainly a step in the right direction, but there’s a problem. Everything being said is big on rhetoric but light on practicalities. As I know from many years of being involved with mangrove afforestation in the tropics, it’s a lot easier to plant seeds than it is to grow trees. So what lessons does the UK’s next government need to learn before it sends planters all over the countryside? First, some context. This clamour to plant more trees can be traced back to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC)‘s influential – and quietly terrifying – Special Report on Global Warming of 1.5°C of 2018. The report envisages four scenarios to take us to the degraded, unstable, but perhaps not catastrophic, promised land of only 1.5°C warming.  Along with very steep cuts in emissions, all four scenarios require us to remove much more carbon dioxide from the atmosphere than at present. The more that we can do this by protecting and expanding natural carbon sinks, including forests, mangroves, seagrass meadows and peatlands, the less we’ll need to rely on difficult technologies such as carbon capture and storage. This will also make it easier to handle the additional burdens after 2050, by when the report stresses we’ll not only have to be reducing net emissions but overall greenhouse gas concentrations as well.   So the political parties are certainly right to emphasise trees – and there’s a big prize in our midst. Recent research estimated a spectacular 5 million km² of land that could be afforested, with the potential to increase global forest cover by about 25% to some 50 million km². This would potentially sequester more than 200 billion more tonnes of carbon in the process. Another team of academics has since countered that the 9 million km² estimate may be up to five times too large for various reasons, but everyone at least agrees there’s plenty space for more trees.  Having said that, a lot can go wrong with planting. Take mangrove forests. More than 45% of them have been cleared around the world in recent decades for everything from agriculture to fish farming to tourism to charcoal production. This is an ecological disaster because they are truly extraordinary carbon sinks. At the field site where I have been stationed in Kenya, their waterlogged soils hold more than 1,500 tonnes of carbon per hectare, most of which is vulnerable to oxidation and release if the forests are removed.  For these reasons, there have been numerous large-scale efforts in different countries to restore these trees, but they have often failed. In Sri Lanka, for example, a survey of 23 sites where planting had been attempted showed that in more than half, none of the mangroves survived – and over 50% of seedlings survived in only three sites. In another survey of mangrove replanting across 74 sites in Thailand and the Philippines, only 20% survived.   Such planting projects are often victim to inappropriate targets in which planters are incentivised by numbers of trees or the total area planted, rather than, say, survival rates after one year. Perhaps unsurprisingly, this has led to mass plantings in unsuitable places with no follow-up care.  Yet even before you talk about incentivising planters, you need to address the reasons why trees are not already growing in an area. Assuming the site is ecologically appropriate for the trees in the first place, you need to ensure you have the right social and economic context for them to survive.  To understand what I mean here, Kenya is a good example. This country has a long-term problem with people removing and damaging mangroves, for instance to provide building poles and firewood. People are poor and have few economic alternatives, while the laws protecting the mangroves are not properly enforced by the authorities. This means that if you plant more trees, they’ll just get cut down.  To turn this situation around, international charities and scientists, including me, have been working on a project with local people in the south of the country. It allows donors from around the world to pay locals to maintain and reforest the area as a means of carbon offsetting while helping them develop other income streams that rely on the forest such as beekeeping and ecotourism.  This has helped several villages to flourish, among other things by providing more money for education, clean water and healthcare. Since 2014, the project has seen 10ha of mangroves planted and another 117ha restored and conserved, while paying more than US$60,000 (£45,800) to the community.  This is a small illustration of how reforestation and forest conservation can be effective in sequestering carbon if it has grassroots support. While Kenya might seem a long way from the UK, the same principles apply in both countries. Only 13% of UK land is forest, much lower than many European nations, and a range of land-owning, industrial and agricultural interests work to keep it that way.  Successful afforestation will require negotiating with and sometimes confronting these interests – and we must not permit naïve or cynical proposals to undermine public understanding and trust.  So while we should welcome the UK political parties’ tree-planting commitments, they are only credible if they also address the long-term causes of forest loss as well as setting targets that ensure that planted seedlings actually grow into trees.  We have heard a lot about the magic money tree in recent years, but now there is a danger that the political parties convince themselves of a magic carbon tree. Big eye-catching targets are one thing, but there needs to be a serious discussion about how they will be delivered. Otherwise, this risks being a dangerous waste of time.

"In the quest to cut carbon out of civilisation, the future of transport is key. Emissions from the sector have doubled in the past 40 years and continue to rise. Our travel habits are now responsible for one in four of the planet-warming molecules of carbon dioxide in our atmosphere. While the transition to electric vehicles will kickstart progress, even a rapid shift will not on its own bring the sector close enough to carbon neutrality to limit warming below dangerous levels. We’ll also need radical and rapid reductions in road traffic – facilitated by a shift to walking, cycling and public transport. After decades of stalled progress, researchers and policymakers are grappling with how to make that happen – and railways could be an important part of the answer. They are highly efficient users of both land and energy – a train can carry several hundred people without having to lift a heavy machine into the air, and moves with much less friction than faced by tyres on roads. Electric trains are particularly energy efficient, as they don’t have to carry diesel fuel or diesel engines, so are lighter and require less maintenance.  Because of this, electrified rail travel uses seven times less CO₂ than road travel and 20 times less than air travel. Investment in high-speed rail lines in Europe, for example, has transferred significant traffic from roads and flight paths, resulting in a 60% reduction in carbon emissions on the affected routes. The carbon-saving potential of rail is even greater for freight. Heavy goods vehicles contribute substantially to transport emissions – but because of their weight, battery technology is not yet an option to reduce this burden. Rail freight produces 76% less carbon emissions than an equivalent journey by heavy goods vehicle. And as the electricity grid and train infrastructure transition further to renewable power, carbon savings for both passenger and freight rail services have the potential to get even bigger. Of course, a big switch to rail means a great deal of new and costly infrastructure. Capacity on existing lines would need to be boosted, and new lines, stations, and logistics terminals added. But these efforts don’t have to all be from scratch. Many disused lines could be reopened – there are proposals for 224 line reopenings in the UK alone. Some increases in rail capacity do not require new lines at all, so are less expensive. For example, making trains longer, upgrading signalling, adding passing loops, or upgrading junctions can all boost capacity on existing lines. But even new lines and terminals can be a cost-effective way of reducing carbon emissions, so long as they are planned carefully. For example, emissions savings from the UK’s controversial HS2 project could vary hugely depending on the energy sources used for rail and road, how the capacity released on parallel existing lines is used and, perhaps most importantly, the siting of and development around stations. It’s particularly important to promote housing developments around railway stations that decrease dependence on cars. Railway stations should also have good transport interchanges, with high-quality connecting local public transport services and good cycling and walking routes that enable travellers to get from their starting point or to their destination without having to drive. Integrated timetabling is crucial to make this a success, so that railways are part of seamless door-to-door travel. Properly planned development like this not only reduces emissions, but also limits the conversion of environmentally fragile land to low-density housing development and creates healthier and less isolated communities. Pricing, taxation and subsidy policies also need to support rail growth. There is good evidence that rail freight is more widely used in countries where heavy goods vehicles pay road tolls. Aviation ticket taxes can also drive more people to travel by rail. In contrast, campaigners have argued that the UK governmnent’s freeze on fuel taxation, combined with a policy of increasing rail fares over time by inflation or above, has had the opposite effect, driving increased car use. At a more local level, the availability and cost of car parking also influences demand for car travel over rail travel. For example, reduced car parking and increased charges in the city centre of Birmingham, England, coupled with improved rail services, have helped rail overtake car as the preferred way to commute into the city. The city is now considering following nearby Nottingham’s introduction of a levy on private non-residential parking spaces at workplaces. In Nottingham this levy contributed to the cost of two new light rail lines and new bus services and as a result the city has the highest public transport mode share in the UK outside of London. Of course, above all, governments need to put their money where their mouth is for rail use to grow. Some countries already are – the German transport minister recently announced a US$86 billion investment in its rail network to double the number of passengers by 2030, while Ireland has increased rail investment by 40%. If other countries follow suit, the coming decades could finally put the trajectory of the transport sector back on track. Click here to subscribe to our climate action newsletter.

Let’s get this out of the way right at the start: There is no excuse — no acceptable reason — for the rioting in Baltimore this week. But, that said, there are lessons to be learned about the failures of government and how those failures can create a climate of anger and frustration that just awaits a spark to ignite the flames of violence and destruction.



That spark in this case was the still‐​unexplained death of Freddie Gray in police custody, but the powder keg was put in place by decades of big‐​government liberalism, both in the city of Baltimore and in the state of Maryland.



For example, Maryland has one of the most generous welfare systems in the nation. A mother with two children participating in seven common welfare programs — Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF), food stamps (SNAP), Medicaid, housing assistance, Supplemental Nutrition for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC), energy assistance (LIHEAP), and free commodities — could receive benefits worth more than $35,000. Yet, nearly a quarter of the people in Baltimore still live in poverty. In 1960, Baltimore’s poverty rate was just 10 percent. While some of the increase since then is a result of demographic and other structural changes, we’ve clearly been throwing a lot of money at poverty in the city without much result.





Freddie Gray’s death was the spark, but Baltimore’s governance was the powder keg.



And while Baltimore’s high welfare benefits haven’t reduced poverty, they may well have exacerbated other social problems. For example, some studies have long shown that high welfare benefits correlate with high out‐​of‐​wedlock birth rates. It should not come as a surprise, then, that two‐​thirds of births in the city are to unmarried mothers, and almost 60 percent of Baltimore households are headed by single parents.



The unemployment rate in Baltimore in February was 8.4 percent, compared with just 5.5 percent nationally. In the Sandtown–Winchester/Harlem Park area, which is near the center of the unrest, more than half of the people did not have jobs, according to a February 2015 report from the Justice Policy Institute and the Prison Policy Initiative.



One reason for this is the city’s — and the state’s — unremitting hostility to business. The U.S. Chamber of Commerce reports that only seven states and the District of Columbia have a worse business climate than Maryland. The state’s tax burden is huge and growing. According to the Tax Foundation’s State Business Tax Climate Index, Maryland ranks a dismal 40th in terms of business taxes, and an even worse 45th in terms of personal‐​income taxes. According to this report, Maryland is one of just a few states where the personal‐​income tax creates “an unnecessary drag on economic activity.” The state’s small businesses face the nation’s seventh‐​highest marginal tax rates.



As if that were not bad enough, the city of Baltimore adds one of the highest property taxes among comparable cities. Despite a recent modest reduction in property‐​tax rates, Baltimore still has a tax rate more than twice the rate of most of the rest of the state. A recent study by the Minnesota Center for Fiscal Excellence and the Lincoln Institute of Land Policy ranked Baltimore twelfth out of 53 major cities in terms of high property taxes. When the city taxes are combined with state taxes, Baltimore ends up with the ninth worst tax burden out of 50 major American cities.



The city’s economic stagnation has driven out much of the middle class, black as well as white. The result is tiny pockets of affluence surrounded by large concentrations of poverty.



The city’s schools represent another failure of government. Teachers’ unions are among the most powerful special interests in Maryland. To cite just one example, even as other states were enacting right‐​to‐​work laws for public employees, Maryland passed a law mandating that all teachers pay fees to the Maryland State Education Association.



Although Baltimore ranks fourth among major cities in per‐​pupil expenditures for districts with more than 40,000 students and spends $16,578 a year per pupil — roughly 52 percent above the national average — more than a quarter of Baltimore students fail to graduate from high school. Fewer than half of Baltimore high‐​school students passed the last Maryland High School Assessment test. SAT scores for Baltimore students are more than 100 points below the national average.



Yet Maryland has one of the nation’s most restrictive charter‐​school laws. There are just 52 charter schools statewide. In neighboring Washington, D.C., 44 percent of the city’s public‐​school students are educated in the District’s 112 charter schools, according to the National Alliance for Public Charter Schools. Even within the public schools, choice is extremely limited in Maryland; parents are not generally allowed to send their children to schools outside their assigned district. Needless to say, any larger efforts to give parents more control over their children’s schooling — such as vouchers or tax credits — have gone nowhere.



Crime remains a major problem in Baltimore. Despite some of the nation’s toughest gun laws, there were 99 murders in Baltimore in the first six months of 2014 (the most recent FBI data available), making the city the fifth‐​most‐​deadly in America. But, while the city remained violent and crime‐​ridden, the police have pursued a policy of random stops and arrests for minor offenses that has alienated residents.



If you are looking for an example of the failure of the War on Drugs, Baltimore would be a showcase. Martin O’Malley, in particular, both as mayor of Baltimore and as governor of Maryland (he is now a Democratic presidential candidate), pushed a “zero tolerance” policy that resulted in the arrest of thousands of young black men for minor drug offenses.



This approach to policing has inevitably led to widespread abuses. Baltimore paid out more than $5.7 million in settlements for police‐​brutality complaints from 2011 to 2014, and spent another $5.8 million on legal fees defending police. While we shouldn’t leap to conclusions until the investigation is complete, it is very easy to see Freddie Gray’s death fitting into this context.



Again, none of this is an excuse for violence or the destruction of property. Moreover, the riots are counterproductive, destroying the very businesses and other resources needed to rebuild troubled communities. Businesses are not going to flock to inner‐​city Baltimore after this week’s mayhem. Taxes are not going to go down. Yet, it is hard to look at the results of decades of big‐​government failure and not understand the frustration and hopelessness of those victimized by such policies.



Once order is restored in Baltimore, there will be time to take stock. We can expect to hear the usual chorus about neglected neighborhoods and the need for government jobs programs or additional social spending. Instead, we should take to heart President Obama’s admonition that “When what you’re doing doesn’t work for 50 years, it’s time to try something new.”



Big government has failed Baltimore. If we learn nothing from what just happened — if we simply go back to throwing money at the same tired old programs — it will be just a matter of time until this happens all over again.

"**Thousands of Eritrean refugees in Ethiopia's conflict-hit northern region of Tigray have run out of food, the UN's refugee agency, UNHCR, has said.**
It appealed for urgent access to the region to provide emergency assistance.
Communications and aid access have been blocked since the conflict between the federal army and fighters loyal to Tigray leadership began a month ago.
Nearly 100,000 Eritrean refugees are in Tigray. They fled political persecution and compulsory military service.
A lot of focus has been on the tens of thousands who have fled to Sudan from Tigray during the fighting, but there is also concern about these Eritreans.
The UNHCR also said it was ""alarmed"" at unconfirmed reports of attacks and abductions and at the refugee camps.
Ethiopia's Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed announced on Sunday that the military offensive in Tigray had ended after federal forces took control of Tigray's capital, Mekelle.
But Debretsion Gebremichael, who leads the Tigray People's Liberation Front (TPLF), said fighting still continues and his forces have made some gains.
Concerns about the state of the Eritrean refugees are growing by the hour, the UNHCR said in a briefing in Geneva.
""The camps will have now run out of food supplies - making hunger and malnutrition a real danger, a warning we have been issuing since the conflict began nearly a month ago.
""Our extreme worry is that we hear about attacks, the fighting near the camps, we hear about abductions and forced removals, so this is very important for us to have that access to go and see what has happened over there,"" its spokesman Babar Baloch told journalists.
The UNHCR also called for the protection of all civilians.
Mr Abiy told parliament on Monday that not a single civilian had been killed since the government launched its offensive in early November.
The government has also said it would open up a humanitarian corridor."
"PHILADELPHIA  —   President Trump’s decision to build a wall along the length of the United States’ southern border with Mexico erupted into a diplomatic standoff on Thursday, leading to the cancellation of a White House visit by Mexico’s president and sharply rising tensions over who would pay for the wall. With the conflict escalating, Mr. Trump appeared to embrace a proposal by House Republicans that would impose a 20 percent tax on all imported goods. The White House press secretary, Sean Spicer, told reporters that the proceeds would be used to pay for the border wall, estimated to cost as much as $20 billion. But a furious uproar prompted Mr. Spicer to temper his earlier remarks, saying the plan was simply “one idea” that might work to finance the wall. Mr. Spicer said it was not the job of the White House to “roll something out” on tax policy, while Mr. Trump’s chief of staff, Reince Priebus, said the administration was considering “a buffet of options. ” If Mr. Trump does eventually announce his support for the tax plan, it could have a broad impact on the American economy, and its consumers and workers, by sharply increasing the prices of imported goods or reducing profits for the companies that produce them. Other nations could retaliate, prompting a trade war that could hit consumers around the globe. Retail businesses could see their tax bills surge, said David French of the National Retail Federation, who predicted that those costs would be passed on to consumers. He called the idea “very counter to the way consumers are feeling at the moment. ” If nothing else, the   developments showed Mr. Trump that international diplomacy and a    overhaul of the tax code would not be as easy as an announcement before a campaign microphone. The events unfolded after Mr. Trump signed an executive order on Wednesday to strengthen the nation’s deportation force and start construction on a new wall along the border. Adding to Mexico’s perception of an insult was the timing of the order: It came on the first day of talks between top Mexican officials and their counterparts in Washington, and just days before a scheduled meeting between Mr. Trump and the Mexican president, Enrique Peña Nieto. The sense of chaos and confusion about the tax issue added to the fallout from Mr. Trump’s conflict with Mr. Peña Nieto, his first direct clash with a world leader since becoming president a week ago. The Mexican peso bounced sharply with each new development. Tensions between the two have been simmering for months, despite comments by both men that they were trying to work together. Mr. Trump’s immigration and   decisions on Wednesday appeared to shatter the remaining good will between them. In a video message delivered on Twitter on Wednesday night, Mr. Peña Nieto reiterated his commitment to protect the interests of Mexico and the Mexican people, and pledged to devote the resources of Mexico’s consulates in the United States to protecting its citizens. “I regret and condemn the United States’ decision to continue with the construction of a wall that, for years now, far from uniting us, divides us,” Mr. Peña Nieto said. Mr. Trump responded on Twitter, “If Mexico is unwilling to pay for the badly needed wall, then it would be better to cancel the upcoming meeting. ” Within hours, that is just what happened. Blasting Mr. Trump for sowing division between the countries, Mr. Peña Nieto angrily backed out of the White House meeting, which had been scheduled for next week. In remarks at congressional Republicans’ retreat in Philadelphia, Mr. Trump portrayed the decision to cancel the meeting as his own and issued a stern warning to Mr. Peña Nieto about the consequences of refusing to cooperate with him on financing the wall. “Unless Mexico is going to treat the United States fairly, with respect, such a meeting would be fruitless, and I want to go a different route,” Mr. Trump said. “We have no choice. ” In the same remarks, Mr. Trump alluded to the idea of a border tax, saying, “We’re working on a tax reform bill that will reduce our trade deficits, increase American exports, and will generate revenue from Mexico that will pay for the wall if we decide to go that route. ” After the speech, in a brief, impromptu news conference as Mr. Trump flew back to Washington, Mr. Spicer told reporters that the president now favored the plan to impose a 20 percent border tax as part of a sweeping overhaul of corporate taxation. Only last week, Mr. Trump had dismissed the tax as too complicated, favoring his own plan to impose a 35 percent tariff on manufactured goods made by American corporations in overseas factories. Mr. Spicer said that the plan for the tax was “taking shape” and that it was “really going to provide the funding” for the wall. Mr. Spicer said that was a direct reference to the centerpiece of House Republicans’ proposal to overhaul the tax code. They have been pushing the idea for months, but with little evidence, until Thursday, that Mr. Trump was interested in it. But by the time Mr. Spicer returned to the White House two hours later, he had already recanted. In another hastily arranged conversation with reporters, he called the proposal “one idea” that might work and said it was not the job of the White House to “roll something out” on tax policy. “We’ve been asked over and over again: ‘How could you possibly do this? There’s no way that Mexico will pay for it,’ ” Mr. Spicer said. “Here’s one way. Boom. Done. We could go in another direction. We could talk about tariffs. We could talk about other custom user fees. There are a hundred other things. ” The White House and House Republicans have been hashing out their respective tax proposals as they press forward with Mr. Trump’s agenda to revive American manufacturing and increase exports. The House proposal would replace the current system of corporate taxation with one that more closely resembles the approach taken by many other developed nations. The government would impose a 20 percent tax on corporate income earned in the United States, which would have the effect of taxing imports while exempting exports. The approach, known as border adjustment, creates the appearance of taxing trade deficits. The goods that the United States imported from Mexico in 2015 were worth about $60 billion more than the goods it exported to Mexico, so federal revenue in the short term would increase by roughly $12 billion. But the House plan would offset that revenue by reducing the 35 percent corporate income tax rate, and would thus generate no new federal revenue over all. It was unclear how that fit with Mr. Spicer’s repeated contention Thursday afternoon that revenue from the tax adjustment would help finance construction of the border wall. By siphoning off that revenue, Mr. Trump would make it impossible to reduce the tax rate as far as Republicans wish. He is pressing for a 15 percent corporate tax rate. Moreover, the tax would not be paid by Mexico. It would be paid by companies selling Mexican goods in the United States. Some might raise prices, imposing the cost on consumers, while others might be forced by competitive pressures to absorb the tax, reducing their profits. Many economists also doubt that the change would end up penalizing imports or encouraging exports. They predict that the value of the dollar would rise, offsetting those effects. Nonetheless, many businesses in industries such as retail and energy, which rely heavily on imports, were in a panic. Representative Kevin Brady, the Texas Republican who wrote the plan, told Fox News on Thursday afternoon that he was pleased that Mr. Trump appeared to be on board with it after his appearance in Philadelphia. “What I heard today from this president was that in tax reform, that they would level the playing field for imports around the world and level it with the U. S. products here in America at the exact same rate,” Mr. Brady said."

Share this...FacebookTwitterFor going on 3 decades now, Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) reports have estimated that the climate’s sensitivity to the doubling of preindustrial levels of CO2 (from 280 ppm to 560 ppm) may range between 1.5°C to 4.5°C due significantly to the assumed “dangerous” warming amplification from positive water vapor feedback.  Despite years of analysis, the factor-of-three difference between the lower and higher surface temperature range thresholds has changed little.  There apparently have been no breakthroughs in understanding the “basic physics” of water vapor amplification to narrow this range further.
The theoretical conceptualization for the surface temperature change resulting from CO2 doubling alone — without the “dangerous” amplification from  water vapor feedback — has also been in use, and unchanged, for decades.  Since the 1960s it has been hypothesized that if preindustrial CO2 levels were to be doubled to 560 ppm, the surface temperature change would amount to a warming of a non-alarming 1.2°C in the absence of other feedbacks.
Below are brief summaries from scientific papers (and the Skeptical Science blog) confirming that the IPCC and models claim doubling CO2 only results in 1.2°C of warming.
IPCC (2001) :
“[T]he radiative forcing corresponding to a doubling of the CO2 concentration would be 4 Wm-2. To counteract this imbalance, the temperature of the surface-troposphere system would have to increase by 1.2°C (with an accuracy of ±10%), in the absence of other changes”
Skeptical Science :
“We know that if the amount of carbon dioxide (CO2) in the Earth’s atmosphere doubles from the pre-industrial level of 280 parts per million  by volume (ppmv) to 560 ppmv, this will cause an energy imbalance by trapping more outgoing thermal radiation in the atmosphere, enough to directly warm the surface approximately 1.2°C.”
Gebhart, 1967 :
“The temperature change at the earth’s surface is ΔT=+1.2°C when the present [CO2] concentration is doubled.”
Hansen et al., 1981 :
“The increase of equilibrium surface temperature for doubled atmospheric CO2 is ∼1.2°C.  This case is of special interest because it is the purely radiative-convective result, with no feedback effects.”
Lorius et al., 1990 :
“The radiative forcing resulting from doubled atmospheric CO2 would increase the surface and tropospheric temperature by  1.2°C if there were no feedbacks in the climate system.”
Torn and Harte, 2006 :
“An increase in atmospheric CO2 concentration from 275 to 550 ppm is expected to increase radiative forcing by about 4 W m2, which would lead to a direct warming of 1.2°C in the absence of feedbacks or other responses of the climate system”
 
IPCC: Dangerous future warming levels (3°C and up) are caused mostly by water vapor, not CO2
As mentioned, the IPCC authors have claimed that it is primarily due to the conceptualization of positive feedback with water vapor that the surface temperature response is projected  to reach the dangerous warming levels of 3.0°C and up as CO2 doubles to 560 ppm.
IPCC (2001) :
“The so-called water vapour feedback, caused by an increase in atmospheric water vapour due to a temperature increase, is the most important feedback responsible for the amplification of the temperature increase [from CO2 alone].”
In their 4th report, the IPCC acknowledged that humans have little influence in determining water vapor levels:
IPCC (2007) :
“Water vapour is the most abundant and important greenhouse gas in the atmosphere. However, human activities have only a small direct influence on the amount of atmospheric water vapour.”
The main reason why IPCC authors have asserted that water vapor will do most of the “dangerous” projected warming, while CO2 will contribute a much smaller fraction, is apparently because the greenhouse warming effect from water vapor forcing is “two to three times greater” than that of carbon dioxide:
IPCC (2013) :
“Water vapour is the primary greenhouse gas in the Earth’s atmosphere. The contribution of water vapour to the natural greenhouse effect relative to that of carbon dioxide (CO2) depends on the accounting method, but can be considered to be approximately two to three times greater.”

Even NASA agrees that water vapor and clouds together account for 75% of the greenhouse effect, while CO2 only accounts for 20%.
NASA  :
“Carbon dioxide causes about 20 percent of Earth’s greenhouse effect; water vapor accounts for about 50 percent; and clouds account for 25 percent. The rest is caused by small particles (aerosols) and minor greenhouse gases like methane.”
 
IPCC: Positive water vapor feedbacks are believed to cause dangerous warming
It is curious to note that the insufficiently understood positive water vapor feedback conceptualization is rooted in . . . belief.  Literally.   In the third report (TAR), the IPCC authors actually used the word “believed” to denote how they reached the conclusion that 1.2°C will somehow morph into 1.5°C to 4.5°C of warming due to amplification from feedbacks.
IPCC (2001) :
“If the amount of carbon dioxide were doubled instantaneously, with everything else remaining the same, the outgoing infrared radiation would be reduced by about 4 Wm-2. In other words, the radiative forcing corresponding to a doubling of the CO2 concentration would be 4 Wm-2. To counteract this imbalance, the temperature of the surface-troposphere system would have to increase by 1.2°C (with an accuracy of ±10%), in the absence of other changes. In reality, due to feedbacks, the response of the climate system is much more complex. It is believed that the overall effect of the feedbacks amplifies the temperature increase to 1.5 to 4.5°C. A significant part of this uncertainty range arises from our limited knowledge of clouds and their interactions with radiation.”
IPCC climate sensitivity estimates have been based on hypotheticals, or the belief that water vapor positive feedback will cause another 1.8°C to 3.3°C of “extra” or “dangerous” warming (to reach upwards of 3.0°C to 4.5°C).  CO2 alone only causes 1.2°C of warming as it is doubled from 280 ppm to 560 ppm.  Since when are modeled beliefs about what may possibly happen to global temperatures at some point in the next 100 years . . . science?
IPCC: Water vapor increased substantially since 1970 — but didn’t cause warming
If water vapor is the primary determinant of the “extra” and “dangerous” warming we are expected to get along with the modest 1.2°C temperature increase as the CO2 concentration reaches 560 ppm, then it is natural to ask: How much of the warming since 1950 has been caused by the additional CO2, and how much has been caused by the water vapor feedback that is believed to cause the extra, “dangerous” warming?
This last question arises because, according to the IPCC, there has been a substantial increase in the potent water vapor greenhouse gas concentration in the last few decades.  Specifically, in their 4th report, the IPCC authors claim there has been “an overall increase in water vapour of order 5% over the 20th century and about 4% since 1970“(IPCC [2007]).
Considering its abundance in the atmosphere (~40,000 ppm in the tropics), if water vapor increased by 4% since 1970, that means that water vapor concentrations could potentially have increased by more than 1,500 ppm in the last few decades.  The overall magnitude of this water vapor concentration increase is therefore more than 20 times greater than the increase in atmospheric CO2 concentration (~70 ppm) since 1970.
But even though the IPCC claims that (a) water vapor will cause most of the “dangerous” warming in the future, (b) water vapor climate forcing is “two to three” times greater than CO2 forcing within the greenhouse effect, and (c) water vapor concentrations have increased substantially since 1970, the IPCC simultaneously claims that (d) CO2 has caused most — if not all — of the warming since the mid-20th century anyway.   In the 5th report, the IPCC’s “consensus” statement reads like this:
IPCC (2013, 2014) :
“It is extremely likely that more than half of the observed increase in global average surface temperature from 1951 to 2010 was caused by the anthropogenic increase in greenhouse gas concentrations and other anthropogenic forcings together.”
For advocates of dangerous anthropogenic global warming (DAGW) projections, the “more than half” CO2 attribution apparently isn’t quantitatively strong enough.  After all, “more than half” could be interpreted as only slightly more than 50%.   To rectify this, Gavin Schmidt  — a primary overseer of NASA temperature adjustments — has calculated that the anthropogenic impact on climate has not  just been “more than half,” but more than 100%.   In a recent RealClimate blog entry, Schmidt  claims that humans have caused 110% of the global warming since 1950 — and that IPCC analysis (found in Fig. 10.5 in IPCC AR5) also supports an anthropogenic CO2 attribution of  “near 100%”.
Real Climate :
“The best estimate of the warming due to anthropogenic forcings (ANT) is the orange bar [in Fig. 10.5] (noting the 1𝛔 uncertainties). Reading off the graph, it is 0.7±0.2ºC (5-95%) with the observed warming 0.65±0.06 (5-95%). The attribution then follows as having a mean of ~110%, with a 5-95% range of 80–130%. This easily justifies the IPCC claims of having a mean near 100%, and a very low likelihood of the attribution being less than 50% (p < 0.0001!).”
 
Conflicting IPCC climate sensitivity feedback suppositions
The IPCC believes that the climate’s overall surface temperature sensitivity to the doubling of preindustrial CO2 ranges between 1.5°C to 4.5°C, with the projected higher warming levels due primarily to amplifying water vapor feedback.  This conceptualization appears to be in conflict with other IPCC suppositions.
On one hand, the IPCC reports have claimed that (a) water vapor is much more potent than CO2 within the greenhouse effect, that (b) the bulk of the 3.0°C and up “dangerous” warming that is believed to occur in the future will be forced by positive water vapor feedback, and that (c) water vapor  levels have significantly increased in recent decades (by 4% since 1970).
On the other hand, (d) water vapor is claimed to have caused right around 0% of the warming in the last several decades.
Summarily, these conflicting explanations or suppositions about what can happen, what will happen, and what has already happened to the climate due to water vapor feedback beg the questions:
Why hasn’t the “dangerous” water vapor warming found in models “kicked in” during the last several decades, when water vapor levels have increased (according to the IPCC)?  
Since it reportedly hasn’t yet, at what point in the future will the “dangerous” water vapor warming projections found in modeling finally show up in the temperature record?
Considering how fundamental climate sensitivity estimates are to climate science, and ultimately to the direction of political policies and energy production and consumption, these questions deserve to be answered . . . with something more substantive than what the IPCC authors have long believed to be true.

"TIJUANA, Mexico  —   Even before President Trump decided to build the wall, this Mexican border city was already overwhelmed. So many Haitian migrants, traveling across the Americas, began arriving here last year with hopes of crossing into the United States that churches, community halls,   programs, rehabilitation centers and private citizens have opened their doors to house, feed and clothe them. In one shelter, about 250 migrants  —   men, women and children  —   share two toilets and one shower. Four hundred are crammed into a church. A soup kitchen sleeps hundreds in hallways, a pantry and a lot out back. Now, some officials and advocates worry that Mr. Trump’s plan could spur immigration crises in towns and cities all along the border and, indeed, throughout Mexico. The Mexican government, they say, may not be able to handle it. Mr. Trump is seeking to tighten the border, restrict immigration and increase deportations from the United States. In announcing his actions this week, the president said they would “help Mexico by deterring illegal immigration. ” “Going to be very, very good for Mexico,” he declared. Yet some international officials and advocates envision a potential nightmare for the country. A growing number of people have been streaming north from Central America, fleeing violence and poverty in their homelands. Nearly 409, 000 were caught trying to cross the southwestern border of the United States illegally in the 2016 fiscal year, a 23 percent increase over the previous fiscal year, according to American government statistics. And the trend has continued over the past few months. As more migrants are blocked at the American border and more undocumented immigrants are deported from the United States, border communities in Mexico could be overwhelmed, migrant shelters could overflow, the ranks of the unemployed could swell, and Mexico will bear the strain, officials and advocates say. “It’s worrying us,” said Christopher Gascon, chief of the Mexico office for the International Organization for Migration. “How Mexico can handle that is going to be a whole new area of concern. I don’t think the absorptive capacity is there. ” Even before this week, Mexico was facing extraordinary migration pressures. The waves of Central Americans heading north were severely testing Mexico’s border patrol in the south of the country and led to a sharp increase in the number of people applying for asylum in Mexico, with applications more than doubling from 2015 to 2016. Mexican officials were also scrambling to develop a strategy in case Mr. Trump made good on his promises to increase deportations of undocumented immigrants, a population that includes millions of Mexicans. An intergovernmental group began on Monday to study ways to help integrate deportees into Mexican society. Beyond that, recent changes in American policy during the Obama administration had already contributed to the surge in Haitian migrants, as well as to a separate wave of Cuban migrants. Thousands of Cubans found themselves stranded in Mexico and Central America this month after the Obama administration ended a longstanding policy that favored Cubans. Under American pressure, President Enrique Peña Nieto of Mexico had been trying to stanch the flow of migrants heading through his country, starting the Southern Border Program in 2014 in an attempt to control the movement of people and goods crossing the border with Guatemala. The plan contributed to a doubling of deportations between 2013, before it was enacted, and 2016. Nearly all the deportees in recent years have been from Central America. But the country’s borders remain highly porous. The International Organization for Migration estimates that between 400, 000 and 500, 000 undocumented migrants transit through the country every year, about 90 percent of them Central Americans. Here in the state of Baja California, the migrant crisis has highlighted the Mexican government’s limited capacity to deal with the challenges. Haitian migrants, traveling from Brazil, began arriving in this border city last spring. For a while, the Haitians had little trouble crossing into the United States. In recognition of the troubles in Haiti following the 2010 earthquake there, American border officials allowed undocumented Haitians to enter under a humanitarian parole provision, with permission to stay for as long as three years. The migrants filled the handful of longstanding migrant shelters and cheap hotels in Tijuana while they waited, often for weeks, for their appointments with American border officials. Then in late September, the Obama administration suddenly announced that it was fully resuming the deportations of Haitians, hoping the policy change would dissuade more Haitians from migrating. Still, the Haitians kept coming. As the Haitian migrant population has ballooned  —   there are now about 4, 500 Haitians in Tijuana and elsewhere in northern Baja California  —   the Mexican authorities have resisted pleas to open a   emergency shelter. More than 30 shelters are providing for the Haitians, yet none are  . Most of the burden of sheltering, feeding, clothing and caring for the nonstop stream of Haitians has fallen to civil society groups and individuals, who have accused the government of doing too little too late. This month, a coalition of the main shelters in Tijuana and Mexicali sent a letter to Mr. Peña Nieto demanding a more robust federal “intervention” to address the crisis. The shelters have yet to receive a reply, they said. Advocacy and humanitarian groups in Tijuana filed a complaint this week with the National Human Rights Commission alleging that federal officials had violated the migrants’ human rights “in a widespread and repeated manner” by failing to address the crisis. Federal officials have rejected the criticism that they have been neglectful. “Is there room to do more? Yes,” Rodulfo Figueroa Pacheco, chief of the Baja California office of the federal migration agency, said in an interview last week, before the complaint was filed. “It’s been a struggle. ” “But,” he added, “it isn’t true that the governments have been unresponsive. ” The crisis, now in its ninth month, has been a crushing burden on the shelters. The migrant population at one longstanding shelter, Movimiento Juventud 2000, with capacity for about 25 people, soared to about 250, many of them living in donated tents in an adjoining lot that becomes a swale of mud when it rains. Iglesia Cristiana Embajadores de Jesus, a church situated in a denuded ravine on the western edge of Tijuana, was sheltering hundreds of people even though it was not connected to the municipal water supply and had to refill its tanks with a water truck. Administrators at Desayunador Salesiano Padre Chava, which had for years served as a soup kitchen, repurposed nearly the entire building, including corridors and the pantry, into a sprawling dormitory that at one point housed more than 500 people. Claudia Portela, coordinator of Padre Chava, which recently opened a smaller second shelter, estimates that donations have provided for 98 percent of their needs during the crisis. Government officials, while acknowledging that the bulk of the humanitarian assistance has come from civil society, insist that they have provided crucial services but have been sorely limited by budgets that were already under strain amid Mexico’s economic malaise. “Our deployment has been very, very small,” Mr. Figueroa said. “Institutional capacities are not as robust as we’d like. ” But despite the limitations, he said, government agencies had donated more than $280, 000, about 445, 000 meals, thousands of blankets, hundreds of mattresses and many other goods and services since late October. State and federal officials, he said, were still discussing the possibility of opening a shelter, but the proposal raised difficult practical and philosophical questions. “Will we be building something we can’t unbuild?” he said. Ad hoc networks of humanitarian groups have scrambled to help. “For me, the worst part is the omission of the federal government,” said Soraya Vazquez, one of nine women who run the Comité Estratégico de Ayuda Humanitaria Tijuana, a local group formed in September. “The government has to recognize it as a humanitarian crisis. ” On a recent morning, she and her colleague, Adriana Reyna, jumped into Ms. Reyna’s sport utility vehicle and took a tour of several shelters in Tijuana to assess their needs. At Iglesia Cristiana Embajadores de Jesus, the church in the ravine, a    Haitian girl had fallen. Her parents worried she had fractured a bone. So the women drove the child and her father to a nearby clinic where they arranged for a free evaluation, then swung by a pharmacy to pick up some medicine to treat the pain and swelling. At another shelter, the women lined up doctor’s appointments for a man with an infected leg wound and for two migrants who were experiencing complications with their pregnancies. They also strategized about setting up a piñata workshop that would give migrants employment. A message arrived, saying that an   cinema had about 30 pillows to donate. With a phone call, the women found a taker: a shelter in central Tijuana. At Iglesia Central del Nazareno, which had been converted into a shelter, the coordinator asked the women whether they had heard anything new about how Haitian migrants were being received at the United States border. Were they being deported? It was the day after Mr. Trump’s inauguration, and rumors were flying. “I hope they’ll all be able to cross. I hope they’ll be O. K.,” said the coordinator, Ruth Gaxiola, fighting back tears. She looked exhausted. Ms. Vazquez opened her arms, and the women embraced."

“We can’t just drill our way out of the problem.”



That was the[ oft-repeated phrase of President Barack Obama](https://www.dailysignal.com/2018/09/14/obama-was-wrong-on-oil-we-did-drill-our-way-out-of-the-problem/), who[ throughout his presidency](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bEyPkY0Kf-Y) argued that the key to beating higher gasoline prices was to subsidize alternative energies, such as solar and wind.



The fracking revolution has turned the United States into a net exporter of oil. 



It was a common sentiment from those who fretted that the world had reached “peak oil,” and that America was simply doomed to become increasingly reliant on a few big international oil producers for a rapidly dwindling resource.



It also played well into the narrative that fossil fuels were inherently evil, destroying the planet by escalating climate change.



But the doomsayers were wrong.



Thanks in large part to American ingenuity and technological innovation, the script has been flipped—and the dividends have been enormous.



Recent events in the Middle East underscore the dramatic change that’s occurred.



It’s been remarkable that following the September attacks on Saudi Arabian oil facilities and the recent U.S. strike[ on Iranian Gen. Qassim Suleimani](https://www.dailysignal.com/2020/01/04/5-things-to-know-about-top-iranian-general-killed-by-us-airstrike/), oil prices have remained more or less stable.



This is a huge departure from what has transpired after major incidents in the Middle East in the past. As Foreign Policy’s C.K. Hickey[ noted](https://foreignpolicy.com/2020/01/10/record-u-s-oil-production-is-keeping-crude-prices-from-spiking/):



The August 1990 Iraqi invasion of Kuwait led to a surge in the price of oil from $15 a barrel that month to $40 by October ($65.68 adjusted for inflation as of 2019). In February 2003, the lead-up to the U.S. invasion of Iraq once again led to a spike in prices to nearly $40 a barrel, or around $55 in today’s dollars, a level that hadn’t been seen since the Gulf War.



This time was different.



Why?



U.S. oil production has boomed in the past decade, thanks largely to innovation in the use of fracking, which has allowed the U.S. to tap into not only enormous amounts of shale oil, but also natural gas and other petroleum resources.



In fact, U.S. production has ramped up so much that in 2018, the U.S.[ became a net exporter](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-12-06/u-s-becomes-a-net-oil-exporter-for-the-first-time-in-75-years) of oil for the first time in nearly 75 years.



Perhaps even more incredibly, for a brief time at the end of 2019,[ the U.S. surpassed Saudi Arabia to become the world’s top oil exporter](https://www.cnn.com/2019/09/12/investing/us-oil-exports-saudi-arabia/index.html).



That, of course, produced jobs and a[ boon to the American economy](https://www.dallasfed.org/research/economics/2019/0820), but it also created the conditions for a global oil market more resistant to supply and price shocks—which were sometimes created by OPEC nations. Many of the latter are in the Middle East or generally hostile to the U.S.



But now, a world suddenly deprived of, say, Iranian oil, can rely increasingly on U.S. oil.



As political scientist Walter Russell Mead[ wrote](https://www.wsj.com/articles/fracking-our-way-to-mideast-peace-1513035925) for The Wall Street Journal, the Middle East is now a region “being fundamentally reshaped by drillers in Texas, Pennsylvania, North Dakota, and elsewhere.”



As my colleague Nick Loris, an expert on energy and environmental policy, has noted, the huge increase in domestic oil production[ doesn’t mean that the U.S. is truly energy independent](https://www.sacbee.com/news/news-services/article239344703.html). We are still very much affected by the global supply and the actions of countries abroad.



Nevertheless, the surge in production has transformed the American economy and given the U.S. an invaluable tool in foreign relations.



That has transpired in spite of efforts by the Obama administration and the left to strangle an industry they fundamentally dislike, an effort that would be stepped up massively if the so-called Green New Deal became law.



The Green New Deal,[ a badly disguised Trojan Horse for socialism](https://www.dailysignal.com/2019/01/04/the-green-new-deal-is-a-trojan-horse-for-socialism/) and of[ dubious environmental benefit,](https://www.dailysignal.com/2019/11/14/the-green-new-deal-isnt-just-expensive-its-also-bad-environmental-policy/) would end and reverse the oil production advances that have been such a broad-based benefit for the U.S. economy.



Hopefully, the strong economy and stable oil markets amid turmoil in the Middle East will serve as a reminder that reversing the incredible advances in oil drilling of the past decade would be a huge mistake.

"The 12 Days of Christmas is a song that promises a great deal, but there’s a line that carollers may have to omit in future. Before a whole house of leaping lords and dancing ladies, the second day is supposed to bring two turtle doves. But dramatic declines in populations across Europe may mean that day two disappoints true loves in Christmases to come. Only slightly larger than a blackbird, the European turtle dove is the UK’s smallest species of pigeon, as well as its only migrant species. You would be hard pushed to find turtle doves in the UK during December, as they spend the winter in sub-Saharan Africa, returning to Europe to breed in late April. With their return comes their gentle purring song, a long-standing sign of spring. Once widespread across England and Wales, the UK turtle dove population plummeted by 98% between 1970 and 2015, with similar declines across Europe. So what’s happening to this icon of the festive season? Turtle doves only eat seeds, and their first choice is weed seeds. Since the second world war, farming has drastically intensified across Europe and while this has also increased food production, it has decimated the food sources of turtle doves and other farmland birds, mammals and insects. Cutting back wild field margins, increasing herbicide use and sowing crops in autumn instead of spring have all contributed to the disappearance of wildflowers. With less of this habitat and food available, species are forced to feed more on easily accessible, man-made food sites, like stored or spilt grain on farms and garden bird feeders.

      Yellowhammer: the Brexit bird with a story to tell about the EU


 This has increased the risk of diseases spreading where birds congregate to feed. Just as diseases tend to spread on public transport, when large numbers of people come into close contact, the same is true for birds at garden feeders. Fewer wild sources of food are also blamed for the later arrival of turtle doves in Europe and their earlier migration to Africa, reducing their possible breeding time. Turtle doves can lay up to three clutches of eggs per season, but with less time to breed, they’re raising fewer chicks. As conservation scientists, we think this effect alone could explain most of the decline that’s been seen over the last 50 years. But turtle doves are also killed by recreational hunters, and although they’re widely protected, hunting was permitted in ten EU countries as recently as 2018, with more than a million birds killed each year in France, Spain and Portugal, along the western migratory route which UK birds travel. Hunting at these levels is likely to prevent turtle dove populations from recovering, even with restrictions on the timing of hunting and the numbers of birds shot. As migrants, turtle doves are threatened by what’s known as multiple jeopardy – they face challenges in African wintering grounds as well as in their European breeding grounds. Squeezed out of both habitats, migrant species tend to suffer more severe declines than their sedentary counterparts.

      Climate breakdown is knocking the natural world out of sync – and we should all be worried


 As a PhD candidate studying turtle doves, I’ve had the privilege of working with these beautiful birds in their natural habitat. I saw thousands of turtle doves leaving one prominent winter roosting site in Senegal – an amazing sight to behold, considering their rarity back in the UK. On a trip to Hungary, one of the only countries in Europe that’s home to a stable population of turtle doves, I heard them singing and saw pairs fluttering between trees. Having spent the majority of my time over the past two years reading about how poorly this species is faring, these moments were truly invigorating. I’m hopeful that the work of Operation Turtle Dove, an effort by four UK conservation organisations, can counter the problems facing the species. This includes helping farmers look after wildlife by reintroducing uncropped field margins where the plants that doves like to eat can grow. Conservationists are also working closely with hunting organisations in Europe to ensure the activity is sustainable. They’ve already succeeded in reducing the hunting allowance in France. Anybody can help by simply reporting a turtle dove sighting on the British Trust for Ornithology’s BirdTrack website. This can help target conservation efforts where they’ll have the greatest impact. Turtle dove-friendly habitats can sprout up in British gardens and parks too, encouraging the spring visitors to feed and nest. All it takes is planting the food species they like, such as fumitory and red and white clover, or allowing hedges to grow for the birds to nesting. If people act now, they can safeguard the purr of spring in the British countryside, and make sure no one goes empty handed on the second day of Christmas."
"**The US National Basketball Association (NBA) has defended free speech amid a row with China over a team executive's tweet in support of Hong Kong protests.**
The tweet posted by Daryl Morey, the general manager of the Houston Rockets, caused uproar in China and his attempt to backtrack upset American fans.
But NBA boss Adam Silver defended Mr Morey and said the league would ""support freedom of expression"".
NBA games draw huge viewership in China, mainly via streaming platforms.
The Rockets have been popular there since the team signed Chinese star Yao Ming in 2002. Mr Yao now heads the Chinese Basketball Association (CBA).
But Mr Morey's tweet prompted a furious backlash in China, with broadcasters vowing to stop airing Rockets games.
They went further on Tuesday by scrapping plans to broadcast two NBA pre-season games being played in China.
The NBA is just the latest international business to be embroiled in controversy in both China and the US over the Hong Kong protests. But the organisation's strong defence of freedom of expression is unusual.
On Friday, Mr Morey posted a tweet with an image captioned: ""Fight For Freedom. Stand With Hong Kong.""
He was referencing months of pro-democracy protests in the territory, which is part of China but enjoys unique freedoms.
Chinese officials and media have reacted furiously to foreign expressions of support for the protesters and accused the West of interfering in Chinese affairs.
In response to Mr Morey's tweet, state-run broadcaster CCTV and Tencent Holdings, which streams NBA games in China, said they would stop broadcasting Rockets matches.
On Sunday the CBA suspended co-operation with the team, as did Chinese sportswear brand Li-Ning and the club's sponsor in China, Shanghai Pudong Development Bank.
On Monday, Mr Morey deleted the tweet and said: ""I was merely voicing one thought, based on one interpretation, of one complicated event.""
""I have always appreciated the significant support our Chinese fans and sponsors,"" he added.
But American fans reacted angrily to his apology, with one tweet saying: ""You shouldn't have to apologise for supporting freedom.""
On Tuesday Mr Silver issued a statement saying: ""The NBA will not put itself in a position of regulating what players, employees and team owners say or will not say on these issues.""
He later told reporters in Japan that the league would not compromise its values on freedom of speech and was motivated by more than money.
The NBA commissioner said he understood there would be consequences but that ""we will have to live with those consequences.""
He said he would travel to Shanghai on Wednesday and meet the officials to try to ""find mutual respect"". But he recognised that ""this issue might not die down so quickly"".
His defence of free speech in the face of Chinese anger is seen as a bold move, given the potential financial impact for the NBA.
""The vast majority of foreign companies apologize profusely at the first sign of discontent from Chinese consumers, which makes the NBA's response all the more remarkable,"" tweeted Mark Dreyer, an expert on China's sports industry.
Initially the Rockets and the NBA distanced themselves from Mr Morley's tweet. This provoked accusations from both Democratic and Republican lawmakers that the league was bowing to Beijing.
Former US presidential hopeful - and Rockets fan - Ted Cruz accused the NBA of ""shamefully retreating"" in pursuit of profit.
Mr Cruz said he was proud to see Mr Morey ""call out the Chinese Communist Party's repressive treatment of protestors in Hong Kong"".
Fellow Republican Senator Ben Sasse called the NBA's response ""shameful"".
Democratic presidential hopeful Julian Castro tweeted that the US must ""not allow American citizens to be bullied by an authoritarian government"".
Also on Tuesday, a Hong-Kong professional gamer was banned by game-maker Blizzard from competing for 12 months for staging an anti-government protest.
Ng Wai Chung put on a gas mask and shouted: ""Liberate Hong Kong, revolution of our age,"" after a Grandmasters Hearthstone tournament.
In September, Zara became a target of anger on Chinese social media after some of its Hong Kong stores closed on a day of strike action.
China accused the retailer of encouraging its employees to join the strike but Zara said it was just ensuring its shops were not understaffed if transport was disrupted.
In August the chief executive of airline Cathay Pacific stood down after the company shifted its stance on whether employees could join protests.
And in the same month Versace had to apologise to China after one of its T-shirts appeared to imply Hong Kong and Macau were independent territories."

…PLUS AN OBVIOUS ERROR IN THE NEW NOAA ERSST.V4 PAPER
Guest Post by Bob Tisdale
We’ve discussed NOAA’s new ERSST.v4 “pauses-buster” sea surface temperature reconstruction in a number of posts this year.  They are linked at the end of this post.  We can add yet another curiosity to the list…this time relating to the global ERSST.v4 data during the first half of the 20th Century.  Additionally, there is an error in a new paper about the NOAA ERSST.v4 that I want to discuss as well.
This post was prompted by a paragraph in NOAA’s recent paper about the uncertainties of their ERSST.v4 sea surface temperature reconstruction.  That paper is Huang et al. (2015b) Further Exploring and Quantifying Uncertainties for Extended Reconstructed Sea Surface Temperature (ERSST) Version 4 (v4), which is presently available (paywalled) as an Early Online Release.   Two things in the following paragraph caught my eye (my boldface):
A recent study (Karl et al. 2015) indicated that the trend of globally averaged SST in ERSST.v4 in the most recent decades (0.99°C century-1; 2000-2014) is as large as in the longer period of 1951-2012 (0.88°C century-1). Figure 6b shows the histogram of the trend during the longer period. The trend ranges from 0.7°C to 1.0°C century-1, which is higher than the long term trend shown in Figure 6a, indicating stronger oceanic warming since the middle of the 20th Century. Factor analyses indicate that the major contributor to this trend uncertainty is the ship-buoy adjustment (the 9th parameter; Fig. 7b).
FIRST, THE ERROR IN THE NEW HUANG ET AL. (2015b) PAPER
For the period of 1951-2012, Karl et al. (2015) listed the trend of 0.088 deg C/decade (0.88 deg C/century) for their “old” ERSST.v3b data, not the “new” ERSST.v4 data.   The 1951-2012 trend for the “new” ERSST.v4 data shown in Table S1 from the Supplementary materials for Karl et al. (2015) is listed as 0.100 deg C/decade (1.00 deg C/century). Their Table S1 is included as my Table 1.  NOAA repeated that “typo” throughout Huang et al. (2015b).

Table 1
Looks like the peer reviewers missed an obvious mistake.
In Figure 1, I’ve added vertical red lines to Figure 6 (SSTa trend uncertainty histograms) from Huang et al. to show the data trends listed in Karl et al. (2015) for the periods of 1951 to 2012 and 2000 to 2014. (Refer again to Karl et al. Table S1, my Table 1.) I’ve also shown the 0.88 deg C/Century trend that was erroneously listed in Huang et al. (2015b) for the period of 1951 to 2012.

Figure 1
Curiously, but not surprisingly, the actual sea surface temperature data trends align with, or are near to, the extreme high end trends in the uncertainty histograms.
And if you’re wondering about the ERSST.v4 data trend for the period of 1901 to 2014 (Cell a in Figure 6 from Huang et al. 2015b), the data for the latitudes of 60S-60N (global excluding the polar oceans) present a linear trend of 0.073 deg C/decade (0.73 deg C/century)….once again toward the high end of the histogram.  (Data available through the KNMI Climate Explorer.)
SO THE WARMING RATE FOR 1951-2012 IS HIGHER THAN THE RATE FOR 1901-2012
The above quote from Huang et al. (2015b) included (my brackets):
The trend ranges from 0.7°C to 1.0°C century-1 [for the period of 1951-2012], which is higher than the long term trend shown in Figure 6a [for the period of 1901-2014], indicating stronger oceanic warming since the middle of the 20th Century.
There’s nothing unusual about global sea surface temperatures since 1951 having a higher warming rate than the data since 1901.  All sea surface temperature and night marine air temperature datasets (end products) available from the KNMI Climate Explorer show that simple relationship.  See Figure 2. The difference between the shorter-term (1951-2012) and the longer-term (1901-2012) trends depends on the dataset.

Figure 2 (Typo Corrected in ERSST.v3b Graph)
Figure 2 (and Figures 3 through 5) include global (60S-60N) ocean surface temperature anomalies referenced to the period of 1971-2000, from top to bottom:

NOAA’s ERSST.v4 Sea Surface Temperature (NOAA’s new “Pauses-Buster” data)
NOAA’s ERSST.v3b Sea Surface Temperature (NOAA’s “old” data)
UKMO’s HadNMAT2 Night Marine Air Temperature (Which NOAA uses to adjust their ERSST.v4 data to account for ship-based temperature biases, from buckets and ship inlets)
UKMO’s HADSST3 Sea Surface Temperature (An uninterpolated product used in the UKMO HadCRUT4 global land+ocean surface temperature product), and
UKMO’s HadISST Sea Surface Temperature (the most-often-used sea surface temperature dataset used in scientific studies, even though it has the lowest warming rates.)

Huang et al. included trends for the periods of 1901-2014 and 1951-2012, using two different end years. For ease of illustration, I ended the data for both periods in 2012. That also agrees with the periods shown in Table 2.5 from Chapter 2 of the IPCC’s 5th Assessment Report. The exception to the 2012 end year is the HadNMAT2 data, which run through 2010 because the dataset ends then.
The data suppliers account for sea ice differently…thus the use of the latitudes of 60S-60N.
In the quote above, Huang et al. (2015b) are suggesting that global warming is accelerating.  But Huang et al. (2015b) failed to note something important.
THE WARMING RATE FOR 1901-1950 IS ALSO HIGHER THAN THE RATE FOR 1901-2012
Figure 3 includes trend comparisons for the five ocean surface temperature products, but this time comparing the warming rates for 1901-1950 and 1901-2012.

Figure 3 (Corrected typo on HADSST3 graph)
The “ew” “new” and “old” NOAA sea surface temperature products show slightly higher warming rates for 1901-1950 than they do for 1901-2012. On the other hand, the UKMO’s HadNMAT2, HADSST3 and HadISST show noticeably higher warming trends for the early period of 1901-1950.
ONLY THE NOAA “PAUSES-BUSTER” DATA SHOW A LOWER WARMING RATE IN THE FIRST HALF OF THE 20TH CENTURY 
Figure 4 compares the warming rates for 1901-1950 and 1951-2012 for the 5 ocean surface temperature products.

Figure 4 (Corrected typo on HADSST3 graph)
With the “old” NOAA ERSST.v3b data, the warming rates for the early (1901-1950) period are comparable to those for the later period (1951-2012).  The early period has a slightly higher warming rate than the later period in the HadNMAT2 and HadISST datasets…though it could be argued that they’re comparable.  The HADSST3 data have a noticeably higher warming rate in the early period.
The exception is NOAA’s new ERSST.v4 “pauses buster” data, which show a noticeably lower warming rate in the first half of the 20th Century.
DIVIDED INTO TWO EQUAL-LENGTH (50-YEAR) PERIODS
Someone is bound to note that we’re not comparing periods of equal length. So, for Figure 5, I ended the later period in 2000, breaking the 20th Century in two.

Figure 5 (Corrected typos in ERSST.v4 and HADSST3 graphs.)
THE DATASET USED BY NOAA FOR SHIP-BASED BIAS ADJUSTMENTS DOES NOT SUPPORT THE LOWER WARMING RATE IN THE FIRST HALF OF THE 20TH CENTURY 
Figure 6 compares the warming rates for the periods of 1901-1950 and 1951-2010 using the global (60S-60N) HadNMAT2 and the new NOAA ERSST.v4 “pauses-buster” sea surface temperature data.  NOAA adjusts their ERSST.v4 sea surface temperature data using HadNMAT2 night marine air temperature data to account for ship-based temperature measurement biases (buckets of various types and ship inlets).

Figure 6
Curiously, NOAA’s ERSST.v4 data have a noticeably lower warming rate than the reference HadNMAT2 data during the first half of the 20th Century (and a noticeably higher warming rate from 1951-2010).  Those additional tweaks are the reasons why the NOAA ERSST.v4 are the outlier, showing a lower warming rate in the first half of the 20th Century than for the period from 1951-2012.
CLOSING
Did NOAA adjustment (modify, tweak, manipulate, etc.) their ERSST.v4 “pauses-buster” sea surface temperature data during the first half of the 20th Century so that the ocean surfaces showed a slight acceleration in global sea surface warming for 1951-2012?   The other ocean surface temperature datasets don’t show the same disparity over those two time periods.  If fact, the UKMO’s HADSST3 dataset (which like ERSST.v4 is also adjusted for bucket, ship inlet and buoy biases) shows a noticeably higher warming rate for 1901-1950 than for 1951-2012.
ADDITIONAL POSTS ABOUT NOAA’S NEW ERSST.v4 “PAUSES-BUSTER” SEA SURFACE TEMPERATURE DATA
In previous posts at WattsUpWithThat and at my blog ClimateObservations, I’ve discussed the new NOAA “pause-buster” sea surface temperature dataset (ERSST.v4) a number of times since the publication of Karl et al. (2015)—latest to earliest:

Busting (or not) the mid-20th century global-warming hiatus

Share this...FacebookTwitterEnergy experts Jürgen Großmann and Prof. Fritz Vahrenholt wrote in an opinion piece in Saturday’s hardcopy edition of the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung (FAZ) that renewable energies are expensive, costing 2 to 3 times more than conventional energy.

FAZ: “Worry over transition to renewable energy”
The two German experts warn that any attempt the country makes to reach the target of 45% renewable energy by the year 2025 is tantamount to economic Harakiri.
28 billion euros annually
Already Germany’s budding Energiewende is costing German consumers and businesses 28 billion euros annually, or roughly an average of 300 euros for each household. These costs are driven in part by insanely high leasing costs that wind turbine operators pay to wealthy land owners –  and subsidies paid to growers of corn for biofuel.
Storage technology “prohibitively expensive”


<!--

google_ad_slot = ""6412247007"";

google_ad_height = 200;
//-->




Großmann and Vahrenholt also remind readers storage technologies are “prohibitively expensive” and offer no solution the problem of evening out the highly volatile wind and solar supply.
Sizzling power grids
Another major problem, the two energy experts comment, are the extreme uncontrolled power surges occurring on both sunny and windy days. In such cases the operators of over-fed, sizzling grids are forced to dump surplus electricity into the power grids of neighboring countries, which has the effect of upsetting both their grids and power generation markets. Another peculiarity is that wind park operators are routinely ordered to shut down, yet are paid for the power that never gets produced. German Vice Chancellor Sigmar Gabriel once said that other countries think it’s “crazy”.
Großmann and Vahrenholt, both former top energy executives, characterize the demands made by the influential German Greens to shut down the country’s coal power plants as naïve and simply unworkable, and call plans to install large wind parks near the Baltic Sea before constructing transmission lines to take the power to markets “nonsense”.
German reductions would be wiped out in just 3 months
The economics of the German renewables project also border on insanity. Vahrenholt and Großmann remind that all the CO2 reductions that are to be made by Germany would be wiped out by China’s massive growth in just a matter of three months, making all the pain and cost for nothing. China represents 29% of the world’s CO2 emissions, Germany only a paltry 2.5%.
Vahrenholt and Großmann conclude that Germany must return to rationality by getting back on a renewable energy path that is technicaly and economically feasilble, and not one that destroys the environment and economy, as is the case currently in Germany. They point out that Great Britain, Spain, Poland, Denmark and Italy have all scaled back their renewable energy development so as to not further overburden their consumers and industry.

"**Dozens of spectators at a US basketball game have held signs and donned T-shirts and masks in support of protests in Hong Kong.**
Demonstrators gathered during a match in New York between the Brooklyn Nets and the Toronto Raptors.
The move was organised by film producer Andrew Duncan, who bought 300 tickets for the activists.
It comes amid an ongoing row between China and the NBA over the protests that have rocked Hong Kong since March.
Images from the pre-season game on Friday show demonstrators wearing T-shirts emblazoned with ""Stand With Hong Kong"" and ""Free Tibet"".
Two other people were also pictured wearing Winnie-the-Pooh costumes. The cartoon bear is used as a symbol to mock Chinese President Xi Jinping and is banned in China.
Footage from the protest was shared on social media.
Among the group was Hong Kong activist Nathan Law, the former chairman of Demosisto, a pro-democracy party he co-founded with fellow campaigner Joshua Wong.
""We want to use our performance art to show our support for Hong Kong and the NBA,"" another spectator, Chen Pokong, 55, told the New York Post. ""[China wants] to take away freedom of speech and now spread dictatorship to America.""
Local media report that some of demonstrators were ejected from the game for chanting.
Similar demonstrations have already been held at other games between American and Chinese teams. Earlier this month, during a match between the Philadelphia 76ers and the Guangzhou Loong-Lions, two people were asked to leave for holding signs in support of Hong Kong protests.
At another game between the Loong-Lions and the Washington Wizards, local media report that spectators had their pro-Hong Kong signs confiscated.
But Friday's protest was the first to be held during a match between two NBA teams.
The spat between the league and China's government began earlier this month after Houston Rockets manager Daryl Morey tweeted support for protests in Hong Kong.
As a result, several Chinese firms suspended sponsorship and telecast deals with the NBA - a huge financial blow to the league, which has millions of followers in China.
The Rockets and the NBA quickly distanced themselves from Mr Morey's tweet, while basketball superstar LeBron James suggested the Rockets' manager ""wasn't educated on the situation"" in Hong Kong.
Brooklyn Nets owner Joe Tsai - who is also the vice-chairman of Chinese ecommerce giant Alibaba - has also criticised Mr Morey for his ""damaging"" tweet, saying he misjudged how strongly many Chinese people felt about Hong Kong.
""Supporting a separatist movement in a Chinese territory is one of those third-rail issues, not only for the Chinese government, but also for all citizens in China,"" Mr Tsai added.
Mr Morey has since backtracked on his tweet. but US lawmakers on both sides of the political aisle have accused the NBA of bowing to Beijing."
"Like everything else in 2020, the football season in Europe has been unusual. The Champions League final this Sunday, its traditional climax, is three months late. All eight quarter-finalists have been quarantined in Lisbon. What normally are two-legged home-and-away ties have been reduced to one match played in an eerie, empty and neutral stadium. Even games of the calibre of Bayern Munich’s 8-2 evisceration of Barcelona were rendered hollow and bizarre.  Yet, as with the wider impacts of the world’s lockdowns, this has been good news for football’s carbon emissions. Last year, the World Land Trust estimated that the Champions League final alone would generate nearly 10,000 tonnes of carbon. In the absence of a crowd, it is estimated that this year’s will be under 3,000 tonnes. Uefa promises that all will be back to normal for 2021, and who could not long for the return of crowds and their electric energies? But the climate crisis will still be with us. In any case, there is no going back to normal. Football is going to feel the impact of the climate emergency very soon. More very hot weather is going to be a problem for spectators and players alike. The physiology of overheating is complex, but once it starts hitting 35C, and you are playing football, it’s all bad news. Memory, hand-eye coordination and concentration all start to suffer, then there are heat cramps, heat exhaustion and heatstroke. There are going to be a lot more days like that in the global football calendar in the next few decades. Pre-season training in the Mediterranean is becoming physiologically dangerous. Grassroots and informal play in great swaths of the global south will become intolerable. In northern Europe the rising number of extreme weather events will also disrupt the game. In 2015, torrential rain accompanying Storm Desmond saw Carlisle United’s Brunton Park flooded and the club forced out of the stadium for seven weeks, at considerable financial cost. Expect more of this. Using mapping technology, combined with climate change models, we can see that by 2050 Werder Bremen’s Weserstadion and Bordeaux’s Matmut Atlantique will be flooded annually. In England, 23 of the 92 league grounds can expect partial or total annual flooding of their stadiums by 2050: four in the Premier League, four in the Championship, eight in League One and seven in League Two – including Grimsby Town’s Blundell Park, which will sit beneath the new North Sea. Similar fates await estuarine and coastal stadiums everywhere. If the football world is going to mitigate the worst of these risks, it needs, like everything else, to make itself carbon zero, and preferably in the next decade. What might that look like? First, as most studies show that 70% of football’s emissions come from spectator travel, and we still want a crowd – without which the whole show is barren – these need to be minimised and offset. Uefa has led the way on this, committing to offsetting aviation emissions from Euro 2020 – now postponed to next year – out of its own budget by investing in reforestation projects. Uefa should also extend the programme to next year’s Champions League – and such practices simply must become the norm for all commercial football. Second, football needs to end its reliance on hydrocarbon sponsorship. The final stages of the Champions League have been particularly soaked in fossil fuels, with Gazprom sponsoring Uefa, Emirates airline backing Lyon, and PSG owned by Qatar (and Qatar Airways a partner of Bayern Munich). Third, every football association, broadcaster, sponsor and club needs to commit to carbon-zero practice by 2030, taking their lead from the best in the sector: Forest Green Rovers are UN-certified carbon zero, with vegan food, a new, wooden stadium and 100% renewable energy use; in the Bundesliga many clubs are massively reducing waste, installing solar panels and subsidising public transport. Self-interest and virtue might, for once, overlap. Football has its own reasons for going carbon zero, but its efforts are just a fraction of what we must do collectively. Its catalytic potential, however, is immense. Few human practices offer such an extraordinarily large, global and socially diverse constituency as those playing and following football. Making a carbon-zero world the commonsense priority of the football world would make a huge and very visible contribution to making it the commonsense priority of all politics. Then there is the question of hope, without which no politics of climate action is possible. This is in short supply. But football, from the street to the stadium, generates hope: that no cause is lost until the game is actually at an end; a past that tells us miraculous recoveries and rallies are possible; that human beings, collectively, have the heart and the wit, when the time comes, to make it happen. That is a precious set of cultural treasures to hold in trust for the world. If football is ready to adopt radical change in the field of climate action, it might be able to offer them, in all good faith, to humanity. And then you just never know. • David Goldblatt is the author of The Age Of Football: The Global Game In The Twenty-first Century (Macmillan).

Our friends at www​.real​cli​mate​.org and www​.ryanavent​.com have been taking shots at the statements in our ad, so I’d like to offer a little commentary.   
  
  
We make three factual assertions.   
  
  
First, we say that “surface temperature changes over the past century have been episodic and modest”. We cite Brohan et al., _Journal of Geophysical Research_ (2006 and updates) and Swanson and Tsonis, _Geophysical Research Letters_ , 2009. The first is the latest update of the East Anglia temperature history, which long has been the IPCC staple. It is the one most cited over the years by the IPCC because it was the first long history that contained much more than simply World Weather Records data updated with local records at the end of a month. At any rate, both it and other global histories indeed show modest warming, about 0.8degC from 1900–2000, and indeed it is episodic. Everyone (well probably almost everyone…there are some real people who don’t believe it is right) pretty much agrees that there are two periods of warming, 1910–45 and 1977–98, with a slight cooling in between and no trend after. If that’s not “episodic”, I don’t know what is. The Swanson paper in fact specifically quantifies these episodes. The paragaph near the end of it that says this may mean that warming will be faster than we thought was pure speculation. It could just have easily been argued (as I do) that the lack of recent warming more likely indicates that 21st century warming will be lower than forecast by oceanic feedback because lack of warming simply delays any water vapor amplification. Pure and simple.   
  
  
The second assertion is that, “after controlling for population growth and property values, there has been no increase in damages from severe weather events”. The citation is short — a note in the _Bulletin of the American Meteorological Society_ , by Pielke Jr. et al, 2005. The et al. numbers over ten other large‐​name scientists/​analysts, and the reference list is the important part. There are a large number of citations on climate‐​related damages for various places and/​or periods. We couldn’t list them all in this format, so we chose a single citation that could be consulted and an interested reader would find all the subsidiary supporting material.   
  
  
Finally we state that “the computer models forecasting rapid temperature change abjectly fail to explain recent climate behavior”, citing Douglas et al., _International Journal of Climatology_ , 2007, which showed the major disparity between forecasts of the upper tropospheric tropical “warm spot”, a hallmark of greenhouse projections, and observations in the radiosonde record. Yes it is true that Santer et al. have published a lengthy rebuttal, but it is extremely dense and marks just another go‐​round‐​and‐​round over this issue. Douglas et al. have a response but it hasn’t been published yet. The debate will go on and on. Further, it is quite apparent from comparing midrange multimodel estimates from the IPCC to observed temperatures, and those indeed projected for coming years, that there is a signficant disconnect developing between the models and surface temperature. They simply don’t anticipate multidecadal periods without warming. Oh yes, since this has happened, all of the sudden models can be forced to “explain” it, but that’s not prospective. Instead, it is retrospective adjustment. Such work wouldn’t be performed if there weren’t something wrong.   
  
  
That’s more than enough to negate President‐​elect Obama’s statement that “The science is beyond dispute and the facts are clear”!

Guest opinion: Dr. Tim Ball
The Daily Caller headline said, Russia’s Putin Says Global Warming Is ‘A Fraud.” What Putin is doing and saying is nothing new. He always knew that the IPCC climate was wrong he simply changed his political position as the situation dictated. Soviet and latterly Russian climatologists are far better than most in the west. I know Chinese climatologists are their equals because I worked with both.
Experience
I worked with several Soviet climatologists during the Cold War. It began when I wrote a chapter in a book titled Climate Since AD 1500.  The editor had chapter authors review other chapters. One that I was assigned titled “Documentary evidence from the USSR” by E. P. Borisenkov reported on the value of the Russian Chronicles. I became very familiar with the work of Mikhail Budyko, who essentially changed the approach from synoptic climatology to energy budget climatology.   His work was influential to current climate science. Ironically, the editor was Phil Jones, who gave me my only mention in the leaked emails. In May 2008, he wrote,
“PPS Our web server has found this piece of garbage – so wrong it is unbelievable that Tim Ball wrote a decent paper in Climate Since AD 1500.”
Michael Mann commented,
p.s. As for Tim Ball, he is so completely discredited (with having lost that lawsuit involving him lying about his academic credentials) that nobody but those truly in denial would even bother reading his tripe. see e.g.
http://www.desmogblog.com/node/1272
I do find it an amusing curiosity that he actually has a chapter in Bradley and Jones.
Probably best kept a secret!
The problem is I didn’t lose a lawsuit and the paper that published the false academic credentials, The Calgary Herald, published a correction and apology. Consider the source of Mann’s information. Besides, we now know who published the real garbage?
Different Approaches and Conflicts
During the Cold War, most Soviet science publications were not available until a significant change occurred when Jewish scientists who escaped from the Soviet Union set up translation services in Israel. In approximately 1990 a divergence in climate science emerged between Eastern block countries and the West. The Soviets believed climate was cyclical, the sum of a multitude of cycles. The challenge was to identify them and how they interacted. Cyclical climate events pervaded Russian thinking particularly since the publication of Nikolai Kondratieff’s 1926 article titled “Long Waves in Economic Life.” The concept of climate cycles has flourished in economics and stock market prognostications ever since. Michael Zahorchak’s book “Climate: The Key to Understanding Business Cycles” is a good example. The western view revolved around Chaos Theory that weather was unpredictable beyond a couple of days because of randomness; Lorenz and the butterfly. This created an ongoing contradiction for AGW proponents. If you can’t forecast accurately for a few days, how can you be so certain about 50 and 100-year forecasts?
The fascinating thing about the east-west scientific, intellectual and philosophical difference is that it was interpreted as political and ideological. It wasn’t, and Putin’s position is a manifestation of the difference. What is fascinating is his recognition that the IPCC and Kyoto was a political agenda to suppress development, except that he believes it is only applied to developing countries. In fact, it was designed to promote equal and limited development by weakening developed nations and minimally improving developing nations. All this comes after the developed nations paid for their sins and the money went to the developing nations who suffered. It takes a communist to recognize an attempt at one-world government. Putin is not opposed to this as long as Russia is in control.
Another illustration of the Russian position occurred when Lord May used science societies to promote the IPCC global warming agenda. He began with the UK Royal Society and used their prestigious status to persuade other national societies to manipulate public perception with public statements. Most societies conformed, an issue that is still a contention for many, as Professor Emeritus Hal Lewis’s resignation from the American Physical Society illustrated. One group, the Russian Academy, resisted the propaganda move under the leadership of climatologist Professor Yuri Izrael. At a United Kingdom Met Office (UKMO) conference at Exeter University titled “Avoiding Dangerous Climate Change,” Professor Izrael and Andrei Illarionov paid the price for their actions. As Benny Peiser reported,
After two days of relentless barrage of doom and gloom predictions at the Met Office conference on “Avoiding Dangerous Climate Change” I decided that enough is enough. The unmitigated exposure to prophecies of imminent ice ages, looming hell fire, mass starvation, mega-droughts, global epidemics and mass extinction is an experience I would not recommend to anyone with a thin-skinned disposition (although the news media couldn’t get enough of it). But such was the spectacle of pending disaster that anyone who dared – or was allowed – to question whether the sky is really about to fall on us (and there were at least half a dozen of moderate anti-alarmists present), was branded a “usual suspect”, a slur hurled against Andrei Illarionov (Putin’s economic adviser) by the IPCC’s Martin Parry.
Peiser reported that after Professor Izrael presented his paper
The Russian scientist was immediately and disrespectfully admonished by the chair and former IPCC chief Sir John Houghton for being far too optimistic. Such a moderate proposal was ridiculous since it was “incompatible with IPCC policy”. Clearly, the Met Office meeting was setting the tone for the next IPCC report.
It was deeply upsetting to witness the ill-mannered and discourteous way in which both Professor Izrael and Dr Illarionov were mocked during the debates by many delegates and IPCC officials.
This is the same UKMO that get weather and climate forecasts wrong so often they lost their contract to the fellow public agency the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC).
Putin’s Climate Representative
Putin was always opposed to Kyoto and the so-called science behind it. He sent his economic advisor Andrey Illarionov on a world tour explaining what was wrong with the science. A copy of his Washington 2004 PowerPoint presentation is available here. After the tour Putin’s political situation changed.
The Kyoto Protocol needed ratification by enough countries that produced 55% of the CO2. When the US refused to participate, Russia was the only country left at the time producing enough CO2 to keep Kyoto going. Illarionov finished his world tour returned to Russia and a month later Putin announced he was going to ratify Kyoto. Illarionov resigned. Some argued that Putin gained more by selling emission credits. Putin explained the realities of his action. His goal was to double Russia’s gross domestic product, and he believed this was more achievable through membership in the World Trade Organization (WTO). 
The fact was that several nations, mostly European, effectively blackmailed Putin by telling him they would not support his application for Russia’s membership in the WTO. Illarionov explained what went on before he left the stage. Putin considered that membership more valuable than the Kyoto deal at the time. Here is that view artfully suggested by a Polish commentator. 
Another popular hypothesis links ratification with EU support for Russia’s WTO accession. Although high-ranking officials such as Foreign Affairs Minister Igor Ivanov and Energy Minister Igor Iusofov denied this allegation, President Putin himself hinted at it, when saying: “The EU has met us halfway in talks over the WTO and that cannot but affect positively our position on the Kyoto Protocol.” It is not clear, however, whether Russia’s delay was part of a strategy to bargain with the EU, or whether the Kremlin “just” took advantage of its special position to come closer to WTO membership—which was one of the main aims of Putin’s presidency.
Now it is to Putin’s economic advantage to oppose the Kyoto replacement the Green Climate Fund (GCF).
Will Putin Contribute To The Green Climate Fund?
At the Conference of the Parties (COP)16, they introduced the Green Climate Fund with the World Bank as the interim trustee. In September 2015, the European Union and South Korea committed to making the GCF a major part of the Paris COP.
SONGDO, 17 September 2015 – Meeting on the occasion of their Eighth Bilateral Summit, the heads of the Republic of Korea and the European Union stressed the need to tackle climate change and confirmed their resolve to play their part in concluding a successful universal climate agreement in Paris later this year.
The three leaders affirmed their ambition to “make the Green Climate Fund fully operational and the main operating entity of the financial mechanism” under the UNFCCC for the Post-2020 climate regime.
Despite this, many are not paying.
Friends of the Earth International today demanded that developed nations provide the Green Climate Fund with the resources they pledged to it in 2014, warning that the contributions made so far are alarmingly low.
Thousands will go to Paris with over half of them Non-Government Organization (NGO) people. They will push an agenda that Putin knows is completely unnecessary. As the French mathematical society, SocietedeCalculMathematiqueSA wrote in a recent paper that Putin will know about titled, “The battle against global warming: an absurd, costly and pointless crusade.”
There is not a single fact, figure or observation that leads us to conclude that the world‘s climate is in any way ̳disturbed‘. It is variable, as it has always been, but rather less so now than during certain periods or geological eras. Modern methods are far from being able to accurately measure the planet‘s global temperature even today, so measurements made 50 or 100 years ago are even less reliable.
Concentrations of CO2 vary, as they always have done; the figures that are being released are biased and dishonest. Rising sea levels are a normal phenomenon linked to upthrust buoyancy; they are nothing to do with so-called global warming. As for extreme weather events – they are no more frequent now than they have been in the past.
It is built on the false science created by the IPCC to support the political objective of Agenda 21. German Physicist and meteorologist Klaus-Eckart Plus explained why too many scientists don’t understand. They never read what the IPCC said.
“Ten years ago I simply parroted what the IPCC told us. One day I started checking the facts and data—first I started with a sense of doubt but then I became outraged when I discovered that much of what the IPCC and the media were telling us was sheer nonsense and was not even supported by any scientific facts and measurements. To this day I still feel shame that as a scientist I made presentations of their science without first checking it.” ”Scientifically it is sheer absurdity to think we can get a nice climate by turning a CO2 adjustment knob.”
Russian scientists know what the IPCC said. Because of them Putin knows that the climate science of the IPCC is wrong. He knows it because Soviet and now Russian climatologists practice open science, which is ironic in a political system that is supposed to be controlling. He also knows the IPCC is designed to use climate for political goals because he does it better than most. As the say, it takes a thief to catch a thief. How much money will Putin contribute to the Green Climate Fund?

We are told the globe is rapidly and dangerously warming, and that this rapid and dangerous warming has been predominantly caused by the steep rise in anthropogenic CO2 emissions that began about the mid-1940s.
We even have a widely-recognized “hockey stick” graph of the Northern Hemisphere — created by Michael Mann in the late 1990s and popularized by the IPCC (2001) — to “prove” that modern warming has been synchronously global in scale, as well as rapid, dangerous, and perhaps even unprecedented (“the warmest on record”).
There is a problem with this paradigm, however.  An enormous problem.
That is, when scientists reconstruct sea surface temperatures (SST) and land surface temperatures and deep ocean heat content from the paleoclimate record (hundreds to thousands of years ago) using existing physical proxy evidence, and when they use this same physical evidence to reconstruct the modern temperatures, the rapid and dangerous warming trend that mysteriously forms a hockey stick shape for recent decades seems to just . . . disappear.  In its place is a modern record of temperatures from locations all over the world that does not even come close to resembling a rapidly warming, dangerous, and unprecedented hockey stick.  Instead, the paleoclimate record reveals the opposite.  Large regions of the Earth were significantly warmer than they are now for most of the last several thousand years.
Below is a compilation of 50 temperature graphs from peer-reviewed scientific papers.  Some graphs indicate that (a) post-1940s temperatures actually declined in many regions of the world rather than rose rapidly — the opposite of what climate models had predicted.   All the graphs show that (b) modern (post-1940s) temperatures aren’t any warmer than the decades and centuries and millennia prior to the steep increase in anthropogenic CO2 emissions, and in some locations even the Little Ice Age temperatures (1400s to 1800s AD) were warmer than modern.  Finally, these 50 graphs clearly show that (c) the conceptualization of global-scale warming, or a globally synchronous rise in temperatures for the vast majority of the Earth’s land and oceanic locations in modern times . . . is not scientifically supportable. 
In many parts of the world, today’s temperatures are still among the coldest they’ve been in the last several thousand years.   Sea levels, in turn, are at some of the lowest levels of the last 8,000 years; relative sea levels were 1 to 4 meters higher than they are now just a few thousand years ago.  Where warming has occurred, it’s been modest and slight, not rapid and dangerous.  Perhaps this is why  the “hide the decline” phenomenon became so necessary for hockey stick-favoring reconstructionists.

"Manhattan Conference on Global Warming Indicates that “No Regrets” is the Best Policy.
The Carbon Sense Coalition based in Australia, says that the science and empirical evidence on Global warming is now clearly indicating that a “No Regrets” policy is the best course for the world to follow.
The Carbon Sense Coalition was one of the 52 organisations from 20 different countries which co-sponsored the recent International Conference on Climate Change in New York. Al Gore was invited to address the conference (he was even promised his $200,000 fee) but he declined to appear. Jim Hansen of NASA, another prominent alarmist, was also invited, but declined. (Contrast this with the Bali conference when a delegation of prominent sceptical scientists sought to present their petition to the UN. They were denied admission and refused an audience.)

The Chairman of “Carbon Sense” Mr Viv Forbes, who attended the conference along with about 20 other Australian and New Zealand speakers and observers, said that with over 500 delegates attending over 100 sessions presented and discussed by scientists, economists, politicians and policy analysts (many of world standing) there was no aspect of global warming science and policy that was not examined in the light of current knowledge and evidence.
For more information on the conference see:
www.heartland.org/Article.cfm?artId=22875 and www.americanthinker.com/2008/03/ny_climate_conference_journey.html
Forbes claimed that a number of clear conclusions arose from the conference:

There is no doubt that the earth is in a warming phase, and has been in this phase for some 300 years. Warming started after the frigid years of the Little Ice Age, and has continued, in waves, ever since.
There is no doubt that the short warm eras in earth’s history have proved very beneficial for life on earth as evidenced by the rising population, increased prosperity, increased life span, increased food production and the flourishing of art and architecture that has accompanied every one of the recent warm eras. Ice Ages, not Warm Ages, are the big threats to life on earth.
There is considerable uncertainty about the future trends in earth’s temperature. However, there is close correlation between past temperature trends and variations in solar output and planetary cycles, and these indicate that the current warming is likely to end, no matter what man does, maybe within decades. The cooling may have already started.
It is very clear that carbon dioxide levels in the atmosphere have risen, but close study of the correlations between CO2 and temperature shows that it is far more likely that temperature changes trigger changes in CO2 levels. Past records also show that current levels of CO2 in the atmosphere are neither unusual nor concerning.
There are no credible claims or evidence from any quarter that current or projected levels of CO2 in the atmosphere pose any other threat to human, animal or plant life on earth. CO2 is not a contributor to air pollution; in fact it is a precious plant food on which all life on earth depends.
Man’s activities contribute less than 5% of total emissions into the atmosphere, and this addition has had only minor effect (probably undetectable) on the rising temperature trend.
There is good evidence that oceans, volcanoes and other natural sources expel large but variable quantities of CO2 into the atmosphere. Oceans expel CO2 as they warm and absorb it as they cool.
It is agreed in all quarters that the computerised General Circulation Models utilised heavily by the IPCC to produce their warming alarms have no proven ability to forecast climate even one year in advance, let alone the 50 or more years that some people have quoted.
It is a fact that CO2 and the other atmospheric gases provide an insulating blanket to the earth, keeping surface temperature higher than it would otherwise be. However, science is agreed that CO2’s warming potential is almost exhausted, and even if current levels of CO2 doubled, it would not on its own cause alarming global warming. There is nothing to fear from CO2 induced warming.
The large positive warming feedbacks assumed by the IPCC are quite likely to be much smaller or even negative. Recent work is showing that the earth has a huge capacity to distribute and dissipate heat via winds, ocean currents, evaporation, precipitation and radiation to space. There is a large degree of self regulation in the natural global temperature controllers.

“In summary, man is not as important or as smart as some people believe he is. He is nowhere near to understanding the complex interactions between the big climate players – the sun, planetary cycles, atmospheric circulation, volcanoes and the dominating role of water in clouds, in the atmosphere, in the oceans, and in snow and ice. Moreover, his tiny contribution to an extremely minor atmospheric gas such as CO2 is highly unlikely to be the main driver of world climate.
“The inevitable conclusion to be drawn from the above observations is that man is unlikely to achieve any positive climate benefits from a very costly and disruptive policy of forcible decarbonisation of all human activities. The earth will largely ignore him.
“This indicates that the huge sums of money contributed by consumers, taxpayers and businesses to this futile war on carbon will be largely wasted, and future generations will have great regrets that their parents were so profligate with their inheritance.
Forbes claimed that the nations of the world should follow a “No Regrets Policy” which yields dividends no matter what the future climate holds.
“We should abandon all policies that assume either warming or cooling, because there is no clear evidence on what the future holds.
“We should be strengthening our ability to adapt our lifestyle and our economy to whatever climate the future holds for us. We can be certain that climate will change, perhaps dramatically, but no one is yet competent to predict it, and man is powerless to have significant effect on it.
“A “No Regrets” policy means exposing all people to the full cost of their actions, and allowing the climate and the market to deter silly practices and encourage sensible ones.
“Specifically, all governments should assist their communities to adapt to whatever changes are surely in store for us by ceasing to mandate market shares for any particular energy source, and abolishing all discriminatory energy taxes and subsidies and all limits, caps and taxes on harmless emissions of CO2. They should also abandon all plans to mandate the Emissions Trading Game – leave that to the gamblers who choose to play. It will be more fun than Monopoly with a similar outcome – a few big winners and all the rest losers.
“No one has the right to gamble the seed corn of the community on preparing for last year’s climate crisis. Governments are currently planning to spend huge and growing amounts of money on the very dubious assumption that global warming is a clear and present danger. This money would be far better spent on infrastructure to insulate us from future shortages of water, energy or food, procuring emergency equipment that can cope with ANY natural disaster, tackling real air or water pollution problems or designing policies that ensure that rising prices are left free to discourage the waste of scarce resources.
“Useful equipment and facilities and sound stable policies will serve us well in drought, flood, fire, tempest, tidal wave, global warming or global cooling.
This indeed would be a policy of “No Regrets”.
“Man believes he is a heavy hitter, confident in his ability to dominate and manipulate the climate. But he needs to remember, “Nature bats last”.

By Kenneth Richard
In a 2015 editorial on the dire consequences of human-caused climate change, Marcia McNutt, editor of the journal Science, stated with conviction that “the time for debate has ended.”   It’s the “action” of reducing our CO2 emissions that is now “urgently needed” instead of debating what apparently is “settled” science. She even laced her opined declaration that the scientific debate is now over with some religious imagery, seemingly characterizing the “treacherous offenders” who remain skeptical or unconcerned about climate change as “sinners” deserving the hottest, innermost sections of Hell.
The time for debate has ended. Action is urgently needed. … In Dante’s Inferno, he describes the nine circles of Hell, each dedicated to different sorts of sinners, with the outermost being occupied by those who didn’t know any better, and the innermost reserved for the most treacherous offenders. I wonder where in the nine circles Dante would place all of us who are borrowing against this Earth in the name of economic growth, accumulating an environmental debt by burning fossil fuels, the consequences of which will be left for our children and grandchildren to bear? Let’s act now, to save the next generations from the consequences of the beyond-two-degree inferno.”
Apparently McNutt’s activist admonitions haven’t convinced scientists publishing papers in other journals that scientific debate about climate change is over.
The year isn’t even half over yet, and already there have been over 20 peer-reviewed papers published that confirm that the climate models relied upon by those advocating that the debate is over (a) do not match observations, (b) leave out important factors affecting climate, (c) don’t have predictive skill, (d) failed to simulate the warming “pause” or “hiatus” of the 21st century, (e) have large uncertainties and biases that impinge on their reliability, and/or (f) are based on assumptions that have been found to be wrong.
Here are some quick-hit examples of statements undermining the validity of climate models found in recently published papers:

“[C]onstraints are needed to guide model development and reduce uncertainty in estimates of the radiative forcing. Unfortunately, the preindustrial observations needed to constrain the sensitivities are not available.”
“[C]limate model runs … indicate no skill at replicating long-term temperature and precipitation changes.”
“This finding suggests that much work remains before we can model hydroclimate variability accurately.”
“The idea that the young Earth had a thicker atmosphere turns out to be wrong. … The results … reverse the commonly accepted idea that the early Earth had a thicker atmosphere to compensate for weaker sunlight.”
“There is this mismatch between what the climate models are producing and what the observations are showing … the rate of warming slowed down at a time when greenhouse-gas emissions were rising dramatically.” 
“Climate models, however, have large uncertainties in representing dehydration and cloud processes in the TTL [tropical tropopause layer], and thus their feedback with surface climate, prohibiting an accurate projection of future global and regional climate changes”
“They found that the wave-like movements of the mantle are occurring at a rate that is an order of magnitude faster than had been previously predicted.”

Perhaps the scientists who have the audacity to report on the considerable uncertainty and unreliability inherent in climate models — or the wrongness of their previously-held assumptions about the Earth-Atmosphere system — can be excused for their lack of understanding of “settled science.” After all, as Marcia McNutt declares, the debate is over; the climate models tell us so; it’s now time to act.
Fortunately, those scientists who “don’t know any better” about the debate being over may be able to escape to the outermost corridors of Hell rather than the innermost ones — where apparently it’s much, much hotter. That’s apparently where we can find those who don’t yet agree that the debate is over, and that activism is now science.
Obviously, there are valid and very substantial reasons why many are skeptical.
21 Papers From 2016
Below are 21 papers published so far in 2016 (through mid-June) that do not support the contention that climate modeling is “settled science,” or that the scientific debate is now over.

Three time series of average summer daily maximum temperature (TMax JJA) are developed for three interior regions of Alabama (AL) from stations with varying periods-of-record and unknown inhomogeneities. The time frame is 1883-2014. … Varying the parameters of the construction methodology creates 333 time series with a central trend-value based on the largest group of stations of -0.07 °C decade-1 with a best-guess estimate of measurement uncertainty being -0.12 to -0.02 °C decade-1. This best-guess result is insignificantly different (0.01 C decade-1) from a similar regional calculation using NOAA nClimDiv data beginning in 1895. … Finally, 77 CMIP-5 climate model runs are examined for Alabama and indicate no skill at replicating long-term temperature and precipitation changes since 1895.”
2. Fyfe et al., 2016
It has been claimed that the early-2000s global warming slowdown or hiatus, characterized by a reduced rate of global surface warming, has been overstated, lacks sound scientific basis, or is unsupported by observations. The evidence presented here contradicts these claims.”
 (press release):
There is this mismatch between what the climate models are producing and what the observations are showing,” says lead author John Fyfe, a climate modeller at the Canadian Centre for Climate Modelling and Analysis in Victoria, British Columbia. “We can’t ignore it.” … Susan Solomon, a climatologist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in Cambridge, says that Fyfe’s framework helps to put twenty-first-century trends into perspective, and clearly indicates that the rate of warming slowed down at a time when greenhouse-gas emissions were rising dramatically.“
3. Zhao et al., 2016
The authors demonstrate that model estimates of climate sensitivity can be strongly affected by the manner through which cumulus cloud condensate is converted into precipitation in a model’s convection parameterization, processes that are only crudely accounted for in GCMs. In particular, two commonly used methods for converting cumulus condensate into precipitation can lead to drastically different climate sensitivity, as estimated here with an atmosphere–land model by increasing sea surface temperatures uniformly and examining the response in the top-of-atmosphere energy balance. The effect can be quantified through a bulk convective detrainment efficiency, which measures the ability of cumulus convection to generate condensate per unit precipitation. The model differences, dominated by shortwave feedbacks, come from broad regimes ranging from large-scale ascent to subsidence regions. Given current uncertainties in representing convective precipitation microphysics and the current inability to find a clear observational constraint that favors one version of the authors’ model over the others, the implications of this ability to engineer climate sensitivity need to be considered when estimating the uncertainty in climate projections.”
4. Ljungqvist et al., 2016
We find a larger percentage of land area with relatively wetter conditions in the ninth to eleventh and the twentieth centuries, whereas drier conditions are more widespread between the twelfth and nineteenth centuries. Our reconstruction reveals that prominent seesaw patterns of alternating moisture regimes observed in instrumental data across the Mediterranean, western USA, and China have operated consistently over the past twelve centuries. …. [T]he intensification of the twentieth-century-mean hydroclimate anomalies in the simulations, as compared to previous centuries, is not supported by our new multi-proxy reconstruction. This finding suggests that much work remains before we can model hydroclimate variability accurately, and highlights the importance of using palaeoclimate data to place recent and predicted hydroclimate changes in a millennium-long context.”
Press release:
According to a new study, the Northern Hemisphere has experienced considerably larger variations in precipitation during the past twelve centuries than in the twentieth century. Researchers from Sweden, Germany, and Switzerland have found that climate models overestimated the increase in wet and dry extremes as temperatures increased during the twentieth century.”
5. Ghan et al., 2016
A large number of processes are involved in the chain from emissions of aerosol precursor gases and primary particles to impacts on cloud radiative forcing. … However, we are most interested in the radiative forcing since the preindustrial era. Because few relevant measurements are available from that era, relationships from recent variability have been assumed to be applicable to the preindustrial to present-day change. …
Given the diversity of the relationships, constraints are needed to guide model development and reduce uncertainty in estimates of the radiative forcing. Unfortunately, the preindustrial observations needed to constrain the sensitivities are not available. … One method would be to use recent trends in regions where emissions have changed substantially during the period when reliable measurements are available. For example, Cherian et al. used measurements of trends in the downward solar radiance at European sites from the period 1990–2005, when SO2 emissions declined threefold, to constrain global estimates of aerosol radiative forcing since the preindustrial era. Although such an analysis is highly informative, it does not provide guidance on removing biases in models that overestimate or underestimate the downward solar trend over Europe, which could be due to errors in any of the factors that produce the cloud radiative forcing change or the clear-sky change, as well as natural variability in cloud cover. Removing those biases is necessary if climate models are to be used for simulations of future climate change. Additional data characterizing each of the factors and components are needed. Some of the necessary data (L, re, aerosol optical depth) are available from 1990, but reliable estimates of Nd, τ, and R are not available for years before 2001, when the Earth Observing System satellite constellation was launched.”

The low agreement between models in simulating the impacts of solar variations on SAT in several regions suggests the different dynamical responses in these models, possibly associated with inaccurate parameterization of the processes related to solar forcing. Our analysis suggests that internal climate variability played a more significant role than external forcings in short-term SAT variability in the regions of the North Atlantic, the North Pacific, the Arctic, the Antarctic Peninsula, and its surrounding oceans. The possibility of long-term impacts of external forcings on SAT and the uncertainties that might be contained due to effects of internal climate modes other than El Niño–Southern Oscillation underscore the necessity for a more detailed understanding of the dynamical response of SAT to external forcings.”

The ocean has absorbed 41 per cent of all anthropogenic carbon emitted as a result of fossil fuel burning and cement manufacture. The magnitude and the large-scale distribution of the ocean carbon sink is well quantified for recent decades. In contrast, temporal changes in the oceanic carbon sink remain poorly understood. It has proved difficult to distinguish between air-to-sea carbon flux trends that are due to anthropogenic climate change and those due to internal climate variability. Here we use a modelling approach that allows for this separation, revealing how the ocean carbon sink may be expected to change throughout this century in different oceanic regions. Our findings suggest that, owing to large internal climate variability, it is unlikely that changes in the rate of anthropogenic carbon uptake can be directly observed in most oceanic regions at present, but that this may become possible between 2020 and 2050 in some regions.”

Irreducible uncertainty in near-term climate projections
Abstract: These results suggest that climate projections need to be performed with many more ensemble members than at present, using a range of ocean initial conditions, if the uncertainty in near-term regional climate is to be adequately quantified.
Summary and Discussion: The presence of initial condition uncertainty and non-linearity produces significant irreducible uncertainty in future regional climate changes. For trends of 20 years, the climate change signal rarely emerges from the noise of internal variability in FAMOUS. Uncertainty in future trends of temperature and precipitation reduce for longer trends as the initial condition uncertainty saturates.”

Map of flow within the Earth’s mantle finds the surface moving up and down ‘like a yo-yo’
Researchers have compiled the first global set of observations of the movement of the Earth’s mantle, the 3000-kilometre-thick layer of hot silicate rocks between the crust and the core, and have found that it looks very different to predictions made by geologists over the past 30 years. … They found that the wave-like movements of the mantle are occurring at a rate that is an order of magnitude faster than had been previously predicted. The results, reported in the journal Nature Geoscience, have ramifications across many disciplines including the study of ocean circulation and past climate change.”

Our data indicate a surprisingly low surface atmospheric pressure of Patm = 0.23 ± 0.23 (2σ) bar, and combined with previous studies suggests ~0.5 bar as an upper limit to late Archaean Patm. The result implies that the thin atmosphere was rich in auxiliary greenhouse gases and that Patm [surface atmospheric pressure] fluctuated over geologic time to a previously unrecognized extent.”

Early Earth’s air weighed less than half of today’s atmosphere
The idea that the young Earth had a thicker atmosphere turns out to be wrong. New research from the University of Washington uses bubbles trapped in 2.7 billion-year-old rocks to show that air at that time exerted at most half the pressure of today’s atmosphere. The results, published online May 9 in Nature Geoscience, reverse the commonly accepted idea that the early Earth had a thicker atmosphere to compensate for weaker sunlight. The finding also has implications for which gases were in that atmosphere, and how biology and climate worked on the early planet. […]
For the longest time, people have been thinking the atmospheric pressure might have been higher back then, because the sun was fainter,” said lead author Sanjoy Som, who did the work as part of his UW doctorate in Earth and space sciences. “Our result is the opposite of what we were expecting. […]
“We’re still coming to grips with the magnitude of this,” Buick said. “It’s going to take us a while to digest all the possible consequences.” Other geological evidence clearly shows liquid water on Earth at that time, so the early atmosphere must have contained more heat-trapping greenhouse gases, like methane and carbon dioxide, and less nitrogen.”
11. Harrison et al., 2016
Palaeoclimate assessment has demonstrated that changes in large-scale features of climate that are governed by the energy and water balance show consistent responses to changes in forcing in different climate states, and these consistent responses are reproduced by climate models. However, state-of-the-art models are still largely unable to reproduce observed changes in climate at a regional scale reliably. While palaeoclimate analyses of state-of-the-art climate models suggest an urgent need for model improvement, much work is also needed on extending and improving palaeoclimate reconstructions and quantifying and reducing both numerical and interpretative uncertainties.”
12. Lehner et al., 2016
Comparisons of the observed global-scale cooling following recent volcanic eruptions to that simulated by climate models from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project 5 (CMIP5) indicate that the models overestimate the magnitude of the global temperature response to volcanic eruptions. Here we show that this overestimation can be explained as a sampling issue, arising because all large eruptions since 1951 coincided with El Niño events, which cause global-scale warming that partially counteracts the volcanically induced cooling. By subsampling the CMIP5 models according to the observed El Niño–Southern Oscillation (ENSO) phase during each eruption, we find that the simulated global temperature response to volcanic forcing is consistent with observations. Volcanic eruptions pose a particular challenge for the detection and attribution methodology, as their surface impacts are short-lived and hence can be confounded by ENSO. Our results imply that detection and attribution studies must carefully consider sampling biases due to internal climate variability.”
Introduction: Estimates of the relative contributions by anthropogenic and natural forcings inform our attempts to constrain transient and equilibrium climate sensitivity [Collins et al., 2013]. Yet such attempts are inherently complicated by the fact that we observe only one of many possible climate trajectories. With internal variability contributing significantly to decadal-scale trends in certain quantities and regions, robust attribution of climate change can become challenging and sensitive to the particular realization of variability sampled in the observational record [Deser et al., 2012a].”
13. Rehfeld and Laepple, 2016
Temperatures in Asia, and globally, are very likely to increase with greenhouse gas emissions, but future projections of rainfall are far more uncertain. Here we investigate the linkage between temperature and precipitation in Asia on interannual to multicentennial timescales using instrumental data, late Holocene paleoclimate proxy data and climate model simulations. We find that in the instrumental and proxy data, the relationship between temperature and precipitation is timescale-dependent. While on annual to decadal timescales, negative correlations dominate and thus cool summers tend to be rainy summers, on longer timescales precipitation and temperature are positively correlated; cool centuries tend to be dryer centuries in monsoonal Asia. In contrast, the analyzed CMIP5/PMIP3 climate model simulations show a negative correlation between precipitation and temperature on all timescales. Although many uncertainties exist in the interpretation of the proxy data, there is consistency between them and the instrumental evidence. This, and the persistence of the result across independent proxy datasets, suggests that the climate model simulations might be considerably biased, overestimating the short-term negative associations between regional rainfall and temperature and lacking long-term positive relationships between them.”

Models suggest that climate change should weaken the AMOC as warmer Arctic temperatures, combined with buoyant freshwater from Greenland’s melting ice cap, impede the formation of deep currents. But so far, limited ocean measurements show the AMOC to be far more capricious than the models have been able to capture.”

An accurate assessment of the role of solar variability is a key step towards a proper quantification of natural and anthropogenic climate change. To this end, climate models have been extensively used to quantify the solar contribution to climate variability. However, owing to its large computational cost, the bulk of modeling studies to date have been performed without interactive stratospheric photochemistry: the impact of this simplification on the modeled climate system response to solar forcing remains largely unknown. Here we quantify this impact, by comparing the response of two model configurations, with and without interactive ozone chemistry. Using long integrations, we first obtain robust surface temperature and precipitation responses to an idealized irradiance increase. Then, we show that the inclusion of interactive stratospheric chemistry significantly reduces the surface warming (by about one third) and the accompanying precipitation response. This behavior is linked to photochemically-induced stratospheric ozone changes, and their modulation of the surface solar radiation. Our results suggest that neglecting stratospheric photochemistry leads to a sizable overestimate of the surface response to changes in solar irradiance. This has implications for simulations of the climate in the Last Millennium and geoengineering applications employing irradiance changes larger than those observed over the 11-year sunspot cycle, where models often use simplified treatments of stratospheric ozone that are inconsistent with the imposed solar forcing.”

Aerosol–cloud interactions are considered a key uncertainty in our understanding of climate change (Boucher et al., 2013). Knowledge of the global abundance of cloud condensation nuclei (CCN) is fundamental to determine the strength of the anthropogenic climate perturbation. Direct measurements are limited and sample only a very small fraction of the globe so that remote sensing from satellites and ground-based instruments is widely used as a proxy for cloud condensation nuclei (Nakajima et al., 2001; Andreae, 2009; Clarke and Kapustin, 2010; Boucher et al., 2013). However, the underlying assumptions cannot be robustly tested with the small number of measurements available so that no reliable global estimate of cloud condensation nuclei exists. This study overcomes this limitation using a self-consistent global model (ECHAM-HAM) of aerosol radiative properties and cloud condensation nuclei. An analysis of the correlation of simulated aerosol radiative properties and cloud condensation nuclei reveals that common assumptions about their relationships are violated for a significant fraction of the globe: 71 % of the area of the globe shows correlation coefficients between CCN0.2 % at cloud base and aerosol optical depth (AOD) below 0.5, i.e. AOD variability explains only 25 % of the CCN variance. This has significant implications for satellite based studies of aerosol–cloud interactions. The findings also suggest that vertically resolved remote-sensing techniques, such as satellite-based high spectral resolution lidars, have a large potential for global monitoring of cloud condensation nuclei.”

The early twentieth century Arctic warming (ETCAW) between 1920 and 1940 is an exceptional feature of climate variability in the last century. Its warming rate was only recently matched by recent warming in the region. Unlike recent warming largely attributable to anthropogenic radiative forcing, atmospheric warming during the ETCAW was strongest in the mid-troposphere and is believed to be triggered by an exceptional case of natural climate variability. Nevertheless, ultimate mechanisms and causes for the ETCAW are still under discussion. Here we use state of the art multi-member global circulation models, reanalysis and reconstruction datasets to investigate the internal atmospheric dynamics of the ETCAW. We investigate the role of boreal winter mid-tropospheric heat transport and circulation in providing the energy for the large scale warming. Analyzing sensible heat flux components and regional differences, climate models are not able to reproduce the heat flux evolution found in reanalysis and reconstruction datasets. These datasets show an increase of stationary eddy heat flux and a decrease of transient eddy heat flux during the ETCAW. Moreover, tropospheric circulation analysis reveals the important role of both the Atlantic and the Pacific sectors in the convergence of southerly air masses into the Arctic during the warming event. Subsequently, it is suggested that the internal dynamics of the atmosphere played a major role in the formation in the ETCAW.”

Cirrus clouds in the tropical tropopause layer (TTL) and water vapor transported into the stratosphere have significant impacts on the global radiation budget and circulation patterns. Climate models, however, have large uncertainties in representing dehydration and cloud processes in the TTL, and thus their feedback with surface climate, prohibiting an accurate projection of future global and regional climate changes. Here, we use unprecedented airborne measurements over the Pacific to reveal atmospheric waves as a strong modulator of ice clouds in the TTL. Wave-induced cold and/or cooling conditions are shown to exert a nearly ubiquitous influence on cirrus cloud occurrence at altitudes of 14-18 km, except when air was very recently influenced by convective hydration. We further observe that various vertical scales of cloud layers are associated with various vertical scales of waves, suggesting the importance of representing TTL waves in models.”

[T]here are still large [uncertainties] in current observational and meteorological reanalysis datasets, so accurate quantification of the influence of solar flux variability on the climate system remains an open scientific question.”

The large heat capacity of the ocean as compared to the atmosphere provides a memory in the climate system that might have the potential for skilful climate predictions a few years ahead. However, experiments so far have only found limited predictability after accounting for the deterministic forcing signal provided by increased greenhouse gas concentrations. One of the problems is the drift that occurs when the model moves away from the initial conditions towards its own climate. This drift is often larger than the decadal signal to be predicted. In this paper we describe the drift occurring in the North Atlantic Ocean in the EC-Earth climate model and relate it to the lack of decadal predictability in that region. While this drift may be resolution dependent and disappear in higher resolution models, we identify a second reason for the low predictability. A subsurface heat content anomaly can only influence de atmosphere if (deep) convection couples it to the surface, but the occurrence of deep convection events is random and probably mainly determined by unpredictable atmospheric noise.“
21. Rugenstein et al., 2016
The ocean dominates the planetary heat budget and takes thousands of years to equilibrate to perturbed surface conditions, yet those long time scales are poorly understood. Here we analyze the ocean response over a range of forcing levels and time scales in a climate model of intermediate complexity and in the CMIP5 model suite. We show that on century to millennia time scales the response time scales, regions of anomalous ocean heat storage, and global thermal expansion depend non-linearly on the forcing level and surface warming. As a consequence, it is problematic to deduce long term from short term heat uptake or scale the heat uptake patterns between scenarios. These results also question simple methods to estimate long term sea level rise from surface temperatures, and the use of deep sea proxies to represent surface temperature changes in past climate.”

"A global campaign encouraging individuals, organisations and institutional investors to sell off investments in fossil fuel companies is gathering pace. According to 350.org, US$11 trillion has already been divested worldwide. But, while it may seem a logical strategy, divestment will not lower demand for fossil fuels, which is the key to reducing greenhouse gas emissions. In fact, it may even cause emissions to rise. At first sight, the argument for divestment seems straightforward. Fossil fuel companies are the main contributors to the majority of CO₂ emissions causing global warming. Twenty fossil fuel companies alone have contributed 35% of all energy-related carbon dioxide and methane emissions since 1965. The argument goes that squeezing the flow of investment into fossil fuel companies will either bring their demise, or force them to drastically transform their business models. It makes sense for investors, too, as they avoid the risk of holding “stranded assets” – fossil fuel reserves that will become worthless as they can no longer be exploited. For companies heavily invested in coal – the most polluting fossil fuel – this rings true. Although new coal plants are still being constructed in countries such as China, India and Indonesia, predictions by major energy agencies and industry alike indicate a steep decline in its contribution to the global energy supply. With cleaner alternatives readily available, coal is no longer considered a safe long-term investment – and widespread divestment will only add to this sentiment. When it comes to oil and natural gas, however, the picture looks quite different. Oil is used for a much wider range of products and processes than is coal, while the cleaner reputation of natural gas gives it significant appeal as a “bridge fuel” to a zero carbon economy, whether rightly or not. As a result, the push for oil and gas divestment is likely to have unintended consequences. The primary targets of the divestment movement are international oil companies (IOCs) – private corporations that are headquartered in Western countries and listed on public stock exchanges. ExxonMobil, Chevron, Royal Dutch Shell, BP, and Total are among the private oil “supermajors”. Recent research suggests that divestment can reduce the flow of investment into these companies. But even if the divestment movement were successful in reducing the economic power of these companies, IOCs currently only produce about 10% of the world’s oil. The rest is mostly produced by national oil companies (NOCs) – state-owned behemoths such as Saudi Aramco, National Iranian Oil Company, China National Petroleum Corporation and Petroleos de Venezuela, located mostly in low and middle income countries. Given that NOCs are less transparent about their operations than are IOCs, and that many of them are also headquartered in authoritarian countries, they are less exposed to pressure from civil society. As a result, they are “dangerously under-scrutinised”, according to the Natural Resource Governance Institute. As they are state-owned, they are also not directly exposed to pressure from shareholders. Even the imminent public listing of Saudi Aramco will only offer 1.5% of the company, and this will mainly come from domestic and emerging markets, which tend to impose much less pressure to value environmental issues. Environmental groups have urged Western multinational banks not to invest in the Saudi company.

      Saudi Aramco's $1.5 trillion IPO flies in the face of climate reality


 This means that while global demand for natural gas and oil is still rising, and investments are insufficient to meet future demand, divestment pressures are unlikely to impact the business plans of NOCs. As a result, instead of reducing global fossil fuel production, the divestment movement will simply force IOCs to cede market share to NOCs. If anything, this would cause CO₂ emissions to rise. The carbon footprints of NOCs per unit of fuel produced are on average bigger than those of IOCs. IOCs are also generally better placed and more willing than are NOCs to reduce the carbon intensity of their products and support the transition to renewable energy. They have, for example, led the way among oil companies in research into capturing and storing carbon, even if results have so far proven elusive. In a nutshell, the divestment movement will not reduce demand for oil and gas. It will transfer the supply of fossil fuel to companies that are more polluting, less transparent, less sensitive to societal pressures, and less committed to addressing the climate crisis. The divestment movement is understandably enjoying widespread appeal in a time of climate emergency. But by targeting the low-hanging fruit that are IOCs, the movement misses the more complex question of how to actually reduce the global demand for fossil fuels.  To achieve that goal, we’d be better off creating a regulatory environment that forces both IOCs and NOCs to redirect their energies. For example, eliminating fossil fuel subsidies and putting a price on carbon would make heavily investing in renewables – already cheaper to produce than fossil fuels – more attractive for all energy companies.  Such changes could also generate nearly US$3 trillion by 2030 for governments worldwide. These funds could be used to massively scale up renewables, prioritise the development of energy storage to address the intermittent nature of such power, and improve energy efficiency in industry, transport and housing – which will make fossil fuels increasingly redundant. While IOCs now produce much less fossil fuel than they used to, they still have a huge amount of expertise that could be applied to the energy transition. In my view, rather than transferring power to less environmentally conscious NOCs, we should make use of them. As for those with shares in fossil fuel companies: exercise your powers as a shareholder to pressure them to support the energy transition as constructively and ethically as possible.

Guest essay by Dr. Norman Page

 1.  Introduction
Dr. Leif Svalgaard said in a comment on a WUWT post:
August 17, 2015 at 2:27 pm     

“If you cannot explain your finding to an [attentive] eight-year old, you don’t understand it yourself.”


I agree entirely.

Miriam – Webster defines Epistemology as


” the study or a theory of the nature and grounds of knowledge especially with reference to its limits and validity “



2.  Granddaughter – You asked – Is the world going to burn up and how do we know?
Ava – Lets  think about when  the temperature is warmer and colder outside. It is hotter when the sun shines during the day and colder at night when our part of the earth is turned away from the sun .You know already that it takes 24 hours for the earth to turn around once to make what we call a cycle from warm to cold and back again.
You also know that it is much hotter in summer than winter and that is because the sun shines longer   and is higher in the sky in summer than in winter. Each year there is a cycle  from warm to cold and back again which takes 365 days.Scientists have  measured or estimated in various ways what the earth’s temperature was  back for hundreds and thousands of years and  can see that there are other hot – cold cycles. Two of the most important ones have cycle lengths of about 60 and 1000 years. Here is a picture showing some of the 1000 year cycles.

Fig 1 (http://www.climate4you.com/)  -(See Humlum’s overview section)




To know what is going to happen in the future we first  have to know where the earth is in the 1000 year temperature cycle. Here is another picture that shows what the temperatures were in the northern part of the earth over the last 2000 years. Look especially at what happened during the last 1000 years.

Fig 2  http://www.clim-past.net/8/765/2012/cp-8-765-2012.pdf




See the warm peak at the year 1000 – then look where we are now at the right hand side of the picture. You can see that the earth is just getting near to, is just at or just past the peak warmth of a 1000 year cycle.
How can we tell which it is. We know that the amount of sunshine which reaches our bit of the earth often changes the temperature by tens of degrees between night and day and as much as 100 degrees sometimes between cold winter nights and the hottest summer days. We also know that the sun itself puts out more energy and its magnetic field is stronger at the activity peaks of its various  cycles.
What is the sun doing now? Here is a picture that shows us what has been going on.
You can see that sun itself also has cycles of activity of 11-12 years in length. When the red line gets nearer to the bottom of the picture the sun is more active, its magnetic field is stronger and fewer Galactic Cosmic Rays hit the earth.


Fig 3 ( http://cosmicrays.oulu.fi/       )



You can see that  solar activity was increasing , that is, the red line  got closer to the bottom of the picture, in each cycle until about 1991 and that the solar  cycle peaks and lows since then are closer to the top of the picture showing a decline in solar activity. This suggests that the 1000 year peak in solar activity may  now be behind us in about 1991.
Because it takes some time for the oceans to warm up and cool down, there is a delay before  the peak in solar activity  shows itself in the earth’s temperature. The best measure we have of global temperatures is made by satellites. Here is a picture of how temperatures have changed in the satellite age.

Fig 4


You  can see how the 1991 peak in solar activity in Fig 3 shows up in the peak in the average global temperatures  ( the green rising  and blue- falling lines) about 12 years later  at 2003 in Fig 4. and that the earth has been cooling slightly since then just as the solar activity declined from 1991 to today.

Ava – you ask.- What about the future.?
Well the simplest and most likely  guess for starters  is that the 1000 year cycle from 2003 – 3003 will have a temperature curve whose general shape is similar to the cycle from 1000 – 2003. see  Fig 2 .
If you look at that Figure again you can see that the Northern Hemisphere average temperature cooled by a bit under 2 degrees from 1000 to about 1635 so that we might expect a similar cooling from 2003 to 2638 – of course with various ups and downs along the way .
The warm peak at about 1000 was a good time for people when the Vikings were able to live  in Greenland.  Harvests  were good and  people in Europe had time  and money to spare to start building cathedrals  The cold period around 1635 – to 1700 is called the Maunder Minimum when the Sun was so quiet that the Sun  spots disappeared. Most people living before about 1850 grew their own food. Before then, if  just a few extra- cold years followed one after the other, millions of people starved to death because their harvests failed.
Man made CO2 had no effect on these temperature changes. In fact President Obama is very wrong to call CO2 a pollutant. It is the absolutely essential plant food. Without it life as we know it could not exist. Plants grow better as CO2 increases. About 25% of the increase in food production in the 20th century was due simply to the increase in CO2 in those years –  a great benefit to mankind.

Ava asks – the blue line is almost flat. – When will we know for sure that we are on the down slope of the thousand year cycle and heading towards another Little Ice Age.

Grandpa says- I’m glad to see that you have developed an early interest in Epistemology. Remember ,I mentioned the 60 year cycle, well, the data shows that the temperature peak in 2003 was close to a peak in both that cycle and the 1000 year cycle. If we are now on the downslope of the 1000 year cycle then the next peak in the 60 year cycle at about 2063 should be lower than the 2003 peak and the next 60 year peak after that  at about 2123 should be lower again, so, by that time ,if the peak  is lower,  we will be pretty sure that we are on our way to the next little ice age.
 That is a long time to wait, but we will get some useful  clues a long time before that.Look again at the red curve in  Fig 3 – you can see that from the beginning of 2007 to the end of 2009 solar activity dropped to the lowest it has been for a long time. Remember the 12 year delay between the 1991 solar activity peak and the 2003 temperature peak, if there is a similar delay in the response to lower solar activity , earth  should see a cold spell from  2019 to 2021 when you will be in Middle School.
It should  also be noticeably cooler at the coolest part of the 60 year cycle – halfway through  the present 60 year cycle at about 2033.
We can watch for these things to happen but meanwhile  keep in mind that the overall cyclic trends can be  disturbed  for a time in some years  by the El Nino weather patterns in the Pacific and the associated high temperatures that we see in for example  1998 and 2010  (fig 2) and that we might see  before the end of this year- 2015.

3. Ava says -It looks like the Earth is going to cool down- Why is my teacher and  President Obama saying the earth is going to get very hot and the Polar Bears are all going to die
unless I walk to school ?

Well Ava – I would have to write a book to explain how so many different people came to be so wrong for so long about so much- sometimes with the best of intentions. Here is a short story telling what happened.
In 1968 a man called Ehrlich published a book called the Population Bomb. He thought the number of people on earth was growing so fast that there soon wouldn’t be enough food to feed everybody, He said in the book.
“ In the 1970s hundreds of millions of people will starve to death in spite of any crash programs embarked upon now. At this late date nothing can prevent a substantial increase in the world death rate” 
Some people at the time got very worried and put their guesses about such things as future population growth, food production ,oil supplies, industrial production and mineral reserves into a computer program.. They intended to look at possible future problems and also  explore the possibility  that the peoples and governments of the earth could agree on a way of running the worlds economy  that could besustainable, that is, go on for a long time. They put all this in a book called The Limits to Growth published in 1972.
 A very energetic business man called Maurice Strong who knew a lot of very influential people persuaded the United Nations that, as he himself believed and indeed still strongly believes,  this sustainability problem was very serious.The UN and Sweden organized a meeting in 1972 in Stockholm to discus the interaction of humans with the environment. Strong was appointed  by his UN friend U Thant , to be  the General Secretary of the meeting. Strong,  by nature, is very determined and action oriented and he and the conference produced an incredibly detailed 109 point  action plan designed to give the UN input and even control over individual Government environmental  policies world wide. As  one of the actions, the United Nations Environmental Program  ( UNEP) was organized in 1973 with Mr Strong himself as Executive Director.
Ten years later it was obvious that the predictions of imminent death and disaster were wrong. The people at UNEP still wanted to take global control of the worlds economy. They realized that if they could show that the CO2 ( carbon dioxide) produced by burning coal and oil to make electricity and drive our cars might cause a dangerous warming of the earth they would  be able to scare the Governments and people into writing laws giving the UN ( and them) control over the world’s economy by controlling the type of energy used and its price.
UNEP organized a meeting of scientists at a place called Villach in Austria in 1985 to see if they could show that CO2 was dangerous. The scientists said

“Although the observed global-scale warming experienced over the past ~100 years is compatible with model estimates of the magnitude of the greenhouse effect, unequivocal, statistically convincing detection of the effects of changing CO2 and trace gas levels on climate is not yet possible. An important problem in the positive identification of a greenhouse gas effect on climate is to explain the medium to long time scale (~decades or more) fluctuations in the past record. Attempts to model such changes have, to date, suffered from a number of deficiencies.”

Ava – In other words they couldn’t prove  any effects of man made  CO2 on climate.

But whoever  wrote the official summary statement and recommendations said:

“As a result of the increasing concentrations of greenhouse gases, it is now believed that in the first half of the next century a rise of global mean temperature could occur which is greater than any in man’s history. “

The report made two important recommendations. As a result of one ,the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change was set up to select from the  evidence and from time to time produce reports which would show that CO2 was the main driver of dangerous climate change and a second recommendation resulted in a meeting in Rio in 1992 chaired by Maurice Strong himself which produced the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change , later signed by 196 governments.
The objective of the treaty is to keep greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere at a level that they guessed  would prevent dangerous man made  interference with the climate system.
This treaty is really a comprehensive, politically driven, political action plan called Agenda 21 designed to produce a centrally managed global society which would control every aspect of the life of every one on earth.
It says :
“The Parties should take precautionary measures to anticipate, prevent or minimize the
causes of climate change and mitigate its adverse effects. Where there are threats of serious or
irreversible damage, lack of full scientific certainty should not be used as a reason for postponing
such measures”

In other words if the models show there  is even a small chance of very bad things happening the Governments who signed the treaty should act now  to stop it. But how good are the  computer Models?
The successive five  reports of the IPCC  in the Summaries for Policymakers written by Government representatives  have clamed increasing certainty for the outcomes of their Model based projections  of future temperature which is not supported by  the Science sections of the reports or the actual data.
Remember the Villach meeting said
 “in the first half of the next century a rise of global mean temperature could occur which is greater than any in man’s history.”
All the models and projections made since 1985  were built in the assumption that CO2 was the main climate change driver- for that and for many other reasons they are in reality useless for forecasting future temperatures.
Here is a picture of what really happened as CO2 levels rose rapidly in the 21st century





As you can see there has been no global warming at all since about 1997.

The climate models on which the entire Catastrophic Global Warming delusion rests are built without regard to the natural 60 and more importantly 1000 year cycles so obvious in the temperature record. The modelers  approach is simply a scientific disaster and lacks even average commonsense .It is exactly like taking the temperature trend from say Feb – July and projecting it ahead linearly for 20 years or so. They back tune their models for less than 100 years when the relevant time scale is millennial. This is scientific malfeasance on a grand scale.
 The temperature  projections of the IPCC –  UK Met office models and all the impact studies which derive from them have no solid foundation in empirical science being derived from inherently useless and specifically structurally flawed models. They provide no basis for the discussion of future climate trends and represent an enormous waste of time and money.  As a foundation for Governmental climate and energy policy their forecasts are already seen to be grossly in error and are therefore worse than useless.
 Here is a picture which shows the sort of  thing  they did when they projected a cyclic trend in a straight line..



 

 A new forecasting method needs to be adopted. For forecasts of the timing and extent of the coming cooling based on the natural solar activity cycles – most importantly the millennial cycle – and using the neutron count and 10Be record as the most useful proxy for solar activity check my blog-post at
 http://climatesense-norpag.blogspot.com/2014/07/climate-forecasting-methods-and-cooling.html
(Section 1 has a complete discussion of the uselessness of the climate models.)

“In the Novum Organum (the new instrumentality for the acquisition of knowledge) Francis Bacon classified the intellectual fallacies of his time under four headings which he called idols. The fourth of these were described as :
Idols of the Theater are those which are due to sophistry and false learning. These idols are built up in the field of theology, philosophy, and science, and because they are defended by learned groups are accepted without question by the masses. When false philosophies have been cultivated and have attained a wide sphere of dominion in the world of the intellect they are no longer questioned. False superstructures are raised on false foundations, and in the end systems barren of merit parade their grandeur on the stage of the world.”
Climate science has fallen victim to this fourth type of idol.

Share this...FacebookTwitterAccording to the IPCC (2013),  global sea levels rose by less than two-tenths of a meter (0.19 m) between 1901 and 2010.  Considering the scientific record of long-term sea level trends from locations across the globe, this small <0.2 m change in sea levels over the course of the last 110 years does not even fall outside the range of natural variability.
Sea levels have commonly risen and fallen at amplitudes much greater than two-tenths of a meter.   As Harris et al. (2015)  confirm, “relative sea-level variations of ∼1 m were common throughout the Holocene.”
For example, consider Bracco et al. (2014).  These scientists found that sea levels along the coasts of South America were a full 4 meters higher than they are now between 5,500 and 6,000 years ago.  Then, over the course of just a 400-year time span  (between 4,700 -4,300 years ago), sea levels dropped by a full 3 meters (to +1 meter above today’s levels), then rose by 2 meters (to +3 meters above today’s levels), and then fell to current levels after 4,300 years ago.   Here’s what these long-term sea-level oscillations look like graphed (Fig. 5):

These rapid variations in sea levels pose critical explanatory problems for advocates of the AGW (anthropogenic global warming) supposition that human CO2 emissions, and not internal Earth-system dynamics, are what drive sea level changes.  Specifically, AGW advocates presume that rising CO2 concentrations cause sea levels to rise (and lowering CO2 concentrations cause sea levels to fall).  A large volume of rapidly accumulating scientific evidence not only does not support this CO2-rise-causes-sea-level-rise supposition, it suggests that a long-term  inverse correlation could just as easily be formulated: As CO2 rises, sea levels decline.
To illustrate this, consider the Bracco et al. (2014) graph above depicting meters-per-century variations in sea levels with the corresponding CO2 concentration recorded for each period.   Notice that the highstand period (5,000 to 6,000 years ago) had lower concentrations of CO2 than the following millennia that subsequently had higher CO2 concentrations.  Also, consider that there was no significant change in CO2 levels during the 400 years of rapid sea level changes.  Finally, notice that the last 200 years of sea level changes (if there have been any) are undetectable on this scale at this location even though CO2 concentrations were rising from 280 ppm to 400 ppm during this period.

And this isn’t just true for the coasts of South America.  In the peer-reviewed scientific literature, a non-correlation — or inverse correlation — for CO2 and sea level (as CO2 rises, sea levels fall) has been reported by scientists for dozens of locations across the globe just in the last few years alone.  Graphs (with CO2 ppm concentrations, text, and arrows added) for a few other locations are shown below.
Prieto et al., 2016  (Argentina, Uruguay)

Dura et al., 2016  (Vancouver Island)

Kench et al., 2014  (central Pacific Ocean)

But not only is the CO2-rise-causes-sea-level-rise AGW supposition dubious, so is the entire paradigm of an alarming and catastrophic human-caused sea-level rise future.
Consider Bangladesh.   According to Rashid et al. (2013), the mean sea level was “at least 4.5 to 5 m higher” 6,000 years ago than it is today.  At that time, CO2 levels ranged close to 265 ppm, or 135 ppm lower than today’s 400 ppm.   Not only that, but for the last 1,500 years, there has been no noticeable difference in the shoreline near Bangladesh — despite the rapidly rising CO2 levels during this period.

Rashid et al., 2013  (Bangladesh)
“[T]he highest RSL [relative sea level] transgression in Bangladesh at approximately 6000 cal BP, being at least 4.5 to 5 m higher than the modern m.s.l. [mean sea level]  After this phase, the relative sea level started to fall, and consequently, a freshwater peat developed at approximately 5980–5700 cal BP. The abundant mangrove pollens in the salt-marsh succession shows the regression at approximately 5500 cal BP, when it was 1–2 m higher than the modern sea level. The curve indicates that at approximately 5000 cal BP and onwards, the RSL started to fall towards its present position, and the present shoreline of Bangladesh was established at approximately 1500 cal BP and has not noticeably migrated inland since.”
—
It was recently pointed out that there are 4 newly published papers confirming that natural variability largely explains recent sea level fluctuations, not anthropogenic CO2 emissions.    Scientists also continue to publish papers (about 30 are compiled here) that indicate relative sea levels across the globe were often meters higher than they are now as recently as a few thousand years ago . . . when CO2 concentrations were much lower and anthropogenic CO2 emissions were non-existent.
In sum, scientists are increasingly finding that is difficult to even detect an anthropogenic signal in the noise of strong natural sea level variability spanning decades to millennia.  So at what point did it become “settled science” or “basic physics” that raising or lowering CO2 concentrations cause sea levels to rise or fall?
—
Prieto et al., 2016  (Argentina, Uruguay)
“Analysis of the RSL [relative sea level] database revealed that the RSL [relative sea level] rose to reach the present level at or before c. 7000 cal yr BP, with the peak of the sea-level highstand c. +4 m [above present] between c. 6000 and 5500 cal yr BP (depending on the statistical method used) or at c. 7000 cal yr BP according to the ICE-6G model prediction, gradually falling after this time to the present position … Particularly for the Río de la Plata (RDP), a Holocene RSL curve was presented by Cavallotto et al. (2004) based on 14 uncalibrated 14C ages from selected samples from the southwestern coast of the RDP (Argentina). This RSL curve was re-plotted by Gyllencreutz et al. (2010) using the same index points and qualitative approach but using the calibrated ages. It shows rising sea-levels following the Last Glacial Termination (LGT), reaching a RSL [relative sea level] maximum of +6.5 m above present at c. 6500 cal yr BP, followed by a stepped regressive trend towards the present (Fig. 2a).”
—
Dura et al., 2016  (Vancouver Island)
“In northern and western Sumatra, GIA models predict high rates (>5 mm/year) of RSL [relative sea level] rise from ∼12 to ∼7 ka, followed by slowing rates of rise (<1 mm/year) to an RSL [relative sea level] highstand of <1 m (northern Sumatra) and ∼3 m (western Sumatra) between 6 and 3 ka [6,000-3,000 years ago], and then gradual (<1 mm/ year) RSL fall until present (Fig. 7a, b).”
—
Sander et al., 2016  (Denmark)
“Results: The data shows a period of RSL[relative sea level] highstand at c. 2.2 m above present MSL [mean sea level] between c. 5.0 and 4.0 ka BP [5,000 to 4,000 years before present] .After that, RSL drops by c. 1.3 m between c. 4.0 and 3.4 ka BP to an elevation roughly 1 m above present MSL. Since then, RSL has been falling at more or less even rates.”

Lee et al., 2016  (Southeast Australia)
“The configuration suggests surface inundation of the upper sediments by marine water during the mid-Holocene (c. 2–8 kyr BP), when sea level was 1–2 m above today’s level.”
—
Yokoyama et al., 2016  (Japan)
“The Holocene-high-stand (HHS) inferred from oyster fossils (Saccostrea echinata and Saccostrea malaboensis) is 2.7 m [above present sea level] at ca. 3500 years ago, after which sea level gradually fell to present level.”

Long et al., 2016  (Scotland)
“RSL [relative sea level] data from Loch Eriboll and the Wick River Valley show that RSL [relative sea level] was <1 m above present for several thousand years during the mid and late Holocene before it fell to present.”

May et al., 2016  (Western Australia)
“Beach ridge evolution over a millennial time scale is also indicated by the landward rise of the sequence possibly corresponding to the mid-Holocene sea-level highstand of WA [Western Australia] of at least 1-2 m above present mean sea level.”
—
Haghani et al., 2016  (Caspian Sea)
“Caspian Sea (CS) water level has fluctuated repeatedly with an amplitude of larger than 25m during the Holocene without any link with the eustatic sea level. …. The data from the Langarud sequence indicate that the CSL [Caspian Sea level] rose to at least −21.44m during that time (i.e. >6m higher than at present), as Langarud was probably not on the shore itself but was affected by distal brackish water flooding. This result is in line with historical findings about the CSL high-stand during the 14th and the early 15th centuries.  … This massive brackish water invasion would have caused a serious disruption to food supply to Persia.”

“In North Island locations the early-Holocene sea-level highstand was quite pronounced, with RSL [relative sea level] up to 2.75 m higher than present. In the South Island the onset of highstand conditions was later, with the first attainment of PMSL being between 7000–6400 cal yr BP. In the mid-Holocene the northern North Island experienced the largest sea-level highstand, with RSL up to 3.00 m higher than present.”

“West Texas Pumpjack” by Eric Kounce TexasRaiser – Located south of Midland, Texas.
Guest essay by Eric Worrall
President Obama, on the eve of a 3 day flying tour of Alaska, to highlight the effects of global warming, has been forced to defend his decision to allow drilling for oil in the Arctic.
According to Obama;
“Our economy still has to rely on oil and gas. As long as that’s the case, I believe we should rely more on domestic production than on foreign imports.”
Read more: http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/aug/29/obama-arctic-drilling-alaska-trip-climate-change
However, green groups have gone on the attack, accusing Obama of hypocrisy, and of undermining his own global warming vision (same article).
“There is a very obvious contradiction between meaningful action to address climate change and continued exploration for remote and difficult hydrocarbon resources,” said Michael LeVine, Arctic campaigner for Oceana.
“Moving forward with exploiting Arctic oil and gas is inconsistent with the Administration’s stated goal and meaningful action on climate change.”
Credo, another campaign group, accused Obama of “self-defeating hypocrisy”.
In my opinion, Green groups are once again demonstrating that there is no compromise with fanaticism. Either you support every line item of their radical agenda, or they treat you as the enemy. By any reasonable metric, President Obama is the best friend green groups have ever had in the White House. Yet rather than recognise that President Obama is a green president, environmental groups are on the attack, because Obama has not fulfilled every one of their economically destructive and environmentally pointless demands.

"WASHINGTON  —   President Trump plans to open a dialogue with Russia on Saturday that could lead to lifting American sanctions, even as Britain’s visiting prime minister and leading senators from his own party urged him not to let up the pressure on the Kremlin until it reverses its armed intervention in Ukraine. In what will be their first conversation since Mr. Trump took office, he and President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia intended to talk by telephone on Saturday about areas of possible cooperation, particularly in fighting terrorism in the Middle East, a collaboration that would represent a significant turnabout from years of friction between the two countries. At the direction of the White House, American officials in recent days have been preparing memos outlining possible common ground, including the prospect of removing some or all of the sanctions imposed by former President Barack Obama, according to officials briefed on the matter. Mr. Trump has suggested lifting the punitive measures in exchange for nuclear arms cuts and Russian cooperation in fighting the Islamic State. Asked about sanctions on Friday, Mr. Trump played down the possibility of quick action, but did not rule it out. “As for sanctions, very early to be talking about that,” Mr. Trump said Friday at a White House news conference with Prime Minister Theresa May of Britain. “But we look to have a great relationship with all countries, ideally. ” As for Mr. Putin, he offered a far more distant assessment after months of praising the Russian president for his leadership. “I don’t know the gentleman,” Mr. Trump said. “I hope we have a fantastic relationship. That’s possible, and it’s also possible that we won’t. We will see what happens. ” Standing at Mr. Trump’s side, Mrs. May warned against easing sanctions unless Russia abides by a peace settlement for Ukraine negotiated in Minsk, the capital of Belarus. “We believe the sanctions should continue until we see that Minsk Agreement fully implemented, and we’ve been continuing to argue that inside the European Union,” she said. Any talk of lifting sanctions is all but certain to spark the first serious conflagration between Mr. Trump and congressional Republicans, who have largely given the president a pass on myriad policy areas where they disagree. Republican lawmakers have been bracing for Mr. Trump to make this move, and their concerns deepened Friday when his counselor, Kellyanne Conway, said in an interview that removing sanctions was under consideration. Senator John McCain of Arizona warned Mr. Trump on Friday against lifting sanctions and vowed to push legislation reinstating them if he does, a measure that already has strong bipartisan support, including from Republicans like Senators Rob Portman of Ohio and Ben Sasse of Nebraska. Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the majority leader, who has largely shunned confrontation with Mr. Trump, has been a longstanding opponent of lifting sanctions, a position he forcefully reiterated on Friday. In a scathing statement against Mr. Putin, Mr. McCain cataloged all of Russia’s controversial actions in Ukraine, Syria and elsewhere and said it could not be trusted as a partner. “President Trump should remember this when he speaks to Vladimir Putin,” Mr. McCain said. “He should remember that the man on the other end of the line is a murderer and a thug who seeks to undermine American national security interests at every turn. For our commander in chief to think otherwise would be naïve and dangerous. ” Mr. Portman concurred, saying in a statement, “We must stand by our allies in the region, including Ukraine. ” Mr. Trump’s meeting with Mrs. May was his first with a visiting foreign leader since taking office with a promise to pursue an “America First” foreign policy. For Mr. Trump, it was a debut on the world stage that took on additional meaning after a scheduled White House visit by Mexico’s president next week fell apart in a dispute over the border wall Mr. Trump wants to build. Mr. Trump appeared comfortable and confident with Mrs. May standing to his right. He offered a brief opening statement that referred twice to the “special relationship” between the two countries, a phrase Britons take seriously. He offered crisp answers, in contrast to Mr. Obama, who tended to talk at length. While Mr. Trump did not demonstrate detailed policy knowledge, he went out of his way to emphasize commonalities with Mrs. May. He also tried to reassure Europeans who view him with deep skepticism. When a British reporter referred to him as a “brash TV extrovert,” Mr. Trump replied, “Actually, I’m not as brash as you might think. ” Mrs. May, eager to forge a relationship with him akin to Margaret Thatcher’s alliance with Ronald Reagan, reciprocated the warm sentiments, praising his “stunning election victory” and conveying an invitation from Queen Elizabeth II for the president to make a state visit, which he accepted. Addressing one area of disagreement, Mrs. May said that the president had privately expressed his support for NATO, despite past comments disparaging the alliance as “obsolete. ” “Mr. President,” she said, “I think you said, you confirmed that you’re 100 percent behind NATO. ” Mr. Trump embraced the decision by British voters to exit the European Union, a referendum known as “Brexit” that he and others have seen as a precursor to his own election. “I think Brexit’s going to be a wonderful thing for your country,” he said. “I think when it irons out, you’re going to have your identity and you’re going to have the people that you want in your country. ” Mr. Trump and Mrs. May talked about negotiating a new   agreement between the two countries. Ms. May is not the only European leader worried about Mr. Trump’s blossoming friendship with Russia, which United States intelligence agencies have concluded hacked Democratic email accounts to influence the American election last year. Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany has been a leading voice of keeping the pressure on the Kremlin, and Mr. Trump is scheduled to talk with her by telephone, too. The United States and Europe have imposed sanctions on Russian officials and companies, mainly in response to the seizure and annexation of Crimea and the separatist war fomented in eastern Ukraine. Before leaving office, Mr. Obama imposed additional sanctions in response to the Russian election hacking. In an interview with The Times of London shortly before taking office, Mr. Trump suggested a bargain that would ease sanctions on Russia in exchange for nuclear arms cuts and cooperation in the fight against the Islamic State. One topic that may come up on Saturday’s call is the fate of Austin Tice, a freelance journalist who disappeared in Syria in 2012. Mr. Trump may ask Mr. Putin for help in pressuring Russia’s ally, President Bashar   of Syria, to release Mr. Tice, according to an official briefed on the matter. Syria has never acknowledged holding him, but Mr. Trump has considered dropping support for the Syrian opposition."

Our comment primarily concerns the use of the social cost of carbon (SCC) by the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) and Department of Agriculture (USDA) in this Preliminary Affordability Determination. The SCC is discordant with the best scientific literature on the equilibrium climate sensitivity and the fertilization effect of carbon dioxide — two critically important parameters for establishing the net externality of carbon dioxide emissions — at odds with existing Office of Management and Budget (OMB) guidelines for preparing regulatory analyses, and founded upon the output of Integrated Assessment Models (IAMs) which encapsulate such large uncertainties as to provide no reliable guidance as to the sign, much less the magnitude of the social cost of carbon. Additionally, as run by the Interagency Working Group (IWG), the IAMs produce illogical results that indicate a misleading disconnect between a climate change and the SCC value. Further, the sea level rise projections (and thus SCC) of at least one of the IAMs (DICE 2010) cannot be supported by the mainstream climate science.



Until this situation can be properly rectified, the SCC should be barred from use in this and all other federal rulemaking. It is better not to include any value for the SCC in cost/​benefit analyses such as these, than to include a value which is knowingly improper, inaccurate and misleading.



Consequently, our overall recommendation is to remove any and all analyses in this Preliminary Affordability Determination — Energy Efficiency Standards that make reference to, or incorporate a value of, the social cost of carbon as determined by the federal Interagency Working Group according to its 2013 report.

Do we live in a special time in which the laws of physics and nature are suspended? No, we do not. Can we expect relationships between the Sun’s activity and climate, that we can see in data going back several hundred years, to continue for at least another 20 years? With absolute certainty.
In this presentation, I will demonstrate that the Sun drives climate, and use that demonstrated relationship to predict the Earth’s climate to 2030. It is a prediction that differs from most in the public domain. It is a prediction of imminent cooling.

"Liberals who have been outspoken in their opposition to taxpayer funding of new coal projects predict a new power plant in north Queensland being championed by the Nationals will never proceed because there are cheaper and more environmentally friendly alternatives for energy generation. Ahead of a vote on a disallowance motion during the current parliamentary sitting fortnight, Trent Zimmerman told Guardian Australia his view was the government should not be investing in coal-fired power stations. But he said a feasibility study into the Collinsville project should proceed “because it was the subject of an election commitment to residents in far north Queensland”. Zimmerman said any “fair” feasibility study would demonstrate there were better alternatives than a new coal plant in north Queensland. That view was echoed by Liberals Dave Sharma and Jason Falinski. “The Collinsville feasibility study into a high-efficiency low-emissions plant was an election commitment and we should honour it,” Sharma said. “But my own view is that new coal-fired power generation, even of the HELE variety, does not stack up economically or environmentally,” he said. “The feasibility study will examine these questions and it does not commit the government beyond that.” Sharma said Australia’s future was “firmed renewable energy”, not new coal plants, “and this is where the government is investing through initiatives like the grid reliability fund, Snowy 2.0 and the Marinus Link”. Falinski said the feasibility study should proceed “because it was an election commitment, but it will not lead to a new coal-fired power station being built because there are more economically efficient and environmentally cleaner options for power generation in Australia”. Labor and the Greens will vote in the Senate to disallow a $3.3m grant to Shine Energy to conduct the feasibility study into a new coal-fired power station in north Queensland. Guardian Australia revealed this grant was awarded on an ad hoc basis, rather than via a competitive process, despite the project having been rejected by a separate electricity underwriting program. Rex Patrick told Guardian Australia he was “likely to support” the disallowance because he believes electricity generation should “move away from fossil fuels” through the use of gas as a transitional fuel and “towards renewable energy in an affordable and sustainable manner”. His position is not final because he hasn’t yet consulted the government. Stirling Griff told Guardian Australia he supports the disallowance. Jacqui Lambie is yet to decide her position. But despite crossbench support to scuttle the study, the Coalition and Pauline Hanson’s One Nation together control 38 Senate votes – enough to block the disallowance motion if all vote or are paired, barring absences or a senator crossing the floor.  Hanson and Malcolm Roberts are both outspoken advocates of coal power, and moved a motion as recently as February in support of the Collinsville plant. Roberts told Guardian Australia he “supports [high-efficiency low-emission] coal, reliable and affordable electricity and the building of the Collinsville coal power station”. Roberts said he is “inclined to oppose any disallowance that attempts to stop the feasibility study going ahead”. Shine was invited to apply for the grant two days after the government announced it would be the recipient on 8 February. The Department of Industry, Science, Energy and Resources has insisted the process of drawing up “specific grant guidelines” for a one-off grant is “normal practice” but Labor has referred the grant to the auditor general."
"The Carbon Sense Coalition today called on all farmers and those who eat farm products to raise their voices in opposition to the silly proposals of Australian and New Zealand governments to include emissions and motions from farm animals as a taxable carbon emission.
The chairman of “Carbon Sense” Mr Viv Forbes, claimed that New Zealand has already agreed to include farm animal emissions in their taxable emissions output and Prof Garnaut is also thinking of driving Australian farmers to the Kyoto bail for a similar milching.

“We smart farmers in the South Pacific must have the longest cows in the world – they feed on farms in Queensland and Queenstown and are about to be milked in Canberra and Wellington.
Forbes, who is an animal breeder, pasture manager and soil scientist, said he could not believe the lack of noise from farm groups and consumers on this matter.
“Any farmer would know that no cow, sheep, pig or goat has yet managed to create carbon out of nothing. Nor do they eat fossil fuel. Every bit of carbon sequestered in meat, bones, wool and milk, or expelled in solid, liquid or gaseous animal waste, was extracted from the air by the pastures and grain crops the animals ate. Pastures, crops and soil fungi live on carbon dioxide, the universal plant food from the atmosphere, and water and minerals from the soil. Ultimately, all carbon in the food chain comes from the air (apart from some artificial “foods” made from coal or petroleum derivatives, and very minor soil humus derived from oxidised coal or oil shale).
“This carbon extraction process starts the day the animal is conceived and ceases on the day it dies. This is the carbon food cycle we all live by.
“In fact all farm animals should get a carbon credit, because they sequester part of the carbon extracted from the air in bones, meat, milk and wool. Much of this carbon then gets transferred to the bones and flesh of the growing human population, and eventually gets sequestered in sewerage (often, unfortunately, on the sea floor), bones in the coffins, and soil in the cemeteries. This is a proven process which provides more secure and far cheaper carbon sequestration than some of the billion dollar schemes being investigated.
“In this respect grazing animals are just like trees; both sequester CO2 for their lifetimes, sometimes much longer.
“Of course other parts of the food chain generate net carbon emissions for agricultural machines, processing, chemicals and transport. Each of these activities would attract its own carbon tax. None are essential elements in the raising of domestic animals – the essentials are soil, water, grass and the atmospheric gases, especially oxygen and carbon dioxide.
“No matter how you do the sums, farm animals cause a net removal of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. Thus they should get a carbon credit, certainly not a carbon tax.
“We all know the moon is made of green cheese. It is time to educate politicians that “All cows are also green”.

Share this...FacebookTwitterOnce welcome as a clean alternative for producing energy, wind turbines in Germany are today faced with ever more hostile political and social environments.
As the turbines increase in size, so do their impacts on people and ecosystems that are near them. In the southern German town of Winterlingen hundreds of people recently packed into a sports facility to listen to a talk by sound expert, Dr. Johannes Mayer on the effects of low frequency sound, so-called infrasound, on humans. Ten years ago not even a handful would have shown up. But today as interest in the adverse effects of infrasound from wind turbines are surfacing and becoming a major public issue, citizens who face the possible invasion by a wind park are taking a keen interest in the topic.
According to the online Schwaebische.de here, Mayer issued strong warnings on the adverse health-effects wind turbines can have on people.
Using the available research results, he emphasizes that people do not hear the infrasound emitted by wind turbines, but that they can feel them. “For 20 to 30% of the exposed persons there are massive consequences: The body comes under a state of constant, uninterrupted stress ,” said the speaker. Difficulty sleeping, disturbed concentration and irritability and depressive mood are the consequences says Johannes Mayer.”

Share this...FacebookTwitterThe energy restriction that the global climate change movement is calling for is arguably about driving the masses back into the mud, and putting a small, elitist class into palaces.
Any study would show that global warming regulators, activists and scientists are the worst offenders when it comes to carbon emissions. Think Al Gore, George Clooney, Leonardo DiCaprio, Hillary Clinton (e.g. private jet for travelling just 20 miles), to name just a few. The most alarmist climate scientists are constantly flying and attending lavish conferences.
I’d even say that the aim goes far beyond us serving them instead of them serving us, rather, at least for some, it’s mostly about forcing us to worship them at their feet. This green movement as we know it is in large part tyranny disguised as rescuing the planet. 80% of the science is pure BS.
Dr. Sebastian Lüning and Prof. Fritz Vahrenholt deliver another prime example of climate arrogance in their latest post, where they write “Preach water, guzzle wine.”
The latest surrounds Swiss Vice President Doris Leuthard of the Christian Democratic People’s Party (CVP) and her in Abu Dhabi celebrating the completion of the around-the-world trip by sun-powered aircraft Solar-Impulse, which de facto was carried around the world.
The two German authors quote an except from an article by Markus Schär of the Swiss Weltwoche No. 30/2016, who writes:
Using the federal parliamentary jet, Doris Leuthard (CVP) flew to Abu Dhabi. She celebrated Bertrand ­Piccard and André Borschberg, who circled the globe in the monster aircraft ‘Solar Impulse’, which was accompanied a charter jet with a 65-man crew and mobile hangar inside, and that in only 425 days more than Jules Verne’s hero (‘Around the World in 80 Days’) back in 1872. A reporter from Blick [daily] was told by Leuthard that ‘Switzerland must somehow show the world how we can set up a world without fossil energies in the future’. (When asked the question why Abu Dhabi was the starting point and destination, she conceded that Switzerland was ‘simply no country for sunshine’). The Parliamentary jet emitted some 80 tonnes of CO2 just for one trip, the same as driving a car for 30 years. Leuthard’s own Federal Ministry for Commercial Aviation recommends against emissions, a ‘reduction of personal travel distances.’ And: “refraining from midsize and long journeys.’”
Of course people like Leuthard have no intention whatsoever of drastically scaling back their own lifestyles.
Power is not about equality, rather it’s all about creating glaring inequality.

"The editor,
Did you know there is a “St. Andrews Sustainability Institute”? (I suppose before global warming alarmism became a fungible activity, their role was recovery of – er, lost balls.) See this link:
St Andrews golf course ‘could sink into sea by 2050’
Now, I’d like to see a “Cinque Ports Sustainability Institute”, which will show that rising sea levels will restore 14th century Rye (now stranded inland on the Romney Marshes, about 5 miles from the Sussex beaches of southern England) to its status as a sea port, doing what it used to do best — smuggle in French Brandy and Burgundy wines under the noses of HM Customs! A positive effect for catastrophic global warming at last!
Any takers?

"Don’t take toilets for granted. Their connection to a managed sewage disposal system protects you from diseases and infections that can stunt your growth, harm your nutrition and even kill you.  For some 670 million people, this basic service is not provided. In rapidly growing cities in low and middle income countries, expensive serviced residential areas stand alongside makeshift settlements, whose poorer residents lack access to sanitation and suffer from preventable diseases and infections. In India, for instance, more than seven children per 10,000 residents die from diarrhoea resulting from lack of sanitation. To address this, some governments have announced national drives to clean up their cities. But many cities are resorting to quick fixes that are polluting water sources and leaving countless urban communities by the wayside. Take India. In 2014, its government announced a highly publicised mission to “Clean India”. Under this mission, the government surveys and ranks cities according to their cleanliness, and hands prestigious awards to those ranking highest. The mission’s main aim was to rid the country of open defecation, makeshift toilets and open sewers by October 2019. This was music to the ears of residents of Siddharth Nagar, an informal settlement in Mumbai. Its 650 migrant families live in self-built shelters without access to functioning toilets. For many years, they had to resort to open defecation – that is, going to the “toilet” outside in the open environment rather than using dedicated and safely managed facilities. Open defecation is not considered safe because it exposes people to contact with faeces and, in the case of more vulnerable populations, potential attackers.  Eventually, residents were able to pool their resources and construct six makeshift toilets for the community. The waste from the toilets was directed straight into an adjacent stream, which took it to the sea. In many cases, water from streams and rivers is used for washing, cooking and drinking, so flushing untreated sludge – potentially containing dangerous viruses, bacteria and parasite cysts – can cause serious problems downstream. In May 2016, Siddharth Nagar residents requested proper toilets for their community. Two years later, following a long bureaucratic battle and committed campaigning, the municipality approved the construction of a managed community toilet block in the settlement. However, what they actually got was a “moving” toilet – a trailer carrying several toilets and a bio-digester. Shortly after the trailer’s arrival, officials visited the area to assess its sanitary status. Following the visit, the moving toilet disappeared. The municipal government had achieved its aim of being declared open defecation free but the community was no better off. In an attempt to pacify angry residents, the municipality eventually delivered four portable toilets later in 2018. But these were positioned out of reach of desludging vehicles, which were vital to the toilets’ proper functioning. Consequently, sludge was not collected in septic tanks as intended but directed straight into the stream-sewer, polluting water and ecosystems that depended on it. Today, three out of the four portable toilets are defunct. Residents are once again resorting to open defecation and their self-built toilets. Similar stories from all over India abound. Temporary fixes and cosmetic solutions offered by municipal governments are leaving countless communities empty handed in the long term. The particularly high risk of disease outbreak from water contamination in densely populated urban environments not only threatens lives but also reduces the time people can work, making it harder to escape poverty. Further east, Chinese president Xi Jinping announced the country’s “Toilet Revolution” in 2015, targeting primarily the countryside and promising access to hygienic toilets for all. But this bold rhetoric is deepening existing stigma surrounding traditional sanitation practices, widening the rift between the urban rich and poor. Prior to Xi’s announcement, sanitation infrastructure had not been considered a priority for several decades. Despite the country’s rapid economic development, the proportion of people relying on open defecation in cities had actually doubled between 1990 and 2008. Although the Toilet Revolution has helped to greatly expand public sewer systems in recent years, in fragmented cities such as Shanghai, not everyone has access to proper sanitation. While entire swaths of land have been swiftly redeveloped, pockets of older neighbourhoods remain untouched. Many of these dilapidated neighbourhoods are inhabited by China’s growing proportion of ageing citizens, who rely on traditional night pots and communal waste collection stations. Younger generations feel disdain and disgust for this way of life. For them, this is reason enough to stay away, leaving the old and frail isolated. China’s 225 million rural-to-urban migrants are another marginalised group. Unable to afford the skyrocketing prices of newer accommodation, most are forced to live in sub-standard conditions without access to sanitation facilities. Already looked down upon by more affluent urban residents, they are often accused of dirtying the urban environment. The desire to adopt modern conveniences – or live up to others’ expectations – has led countless urban migrant households to install flush toilets themselves. In most cases, these are not connected to municipal sewers. Rather, human waste is flushed directly into the street. The municipal government is now slowly taking steps to modernise its remaining older neighbourhoods. But even where toilets are formally connected to the sewer – including in newly built residential compounds – not all waste ends up at a treatment plant. As in India, much of it eventually pollutes surrounding bodies of water and linked ecosystems. It’s great that countries are backing the global drive for universal access to sanitation. But at the heart of these aims must be a desire to protect the environment and improve the health and wellbeing of the people – not recognition and awards. Otherwise, those most in need get left behind. Click here to subscribe to our climate action newsletter. Climate change is inevitable. Our response to it isn’t."
"The departure board at Pennsylvania Station in Manhattan has departed this life, but unlike Elvis, it has not left the building. Amtrak disconnected the board on Monday, stretching tarpaulins over one side of the familiar,   sign that told commuters whether the 5:54 to Metuchen, N. J. would be a touch late  —   and, when the time finally came, which track they could find it on. The other side of the board was left uncovered, a big, black, blank rectangle. Amtrak had said the departure board’s demise would begin around 10 p. m. on Monday, after the evening rush. For once, Amtrak was early. By the time commuters arrived at 6 p. m. the board was off, compounding the aggravation of a bad night caused by heavy winds and rain. Some commuters wondered if the   board was related to the delays on New Jersey Transit, which shares Penn Station with Amtrak and the Long Island Rail Road. An Amtrak spokeswoman, Kimberly Woods, said it was not. She said the board was turned off for testing and restarted before the final shutdown after 10. As early as 3:37 p. m. New Jersey Transit had warned on Twitter that there would be “major delays” because a storm had knocked down power lines in Linden, N. J. Trains from Trenton to Metropark, a major station, were suspended for about 30 minutes during the evening rush, but the delays continued even after service resumed. The old board was replaced by video monitors that have been functioning for several months. There are large monitors at both ends of the main waiting area on the west side of the station and smaller ones above the gates. Another large monitor is in the rotundalike space on the east side of the station, where there is also an arrivals monitor. Ms. Woods said Amtrak made the change in “our ongoing effort to improve and upgrade the passenger experience. ” “It’s like anything else  —   modern times, and everything’s digital,” said H. Edward Wilkin III, an accountant who was on the way to Secaucus, N. J. on Tuesday morning. But the trains were no more modern. Mr. Wilkin had a noon appointment. The new departure screen reported that his 11:06 train would be delayed. For how long, it did not say. Some commuters said the change made no difference, because the old board had little to do with the reality of when trains actually pulled away from the station, and they doubted the new screens would be any more accurate. Amtrak said the old board would be dismantled over the next few nights, when crowds in the station were thinnest. “I’ve been taking these trains since I was 18, going to college,” said Joe Castaldo, 63, who grew up in Oceanport, N. J. and now runs a   firm in Manhattan. “I’m sad the board is gone. It’s nostalgic, I know. ” He said the new screens were better, but the change was jarring for his mother, whom he had just put on a train. “She was like, ‘What am I going to do now? ’” Mr. Castaldo said. The old board was a centerpiece, the thing that brought a community together  —   a community of strangers about to be on a train. The board on the west side of the station was the heart of the waiting area  —   the town square, such as it was. A town square with linoleum underfoot, not grass, and fluorescent lighting above, not a Norman Rockwell sky. Like something from the days when newspapers hung bulletins outside their offices, the board told stories  —   and like Twitter, it told them in a minimum of characters, with few full sentences. Explanations were not always provided for “Delayed” or “Standby. ” The departure board that was disconnected on Monday was not the one many thought it was. It was not the one made by the Italian company Solari that whirred and clicked like the boards on television game shows in the 1960s. That sign was replaced about 15 years ago by the device that went dark on Monday, which had become too difficult to keep going, Amtrak said last summer. “That one can only do letters and numbers and columns,” said Kevin Farley, a digital experience strategist who was on his way to Philadelphia on Tuesday. “It was a classic design. ” Then, nodding toward one of the new electronic screens, he added: “This is still a little  . We’d like to know: Is the wind going to affect us? They could do little messages like that. ” At the other end of the waiting area, Ritu Narula, a lawyer heading to Washington, complained about legibility. “You can’t see the track number as easily” on the new screens, she said. “But we’ll get used to it. ” Did the new screens make the wait more pleasant or the lines shorter? Some remembered the architect Vincent J. Scully Jr. ’s famous line about the old Penn Station, demolished in the 1960s, as compared with the present one: “One entered the city like a god one scuttles in now like a rat. ” “I always feel like a rodent in there, getting from Point A to Point B,” Lorraine B. Diehl, the author of “The Late, Great Pennsylvania Station,” said from her apartment on the Upper East Side of Manhattan. As for the departure screens, she said, “I can’t pretend it’s something I care about. ” “To me, the bigger picture has to be addressed,” she said. “We need a new station. ”"

You Ought to Have a Look _is a feature from the Center for the Study of Science posted by Patrick J. Michaels and Paul C. (“Chip”) Knappenberger. While this section will feature all of the areas of interest that we are emphasizing, the prominence of the climate issue is driving a tremendous amount of web traffic. Here we post a few of the best in recent days, along with our color commentary._   
  
_\---_   
  
At the top of our list of things you ought to have a look at this week is a pair of blog posts by Dr. Roy Spencer updating the recent post-El Niño evolution of the satellite-observed temperature record of the earth’s lower atmosphere. In Roy’s first post, he updates the satellite record through June 2016, noting the big drop in temperatures as the effect of the recent big El Niño wanes. The take home figure looks like this:   






_Figure 1. Global average temperature of the lower atmosphere as derived and compiled by researchers at the University of Alabama at Huntsville, January 1979 through June 2016._



Roy notes that the “2-month temperature fall of -0.37 deg. C, which is the second largest in the 37+ year satellite record.”   
  
In a follow-on post, Roy looks to see what the prospects are for the 2016 annual temperatures being the highest in the 38-year satellite temperature history. In late June, Roy had concluded that is “2016 Will Likely See Record Global Warmth in Satellite Data.” But with the big drop in June temperatures, he is now reconsidering, writing that his previous prediction “looks…well…premature.”   
  
Be sure to check out all Roy’s analysis and keep tuning in to see how the year’s temperatures are progressing. We surely will be.



Next up is a piece from _Retraction Watch_ that notifies us that a (controversial) paper published last year that found that “Air pollution from fracking operations may pose an under-recognized health hazard to people living near them” and led to headlines like “Fracking could increase risk of cancer, new study finds,” well, was wrong. Turns out that the authors had used the wrong units in some of their calculations, and when they made the necessary correction, air pollution levels near fracking wells were well within EPA’s acceptable risk levels and below those that would increase cancer risk. Oops!   
  
Be sure to check out the entire Retraction Watch article, it is chock-full of interesting tidbits.   
  
And finally, the bottom of our post brings to the bottom of the world and a look at the increase in sea ice there.   
  
The growth of sea ice around Antarctica that has been ongoing for at least the past 25 or so years is a somewhat inconvenient fact for global warming cheerleaders in that climate models predict that the region should be _losing_ its sea ice (see for example the findings of Shu et al.).   
  
For a long time, the U.N.’s IPCC did its best to downplay (deny?) the increase was indeed real (e.g., https://www.masterresource.org/climate-science/yet-another-incorrect-ipcc-assessment-antarctic-sea-ice-increase/). Finally, they capitulated under the weight of the growing (!) evidence, including in their 2013 _Fifth Assessment Report_ : “It is very likely that the annual mean Antarctic sea ice extent increased at a rate in the range of 1.2 to 1.8% per decade (range of 0.13 to 0.20 million km2 per decade) between 1979 and 2012.”   
  
Even so, when climate change worriers get together to talk impacts, they rarely mention the goings on with the sea ice around Antarctica, preferring instead to hyperventilate about Arctic sea ice declines (which, by the way, have no impact on sea level rise—like the floating ice in your cocktail glass, when it melts, it doesn’t affect the level of your drink).   
  
That is, until now. Just this week a paper was published by Gerald Meehl and colleagues makes it safe to finally discuss Antarctic sea ice trends. Why? Because, Meehl & Co. link the increase to…wait for it…natural variability! Which means that while the poor climate models have been getting the sign of the trend wrong, it is not because of their inability to correctly ascertain the impacts of human-caused greenhouse gas increases, but rather that random processes—which the models are generally not expected to get the timing of—have been acting to overwhelm the model-projected decline. Whew!   
  
Somehow, as is his inimitable fashion, Chris Mooney of the _Washington Post_ manages to use this finding to proclaim that this is “bad news for climate change doubters.” We helped Valerie Richardson of the _Washington Times_ get it right.   
  
Bottom line is that if natural variability is leading to a slowdown of the warming around Antarctica (and leading to sea ice growth there), when it swings back the other direction, it should help prime the atmosphere with moisture (warmer air can hold more moisture than colder air) that should result in greater snowfall over Antarctica and a growing ice load on land—which does impact global sea levels, acting to lower them (that is, partially offset the rise from warming oceans). This sea level rise offsetting effect has long been expected but has been slow to be manifest (although there is some evidence that it is underway).   
  
We’ll have to see how all of this develops in the future, but regardless of the outcome, it won’t be “bad news” for climate skeptics.

As wind-turbine farms expand, research shows they could offer diminishing returns
From the UNIVERSITY OF KANSAS

 
LAWRENCE — Renewable wind energy is experiencing a boom, with more wind turbines popping up across landscapes in the U.S. and abroad. Indeed, wind energy accounted for 3.3 percent of electricity generation in the United States in 2011, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. Globally, that number was 2.9 percent for the same year.
But as wind turbines proliferate, researchers at the University of Kansas are looking at how these forests of turbines affect the wind itself. What happens to the wind when a larger number of wind turbines removes more and more of the energy of atmospheric motion?
Atmospheric science professors Nate Brunsell and David Mechem in KU’s Department of Geography are co-authors of a new study just published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences by an international research group that evaluated the effects of large wind farms on atmospheric flow and its implications for how much renewable energy the turbines can generate.
“Wind turbines generate electricity by removing energy from the wind, so a larger number of wind turbines should result in a slowdown of the winds in the lower atmosphere,” Mechem said.
The researchers quantified this phenomenon in numerical simulations by applying a sophisticated model normally used for weather forecasting to one of the windiest regions of the United States.
The team found that a slowdown effect triggered by wind turbines is substantial for large wind farms and results in proportionally less renewable energy generated for each turbine versus the energy that would be generated from an isolated wind turbine.
While the researchers stress that no current or planned wind farm approaches the size or concentration that would cause the slowdown effect, their results suggest the phenomenon tied to large wind farms needs to be accounted for in future planning of wind energy.
“When just a few wind turbines are installed, each additional turbine results in a similar increase in electricity generated, as you might expect,” Brunsell said.
However, when a substantial number of turbines are installed over a small area, the amount of electricity generated is no longer governed by simple multiplication, according to the researchers.
“Instead, because the turbines extract energy from the wind, additional turbines will each generate less and less electricity,” Mechem said.
The team’s simulations estimate this slowdown effect results in a practical upper limit of 1 megawatt per square kilometer that can be generated — far less than previous estimates not accounting for the effect. Current wind farms are operating well below this generation limit, but the authors found that this slowdown effect needs to be accounted for, particularly when comparing different sources of renewable energy.
The study was published online in the scientific journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences on Aug. 24.

"By Dirck T. Hartmann Thursday, July 3, 2008
(Editor’s Note: To many in the know, Dirck T. Hartmann, who worked on the Apollo Space Program and many other significant NASA projects, was a fighter pilot in WWII, flying P38s. So when this gifted scientist/engineer/physicist and 87-year-old hero felt compelled to answer the questions of Man Made Global Warming, not only his son and grandchildren knew he had something to say with factual substance, truth and knowledge. What he has to say is clear and concise and should be read by everyone.)
What is your carbon footprint? That is the wrong question to ask. A more meaningful question is – How much carbon dioxide does it take to grow the wheat required to produce a loaf of bread? Or – How much carbon dioxide does it take to grow the corn for the chicken feed required to produce a dozen eggs?

Far from being a pollutant, man along with every animal on land, fish in the sea, and bird in the air is totally dependent on atmospheric carbon dioxide for his food supply.
Some politicians complain that the United States with only 3% of the world population uses 25% of the energy. But the clean carbon dioxide which we produce is increasing food production everywhere on earth. China, on the other hand, is building new power plants at a record rate using the abundant domestic supply of coal they have and has now passed the United States as the leading producer of carbon dioxide. Although their coal has a high sulfur content, they are building the new plants without any pollution controls. The sulfur dioxide which these power plants are releasing to the atmosphere, besides smelling like rotten eggs is, in sunlight, readily converted to sulfur trioxide, the highly solublegas responsible for most acid rain.
Photosynthesis is the process by which plants, using energy from sunlight, convert carbon dioxide and water into high energy fuels. It is responsible for all the fuel that feeds forest fires, and for the rapid grow-back of fuel after a fire. But even with the hundreds of millions of tons of coal and the billions of barrels of oil and gasoline that are burned annually, the carbon dioxide content of the atmosphere remains about .04%.
It has been estimated that more than two hundred billion tons of atmospheric carbon are fixed yearly by photosynthesis, 10% to 20% by land plants, and the remaining 80% to 90% by plant plankton and algae in the ocean, which constantly resupply us with oxygen. Atmospheric carbon dioxide acts like a thermostat for plant growth, increases triggering vast blooms of ocean algae, and spurts in the rate of growth of land plants. As long as man burns coal and oil responsibly, that is with pollution controls that minimize the production of acid rain, the earth can never have too much carbon dioxide. The plants will not permit it.
Anyone who has lived in a desert area where the relative humidity is frequently below 5%, knows that dry air is a lousy green house gas. It can be 115 degrees F (46 degrees C) during the day yet cool off so rapidly that a sweater is needed two or three hours after sunset. Despite the heat sink of the ground with rocks hot enough to fry an egg, the heat is radiated rapidly away through the dry air to the clear night sky. Since dry desert air has about the same .04% concentration of carbon dioxide as air everywhere else, it is not credible to conclude that carbon dioxide is causing global warming
Water vapor is the most effective greenhouse gas by far. With high humidity, even without cloud cover, the night air cools at a rate so slow as to be nearly imperceptible, particularly if you are trying to sleep without air conditioning.
High humidity is the reason nights are so balmy in the tropics. At 100 degrees F and 100% relative humidity, water vapor accounts for only 2% of the atmosphere. It has a greater effect than all other greenhouse gases combined but, since it cannot be regulated, is rarely mentioned as a greenhouse gas.
If human activity is not the cause, why are the ice sheets on the earth poles receding? They are melting for the same reason that the polar caps on Mars are melting. For the 200 years or so that a record of sun spot activity has been kept, it has been observed that global temperatures on earth correlate closely with sun spot activity, very low activity corresponding to a mini ice age, and high activity to global warming.
Every second the sun converts 564 million tons of hydrogen into 560 million tons of helium, consuming its mass at the rate of 4 million tons per second. It has been doing this for 4.5 billion years and has about 4.5 billion years to go before all its hydrogen is used up. At that time it will have consumed less than 1% of its mass. This enormous solar furnace is responsible for climate change as well as all weather on earth.
The U.S. has a domestic supply of coal that is alone sufficient to meet our present power needs and projections for growth for at least 1,000 years, even without building any new nuclear power plants. Burning the coal responsibly and releasing the carbon locked up in it as clean carbon dioxide will benefit crop yields all over the earth. The great atmospheric patterns of air movements ensure a steady supply of carbon dioxide for crop growth, and a steady supply of oxygen for animals and people. To increase the rate at which photosynthesis removes carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, a respected scientist proposed to the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, or IPCC, seeding the ocean to trigger algae blooms. This practical, inexpensive, highly effective means for sequestering carbon dioxide would benefit the food chain in the oceans and increase fish populations. But because it did not impose hardships, require trading carbon credits, punish the U.S. or any other nation, or require increased governmental control, the IPCC rejected it. The IPCC uses the hoax of man made global warming to increase its power and that of a corrupt, anti-American United Nations that has proven itself impotent in combating world wide acts of terrorism, genocide in Sudan, the real threat of nuclear proliferation in the mid-east from Iran and Syria, or human rights violations in China and Africa.
Our mainstream media uses every opportunity to hype the hoax of man made global warming by repeated reporting of data and events that appear to support it, and ignoring those that contradict it. When the NFC championship game In 2007 between the Packers and the New York Giants was played at Green Bay in record low temperatures and blizzard conditions, there was no mention of global cooling; nor was there any in 2007 when below freezing temperatures threatened the vegetable crops in the south and the citrus crops in Florida. The drought in California is the result of colder than normal conditions in the equatorial Pacific Ocean, and the fact that ocean temperatures along the Pacific coast have been falling for the last three years is never mentioned. But after hurricane Katrina we were fed a host of dire predictions which warned of the increasing severity of storms, the melting of the polar ice caps, and the flooding of coastal areas from rising sea level, if we do not drastically reduce the release of greenhouse gasses to combat global warming. Which greenhouse gasses is not specified. We already have pollution controls in the smokestacks of most power plants, steel mills, and factories that minimize the release of sulfur dioxide.
The only completely uncontrolled exhaust gas is carbon dioxide, and photosynthesis automatically controls its atmospheric concentration for us.
Three billion years ago when the earth’s atmosphere was an unbreathable brew of noxious gases with almost no oxygen, a small green algae evolved in the ocean which, using the energy from sunlight over a few million years, completely altered the earth’s atmosphere. This oceanic green algae, the first plant to use photosynthesis to convert carbon dioxide and water into high energy fuel, was of course followed by the evolution of an almost limitless number and variety of carbon dioxide consuming plants.
Fortunately for mankind and all animals, fish,and birds, all of whom are totally dependent on plants, the oceanic green algae continues to perform its magic in the oceans of the earth today. Every three centuries all the carbon dioxide in the atmosphere and dissolved in the waters of the earth goes through the cycle photosynthesis, decay, photosynthesis, with the cycle constantly renewing the earth’s supply of oxygen.
People on the left claim global warming is real, a threat to the continued existence of mankind, and the debate as to its cause is over! Although none of this is true, it nevertheless is what four of my grandchildren were taught in high school. Most politicians on the left have little respect for truth and no regard for clarity, and apparently many high school teachers reflect their views. My oldest granddaughter just graduated from MITwhere she was spared the political rhetoric of the left on global warming. However Caltech’s Argyros Professor and professor of chemistry, in an article titled “Powering the Planet” states “The carbon dioxide we produce over the next 40 years, and its associated effects will last for a timescale comparable to modern human history. This is why, within the next 20 years we either solve this problem or the world will never be the same.” This is nonsense. It ignores the more than 200 billion tons of carbon that is sequestered yearly through photosynthesis from carbon dioxide In the atmosphere. Since this has been known for 40 years, I can only assume he is politically motivated to make such a statement. Hopefully man made global warming will come to be recognized for the hoax it truly is.

We now have a full one‐​third of a century of satellite‐​measured lower atmospheric temperatures, and what an interesting story the machines are revealing. I think it’s fair to say that they provide increasing evidence in favor of the “lukewarm” view of climate change, or the hypothesis of modest warming. In climate change, “it’s not the heat, it’s the sensitivity”, or the amount of warming that a change in carbon dioxide causes, that is important.



Almost every map of the decadal trends in the satellite data is centered on the Equator and looks like this:









But much more interesting things are going on around the poles, where the climate action is.



For a number of reasons, computer models with added atmospheric carbon dioxide preferentially warm the mid‐​and high‐​latitude land areas of the northern hemisphere that are ice‐​free, which also enhances summer melting of the relatively shallow ice in the Arctic Ocean. That, in turn, results in an increased absorption of solar radiation by the darker ocean surface, which also contributes to warming.



Here’s a view from over the North Pole. with vision down to 60°N:









The warming of high‐​latitude North America and the adjacent Arctic Ocean is the largest of any on the planet. Note that there tends to be less warming over the massive Greenland ice cap.



That’s because Greenland is kind of a miniature Antarctica, where things are much different than they are in our hemisphere.



Here’s the view from over the South Pole:









Antarctica is surrounded by a very cold and turbulent ocean, whose massive thermal capacity (compared to land) drastically reduces warming, compared to what we see in our hemisphere. But, even a tiny warming of the huge Southern Ocean must increase the amount of moisture in the air around Antarctica which can only result in more clouds and snow over the continent. Indeed, interior Antarctica can conceivably cool with a modest “global” warming. Warming doomsayers conveniently ignore the fact that even the UN’s models (current version) forecast that Antarctica will gain ice this century.



A lot of interior Antarctica (and a big patch of the southern ocean, for reasons I think no one understands) is getting colder. There are some pockets of decent maritime warming right near the coast, which almost certainly are increasing snowfall substantially when the wind blows onshore.



Here’s the lukewarm part. The bipolar behavior is pretty close‐​in pattern‐​to what theory and models say should be happening. But the models aren’t even close in the amount of warming.



The average warming trend in the one‐​third century of satellite data is 0.14°C per decade, but the warming rate in the UN’s midrange climate models is 0.25°. This differential has been pretty constant ever since the satellite data was corrected for orbital and sensor issues.



There’s no reason for that not to continue. In other words, the UN’s average forecast of 3.2°C of warming this century is off by about 40%, which should spell the victory of the lukewarmers and the death‐​knell of apocalyptic global warming. Indeed, it is not the heat, it’s the sensitivity, which looks to be quite a bit lower than what’s in those computer simulations.

Share this...FacebookTwitterNew Paper: From 1992-2014, There Was A
Pause In CO2’s Influence On Temperature

“Monthly variations of the areal averaged atmospheric and surface greenhouse effect parameter anomalies (Gaa and Gsa) from 1979 to 2014 for the (a) globe”

Between the years 1992 and 2014, anthropogenic CO2 emissions rates grew by 65%, or from a yearly average of 6.1 gigatons of carbon (GtC) in 1992 to a rate of 10.1 GtC by 2014 (Global Carbon Budget, 2014).
However, according to a new Nature paper entitled “A Hiatus of the Greenhouse Effect” by Song, Wang, & Tang (2016), there has been an overall hiatus to slight decline in the influence of the greenhouse warming effect on temperature beginning in 1992, which has coincided with the well-established pause in global warming since the early 2000s.
The encapsulating graph from the paper is depicted above, illustrating that the global-scale atmospheric and surface greenhouse effect (Gaa and Gsa) has remained flat or slightly declined between 1992 and 2014, during the same period time that anthropogenic CO2 emissions were rapidly rising.
This strongly suggests that anthropogenic CO2 emissions retain a very modest role in affecting variations in the overall greenhouse effect.

Song, Wang & Tang, 2016
A Hiatus of the Greenhouse Effect

[T]he primary goal of this study is to investigate the spatiotemporal evolution of the greenhouse effect to better evaluate its potential impact.
Because of the shorter period of the CERES EBAF product, the areal averaged Gsa [surface greenhouse effect] is represented only between 2003 and 2014 in Fig. 2 but shows no notable trend over the globe, sea or land. Thus, the surface greenhouse effect has not been strengthened in the last decade.
In the 1980s,a significant increasing Gaa [atmospheric greenhouse effect] tendency exists with a linear estimate of 0.19 W m−2 yr−1. However, this uprising trend pauses starting in circa 1992, when Gaa [atmospheric greenhouse effect] begins to slightly decrease at a rate of −0.01 W m−2 yr−1. This statistically non-significant trend indicates that the enhancing global atmospheric greenhouse effect is slowed down. Moreover, the atmospheric greenhouse effect hiatus can be found over both sea and land.
The oceanic Gaa [atmospheric greenhouse effect]exhibits a notable increasing trend with a rate of 0.21 W m−2 yr−1 in 1979–1991, whereas its rate of change (−0.04 W m−2 yr−1) during 1992–2014 is not statistically significant. By contrast, although a sudden change in the Gaa tendency is observed overland, the breakpoint is approximately 5 years later than that of the oceanic Gaa. The terrestrial Gaa trends are 0.12 W m−2 yr−1 and 0.05 W m−2 yr−1 before and after 1997, respectively.
In the last subperiod [2003-2014], the global averaged SULR [surface upwelling longwave radiation/greenhouse effect] anomaly remains trendless (0.02 W m−2 yr−1) because Ts [global temperatures] stop rising. Meanwhile, the long-term change of the global averaged OLR anomaly (−0.01 W m−2 yr−1) is also not statistically significant. Thus, these two phenomena result in a trendless Gaa [atmospheric greenhouse effect].
[A]remarkably decreasing Gaa trend (−0.27 W m−2 yr−1) exists over the central tropical Pacific, indicating a weakened atmospheric greenhouse effect in this area, which largely offsets the warming effect in the aforementioned surrounding regions. As a result, a trendless global averaged Gaa [atmospheric greenhouse effect]   is displayed between 1991 and 2002 (Fig. 2).
Again, no significant trend of the global averaged Gaa [atmospheric greenhouse effect] is found from 2003 to 2014 (Fig. 2) because the enhanced warming effect over the western tropical Pacific is largely counteracted by the weakened warming influence on the central tropical Pacific.


Explanation: Cloud Variations, Water Vapor Dominate Greenhouse Effect, With Insignificant CO2 Influence

As scientists Song, Tang, & Wang (2016) point out, during the 2003 to 2014 period, global temperatures “stop rising”.  In fact, temperatures declined slightly during this period according to HadCRUT and RSS.

Song, Wang, & Tang ultimately provide an explanation for the hiatus in the global-scale greenhouse effect (from the early 1990s to present) and temperature rise (from the early 2000s to present).  They insinuate that water vapor and clouds are the dominant contributors to greenhouse warming, and the CO2 contribution is quite modest by comparison.  Small variations in water vapor and cloud can therefore supersede large variations in CO2 in determining trends in the overall greenhouse effect.  Below are the key points from the rest of the paper detailing CO2’s small contribution to the overall greenhouse effect (relative to water vapor, clouds).

Song, Wang & Tang, 2016
[T]he influences of water vapor and clouds … contribute approximately 75% of the total [greenhouse] effect.
The results above indicate that the notably downward Gaa tendency over the central tropical Pacific indeed plays an important role in inducing the greenhouse effect hiatus since the 1990s. What causes this decreasing Gaa [atmospheric greenhouse effect]? The variation of the greenhouse effect is substantially influenced by its contributors, including water vapor, clouds, and GHGs. GHG concentrations have risen steadily during recent decades. The variations of metrics related to the other two contributors are given in Fig. 4a and are based on the CERES-EBAF products between 2003 and 2014. The total column precipitable water (TCPW) anomaly significantly increases at a rate of 0.44 cm yr−1. However, the cloud area fraction (CAF) anomaly is reduced by −0.60% yr−1, which is consistent with the decreasing cloud activity described in previous publications. Therefore, although the greenhouse effect can be enhanced by increasing GHGs and water vapor in the atmosphere, it can be weakened by decreasing clouds. If these two actions offset each other, a hiatus of the global greenhouse effect will result. 
[T]his pause in the greenhouse effect is mostly caused by the high number of La Niña events between 1991 and 2014. A strong La Niña indicates suppressed convection in the tropical central Pacific that reduces atmospheric water vapor content and cloud volume.
[T]he atmospheric and surface greenhouse effect parameters both become trendless when clouds are considered. … Overall, the downward tendency of clouds is the dominant contributor to the greenhouse effect hiatus.
In conclusion, the pause of the greenhouse effect since the 1990s may be one of the reasons for the global warming hiatus starting in the early 2000s.

The Scientific Literature Substantiates Insignificant CO2 Influence

The explanation that water vapor and clouds are the most dominant contributors to the overall greenhouse effect — and that the CO2 contribution is insignificant by comparison — has been well known and documented in the scientific literature for decades.  For example:

Willett, 1974
“[R]ecent increases of atmospheric carbon dioxide have contributed much less than 5% of the recent changes of atmospheric temperature, and will contribute no more than that in the foreseeable future.”

Dunbar, 1976
“[T]he measured increase in carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, according to the most recent computations, would not be enough to have any measurable climatic effect. Rasool and Schneider (1971) conclude that an increase in the carbon dioxide content of eight times the present level would produce an increase in surface temperature of less than 2°C, and that if the concentration were to increase from the present level of 320 parts per million to about 400 by the year 2000, the predicted increase in surface global temperature would be about 0.1°C.”

Ramanathan et al., 1989
“Water vapour and cloud are the dominant regulators of the radiative heating of the planet. … The greenhouse effect of clouds may be larger than that resulting from a hundredfold increase in the CO2 concentration of the atmosphere. … The size of the observed net cloud forcing is about four times as large as the expected value of radiative forcing from a doubling of CO2. The shortwave and longwave components of cloud forcing are about ten times as large as those for a CO2 doubling.”

Wielicki et al., 2002
“It is widely assumed that variations in Earth’s radiative energy budget at large time and space scales are small. We present new evidence from a compilation of over two decades of accurate satellite data that the top-of-atmosphere (TOA) tropical radiative energy budget is much more dynamic and variable than previously thought. Results indicate that the radiation budget changes are caused by changes in tropical mean cloudiness. The results of several current climate model simulations fail to predict this large observed variation in tropical energy budget. The missing variability in the models highlights the critical need to improve cloud modeling in the tropics so that prediction of tropical climate on interannual and decadal time scales can be improved.”

Kauppinen et al., 2014
“We will show that changes of relative humidity or low cloud cover explain the major changes in the global mean temperature. We will present the evidence of this argument using the observed relative humidity between years 1970 and2011 and the observed low cloud cover between years 1983 and 2008. One percent increase in relative humidity or in low cloud cover decreases the temperature by 0.15 °C and 0.11 °C, respectively. In the time periods mentioned before the contribution of the CO2increase was less than 10% to the total temperature change.”

Hamdan, 2016
“The analysis showed that the main atmospheric parameters that affect the amount of global radiation received on earth’s surface are cloud cover and relative humidity. Global radiation correlates negatively with both variables. Linear models are excellent approximations for the relationship between atmospheric parameters and global radiation. A linear model with the predictors total cloud cover, relative humidity, and extraterrestrial radiation is able to explain around 98% of the variability in global radiation.”

Summarizing Question:  Why is there so much preoccupation with atmospheric CO2 concentrations and reducing anthropogenic CO2 emissions when it is well documented in the peer-reviewed scientific literature that the CO2 contribution to the overall greenhouse effect is so weak that it can be easily supplanted by small changes in clouds and water vapor, or natural climate-changing constituents?

"Intensive agriculture may be nourishing most of the Earth’s inhabitants, but it’s doing the opposite to earth itself. Its dependence on singular crops, heavy ploughing machinery, fossil-fuel based fertilisers and pesticides is degrading our soils wildlife and nutrient cycles, and contributing a quarter of the planet’s unwanted extra heat. But we’re not powerless to change the future of food. Nature and technological innovation are tackling these problems head on – and if the solutions they’re offering are incorporated on a large scale and used together, a new agricultural revolution could be on its way. Here are three of the most exciting developments that can help farms not just feed the planet, but heal it too. Several UN reports have highlighted agroecology – farming that mimics the interactions and cycles of plants, animals and nutrients in the natural world – as a path to sustainable food. The approach uses a wide variety of practices. For example, instead of artificial fertilisers, it improves soil quality by planting nutrient-fixing “cover crops” in between harvest crops, rotating crops across fields each season and composting organic waste. It supports wildlife, stores carbon, and conserves water through the planting of trees and wildflower banks. It also integrates livestock with crops. This may seem counter-intuitive given their inefficient land use and high emissions. But having a small number of animals grazing land doesn’t have to accelerate global heating. Grassland captures carbon dioxide. Animals eat the grass, and then return that carbon to the soil as excrement. The nutrients in the excrement and the continuous grazing of grass both help new grass roots to grow, increasing the capacity of the land to capture carbon. Keep too many grazing animals in one place for too long and they eat too much grass and produce too much excrement for the soil to take on, meaning carbon is lost to the atmosphere. But if small numbers are constantly rotated into different fields, the soil can store enough extra carbon to counterbalance the extra methane emitted by livestock’s digestive rumblings. While this doesn’t make them a carbon sink, livestock bring other benefits to the land. They keep soil naturally fertilised, and can also improve biodiversity by eating more aggressive plants, allowing others to grow. And if local breeds are adopted, they generally don’t require expensive feed and veterinary care, as they’re adapted to local conditions.  Pests, diseases and weeds cause almost 40% of crop losses globally – and without care, the figure could rise dramatically. Climate change is shifting where pests and diseases thrive, making it harder for farmers to stay resilient. Many commonly used herbicides, pesticides and fungicides are now also under pressure to be banned because of their negative effects on the health of humans and wildlife. Even if they’re not, growing resistance to their action is making controlling weeds, pests and diseases increasingly challenging. Nature is again providing answers here. Farmers are starting to use pesticides derived from plants, which tend to be much less toxic to the surrounding environment. They’re also using natural enemies to keep threats at bay. Some may act as repellents, “pushing” pests away. For example, peppermint disgusts the flea beetle, a scourge to oilseed rape farmers. Others are “pulls”, attracting pests away from valuable crops. Plants that are attractive for egg-laying but that don’t support the survival of insect larvae are commonly used for this purpose. Technology is also offering solutions on this front. Some farmers are already using apps to monitor, warn and predict when pest and diseases will attack crops. Driverless tractors and intelligent sprayers that can target specific weeds or nutritional needs have recently entered the market. Agritech companies are now also developing robots that can scan fields, identify specific plants, and decide whether to use pesticide or to remove a plant mechanically. In combination, these methods can dramatically reduce agriculture’s reliance on herbicides and pesticides without lowering crop yields. This is important, since the world’s population is set to rise by a quarter in the next three decades. Soon, technology at an almost impossibly small scale could make a big difference to the way we grow our food. Companies have designed nanoparticles 100,000 times smaller then the width of a human hair that release fertiliser and pesticides slowly but steadily, to minimise their use and maximise crop yields. New gene-editing techniques will also increasingly use nanomaterials to transfer DNA to plants. These techniques can be used to detect the presence of pests and nutrient deficiencies, or simply improve their resistance to extreme weather and pests. Given that increasingly frequent and severe extreme weather events due to global heating are putting the very functioning of the global food system at risk, these advancements could be vital for preventing agricultural collapse. Nanotechnologies aren’t cheap yet and researchers have yet to conduct rigorous tests of how toxic nanomaterials are to humans and plants, and how durable they are. But should they pass these tests, agriculture will surely follow the path of other industries in adopting the technology on a large scale. Save for nanotechnology and advanced robots, the above solutions are already in use in many small-scale and commercial farms – just not in combination. Imagine them working in synchrony and suddenly a vision of sustainable agriculture doesn’t seem so far away anymore. Click here to subscribe to our climate action newsletter.

Share this...FacebookTwitterGermany’s Geomar Research Center recently published a press release (see below) concerning the latest on the Gulf Stream. Hat-tip: DkS.
Some leading scientists have claimed that melting Greenland glaciers due to “man-made global warming” will lead to a disruption of the Gulf Stream and cause the North Atlantic region’s climate to change dramatically. However, the latest computer simulations show this scenario may be delayed.
=====================================================
Breathing space for the Gulf Stream
Scientists calculate the fate of the Greenland meltwater
20 June 2016/Kiel. The salinity of the waters around Greenland plays an important role in driving the Gulf Stream. There are concerns that a progressive freshening by the increasing ice losses from the Greenland ice sheet could influence and weaken the current system.
New model calculations conducted by an international research team suggest, however, that a large fraction of this meltwater is effectively removed from the most sensitive areas by swift, narrow boundary currents, delaying the influence on the Gulf Stream. The study is published today in the international journal Nature Geoscience.
Greenland’s glaciers are melting. Recent work by researchers at the University of Bristol found a 50% increase in the freshwater flux since 1990. Due to both enhanced summer melt and calving of outlet glaciers more than 5000 cubic kilometers of extra meltwater have been flowing into the sea, equivalent to a quarter of the volume of the Baltic Sea. The fate of this freshwater is of great importance for the system of ocean currents in the North Atlantic, which is governed by the density of the waters surrounding Greenland. A reduction in the water density especially in the Labrador Sea due an increased influx of freshwater could ultimately lead to a weakening of the current system, including the Gulf Stream.

Using a newly developed computer model, an international team of scientists led by the GEOMAR Helmholtz Centre for Ocean Research Kiel has now simulated in detail the pathways and effects of the additional meltwater. “The effects of the melting Greenland glaciers initially remain smaller than expected, since a large part of the meltwater is effectively flushed out by fast, narrow currents along the coastline of North America. Thus changes in the critical, northern seas are delayed”, explains GEOMAR researcher Prof. Claus Böning, lead author of the study.
The computer model takes into account the regional differences in meltwater discharge trends and very fine details of the ocean currents. This fine detail allowed the researchers to assess more accurately the influences of the narrow boundary currents and small-scale eddies on the water exchange between the coastal shelf and the deep ocean.
The model calculations showed that more than half of the meltwater is transported southwards along the Canadian coast by the Labrador Current. Less than 20 percent remain in the area between Greenland and Labrador which is critical for the Gulf Stream system. The model suggests that the melting-induced impact on ocean salinity is, to date, only half as large as natural variations measured in the past decades.
However, the simulation also shows a progressive trend in the freshening of the Labrador Sea. “If we project the rise in Greenland melting rates into the future, we expect first noticeable changes in the Labrador Sea in two or three decades”, emphasizes Professor Böning, “in this sense the Gulf Stream may just get some breathing space”. “Meltwater fluxes from Greenland have been accelerating in recent years and if, as seems likely, this trend continues we could see changes in ocean circulation even sooner” explains co-author Jonathan Bamber, Professor at the University of Bristol.

"**Five people have been injured in a knife attack at the site of a pro-democracy protest in Hong Kong.**
The attack happened at the Cityplaza mall in the Tai Koo district on Hong Kong Island.
The local hospital authority said four men and one woman were injured, with two in critical condition.
One of the injured, a local councillor, had his ear partially bitten off by the as-yet unidentified male attacker, who was subdued by passersby in the mall.
Witnesses said the Mandarin-speaking attacker drew a knife after a political argument with people in the mall, which was the site of pro-democracy protests earlier in the day.
The local councillor, Andrew Chiu Ka-yin, reportedly was attempting to prevent the attacker leaving the scene when the man bit off a section of his ear. Witnesses said the attacker was badly beaten by passersby who intervened, before police arrested the man.
One of the victims, a woman, told the South China Morning Post that the suspect drew a knife after arguing with her sister and her husband, who were also injured. The Hong Kong Free Press reported that that attacker was a Mandarin-speaking pro-Beijing supporter.
Hong Kong has experienced five months of sometimes violent demonstrations by pro-democracy activists, who first took to the streets to protest against a bill that would have allowed extradition to mainland China, but evolved into a broader revolt against the way Hong Kong is administered by Beijing.
The wave of pro-democracy protests continued this weekend, days after a high-profile activist, Joshua Wong, was banned from standing in local elections. Police fired tear gas on Sunday into crowds of demonstrators in the eastern suburb of Taikoo Shing, home to the Cityplaza where the stabbing occurred.
With no end in sight, China's leaders signalled last week that they were preparing to change how the mainland administered Hong Kong.
Shen Chunyao, the director of the Hong Kong, Macau and Basic Law Commission, told reporters that officials were looking at ways to ""perfect"" how Hong Kong's chief executive was appointed and removed. He did not elaborate on what exactly might change.
Last month, the leader of one of Hong Kong's largest pro-democracy groups was taken to hospital after being attacked, apparently with hammers. Photographs on social media showed Jimmy Sham of the Civil Human Rights Front lying in the street, covered in blood.
From hospital, the activist said he ""remained committed to the ideal of peaceful non-violence"".
**Stephen McDonell** **, BBC News, Hong Kong**
Images and footage of the incident spread quickly around social media platforms. The man who did the biting was subdued by a crowd, which then beat him, some using metal objects.
That is was all happening in a shopping centre being stormed by riot police in pursuit of protestors who were earlier singing and chanting made it even more intense. A small group of hardcore activists had also smashed up shops whose owners they judged to be too ""pro-Beijing"".
I watched the footage on a television in a small restaurant in Hong Kong. Halfway through the report, the woman running the place turned and walked away from the screen. ""This is all too depressing,"" she said in Chinese."

Political cartoonist Rick McKee of the Augusta Chronicle sees what you and I do – that any weather event can be pinned on climate change.
The warm weather on the eastern half of the USA this winter has prompted  many climate alarmists blame it on global warming/climate change/climate disruption even though in 1955, a similarly warm and record breaking warm winter occurred well before CO2 was out of the “safe” zone as some call it. This map illustrates:

McKee of course sees right through the hype of blaming any weather event on climate change with this cartoon…

What is funny is that there was some climate scientists who actually did a paper and a wheel of climate as a PR prop

"Australia’s greenhouse gas accounting underestimates national emissions by about 10%, largely due to a failure to properly recognise the impact of methane released during gas production, an analysis has found. In late June, the energy and emissions reduction minister, Angus Taylor, amended laws to reflect a scientific consensus that methane – a highly potent but short-lived greenhouse gas that leaks during gas processing – plays a greater role in heating the planet than previously thought.  The change is expected to increase Australia’s reported annual emissions by about 3% compared with what they otherwise would have been. Tim Baxter, a former University of Melbourne climate law expert, now a senior researcher with the Climate Council, said the government update was belated as it was based on a report by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) published six years ago. But he said the change did not fully reflect the panel’s conclusions, including that methane from fossil fuels was more damaging than from living sources, and was yet to factor in more recent peer-reviewed evidence that methane’s heating role was even greater than estimated in 2014. Baxter found that if the methane emitted in Australia was measured according to the latest science it would increase annual emissions by more than 50m tonnes a year, the equivalent of Sweden’s total carbon pollution. His analysis is included in a submission to the New South Wales authorities on the controversial Narrabri gas project and will form the basis for an upcoming report. He said the Morrison government, which is backing a “gas-fired recovery” from the Covid-19 recession and is considering whether to underwrite new gas infrastructure including major pipelines, was failing to report the full impact of its emissions. “It’s no surprise to anyone who has been paying attention that the federal government is miles behind when it comes to keeping up with the science of climate change,” Baxter said. “It is still ignoring the extra impact of fossil fuel methane compared to other sources and still failing to consider the full impact of those emissions on natural feedbacks. The government is several steps behind key scientific developments that have occurred over the past seven years.” Methane lasts in the atmosphere for only about 12 years but is much more potent than carbon dioxide. Scientists have found the level of atmospheric methane had increased significantly since 2007 after a relatively flat period, but they are unsure why. Gas emits about half the carbon dioxide released from coal when burned, but Global Energy Monitor, a US research and advocacy group, found the role of fugitive methane emissions from new gas developments in global heating was likely to be as large as or larger than the expansion of coal power. A spokesman for the Department of Industry, Science, Energy and Resources said it was simplistic for Baxter to conclude that methane impacts were underestimated in government data. He said Australia was acting in line with a 2018 international agreement that the warming power of methane and other gases set out in the IPCC’s 2014 report would be reflected in greenhouse reporting by 2023. “The analysis is not accurate,” the spokesman said. On Tuesday, 25 leading scientists released a letter  to the chief scientist, Alan Finkel, warning his advocacy for increased use of gas-fired electricity was at odds with the Paris agreement and not consistent with a plan to secure a safe climate. “There is no role for an expansion of the gas industry,” they wrote. “The combustion of natural gas is now the fastest-growing source of carbon dioxide to the atmosphere, the most important greenhouse gas.” Finkel responded that he shared their vision for the expansion of renewable energy but he believed it would be “faster, more economical and more reliable” if supported by gas-fired electricity generation “in the near to medium term”. The chief scientist said he had not commented on an expanded role for gas in industry – backed by the government and Scott Morrison’s handpicked National Covid Coordinating Commission – having focused solely on the electricity grid. The Australian Energy Market Operator (Aemo) last month found additional gas-fired power was an option, but not essential, for an electricity grid increasingly based on renewable energy, and gas prices would need to stay at lower levels than expected if new gas was to compete with pumped hydro, batteries and other alternatives. The prime minister repeated his strong support for gas in parliament on Tuesday. He said gas was an important transition fuel and expanding the supply was critical to Australia’s economic recovery from the Covid-19 recession. “That is why we want to see more of it and get more out of the ground,” he said. The update announced by Taylor increased the estimated warming potential of methane – effectively, how much heat it traps – from 25 times greater than carbon dioxide to 28 times greater, calculated over a century. The change matters because methane emissions are converted to their “carbon dioxide equivalent” and then counted in national CO2 emissions. The 2014 IPCC report suggested the warming power of methane from fossil fuels was 30 times greater than CO2. The warming power of “biogenic methane” – released from living organisms such as cows – was 28 times greater. A later reassessment, published in the journal Geophysical Research Letters in 2016, found it was greater still: 34 times greater than CO2 for “fossil methane” and 32 times greater for biogenic methane. Baxter said these figures were still not truly representative as they did not factor in the feedback effects caused when greenhouse gases are released. The IPCC report in 2014 cited research that found the feedback from methane emissions increased its warming potential by a further 20%. Baxter calculated this would lift the warming rate for biogenic methane to 39 and for fossil methane to 40. He said the additional, unexplained methane in the atmosphere suggested the emissions from the gas industry were being systematically underreported. "
"Covid-19 has provided a crucial opportunity to make drastic changes to tackle climate change, experts behind this year’s Royal Institution Christmas lectures have said. The talks, Planet Earth: A User’s Guide, will take audiences on a deep dive into our planet’s workings, from rock formation and Earth’s ancient climate, to the fundamental role of the oceans and the makeup of the air we breathe.  Each of the three lectures will be presented by a different scientist from a trio of experts: the oceanographer Dr Helen Czerski, environmental scientist Dr Tara Shine and geologist Prof Chris Jackson. “What gets the three of us really excited is that we’re not going to tell you about all these parts in isolation, we’re trying to paint for you a picture of how our planetary system works and where we are as one species within that,” said Shine, speaking over Zoom from Ireland. Joining the conversation with a large image of a bioluminescent bigfin squid behind her, Czerski said she hoped her lecture would encourage viewers to see oceans were more than just the “blue bit” of the planet but the heart of its engine. “The reservoir of water the Earth has, that’s its battery of energy from the sun – it shifts, it carries heat, it holds heat, it moves it around, it moves chemistry around. If you didn’t have that the Earth would be uninhabitable,” she said. While the Blue Planet series by David Attenborough in 2018 has been credited as fuelling a drive to reduce plastic waste, Czerski hopes this year’s lectures will trigger a bigger shift in how we view the oceans. “People were upset by the plastic. And that’s fine. But it’s not the point,” she said. For Jackson, the lectures bring the opportunity to set out how the climate has changed over the planet’s 4.5bn-year history. Understanding the Earth’s systems, and our impact on them, raises crucial questions. “Are we going to say the Anthropocene was the time that humans destroyed the planet,” Shine said. “ Or are we going to say it was the time that humans nearly destroyed the planet and just pulled it back from the brink?” The team believe Covid-19 presents a new opportunity to take action on climate change, as countries make drastic changes to infrastructure, jobs and investment. “One of the excuses people give for not doing things about climate change is, ‘Oh, there’s this enormous system and it’s too hard or too expensive or too difficult to change it because that’s the way it is’,” Czerski said. “What’s happening now is that systems are having to change.” “Covid is a restart button,” Shine said. The pandemic provided an opportunity to build on developments such as the EU green deal, while opening conversations about risk and resilience. “To be resilient to the next pandemic we have to build some of the same core skills and capabilities that we need to be resilient to climate change,” she said, adding that such challenges were interconnected. A growing body of research has found destruction of ecosystems allows animals that carry potentially deadly diseases to proliferate, increasing the risk of another pandemic. But, Czerski stressed, Covid was far from welcome. “The scientists and the policymakers who are concerned about climate change are extremely sympathetic to the massive suffering a huge number of people have had through this pandemic,” she said. “The entire point is that this is what societal change looks like when something changes.”"
"**China's President Xi Jinping has told embattled Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam that the central government has a ""high degree of confidence"" in her, according to Chinese state media.**
There were reports last week of Beijing planning to replace Ms Lam, after months of anti-government protests that have at times crippled Hong Kong.
But Mr Xi reportedly expressed his full support at a meeting in Shanghai.
The protests began against an extradition bill put forward by Ms Lam.
She championed the proposed law, which would have allowed criminal suspects in Hong Kong to be sent to mainland China for trial.
The bill sparked fears Hong Kong's freedoms were being eroded, and led to widespread protests, including one with a reported turnout of close to two million.
Ms Lam eventually withdrew the bill, but protests have continued, with activists demanding an independent inquiry into alleged police brutality, and democratic reform.
China's state news agency Xinhua published pictures of the two leaders shaking hands, and reported that Mr Xi had praised Ms Lam for her efforts to quell clashes in the territory.
""The central government has a high degree of confidence in you,"" he was quoted as saying, adding: ""Stopping the storm and restoring order remains the most important task in Hong Kong.""
The wave of protests continued this past weekend, with riot police spraying tear gas into crowds of demonstrators in Taikoo district, a residential area.
On Sunday, in the same district, a man stabbed four people and bit off part of a pro-democracy local councillor's ear, after a political argument about the protests.
With no end to the demonstrations in sight, China's leaders signalled for the first time last week they were prepared to make changes to the way the mainland administered Hong Kong.
Shen Chunyao, the director of the Hong Kong, Macau and Basic Law Commission, told reporters officials were looking at ways to ""perfect"" how Hong Kong's chief executive was appointed and removed. He did not elaborate on the exact nature of the proposed changes.
Hong Kong's leader, the chief executive - currently Ms Lam - is elected by a 1,200-member election committee, a mostly pro-Beijing body chosen by just 6% of eligible Hong Kong voters.
Once a British colony, Hong Kong was handed back to China in 1997. It has its own judiciary and a separate legal system from mainland China, and rights mainland Chinese citizens do not enjoy, such as freedom of assembly and freedom of speech.
But human rights groups say some of those freedoms are being curtailed, and accuse China of meddling in the territory's affairs, citing legal rulings that have disqualified pro-democracy legislators.
Artists and writers in the territory also say they are under increased pressure to self-censor - and a Financial Times journalist was barred from entering Hong Kong after he hosted an event that featured an independence activist.
The Chinese government said in 2014 it would allow Hong Kong voters to choose their leaders from a list approved by a pro-Beijing committee. But critics called the proposal a ""sham democracy"" and it was voted down in Hong Kong's legislature.
In 28 years' time, in 2047, the Basic Law - which grants Hong Kongers their freedoms - expires, and what happens to the territory's autonomy after that is unclear."

Share this...FacebookTwitterAntarctic climate models fail to handle natural variability: Adélie penguins continue to appear
By Dr. Sebastian Lüning and Prof. Fritz Vahrenholt
(German text translated/edited by P. Gosselin)
On June 29, 2016 the University of Delaware (UD) unleashed a climate penguin panic with its press release:
Penguins and climate change:
UD scientists report projected response of Adélie penguins to Antarctic climate change
It’s a big question: how is climate change in Antarctica affecting Adélie penguins? Climate has influenced the distribution patterns of Adélie penguins across Antarctica for millions of years. The geologic record tells us that as glaciers expanded and covered Adélie breeding habitats with ice, penguin colonies were abandoned. When the glaciers melted during warming periods, this warming positively affected the Adélie penguins, allowing them to return to their rocky breeding grounds. But now, University of Delaware scientists and colleagues report that this beneficial warming may have reached its tipping point. In a paper published today in Scientific Reports, the researchers project that approximately 30 percent of current Adélie colonies may be in decline by 2060 and approximately 60 percent may be in decline by 2099.”
That’s absolutely bitter. More than half of the penguins will be dead by 2099. In earlier times they benefitted from climate warming, but today heat is threatening to wipe them out. How has this come to be? The press release continues:
It is only in recent decades that we know Adélie penguins population declines are associated with warming, which suggests that many regions of Antarctica have warmed too much and that further warming is no longer positive for the species,” said the paper’s lead author Megan Cimino, who earned her doctoral degree at UD in May.”
Antarctica has warmed unusually over the past decades?

Unfortunately that is completely wrong, see here. Precisely on this subject a new paper by Jones et al. 2016 in Nature Climate Change tells us:
Assessing recent trends in high-latitude Southern Hemisphere surface climate
Understanding the causes of recent climatic trends and variability in the high-latitude Southern Hemisphere is hampered by a short instrumental record. Here, we analyse recent atmosphere, surface ocean and sea-ice observations in this region and assess their trends in the context of palaeoclimate records and climate model simulations. Over the 36-year satellite era, significant linear trends in annual mean sea-ice extent, surface temperature and sea-level pressure are superimposed on large interannual to decadal variability. However, most observed trends are not unusual when compared with Antarctic paleoclimate records of the past two centuries. With the exception of the positive trend in the Southern Annular Mode, climate model simulations that include anthropogenic forcing are not compatible with the observed trends. This suggests that natural variability likely overwhelms the forced response in the observations, but the models may not fully represent this natural variability or may overestimate the magnitude of the forced response.“
Perhaps the penguin researchers should first take a better look at this paper as soon as it gets published officially. It becomes necessary to explain why the Adélie-penguins are even alive today because the Antarctic Peninsula was warmer than today many times over the past thousands of years. By the way, the last warm phase in Antarctica occurred as an effect of the Medieval Warm Period.
When one looks more closely at the University of Delaware paper, the tricks the penguin researches are using quickly becomes clear. For assessing the danger, a middle of the pack climate model scenario was not used. No, instead the absolute most grim model by the name of RCP 8.5 was used. It just could not be worse. It’s like being sure you’ll have a car accident on the way to work today.
We at this blog constantly have to make official complaints when the media simply take over press releases without checking, and thus promote climate alarm. Finally, there is some good news: It appears people have in fact gotten more careful, as a search for the report turned up no result. That’s very praiseworthy. The sole exception is the Internet platform wetter.de, who found it too much to resist – and took the bait.

"Last year Lehman Brothers released a report about climate change. High profits from the Kyoto carbon trade scheme was the essence of it. It met with the applause of politicians, the entire media and the greens. PM Rudd and Malcolm Turnbull were very keen on it and remain so.
Lehmans predicted the climate 100 years ahead. Green militants have been using the Lehman report as a proof of global warming and impending chaos.
Lehmans scientific advisor is James Hansen, Al Gore’s scientific adviser.
The report is driving climate change policy in Europe, Argentina and several other countries; it is used by economy professors playing being climatologists; by newspapers editorials and essays and even by a U. S. State Secretary.
But Lehmans couldn’t even predict their own demise less than a month ahead, though there were many people that had been warning about this present crash for years.
Lehman’s failure provides a preview of our future if more nations and companies bank their future on the speculative advice of these advocacy scientists, politicians and environmental groups, while ignoring common sense.
If we let them, our politicians will drive the nation to bankruptcy, using the policies that have destroyed Lehmans.
China and India have been and remain much more sensible.

"In 2018, a super-typhoon destroyed 80% of the corals in Hoi Ha Wan bay off the Sai Kung peninsula in Hong Kong. In the city’s strongest storm since records began, winds reached 155mph (250km/h) and battered the reefs, leaving behind mostly scattered debris and broken coral skeletons. A few coral species survived, but these will likely take decades to regrow to their former state. Sadly, this was no exception. Coral reefs are rapidly vanishing from the world’s oceans in large part because of the effects of global heating, which among other issues is increasing the frequency and severity of storms. In 2016 and 2017 alone, 89% of new corals on the Great Barrier Reef perished as a result of global heating-induced bleaching. Without decisive action to tackle the climate emergency, overfishing and pollution, it is estimated we will lose 70% to 90% of the world’s remaining coral reefs over the next 20 years.  A team of marine scientists and architects from the University of Hong Kong are trialling one method of restoring the reefs destroyed in the typhoon – and, they hope, others in future. Using a 3D printer, they have created so-called “reef tiles” – hexagons made of terracotta – and placed them on the seafloor in Hoi Ha Wan bay. The technology might be advanced but the idea is simple. “To create a hard bottom on a sandy seafloor,” says David Baker, director of the Swire Institute of Marine Science (Swims). “Sand is really not great for corals as it can move and bury or scour the coral’s thin tissues. Most corals that end up in sand usually suffer a slow death.” The tiles, on the other hand, stand on feet that elevate them from the seabed – allowing corals to grow higher in the water column, where they can access all the things corals like: sunshine, nutrients and food. The idea is being tested in other locations around the world: scientists are working to restore reef habitats with 3D printing in the Maldives, which is home to the world’s largest 3D-printed reef, as well as in France and the Caribbean. The tiles are designed in layers, using biomimicry to replicate the geometry of a brain coral, so as not to interfere with the growth patterns of real coral. “The top layer is based on a biomimetic approach and serves as the primary space to attach the coral fragments,” says Christian Lange, an associate professor of architecture at the University of Hong Kong and leader of its robotic fabrication lab. “We designed this part so that the marine biologist can insert the different coral species in six designated areas.” The tiles only cover 40 sq m for now, but if the experiment works it could be rolled out elsewhere. “Our hope is that the tiles provide a solid foundation for corals to reach a durable size,” says Baker.Other artificial techniques to save reefs are being tested as well. In a practice known as “rigs to reefs”, decommissioned offshore oil rigs have been turned into artificial reefs in the US, Brunei and Malaysia. Scuttling ships – deliberately sinking them – is another method. The sunken American aircraft carrier USS Oriskany is the largest artificial reef in the world. Nicknamed “the Great Carrier Reef”, the carrier is located in north-west Florida and was sunk in 2006, using 22 simultaneous internal explosions, in more than 200ft (60m) of water. Today it is one of the most popular diving sites in the US. The team in Hong Kong, however, hope their use of terracotta is an improvement on other methods of reef-building. “There are other researchers around the world working on 3D printing in relation to artificial reef-building,” say Lange. “But most of them are using concrete as a material to print. I haven’t seen any other project that uses terracotta clay to 3D print this kind of work.” Though terracotta needs to be fired to harden, it is considered more eco-friendly than concrete, as it requires less energy to produce; the manufacturing of concrete generates huge quantities of CO2 emissions. “Concrete contains cement, which is very caustic,” Baker says. “In seawater it maintains a very high pH value on the surface – which is damaging to many types of marine species. Concrete structures often seem oddly devoid of life or have very unsightly biofilms of algae, much of which doesn’t support corals or other marine life.” Terracotta is also similar to the calcium carbonate found in real coral reefs, which makes it more suitable. And crucially, ceramics like terracotta clay will naturally erode: in a few decades, the scientists hope, the tiles will be gone and all that will be left are the new corals. Early results since the deployment last month have been promising. “It’s encouraging that we see many species like small fish and crabs taking refuge in the tiles almost as soon as they touch the seafloor,” says Baker. “My hope is that the government will allow us to plant patch reefs that within my lifetime could be significant biodiversity hotspots, enjoyable dive sites, and contribute to increasing corals within Hong Kong through their reproductive output.” But the scientists all stress that no artificial reef technology is a panacea for coral reef decline. For one thing, they are expensive to produce and could not be cheaply scaled up. “3D printing does have a promising role in generating small complex substrates on which coral larvae can be settled and reared,” says Alasdair Edwards, emeritus professor of coral reef ecology at Newcastle University. “But with several tens of thousands of square kilometres of reef already trashed globally over the last 50 years 3D printing is clearly not a solution, but may have some minor role. The only solution is to curb greenhouse gas emissions.”"

 **Promise** : _Electric Vehicles_



“This ambitious plan to take real action on climate change will involve all New Zealanders. This government will act as a role model, showing leadership by requiring State-owned enterprises and other government organisations to pursue low-carbon options and technologies, including electric vehicles for all Government vehicle fleets.



 **Altered Promise** :



The Government quietly dropped their commitment this year to making the entire Government fleet emissions-free by mid-2025.



“When the coalition Government came into power in late 2017, the agreement between Labour and New Zealand First stipulated that the entire fleet would be emissions-free by mid-2025, ‘where practicable.’ Although it was repeated as recently as June, that goal has been quietly revised to a commitment that, after mid-2025, all new vehicles entering the fleet will be emissions-free.”



 **Promise** : _Green Investment Fund_



“The agreement between Labour and the Green Party also provides for up to $1 billion of new investment to be stimulated in low carbon industries by 2020, **kick-started by a government-backed Green Investment Fund of $100 million.”**



 **Incomplete** **Promise** : 



The money is allocated, but not a single cent of the $100 million Green Investment Fund that was supposed to kick-start $1 billion of investment in ‘low carbon’ industries has been invested.



 **Promise** : _Low Carbon Investment_



 **“The agreement between Labour and the Green Party also provides for up to $1 billion of new investment to be stimulated in low carbon industries by 2020** , kick-started by a government-backed Green Investment Fund of $100 million.”



 **Broken promise** :



Answers to Written Parliamentary Questions say the Green Investment Fund is looking at a number of opportunities, but the bottom line is this Government hasn’t delivered.



Not a single cent of the Government’s side of the bargain has been invested, which is why not a single dollar of private sector money has been either.



 **Promise:** _Greenhouse Gas Emissions_



“Climate change is the greatest challenge facing the world. If we do not urgently reduce our emissions of greenhouse gases, warming will disrupt the climate which our agriculture and other industries depend upon, and sea-level rise will affect our coastal cities, along with other profound changes.”



 **Broken promise** : 



Not only have they failed to deliver on this promise but emissions have gone up! 



The Climate Change Minister admitted emissions are increasing under this Government and will continue to for the next five years. National has supported a legislative framework in the form of the Zero Carbon Bill that will help deliver on everyone’s goal of reducing emissions.

A runaway JLENS aerostat highlights the uncertainty and risks of pie-in-the-sky green energy schemes.
JLENS blimp (US Army photo)
Guest essay by Tom Scott
One reason that a fragile naked human species has adapted to conditions in every corner of every continent is its ingenuity. Its is simply impossible to know the limits of homo sapiens. That said, one tactic of the green blob, used to rationalized the destruction of existing energy infrastructure, has been to throw out the possibility of one “free energy” scheme after another while ignoring or actively hiding the unknowns, risks, costs, and public dangers associated with each new proposal.
But first a quick review for those who did not see the news reports. On October 28th a 240 foot long (80 meter) aerostat, or tethered blimp, broke loose from its mooring and drug 6,700 foot of cable for some distance, apparently knocking out power for about 20,000 customers. This blimp was one of several in a multi billion dollar Federal system call JLENS. Two aerostats have been in service for less than a year in a Baltimore suburb, but this is at least the second time one of the devices has broken loose.
How could such a thing happen? At least one comment to the Baltimore Sun article referenced below was right on point.
“I worked on the PTDS (very similar) balloons in Afghanistan for a year and what they don’t tell you is that it’s not really the “wind” that makes them break free, it’s the slack and then sudden tension applied to the tether. You are NOT going to stop it. We lost millions of dollars worth of balloons over there.”
The JLENS aerostat operates on a 10,000 foot long cable. Consider for a moment some of the proposed power schemes wherein huge fleets of devices would float 20,000 feet overhead, tethered by 30,000 foot long cables, and collect/generate lots of “free” power.

What could possibly go wrong with that scheme? Not to mention the huge areas of airspace which must be confiscated from public use because of the cables and their swing and unpredictable catenary.

It would be impossible to make a blanket claim that pie-in-the-sky energy schemes could never work. And I applaud anyone who would apply intellect, hard work, and their own investor’s money toward innovative schemes. But a bird in hand is worth 100s of unproven ideas.
Until a concept is tested and proven by experience and a long operating record, and its costs and benefits are truly known, it can never be properly compared to a real production system, much less serve as a rationale for destroying existing infrastructure. If you think otherwise, I suggest you browse the past 90 years or so of “Popular Mechanics”, “Mechanics Illustrated”or “Popular Science” and then ask yourself why so many of those great-sounding ideas never made it past a drawing board and into everyday life.

"Your editorial (19 August) correctly points to the fact that the “money no problem” approach to tackling the short-term upheavals caused by coronavirus must now shift to tackling the climate crisis. If not, it risks the further alienation of young climate protesters, the exceptional Greta Thunberg and the countless environmental campaigners active over the past few decades. The catalyst for this is the need for new jobs in every community to counter the political, economic and personal trauma that will come in the wake of the coming tsunami of lost livelihoods across the country. An answer to the inevitable question of how to pay for such a transformation was provide by Larry Elliott’s observation (18 August) that the government’s money-printing programme of quantitative easing (QE) inflates the assets of the already rich, rather than helping rebuild the real economy. Given rising unemployment, it’s likely that QE is going to be required for some time to come. In that case, the government’s e-money printing presses must be used to help fund the employment of the millions of increased staff needed across all social sectors, from more care and health workers to teachers and police, while also funding investment in new climate-friendly infrastructure projects, such as making the UK’s 30m buildings carbon neutral and adapting existing infrastructure to deal with future heatwaves and flooding. This would be a serious start to healing the damage currently being inflicted on people as well as the planet.Richard Murphy Visiting professor, University of SheffieldColin Hines Convener, UK Green New Deal Group  • Join the conversation – email guardian.letters@theguardian.com • Read more Guardian letters – click here to visit gu.com/letters"

Guest essay by Eric Worrall
The Bank of England has stepped into the climate fray, with a claim that climate change poses a huge financial risk to UK based businesses. For once I believe the Bank of England is absolutely correct (more below).
According to the Sydney Morning Herald;
Bank of England Governor Mark Carney said Britain’s insurers face potentially “huge” exposure to shifts in climate-change policy and Group of 20 nations need to do more to combat associated financial-stability risks.
“The challenges currently posed by climate change pale in significance compared with what might come,” Mr Carney said in a speech at a Lloyd’s of London dinner.
“Once climate change becomes a defining issue for financial stability, it may already be too late.”
England’s central bank has been looking into the economic and financial-stability risks posed by climate change and Carney spoke as the BoE published a report on the impact on the British insurance industry. As well as physical and liability risks, British insurers, which manage almost £2 trillion in assets, also face threats from the re-pricing of investments in fossil fuels in the move toward a lower carbon economy, Mr Carney said.
“The exposure of UK investors, including insurance companies, to these shifts is potentially huge,” Mr Carney said. General insurers are the most directly exposed to such losses, he said.

Why do I agree with Mark Carney, that climate change poses a huge financial risk to UK based businesses? The reason has nothing to do with the weather, which, given the multi-decadal decline of weather extremes, is currently surprisingly benign.
In my opinion, the biggest climate related risk for owners of UK based businesses, is the risk of lunatic political interventions, which destroy the financial viability of your business.
WUWT reported that Shell recently abandoned exploring the US Arctic, because of regulatory uncertainty.
In the UK a similar scandal has erupted, with the closure of Redcar steel, a major steel works. One of the reasons given for the closure, and loss of thousands of jobs, is that the excessive green tariffs UK based steel plants and other intensive energy users have to pay, are making it impossible to compete with foreign businesses. (h/t Roger Helmer MEP)
Gareth Stace, director of UK Steel, said: ‘Sympathy and warm words are welcome, but Ministers must now get behind British steel and deliver the support that we urgently need.’
He called on the government to ‘create a level playing field for British steel by fully compensating the industry for the high cost of electricity caused by the imposition of climate change policies‘.

What should UK businesses do, to avoid catastrophic regulatory instability, and unsustainable, politically imposed green costs? One option surely well worth considering is to relocate business assets and infrastructure to Asia.
Asia does not appear to have abandoned cheap energy and economic sanity. As WUWT recently reported, China and Japan are stepping in, to finance energy / industrial infrastructure, and to facilitate economic activity on a scale which the Western world no longer wishes to embrace.
Businesses should also seriously consider moving their head office and share market listing, as well as their physical assets. There have been multiple suggestions over the years, that the global assets of businesses should be fully included in any carbon accounting regime, regardless of the regulatory regime in the country where the assets are physically located. Keeping the business head office in the UK might still leave a business vulnerable to future regulatory instability.

"I have noticed in the news that after twenty years of slapping a hefty price on carbon dioxide emissions, Norway’s carbon emissions have increased by 15%. Not that it matters, as carbon dioxide is not a pollutant anyway.
And China and India don’t even want to discuss carbon dioxide. But when they do they insist that, as it is we who are the carbon dioxide enthusiasts, we should pay. 
But here we are,  with a credit crisis and politicians panicking about infrastructure, they are tied in knots over how to go about imposing a carbon tax on the population. 
The futility of carbon dioxide taxation has been ably and practically demonstrated by Norway. But our lemming like politicians on both sides of the house are as enthusiastic as ever to impose yet another tax on the public.
Why don’t they be honest and just say “We intend to close Australia down.” Rudd wants to close us down in 2010 and Turnbull in 2012 or so. They both deserve to be bushed. (No pun intended).
Then we can select at random some sensible officials out of the phone book, and get on with the job of growing food and mining products for which the world is scrambling to acquire.

Very early on in the climate saga, the alarmist activists settled on a clear strategy. “Post-normal science,” they dubbed it. Despite its moniker, it has bugger-all to do with science. What it is, is **naked political activism**. In their own words, it means sacrificing rigorous truth-telling (you know: science) for “policy influence”.



To that end, they endlessly try to scare the pants off the gullible and uninformed. “Offer up some scary scenarios, make simplified dramatic statements,” as pioneering climate alarmist **Stephen Schneider** put it.



One of their favourite scare stories is that “we’re all gonna drown!” Back in 1988, climate doyen James Hansen was predicting that Manhattan would be flooded under ten feet of water within 40 years. Well, we’re three-quarters of the way there, and New Yorkers haven’t broken out the gumboots yet.



It’s no different in Australia.



In Australia, we mostly live near the sea. All along our coastline there is evidence of sea level fall, yes fall.



Where is the evidence for rising sea levels? 



Will you see how much sea levels have risen when you watch the fireworks over the Opera House in Sydney Harbour this New Year’s Eve — or will you see evidence of sea level fall?



Oh, shush, you! This is climate change we’re talking about! We don’ need no stinkin’ evidence!



The best evidence is that global sea level has fallen by at least 2 metres since the the Holocene high stand about 4,000 BC; that is about 6,000 years ago, a time known as the Minoan warm period.



The evidence in rocks and cliff faces all along the Australian east coast is that sea level was about 1m higher in the Roman warm period (year 0), and about 0.5m higher in the Medieval warm period (1,000 AD).



Conversely, it is believed the sea level was lower in the cold periods of 500 AD (Dark Ages) and the Little Ice Age (1,650 AD), maybe both 0.2 — 0.5 metres below today’s level. This last low sea level is particularly important, because it from this base sea levels are perhaps still rising back to average Holocene levels.



Still, despite the Chicken-Little screeching of the climate alarmists – not to mention the [high-handed judgments of globalist UN enforcers](https://www.pri.org/stories/2018-12-11/un-compact-recognizes-climate-change-driver-migration-first-time) – most of the world is stubbornly refusing to drown. Bangladesh, one-time poster-child of we’re-all-gonna-drown, is actually **gaining** land area. The vast majority of islands are either stable or growing. Well-documented sites around Australia, such as the Fort Denison show no sign of slipping under the waves soon.



Even the [Isle of the Dead](http://www.john-daly.com/deadisle/index.htm), in Tasmania, seems not to be the proof of accelerated rising sea levels that it was claimed to be.



But, ignore all that, children. Who are you going to believe? Your lyin’ eyes, or the globalists demanding more of your money?

Share this...FacebookTwitterAn open letter about climate politics from seven distinguished climate researchers and friends of science follows:
=============================================
Some 375 political activists attached to the National Academy of Sciences, supporting the totalitarian view on the climate question, have issued an open letter saying we “caused most of the historical increase in atmospheric levels of heat-trapping greenhouse gases”.

Harvard astrophysicist Willie Soon slams political open letter issued by 375 NAS activists, calling manmade global warming science a “totalitarian view”. Soon has been viciously attacked by activist groups, organizations and the mainstream media. He refuses to back down. Image: Heartland Institute.
Global warmists making outlandish and absurd claims…
We influence climate by returning to the air carbon dioxide that was there before. But so do termites, by emitting more methane than all the world’s farm animals combined. So do plants, by breathing carbon dioxide and returning oxygen to the air. So does the Sun, by supplying the Earth’s radiant energy. So do volcanoes, by ejecta that shade the Earth from the Sun. So do the oceans, by helping to keep the Earth’s temperature extraordinarily stable for more than 800,000 years.
The activists say we are warming the oceans. But even the worst assessment says this is just 1 degree Celsius every 430 years.
The activists say we are warming the lower atmosphere. Yet all data shows the atmosphere is warming at less than half the rate originally predicted by the error-prone Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change.
The activists say the oceans are “acidifying”. The truth is that we have no idea whether or at what rate the oceans are “acidifying”. What is known, however, is that the oceans are pronouncedly alkaline and are so powerfully buffered that alkaline they must remain.
The activists say our influence on climate is evident in “altered rainfall patterns”: but there is little or no evidence of a link between our industries and enterprises on the one hand and global rainfall patterns on the other.
The activists say we are to blame for retreating Arctic sea ice. But Arctic sea ice variations, if objectively quantified with proper error estimates, are fully within the large natural range of changes that have no need of any unique explanation by rising atmospheric carbon dioxide. In addition Antarctic sea ice, which they forget, has largely offset the loss of Arctic ice.

Failed predictions mean bad science
The activists declare their faith in the doctrine “that the problem of human-caused climate change is real, serious and immediate, and that this problem poses significant risks” to everything from national security via health and agriculture to biodiversity. But this statement is based wholly on faith and is unsupported by reality. We know this because of the serially failed predictions made by the activists. Good science makes accurate predictions.
The activists say, “We know that the climate system has tipping points”. Yet, revealingly, “Tipping point” is not a scientific but a political term. The activists say that “rapid warming of the planet increases the risk of crossing climatic points of no return”, but there is no evidence for rapid warming of the planet today.
The activists say warmer weather will “possibly” set in motion “large-scale ocean circulation changes”. The scientific truth is that, while the wind blows, the Earth rotates and its land-masses are approximately where they are, the ocean circulation must remain much as it is now. To suggest otherwise is mere rodomontade.
Totalitarians undercurrents
Scientists, like other citizens, are entitled and even encouraged to take part in the political process. This applies to non-citizens, which many of the 375 are. What scientists must not do, however, is pretend, as the activists did, that their totalitarian point of view is unchallengeable. In all material respects, unfolding events have proven their extremist viewpoint prodigiously exaggerated at best, plain wrong at worst.
Though the activists have attempted – falsely and improperly – to convey the impression that it is somehow illegal, immoral or damaging to the planet to vote for the Republican party’s candidate in the forthcoming Presidential Election because he disagrees with the totalitarian position on the climate question that they espouse with such religious fervor and such disregard for science, in truth it is not the business of scientists to abuse the authority of their white lab-coats by collectively suggesting that “Science” demands the voters should or should not cast their vote in any particular direction.
“Antiscientific letter”
Therefore, the signatories hereto repudiate the letter issued by the 375 activists as reflecting not scientific truth but quasi-religious dogma and totalitarian error; we urge the voters to disregard that regrettable and anti-scientific letter; and we invite every citizen to make up his or her own mind whom to elect to the nation’s highest office without fear of the multifarious bugaboos conjured into terrifying but scientifically unjustifiable existence by the totalitarian activists who have for decades so disrespected, disgraced and disfigured climate science.

"**The leader of one of Hong Kong's largest pro-democracy groups has been taken to hospital after being attacked.**
Photographs on social media showed Jimmy Sham of the Civil Human Rights Front (CHRF) lying in the street, covered in blood.
From hospital, the activist said he ""remained committed to the ideal of peaceful non-violence"".
Mass protests in support of greater democracy in the territory, which began in June, show no sign of abating.
The attack on Mr Sham came hours after the territory's leader suspended her annual address after being heckled in parliament.
The CHRF said he was set upon by a group of up to five hammer-wielding men in the Mong Kok district of the Kowloon peninsula, and left with head injuries.
It added that he was conscious as he was taken to hospital, and was in a stable condition.
It was the second time Mr Sham had been attacked since the protests began.
The CHRF linked the attack to government supporters, who are suspected of assaulting other pro-democracy activists in recent months.
""It is not hard to link this incident to a spreading political terror in order to threaten and inhibit the legitimate exercise of natural and legal rights,"" it said in a statement.
Jimmy Sham is a long-time political activist in Hong Kong, mostly known for campaigning for LGBT rights.
In the anti-government protests he has been one of the leaders of the Civil Human Rights Front, one of the non-violent protest groups behind several of the huge marches since June.
The group said it was applying for a police permit to hold a new march on Sunday.
Its recent requests have been rejected, while more hardcore activists have held protests in defiance of bans and clashed with police.
While still in hospital, Mr Sham released a statement on Facebook, saying the attack ""only enables me to connect even more"" with fellow protesters.
He also thanked the police for swiftly arriving to help him and urged them to find who was behind the assault.
Amnesty International urged the authorities to launch an investigation into the attack on Mr Sham.
""Jimmy Sham was left bleeding on the street and has been hospitalised with head injuries.
""Even in the context of increasing attacks on activists, this incident is shocking in its brutality,"" said the head of the rights group's East Asia regional office, Joshua Rosenzwei.
Opposition lawmakers disrupted the Legislative Council (Legco) session as Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam tried to make her annual address.
After a first interruption, the session resumed only to be interrupted again.
It was then suspended - and a pre-recorded speech by Ms Lam was made available on the Legco website instead.
It was the first time a Hong Kong chief executive had been unable to deliver a policy address in the chamber.
It meant a controversial extradition bill - the trigger for the months of protests - could not be withdrawn formally.
During a news conference after the video address, Ms Lam rejected claims that her speech had ignored the demands of the protest movement.
But she said it was not the time to consider voting reform, while insisting Hong Kong did have freedom of speech and freedom of the press without Chinese interference.
Hong Kong is part of China but, as a former British colony, has some autonomy and people have more rights.
The protests started in June against plans to allow extradition to the mainland - which many feared would undermine the city's freedoms and judicial independence.
The government in September promised the bill would be withdrawn once parliament resumed but demonstrations continued.
Protesters are now calling for five key demands:
Protests have taken place every weekend over the past month and in every district, causing widespread disruption.
Clashes between police and activists have become increasingly violent, with police firing live bullets and protesters attacking officers and throwing petrol bombs."
"The 2019 UK general election may be defined by Brexit, but the climate crisis has never loomed larger in the minds of voters. And the country’s two largest parties offer very different visions on how to address it. Labour may have stepped down from their commitment to net zero emissions by 2030, but their manifesto pledge is still ambitious: to deliver “nearly 90% of electricity and 50% of heat from renewable and low-carbon sources by 2030”, on track for “a net-zero-carbon energy system within the 2030s”. Meanwhile, the Conservatives have stuck with their recently upgraded target of net zero emissions by 2050 – but haven’t set any shorter-term targets on which they can be judged. Long-term goals matter – but any targets are dependent on concrete action to get there. Every year of unfettered emissions makes the task of limiting global warming below dangerous levels that much harder. I’ve analysed how the policy plans of Labour and the Conservatives stack up with their targets — and where this might leave the planet. In a nutshell, Labour’s plans for immediate action align well with both their targets and the country’s responsibility in the global effort to limit warming below dangerous levels. Meanwhile, the Conservatives’ path forward is less ambitious, lacks specific commitments, and is not sufficient to tackle the climate crisis. Labour’s manifesto contains a few key energy policy pledges, and promises to develop the more detailed recommendations contained within the party’s Thirty by 2030 report. In these documents, Labour promises 7,000 new offshore wind turbines – a more than threefold increase on the current 2,000 – as well as 2,000 new onshore wind turbines. They’ve also pledged to install “enough solar panels to cover 22,000 football pitches”. That means 30GW of onshore wind, 52GW of offshore wind and 35GW of solar energy by 2030. Taking into account the varying efficiencies and intermittent power generation of these technologies, that translates to roughly 32GW of usable energy. This is much more than the 14GW of fossil-powered electricity the country currently uses. In fact, it’s equivalent to the current average demand for electricity in the UK. Vaguer commitments to invest in further nuclear power and trial tidal energy will add even more clean power to the grid. Labour’s energy commitments are so high because they need to cover the vast increase in electricity consumption expected over the next decade as the UK replaces petroleum-powered vehicles and gas-fired heating systems. The scale of this increase is difficult to estimate, but a one-third rise from transport would be reasonable. If all fossil fuel-powered heating systems were electrified, the increase in electricity demand would be too big to handle. But Labour is planning to limit the rise in two ways. First, the party says it will retrofit homes, capture waste heat from industry, and ensure all new homes will be zero carbon by 2022, to reduce heat demand by 20%. Second, it will develop hydrogen-based hybrid heating systems alongside electric heat pumps – a crucial component of any future energy system because of the burden it can relieve on electricity and energy storage demands. Labour’s Thirty by 2030 report commits to 20GW of storage, and backup gas generation throughout the 2020s. This, as well as the party’s other commitments, will come at significant cost. But, if followed through on, Labour’s policy pledges back up its targets. Transport emissions, which account for a quarter of the UK’s total carbon ledger, are not included within these targets. Labour acknowledges the intimate links between the transport and energy sectors, and envisages 21.5m electric vehicles by 2030 – a massive increase on the current 250,000. However, it offers no detail on what it will do to get there, or how it will build charging infrastructure to support the transition. Unlike Labour, climate action is not headlined as a keystone of the Conservative party’s manifesto. While they mention their “world-leading” target to hit net zero emissions by 2050 multiple times, the document contains few concrete pledges that demonstrate any serious commitment to actually get there. The party promises an extra 31.5GW of offshore wind by 2030. However, it does not mention onshore wind or solar – technologies that have been stymied since 2015 by the Conservative government. The party therefore commits to adding roughly a third of the renewable power that Labour does. Instead, they back hydrogen produced from natural gas. In order to offset emissions from this and other sources, they commit to investing £800 million in carbon capture technology. They also voice support for nuclear fusion, echoing their recently announced vision to get the technology online by 2040. The problem is that both of these technologies do not yet exist commercially, and nor will they in the near future. Making nuclear fusion a viable power source by 2040 is extremely unlikely. Even if both fusion and carbon capture were scalable by 2040, that’s far too late. Using the most generous estimates, the UK’s remaining carbon budget for the century will be exhausted in eight years if current levels of emissions continue. For net zero by 2050 to work, emissions need to fall dramatically in the next few years. My research shows that backing renewables and energy storage is a much surer and more efficient bet to achieve these aims. Like Labour, the Conservatives intend to reduce heat demand, but beyond vague support for “environmentally friendly homes” and funds to improve the efficiency of homes and industries, details are nonexistent. Their transport commitments also lack detail, merely stating that they will “support clean transport” and “consult on the earliest date” they can phase out fossil fuel-powered cars. The Conservative government’s current commitment is 2040 – ten years later than Labour’s pledge. Finally, the manifesto pledges to plant 30m trees a year by 2025. But the party’s government planted just a third of the 11m trees it promised in 2015, and the new promise is still well below the rate that the government’s independent climate advisers state is necessary to hit net zero by 2050 – unlike Labour’s promise of 300m trees by 2025. Of the two parties, Labour’s manifesto is far superior on climate action. Its long-term goals give a much better chance of limiting global warming below dangerous levels, and its policy commitments are far more detailed, measurable, and aligned with its targets.  While the UK may only account for 1% of global emissions, the direction the country takes matters. The UK is seen as a major policy leader across the world. On this front, there is one final major difference between the manifestos that could be of particular global importance. If elected, Labour will calculate the country’s emissions based on what it consumes (including a TV imported from China, for instance), not what it produces. This closes a loophole through which developed economies – which tend to consume more than they produce, the UK included – can claim they are reducing emissions, when in fact they are outsourcing them to other countries. This is a much fairer way of apportioning responsibility for addressing the climate crisis, and focuses attention on one of its biggest root causes – consumption. If other countries were to follow the UK’s lead, the election of a small island could make a big difference on the world stage.

June brings with it sunshine and warmth – Germany can rely on that.
The German June mean temperature, however, has hardly changed over the past 85 years, as the official weather data of the German DWD National Weather Service confirm:

Figure: June mean temperature trend in Germany over the past 85 years. Data: DWD. Chart: Josef Kowatsch

What stand out are the negative peaks in the late 1980s and early 1990s. Then in the 2000s there was a sudden upward jump.
Today June mean temperatures have been moving well within a normal range. Of course this is much too boring for the media to report on. Luckily at the Die kalte Sonne website, you get all the facts unfiltered.

"(Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the  .) Good evening. Here’s the latest. 1.  President Trump’s aggressive moves on security and immigration drew strong responses both domestically and internationally. Tensions with Mexico are particularly high. Its president, Enrique Peña Nieto, above, canceled a meeting with Mr. Trump, and the two feuded  —   largely over Twitter  —   as reports emerged that Mr. Trump could consider a 20 percent tax on imports to pay for a border wall. Mexico said its 50 consulates in the United States would work to protect the rights of Mexican immigrants, while America’s   sanctuary cities, including New York, Boston and Los Angeles, vowed to resist   immigration enforcement. _____ 2. Mr. Trump told Republican leaders at a policy retreat in Philadelphia that this Congress would be the busiest “in decades, maybe ever. ” His adviser Steve Bannon deepened tensions with the news media, saying it had been humiliated by election missteps and should “keep its mouth shut. ” He added: “I want you to quote this. The media here is the opposition party. ” This may not come as a surprise: Sales of dystopian novels, most notably George Orwell’s “1984,” are spiking. Our literary critic offers a reappraisal. The Times is tracking Mr. Trump’s full agenda, and covering many more aspects of his administration. You can also sign up for our daily politics newsletter here. _____ 3. Vice President Mike Pence will speak at the   March for Life on the National Mall on Friday. Organizers have ramped up attendance efforts, not wanting to be embarrassed by a poorer turnout than the women’s marches last weekend. And health clinics across the developing world are bracing for cuts because of Mr. Trump’s revival of a policy prohibiting foreign aid to groups that discuss abortion, a rule that often curtails broader health services. Above, a woman who suffered complications from a botched abortion in the Democratic Republic of Congo. _____ 4. The Doomsday Clock has moved nearer to midnight than it’s been in more than 60 years. Devised by the nonprofit Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists, it’s meant to convey “how close we are to destroying our civilization with dangerous technologies of our own making. ” It debuted in 1947. Two of the group’s scientists cited alarm over Mr. Trump’s positions on nuclear weapons and climate change. _____ 5. In China, hundreds of millions of people are traveling from industrial regions to their hometowns to celebrate the start of Lunar New Year on Saturday. Some cities have restricted the use of fireworks over pollution concerns. _____ 6. For the first time, biologists have succeeded in growing human stem cells in pig embryos. The advance brings scientists closer to developing human organs in animals for later transplant. Since the organ would be made of a patient’s own cells, there would be little risk of immune rejection. _____ 7. Tributes to Mary Tyler Moore, the iconic actress who died on Wednesday at 80, continue to pour in. The TV journalist Jane Pauley, above, said the character of the single,   news producer Mary Richards was a role model and more. She even mimicked her fashion and home décor choices.

I have been watching “Hitlers Circle of Evil”  
It is like a documentary and can be viewed on Netflix.



Hitlers Circle of Evil: Series 1 This is the inside story of the rise and fall of the Third Reich told like the drama it really was: from the perspective of those who made it happen — the movers and shakers of the most evil regime in history. They were Hitler’s henchmen — the small gaggle of war heroes, misfits, careerists and fanatical Nazis who had the ear of the Fuhrer..



There are 10 episodes and it takes the viewer from the beginning to the end of the Nazi Party.  
While watching some of the episodes a number of times I thought…”That’s exactly what the coalition are doing.”



For example:



There are many more examples that came through the series.  
I believe that we should be very worried if Ardern gets another 3 years

"The Carbon Sense Coalition submission in response to the Government Green Paper on The Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme is here in full [PDF, 70 KB].
The recommendations are:

Abandon attempts to get global or national support for an Emissions Trading Scheme or any other carbon emissions reduction strategy.
Do not introduce ETS by stealth, by legislating for the whole reporting and compliance structure but with so many tax exemptions and compensations that most people do not notice the change. Once it is in place, and no matter what is promised, the Emissions Tax burden will rise, no matter what the Climate
does.
Accept “adapting to climate change” as the sole leg of Australia’s Climate Policy.
Support policies that allow markets to ration scarce resources.
Apply policies that impose costs and deterrents on real polluters.

"Major Australian insurer Suncorp will end any financing or insuring of the oil and gas industry by 2025, adding to the group’s existing ban on support for new thermal coal projects. The insurer revealed on Friday it had already stopped insuring, underwriting or directly investing in new oil and gas projects and would phase out underwriting and financing existing oil and gas businesses by 2025.  All direct investing in the oil and gas sector would end by 2040, the company said in a report. The announcement puts the company at odds with the advice of the government’s Covid advisory commission, which has recommended Australia’s economic recovery from the pandemic should have a focus on gas. Suncorp said the move built on its commitment last year to end any backing of thermal coal projects. In the company’s sensitive sector guidelines, Suncorp’s external investment managers were asked to apply a shadow carbon price as they looked at investment opportunities “to manage the risk of stranded assets as we transition to a net-zero emissions economy”. At the end of June, the company said fossil fuel extraction and generation made up less than 0.1% of its general insurance business. Among its insurance and shareholder investment assets, exposure was below 0.5%, and was less than 1.5% of all the investments it managed. “Suncorp will continue to underwrite, lend to and invest in companies whose business is clearly consistent with the transition to a net-zero emissions economy by 2050,” the report said. Current investments in low carbon industries stood at $236m at the end of June, the company said. Insurance companies globally are introducing internal guidelines restricting their exposure to fossil fuels. At least four insurers of Australia’s controversial Adani coal mine have backed away from the project. In 2019 Suncorp said it would not finance or insure new thermal coal mines and power plants and would not underwrite existing thermal coal projects after 2025. Campaign group Market Forces said it had been told by Suncorp the company had already begun offloading shares in oil and gas companies. Market forces campaigner Pablo Brait said Suncorp’s announcement still left “significant gaps” because it didn’t address pipelines or gas-fired power stations. But he said it was “a great step forward” and put the company ahead of many other insurers around the world in moving away from fossil fuels. Brait said: “Suncorp has recognised that an expansion in oil and gas production will undermine the Paris Agreement on climate change and worsen the floods, bushfires, droughts and storms which are hitting its profits. “With this new policy Suncorp has sent a clear message to the federal government, that it will not be a part of any expansion of dirty gas production.” Market Forces claimed QBE was now the only major Australia-based insurer without a policy on backing for oil and gas. Brait said: “QBE must stop undermining efforts to bring the climate crisis under control and join Suncorp and IAG in phasing out oil and gas exposure. “With global warming-fuelled extreme weather hitting insurance company profits it makes no sense for QBE to continue to support polluting industries.” QBE’s group energy policy says it will continue to back oil and gas because it could complement renewable energy in electricity grids and was an important fuel as the world transitioned from burning coal for electricity. A QBE spokesperson said the company supported the objectives of the Paris climate agreement and was implementing the recommendations of the international Financial Security Board’s taskforce on climate-related financial disclosures – a project chaired by Michael Bloomberg that encourages financial institutions and companies to disclose their exposure to risks from climate change. The spokesperson said: “QBE has already ceased direct investment in thermal coal and has committed to phase out all direct insurance services for all thermal coal customers by 1 January 2030, at the latest. We have also committed to setting metrics and targets to measure and monitor other climate related risks and opportunities this year. These will be published in our 2020 annual report.”"

Share this...FacebookTwitterAt BR Bavarian public broadcasting here, Judith Zacher writes how the Zöschingen wind park has lost the air under its wings and has disappointed investors. At the time it opened in 2013, it was Bavaria’s largest citizens-operated wind park. But the BR writes that “there’s not enough wind and the financial expectations can hardly be fulfilled.”
Back at the beginning of the decade when the park was under planning, there was considerable opposition to its construction. But the town’s mayor and the wind lobby prevailed and pushed the project through in 2011, in the wake of the German Fukushima hysteria. Moreover, studies and wind measurements showed there was enough wind to produce enough clean energy to make the project worthwhile. So construction was approved and the park with its 8 large turbines went into operation in the spring of 2013.
Only 1% return on investment
The Zöschingen project is called a citizens’ wind park because a number of citizens invested in the project with the hopes of seeing a strong return. However, Zacher writes at BR that those expectations have failed to materialize. Instead of the expected 9% return, the BR reports that investors received only 4.5% in the first year, and only a measly 1 percent over the following two years.
This seems to have become a typical story for many German wind park projects: big promises turning out to be huge disappointments. And every time the winners are few and always the same: the project planners and the land owner who makes easy money with leasing fees.

Wind has been much weaker than expected
So why isn’t the Zöschingen wind project delivering?
BR reports that although there have been productive months, overall wind energy output is still “20 percent below the expectations“. Before the project began, wind measurements had been taken over months, and three expert technical assessments showed the project would yield good returns. However since the wind park was built, the winds have not blown like they were expected to do. These things happen.
The BR report writes that the problem may have something to do with the turbines being located in a forest – too near to tree tops. Plant builder Georg Honold says the turbines should have been taller.
What’s left is a poor investment that has turned the landscape into an eyesore that everyone in the area will have to wake up and look at every day — for probably another 20 years.

"**Hong Kong's legislature has formally withdrawn a controversial extradition bill that has sparked months of unrest.**
The bill - which would have allowed for criminal suspects to be extradited to mainland China - prompted outrage when it was introduced in April.
Hundreds of thousands of people took to the streets and the bill was eventually suspended.
But protesters have continued regular demonstrations, which spiralled into a wider pro-democracy movement.
It is the worst crisis for Hong Kong since the former British colony was handed back to China in 1997.
It has also presented a serious challenge to China's leaders in Beijing, who have painted the demonstrators as dangerous separatists and accused foreign powers of backing them.
The proposed bill would have allowed for Hong Kong to extradite criminal suspects to places it does not have an extradition treaty with, including mainland China, Taiwan and Macau.
Critics of the planned law had feared extradition to mainland China could subject people to arbitrary detention and unfair trials.
The bill's formal withdrawal meets only one of five key demands emphasised by some protesters, who have often chanted ""five demands, not one less"" in Hong Kong's streets.
The others are:
Connie, a 27-year-old protester, told Reuters news agency the move was ""too little, too late"".
""There are still other demands the government needs to meet, especially the problem of police brutality,"" she said.
Carrie Lam, the embattled Hong Kong leader, has insisted that other demands by protesters are outside her control.
The protests - which began peacefully - now often descend into violent running battles between Hong Kong police and hardcore demonstrators who have vandalised shops and hurled petrol bombs at security forces.
Police have used water cannon, tear gas and rubber bullets in response. Live rounds have been fired on a few occasions, and an 18-year-old was shot by police in the chest on 1 October.
The Financial Times newspaper reports that China's government is drawing up plans to remove Ms Lam, a figure loathed by protesters whom Beijing has thus far stood by.
If Chinese President Xi Jinping approves the plan, the paper says, she will be replaced by an interim chief executive after calm returns to Hong Kong.
Ms Lam's office told the BBC: ""We do not comment on speculation."" China's foreign ministry said the FT report was ""a political rumour with ulterior motives"".
Separately on Wednesday, Hong Kong released the murder suspect whose case led to the extradition bill in the first place.
Chan Tong-kai is accused of murdering his pregnant girlfriend in Taiwan last year before fleeing back to Hong Kong.
But Hong Kong and Taiwan do not have an extradition treaty, and his case was cited when the government proposed amending the law."

As the ashes cool from Australia’s catastrophic bushfires, there are big questions to be grasped. Why did they happen, and what can we do about it? To that end, the Morrison government is hinting that it will convene a royal commission. As the saying goes, never hold an inquiry unless you know the outcome; and, indeed, almost everyone in Australia is certain that they have all the answers, already.



For the green-left, the answer is the same one that they have for almost everything: **climate change**. Many others, though, are adamant that the answer is one already put forward by multiple bushfires commissions, for the last 80 years: hazard reduction and mismanagement of the landscape, especially the wilderness. It seems that state governments, who are responsible for the latter, are worried that a royal commission will come to the same conclusion. Hence, they’re already marshalling their political forces against a commission – especially in Victoria.



For Morrison, then, a royal commission must seem like an unmissable opportunity to seize the narrative and hold negligent (mostly Labor) states to account for the disaster.



Most of the fires have taken place in forests for which the states are solely responsible. State governments know they would be held hostage to a royal commission of which they are part and they are probably petrified that once the monster is out of its cage, it will come to the conclusion that state governments grievously failed to insist on more backburning and to ensure the fire services were properly funded, staffed and equipped. The cunning Victorian government has already voiced its opposition to a royal commission and it is no co-incidence that it has a discreditable history of neutering the volunteer firefighters’ service and expanding the power of **Daniel Andrews’** mates in the highly-unionised city fire brigades.



But there is every threat that the commission will run out of the government’s control and simply become a bully-pulpit for the loudest shouters – the [Krazy Klimate Kult](https://thebfd.co.nz/2019/10/be-very-afraid-of-the-new-kkk/).



It will be the main vehicle that the Labor party, the Greens and the whole climate change and media lobby will use to beat the government over the head […] anyone with the right to appear will have an open go to say whatever they want in their so-called evidence. Witnesses will disparage anyone they wish and make endless speeches about the evils of climate change, how it alone has caused the bushfires and how the government is solely responsible for the whole disaster […] Picture Greta Thunberg in full flight, scowling and screaming ‘How Dare You?’ and you have a good idea of what the atmosphere will be like in a royal commission into bushfires.



As per [O’Sullivan’s Law](https://www.powerlineblog.com/archives/2012/02/osullivans-first-law-in-action.php), unless the government keeps a firm rein on the commission’s terms of reference and the appointment of its commissioners, the whole thing will become yet another Green-left circus. The left will almost certainly attempt to shoehorn the likes of a Flannery, a GetUp! activist, or some spotty “yoof” representative into a position of control.



Some form of inquiry is absolutely necessary, if nothing else, to call to account culpable state governments who’ve so far taken shelter behind the Media-left’s unhinged pile-on on Scott Morrison. A royal commission is not altogether unmerited (indeed, the roster of those most loudly opposed to it suggests who has the most to fear). But, unless the Morrison government displays the steely resolve of a John Howard, as opposed to the watermelon spinelessness of a Malcolm Turnbull, there is grave danger of it becoming the Klimate Kult’s very own inquisition.

"The world is often better and getting better than people think. Murder rates, deaths from terrorism and extreme poverty are all down. Life expectancy, health and education levels are up. But, as I explore in my book Why We’re Wrong About Nearly Everything, people mostly think things are worse than they are and going downhill fast because of the natural tendency of humans to focus on negative stories and forget how bad the past was. But there is one vital, even existential, exception: people still don’t realise how bad the world’s climate and natural environment have become. Misperceptions about climate change and the ecological crisis are all too clear from a new survey of Americans that tested their understanding of how far the problem has progressed in their lifetimes.

      What you think you know about the climate is probably wrong – new UK poll


 It’s an extraordinary fact that all 20 of the hottest years on record have been in the last 22 years. But when we asked the US public how many of the past 22 years have been among the hottest, the average guess is 14, and only 15% of Americans correctly guess that it is all 20 years. Democrats are slightly better at getting the right answer (23%) than Republicans (9%). It’s understandable that people might be poorly versed in statistics like this, but there’s also confusion over what the biggest causes of warming are. The people we interviewed guessed that 16% of global greenhouse gas emissions come from air travel, when it’s only around 2%. While aeroplanes emit a lot of CO₂ during each flight, air travel is still relatively infrequent, compared with, say, car journeys. The rarity of flying explains why, despite aviation’s relatively limited contribution to emissions, one of the most effective actions a person can take is to fly less. A study by Swedish academics puts skipping one transatlantic flight as the third most effective action someone can take, only behind having one less child and living entirely car free. But only 10% of the US public pick out skipping the flight as one of the top three. Instead, 45% thought recycling as much as possible is a priority for reducing emissions – a much less effective action than giving up just one flight. And that’s not the only misperception about recycling. People also think much more plastic waste has been recycled than is really the case. Our respondents thought about half of the 6.3 billion tonnes of plastic waste that has been produced worldwide is now languishing in the environment. Research shows it’s an incredible 79%. People thought that a quarter of plastic waste has been recycled, when it’s only 9%. The people we spoke to also didn’t realise just how much wildlife has suffered over the past few decades, and how precipitous the decline in populations has been. Only a quarter of the US public correctly identify that the population sizes of mammals, birds, fish and reptiles in the world have declined by 60% since 1970. Again, Democrats were slightly better than Republicans: 26% selected the correct, terrifying answer, compared with 16% of Republicans. Despite low engagement with the scale of the problems, people are still worried. Our new polling also showed that 60% of Americans reject President Donald Trump’s past assertion that global warming is an “expensive hoax” – and instead, 62% agree that the world is facing a “climate change emergency, with the threat of irreversible destruction of our environment in our lifetime”. But there are huge differences in these attitudes between Republicans and Democrats. Seven in ten Democrats strongly disagree that global warming is an expensive hoax, compared with just 17% of Republicans. Half of Republicans disagree that the world is facing a climate change emergency, compared with just 6% of Democrats.

      Deniers vs alarmists? It's time to lose the climate debate labels


 This very different view between party supporters is despite only relatively small differences in perceptions of the reality between the two groups. This shows that attitudes to big issues like climate change are sometimes so tied up with political identity, including attachment to political parties, that understanding the facts is often secondary. This is a real challenge for those campaigning for climate action. It’s not enough to just provide more facts and expect people to hear them and act, regardless of how extraordinary those facts are.

Share this...FacebookTwitterMore “consensus” science: Antarctica not influenced by AGW
By Kenneth Richard
In recent years, the headlines of common news sources have austerely warned that West Antarctica is melting rapidly:

“‘Nothing can stop retreat’ of West Antarctic glaciers” — BBC
“The melting of Antarctica was already really bad. It just got worse.”   — Washington Post
“West Antarctic glacier loss: We have passed the point of no return“ — Christian Science Monitor
“Antarctic ice melting so fast the whole continent may be at risk“ — The Guardian

Then, last November (2015) a NASA study (Zwally et al., 2015*) was released indicating that the growth in the Antarctic ice sheet (AIS) has been exceeding the losses since the early 1990s, and that the net mass gains from the AIS were negatively contributing to sea level.  This, of course, did not affirm the alarmist headlines.
RealClimate, an AGW blog co-founded by Gavin Schmidt and Michael Mann, necessarily cobbled together a response to the inconvenient study.  After all, a growing polar ice sheet in response to anthropogenic global warming did not advance the cause.
The result was an essay written by Jonathon Bamber – “So what is really happening in Antarctica?”** – which essentially characterized the Zwally et al. (2015) conclusion as a peculiar outlier. Most other papers on Antarctic ice sheet mass balance indicate that the AIS is losing about -50 to -100 Gt/year on average (which is the equivalent of about one inch per century of sea level rise contribution).
These studies were characterized as more likely to be accurate than the NASA-sponsored paper that found a net AIS gain of about +100 Gt/year.  In other words, “consensus” logic (the more people agree, the more likely they are to be right) was employed to “refute” the NASA study. This graph (below) from the RealClimate essay was featured as a visual representation of just how “out-there” the Zwally et al. (2015) paper was compared to the “consensus” conclusions of other scientists:

Image: RealClimate.org.
Sometimes, though, a thorough reading of entries on AGW blogs like RealClimate can prove enlightening. Buried in the comment section of this same essay — comment number 26 to be specific — was an admittance by Dr. Eric Steig (moderator of comments) that the evidence that the Antarctic ice sheet (AIS) responds to anthropogenic global warming, is “weak.” Not only that, he acknowledged that about half of scientists agree with him on this.
Dr. Eric Steig’s Comment 26:
I think the evidence that the current retreat of Antarctic glaciers is owing to anthropogenic global warming is weak. The literature is mixed on this, about 50% of experts agree with me on this.”
The admission that Antarctica may not respond to CO2 emissions, or anthropogenic global warming (AGW) in general, has been affirmed several more times in other recent scientific analyses.  The most recent example is a peer-reviewed paper by Smith and Polvani (2016) published online just last week. These scientists set out to determine if anthropogenic forcing can explain why West Antarctica has warmed substantially in the last few decades, or why East Antarctica has not warmed substantially during the same period.
After analyzing the factors involved for the warming of West Antarctica and the peninsula, Smith and Polvani concluded that an anthropogenic signal is “completely absent” when “natural climate variability” is included. In other words, “natural climate variability” is the driving force behind the West Antarctica and peninsula warming, and “there is little evidence of anthropogenic SAM-induced driving of the recent temperature trends.”
Below are the key points from the paper Smith and Polvani, 2016:
The recent annually averaged warming of the Antarctic Peninsula, and of West Antarctica, stands in stark contrast to very small trends over East Antarctica. This asymmetry arises primarily from a highly significant warming of West Antarctica in austral spring and a cooling of East Antarctica in austral autumn. Here we examine whether this East–West asymmetry is a response to anthropogenic climate forcings or a manifestation of natural climate variability. We compare the observed Antarctic surface air temperature trends over two distinct time periods (1960–2005 and 1979–2005), and with those simulated by 40 models participating in Phase 5 of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP5). We find that the observed East–West asymmetry differs substantially between the two periods and, furthermore, that it is completely absent from the forced response seen in the CMIP5 multi-model mean, from which all natural variability is eliminated by the averaging. We also examine the relationship between the Southern Annular mode (SAM) and Antarctic temperature trends, in both models and reanalyses, and again conclude that there is little evidence of anthropogenic SAM-induced driving of the recent temperature trends. These results offer new, compelling evidence pointing to natural climate variability as a key contributor to the recent warming of West Antarctica and of the Peninsula.

Here is a further sampling of some (6) other recently-published papers indicating that an anthropogenic forcing (warming) signal may not be detectable for Antarctica, or that natural variability dominates in that region:

1. Le et al., 2016
Our analysis suggests that internal climate variability played a more significant role than external forcings in short-term SAT variability in the regions of the North Atlantic, the North Pacific, the Arctic, the Antarctic Peninsula, and its surrounding oceans.
2. Garfinkel et al., 2015
Correct representation of the SSTs changes is important for the Northern Hemisphere, while correct representation of stratospheric ozone changes is important for the Southern Hemisphere. The ensemble-mean trend (which captures only the forced response) is nearly always much weaker than trends in reanalyses. This suggests that a large fraction of the recently observed changes [in sea surface temperatures, ozone] may, in fact, be a consequence of natural variability and not a response of the climate system to anthropogenic forcings.
3. Thomas et al., 2015
Introduction: It is expected that the observed recent atmospheric warming in this region [Bellingshausen-Amundsen coast region between the Antarctic Peninsula and West Antarctica] will result in increased snow accumulation, although the stable water isotopes from Ellsworth Land ice cores have shown that the recent rise in temperature here is not unusual in the past 300 years [Thomas et al., 2013]. Therefore, it is unclear whether these recent glaciological changes are part of a longer term natural trend or associated with anthropogenic climate forcing.
4. Altnau et al., 2015
For East Antarctica, no general warming and increase in precipitation is found in surface observational data (Turner et al., 2005; Monaghan et al., 2006, 2008). This is important because an increase in precipitation, and hence increased surface mass balance (SMB), might mitigate sea level rise. … We conclude that, in the last 2 centuries, conditions in the interior DML [Dronning Maud Land, East Antarctica] have been fairly stable and only weakly influenced by changes in atmospheric dynamics.”
5. Raphael et al., 2016
The Amundsen Sea low (ASL) is a climatological low pressure center that exerts considerable influence on the climate of West Antarctica. Its potential to explain important recent changes in Antarctic climate, for example, in temperature and sea ice extent, means that it has become the focus of an increasing number of studies. … The ASL has deepened in recent decades, affecting the climate through its influence on the regional meridional wind field, which controls the advection of moisture and heat into the continent. Deepening of the ASL in spring is consistent with observed West Antarctic warming and greater sea ice extent in the Ross Sea.”
6. Schmithüsen et al., 2015
For this region [central Antarctica], the emission to space is higher than the surface emission; and the greenhouse effect of CO2 is around zero or even negative, which has not been discussed so far. We investigated this in detail and show that for central Antarctica an increase in CO2 concentration leads to an increased long-wave energy loss to space, which cools the Earth-atmosphere system. … For most of the Antarctic Plateau, GHE-TES [greenhouse effect as measured by the Tropospheric Emission Spectrometer] is close to zero or even slightly negative; i.e., the presence of CO2 increases radiative cooling.
Yet, let’s assume the alarmist headlines are actually true and that indeed Antarctica has been melting rapidly, or has eclipsed the “point of no return.” If the burgeoning scientific “consensus” is that Antarctica is likely not responding to anthropogenic or CO2 forcing,  or that warming trends (for West Antartica and the peninsula) are predominantly a consequence of natural variability, the alarmist headlines forecasting an Antarctic ice melt catastrophe effectively lose their impact.
Apparently the scientifically “weak” evidence that the Antarctic climate is significantly affected by anthropogenic forcing doesn’t make a good headline.

There’s a law against shouting “fire” in a crowded movie theatre, based upon the notion that people will believe it and run over each other in the subsequent pandemonium. But when Al Gore recently visited burning Florida, shouted “fire,” and blamed global warming, there was no climate panic. What happened?



For years now, the Gore and Clinton administration has resorted to bathos in its desperation to sell global warming gloom and doom — first in an Earth Day snow job in 1995 and most recently in Florida.



Unfortunately, it hasn’t used very much science as it chases the global warming ambulance. Here’s what I mean:



March 1995. In his annual Earth Day address at George Washington University, Vice President Gore said, “Torrential rains have increased in the summer in agricultural regions.” Gore was referring to a yet‐​to‐​be published paper by federal climatologist Tom Karl, which demonstrated that the portion of total rainfall from two‐ to three‐​inch storms in the United States has increased from 9 percent in 1900 to 11 percent in 1950. That works out to 0.6 inches more rain per year, mainly before the greenhouse effect had changed much. We’ll bet most farmers could use plenty more rain in the summer.



February 1996. On February 5, many locations in the northern United States set their all‐​time records for lowest recorded temperatures on any date. On February 7, President Clinton blamed the cold on global warming. Any scientist in the world will tell you that the first thing that warms up are the very same air masses that set those record cold temperatures. The president is free to say that warming causes cooling, but he can’t veto the first law of thermodynamics.



On February 16, speaking into a raging snowstorm in Pennsylvania, President Clinton blamed global warming. But Atlantic Seaboard snowstorms always come close to being rainstorms because cold air is in such short supply. Warm up the atmosphere a bit and the snow changes to rain. Global warming will cause a blizzard in Washington DC only when hell freezes over.



September 1996. At an administration‐​sponsored “town meeting” on global warming, State Department officials said that the damage from recently landed Hurricane Fran was what you would expect from global warming. The fact is that maximum winds in Atlantic hurricanes have been declining significantly for the last 50 years. 



July 1998. Gore goes down to Florida to announce that the fires “offer a glimpse of what global warming may mean to families.”



April 1997. Speaking about the Red River flood in North Dakota, President Clinton said that “every American has noticed a substantial increase” of similar events “in the last few years.” That flood was caused by the melting of excessive snow. If Clinton’s people had bothered to check, they would have discovered the shocking fact that the warmer the winter is, the less it snows! Further, all the predictions of global warming concentrate their heating in the winter in the middle of continents — that is, places like North Dakota.



September 1997. Vice President Gore dragged a covey of quailing reporters up to Grinnell Glacier, in Glacier National Park, to announce, “This glacier is melting.” All midlatitude glaciers melt in late summer, because daytime temperatures reach their maximum. (It tends to be below freezing at night and in the winter.) But a check of the nearest long‐​term weather station at Kalispell, Montana, would have shown no warming trend in the last 100 years. Even the Park Service’s own literature says that Grinnell started to melt about 150 years ago at the end of the “little ice age.” 



October 1997. Vice President Gore traveled to the oxymoronic “El Niño summit” in California to conflate global warming and the natural temperature oscillation in the tropical Pacific. With him were the Federal Emergency Management folks and just about everyone else needed to shower the California electorate with tax dollars. In the final analysis, El Niño was a tremendous net benefit to the economy of the United States (about $20 billion) because of the lowered fuel costs that accompanied a mild winter.



July 1998. Gore goes down to Florida to announce that the fires “offer a glimpse of what global warming may mean to families.” Somewhat more embarassing is that the total insurance claims to date are a mere $300 million, about 1 percent of those that resulted from a decent Florida hurricane, and more in line with the claims caused by summer’s normal weather variation. 



In a one‐​hour infomercial broadcast by ABC’s Peter Jennings last April, both he and the veep lamented that Gore just can’t seem to communicate to the American people how important global warming is. The usual suspects came up: evil industry, bad people like you and me who don’t want to pay more taxes to stop global warming and people who think network news stories exaggerate things.



But the real reason Gore’s message isn’t resonating has to do with the common sense of the American people. They know that it snows less when it’s warm, that blizzards happen when it’s cold, that El Niño is as natural as prunes — and they know when someone is yelling fire in a crowded greenhouse.

"Helen Macdonald is very excited to show off her tattoo. It was one of the first things she did when lockdown eased and no one else has seen it yet. It is a seraph inspired by the gilded angels on “a completely over the top 19th-century screen by Sir Ninian Comper” in St Peter’s Church, Ely. He has a sword, “an expression of tender solemnity” and, most importantly for the author of H Is for Hawk, six wings, “which is very cool. I love him to bits.” Her parrot, called Birdoole (“slightly Games of Thronesish”), is wandering over the kitchen table. “Tattoos are all about mortality and getting old,” she says. “They are all about who you are.” The writer, naturalist, poet and illustrator, who turns 50 this year, insists it has nothing to do with a midlife crisis: “I’ve had loads of those already.” Instead, it goes back to her earliest days and the death of her twin brother soon after he was born. “It has taken me many years to realise that was a very important loss for me.”  Loss and grief are the emotional landscape of Macdonald’s work. H Is for Hawk, which tells of her attempts to train a goshawk called Mabel after the sudden death of her father, was at once a devastating memoir and an elegant addition to the burgeoning genre of contemporary nature writing, winning both the Costa book of the year and the Samuel Johnson prize for nonfiction in 2014. Where her first book was written “trapped inside the walls” of personal grief, her new collection of essays, Vesper Flights, is a lamentation for the world itself. “To talk about nature is to open yourself up to constant grief,” she says. The success of Hawk meant she was able to buy this cottage, crouched between a pub and a church in a tiny Suffolk village. The kitchen, overlooking a large chestnut tree and a field of barley, is a nest of foraged treasures: bird feathers (including one of Mabel’s, who died just before the book was published), her collection of glasses from extinct American airlines – Pan Am, TWA; a guillemot’s skull from a school trip when she was 11. “I remember being faintly surprised that all my classmates were absolutely horrified that I was cutting the head off this dead bird.” And it’s the first time I’ve gone home from an interview with the gift of a porcupine needle in my bag. Macdonald is Beatrix Potter with a tattoo. There are field guides in the downstairs loo and avian prints by David Hockney and Paul Nash on the walls. “I’m Jilly Cooper. Obviously!” she says of her conversion to the Aga, which, with the nature writer’s fondness for anthropomorphism, she likens to a “little sleeping dragon”: “I often feel there are three people in the house – me, the parrot and the Aga.” (She is so undomesticated her bank queried her lockdown purchase of a posh food mixer: “I am wildness,” she wrote in H Is for Hawk). As in her writing, she expresses herself in easy metaphors (grief is a “submarine”), her conversation a lively tumble of anecdotes, enthusiasm and facts. “I really like to think my subject is love,” she says. “Love of the world and the things in it. And a lot of the things that I love aren’t human. It’s not that I love them in preference to humans; it is just that I notice them and I want to tell everyone about them. I want to yell: ‘Look at this! Look how cool it is. It’s amazing!’” Birdoole clicks his beak appreciatively, his happy sound apparently. But, she continues, “writing about love means you are also writing about death. Because love and death and loss are all part of one thing, really, particularly now with the climate emergency. It is really hard to write about the natural world without writing about grief.” The world has changed scarily since H Is for Hawk was published, and she felt it was no longer possible to write a book about “voles plashing through the fens”. She wanted to examine why we value certain landscapes and creatures over others, “and how we can do our best to stop everything disappearing”. As she writes in one essay: “During this sixth extinction we who may not have time to do anything else must write what we now can, to take stock.” Vesper Flights is “a curious various creature”, she says, the essays (some of which began life as commissions for the New York Times Magazine and the New Statesman) taking the reader on exhilarating adventures: watching night migrations of birds from the top of the Empire State Building in New York; witnessing an eclipse on the Turkish coast; camping by a rumbling volcano in the Chilean desert. Closer to home, she goes mushrooming in Thetford Forest in Norfolk; visits a bridge over the M25 for deer to cross the motorway safely at night and goes swan upping on the Thames at Cookham to write about Brexit (“not a fan”) – “a little bit of an off-beam way of doing it”. And then there are interior journeys revisiting her childhood as a bird nerd (for a while, she tried to sleep with her arms in the position of wings), or exploring the almost religious rapture which nature inspires in her as an adult: “Love, beauty, mystery. Epiphanies, I suppose. Moments of grace.” The title is taken from the twilight flights of swifts, reaching as high as 10,000ft from where they can both perfectly orient themselves and see what weather is on the horizon. “It seemed to me the most astonishing metaphor, not only for spiritual flights, but also for what we need to do, sometimes for the good of us all: to break away from our everyday lives and try to get bearings on where we are and where we are going next,” she explains. And the view from above is really not great. “We are completely fucked,” she says. “We are pretty much in the apocalypse right now, we just expect it to take place in 24 hours. Actually, it just takes place in a slightly longer timeframe. It is going to be grim. We are going to have to adapt.” Solastalgia is a “heartbreaking” phrase mentioned in the book to describe the distress of communities affected by the Australian droughts. “Everything was dead. What does it mean to mourn your home? You haven’t moved geographically, but everything is different,” she says. It is something she feels we are experiencing already. “Now spring tends not to be this slow progression, but a sudden flourishing of life. There’s a sense that a lot of the things around us aren’t what they used to be.” Her lifetime, she says, has seen the most precipitous decline in nature, with the loss of more than half the world’s large animals and more than 3 billion birds. “We’ve just fallen off a cliff. What do you do when your life is being matched, hour by hour, day by day, with disappearances?” Memories of collecting caterpillars and frogspawn are being denied to children today, not because they are “stuck behind screens” but because nature isn’t as easily found. “It is really really sad.” A “gothic naturalist child”, she spent her early years roaming the grounds of Tekels Park, a walled estate owned by the Theosophical Society in Surrey: “It was like something from a kid’s book,” she says. “Fifty acres of formal parkland and meadow and forest. It was all a little bit ragged.” During this summer’s heatwave, Chobham Common, one of her favourite haunts, where she saw her first nightjars and adders, was devastated by a wildfire. Her father was the youngest staff photographer on the Daily Mirror, her mother was a journalist on the Aldershot News. Both parents were “wonderful”, indulging her passions with trips to Birdworld (“four flamingos in a concrete pond”), her own mecca off the M3, and to a local garden centre with a tiny aviary, where she would “literally cling on to the wire”. Paradoxically for a book about falling apart, H Is for Hawk helped her to feel whole for the first time: “I felt that all of me was in one place,” she says. “All those parts of me – the literary side, the more scientific side, the experiential stuff, all the bird stuff – all came together in one.” She likes to think of her essays as “conversations” with the readers, and tries to avoid the rather lofty, earnest tone of the nature books she read as a child. “It’s not as bad as it was,” Macdonald says of the tendency for the genre to be a bit of a Boys’ Own club, the exclusive domain of the “Lone Enraptured Male!”, as it was once put: white, middle-class, Oxbridge-educated. There have always been great women writing about nature, she says. This exclusionary rhetoric, an invisible “keep out” sign around the countryside, doesn’t only apply to female writers. “We desperately need more voices from black and ethnic communities.” She cites J Drew Lanham’s account of “growing up as a black nature nerd”, The Home Place, as an example of how the field needs to be widened. The first essay in Vesper Flight traces her fascination with birds’ nests back to her own first month spent in an incubator “when the world was nothing but surviving isolation”. Isolation and loneliness are defining themes of her work (new mothers have told her how much they identified with her feelings of fear and responsibility at being stuck at home with a young hawk). How did she fare during lockdown? When she wasn’t watching action movies on her computer, she says, she looked at the birds in her garden “in ways that I hadn’t really thought of for a while”. A few years ago, she was commissioned to write a radio play called Through the Wire – “It was terrible! Shall we say that I’m not very good at dialogue” – based on notebooks she found in the Oxford University library detailing how British prisoners during the second world war kept themselves sane by recording the minute movements of birds. “Nature in the pandemic worked a bit like that,” she says. “We looked because we were stuck.” She is sceptical about the claims that lockdown allowed nature to flourish. “Twitter was full of pictures of swans and dolphins,” she says. “In fact, the animals had always been there but we hadn’t seen them.” But she does take hope from people’s delight in small discoveries, such as the transformation of unmowed grass verges from “little green deserts” into “Alpine meadows” full of wild flowers. “There is a sense that a few eyes have been opened to the fact that maybe things can be different.” She feels the government’s handling of the pandemic has been similar to their approach to the environmental emergency: “Let’s make it your own personal responsibility, let’s not make any structural change.” Our only option, she believes, is unprecedented public pressure. “We need to get out there. We need to demand change.” She would have spent this summer in even greater isolation on Midway Atoll, a 2.4 sq-mile coral reef in the North Pacific Ocean, which she visited a couple of years ago as part of a project to count albatrosses. With more than 2 million birds across its islands, turquoise water and a nesting albatross every three feet, for Macdonald “it is like the afterlife in the best possible way”. According to Hawaiian tradition it is the place from which souls arrive and to which they return after death. Extremely low-lying, it now looks set to disappear into the sea as a result of the climate crisis. The atoll has inspired her next book, Midway, which will again bring together the political and personal. It explores our collective environmental shame – “If you are going to write about guilt you write about albatrosses, Baudelaire’s albatross, Coleridge’s albatross” – and the “dubious cultural shame” of being a middle-aged woman on her own, “the whole crazy cat lady thing”, although in her case the cat is a parrot. “Even though I feel my life is very fulfilled and I feel creatively fulfilled and have the deepest friendships, I still feel somehow I didn’t do it properly,” she reflects. “So I want to interrogate that a bit.” Above all, the book is going to be nothing less than a contemplation on the end of the world, “in a proper eschatological sense”. Hopefully, she says, there will be some jokes in there too. As she learned as a historian: “If you are going to write about something huge the only way to do it is to focus on something tiny and then spool out from that place.” • Vesper Flights by Helen Macdonald is published by Cape on 27 August.

 **Richard Harman** , in his first _Politik_ article of the year, focuses on a very interesting topic, _Facing up to the rise of populism._ He concentrates mainly on the views of David Parker and his concerns on the subject. Harman rightly points out that in Opposition the Labour Party opposed the TPP and then after the 2017 election made a few cosmetic changes and joined the trade grouping. Parker’s view is that trade is a way of defeating the rise of populism which he think is brought about in part by the ever-widening gap between the haves and the have-nots. He argues that while trade deals are often seen to benefit larger companies, e.g. Fonterra, it is beneficial to the country as a whole.



I would agree.



What disturbs Parker is the type of populism engendered by Trump & Johnson. He sees this form of populism as a possible threat to his party and is determined to stop it from taking root in this country. This brings an interesting scenario into play. For a political party to succeed with populism you first need a populist leader. **Labour has one, National doesn’t.** America has one as does Britain. The difference between the two overseas leaders and our one is that the two offshore have the ability to know how to retain the populist vote. Retaining the populist vote is all to do with introducing policies that are relevant to that part of the population and little to do with hugging and dress ups.



Harman says Parker is concerned about the survival of capitalism as it faces a series of direct challenges. What worries him is the rise of populism in the United States and Europe and its attractiveness to the blue-collar voter. Despite Brexit, I presume he lumps the UK in with Europe. He understands that for a traditional working-class party like Labour, that represents an existential threat. His mission, therefore, in politics seems to be to moderate capitalism so that those who might be tempted here to introduce the politics of Brexit or Trump or European nationalism do not get a look in. Apart from ACT, who are the only true right-wing party, who would he be talking about?



There are lessons here for both major parties. Labour needs to look after its working-class vote unlike its namesake in Britain and the Democrats in America whose only aim in life is to fail to get rid of Trump. In the British election, the northern and Midland red wall collapsed due to Labour losing interest in their core support. Labour’s support came largely from the young, the urban and the student voters. That is never enough to win an election. **Trump and Johnson won on creating jobs.** That is the number one priority for workers. Trump has done that and Johnson will do the same in the north of England. Labour here need to cut the Greens loose. The jobs they talk about under their ‘green energy’ nonsense are nothing more than a pipe dream. Anything that currently creates jobs in Taranaki or the West Coast they’re not interested in. Hence Shane Jones’s recent comments.



The lessons here for National are many but I doubt they’ll learn from them. First, make friends with the farmers. You are supposed to be their party. You need to show an independent stance in agricultural, environmental and climate policies. **Stop sucking up to Labour.** Introduce policies that create jobs. Embrace the populism Mr Parker is so afraid of. Do a Johnson. Do a Trump. **Support free speech.** Support responsible gun owners. Start looking like a true right-wing party instead of some wish-washy half pie lefty liberal outfit. But here’s the catch. To achieve the above it helps to have a populist leader.



David Parker is right to be concerned. Both in America and Britain, the working class voted right rather than left. Why? One word – jobs. In America, the workers saw industries fleeing the country and with them jobs. In Britain the workers saw Europe as the problem and therefore supported Brexit and Boris. Parker might want to moderate capitalism but that is the very vehicle for creating jobs. This is the ghastly conundrum for the left. They hate capitalism but know they can’t live without it.



So Parker wants to moderate it. In other words, half in half out. Doesn’t work. Just ask [Harry and Meghan.](https://thebfd.co.nz/2020/01/runaway-royals/)

November 30, 2015 – Today, on the first day of the United Nations’ twenty-first conference of the parties (COP-21) taking place in Paris, a new book emphatically rejects claims of a “scientific consensus” on the causes and consequences of climate change.
The authors are three prominent climate scientists affiliated with the Nongovernmental International Panel on Climate Change (NIPCC). The book is titled Why Scientists Disagree about Global Warming: The NIPCC Report on Consensus.
About the Book
“Probably the most widely repeated claim in the debate over global warming is that ‘97% of scientists agree’ that climate change is man-made and dangerous,” the authors write. “This claim is not only false, but its presence in the debate is an insult to science.”
With these words, the authors begin a detailed analysis of one of the most controversial topics of the day. The authors make a compelling case against claims of a scientific consensus. The purported proof of such a consensus consists of sloppy research by nonscientists, college students, and a highly partisan Australian blogger. Surveys of climate scientists, even those heavily biased in favor of climate alarmism, find extensive disagreement on the underlying science and doubts about its reliability.
The authors point to four reasons why scientists disagree about global warming: a conflict among scientists in different and often competing disciplines; fundamental scientific uncertainties concerning how the global climate responds to the human presence; failure of the United Nations’ Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) to provide objective guidance to the complex science; and bias among researchers.
The authors offer a succinct summary of the real science of climate change based on their previously published comprehensive review of climate science in a volume titled Climate Change Reconsidered II: Physical Science. They recommend policymakers resist pressure from lobby groups to silence scientists who question the authority of IPCC to claim to speak for “climate science.”
About the Authors
CRAIG D. IDSO, Ph.D., a climatologist, is one of the world’s leading experts on the effects of carbon dioxide on plant and animal life and is chairman of the Center for the Study of Carbon Dioxide and Global Change.
ROBERT M. CARTER, Ph.D., a paleogeologist, is emeritus fellow of the Institute of Public Affairs in Australia and author of Climate Change: The Counter Consensus (London: Stacey International, 2010).
S. FRED SINGER, Ph.D., a physicist, is president of the Science and Environmental Policy Project and founder of the Nongovernmental International Panel on Climate Change (NIPCC).
About NIPCC
The Nongovernmental International Panel on Climate Change (NIPCC) is an international panel of nongovernment scientists and scholars who have come together to present a comprehensive, authoritative, and realistic assessment of the science and economics of global warming. Whereas the reports of the United Nations’ Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) warn of a dangerous human effect on climate, NIPCC concludes the human effect is likely to be small relative to natural variability, and whatever small warming is likely to occur will produce benefits as well as costs.
NIPCC is sponsored by three nonprofit organizations: the Center for the Study of Carbon Dioxide and Global Change, the Science and Environmental Policy Project (SEPP), and The Heartland Institute.
This volume, like past NIPCC reports, is edited and published by the staff of The Heartland Institute, a national nonprofit research and educational organization newly relocated from Chicago to suburban Arlington Heights, Illinois.

"**The US National Basketball Association (NBA) has defended free speech amid a row with China over a team executive's tweet in support of Hong Kong protests.**
The tweet posted by Daryl Morey, the general manager of the Houston Rockets, caused uproar in China and his attempt to backtrack upset American fans.
But NBA boss Adam Silver defended Mr Morey and said the league would ""support freedom of expression"".
NBA games draw huge viewership in China, mainly via streaming platforms.
The Rockets have been popular there since the team signed Chinese star Yao Ming in 2002. Mr Yao now heads the Chinese Basketball Association (CBA).
But Mr Morey's tweet prompted a furious backlash in China, with broadcasters vowing to stop airing Rockets games.
They went further on Tuesday by scrapping plans to broadcast two NBA pre-season games being played in China.
The NBA is just the latest international business to be embroiled in controversy in both China and the US over the Hong Kong protests. But the organisation's strong defence of freedom of expression is unusual.
On Friday, Mr Morey posted a tweet with an image captioned: ""Fight For Freedom. Stand With Hong Kong.""
He was referencing months of pro-democracy protests in the territory, which is part of China but enjoys unique freedoms.
Chinese officials and media have reacted furiously to foreign expressions of support for the protesters and accused the West of interfering in Chinese affairs.
In response to Mr Morey's tweet, state-run broadcaster CCTV and Tencent Holdings, which streams NBA games in China, said they would stop broadcasting Rockets matches.
On Sunday the CBA suspended co-operation with the team, as did Chinese sportswear brand Li-Ning and the club's sponsor in China, Shanghai Pudong Development Bank.
On Monday, Mr Morey deleted the tweet and said: ""I was merely voicing one thought, based on one interpretation, of one complicated event.""
""I have always appreciated the significant support our Chinese fans and sponsors,"" he added.
But American fans reacted angrily to his apology, with one tweet saying: ""You shouldn't have to apologise for supporting freedom.""
On Tuesday Mr Silver issued a statement saying: ""The NBA will not put itself in a position of regulating what players, employees and team owners say or will not say on these issues.""
He later told reporters in Japan that the league would not compromise its values on freedom of speech and was motivated by more than money.
The NBA commissioner said he understood there would be consequences but that ""we will have to live with those consequences.""
He said he would travel to Shanghai on Wednesday and meet the officials to try to ""find mutual respect"". But he recognised that ""this issue might not die down so quickly"".
His defence of free speech in the face of Chinese anger is seen as a bold move, given the potential financial impact for the NBA.
""The vast majority of foreign companies apologize profusely at the first sign of discontent from Chinese consumers, which makes the NBA's response all the more remarkable,"" tweeted Mark Dreyer, an expert on China's sports industry.
Initially the Rockets and the NBA distanced themselves from Mr Morley's tweet. This provoked accusations from both Democratic and Republican lawmakers that the league was bowing to Beijing.
Former US presidential hopeful - and Rockets fan - Ted Cruz accused the NBA of ""shamefully retreating"" in pursuit of profit.
Mr Cruz said he was proud to see Mr Morey ""call out the Chinese Communist Party's repressive treatment of protestors in Hong Kong"".
Fellow Republican Senator Ben Sasse called the NBA's response ""shameful"".
Democratic presidential hopeful Julian Castro tweeted that the US must ""not allow American citizens to be bullied by an authoritarian government"".
Also on Tuesday, a Hong-Kong professional gamer was banned by game-maker Blizzard from competing for 12 months for staging an anti-government protest.
Ng Wai Chung put on a gas mask and shouted: ""Liberate Hong Kong, revolution of our age,"" after a Grandmasters Hearthstone tournament.
In September, Zara became a target of anger on Chinese social media after some of its Hong Kong stores closed on a day of strike action.
China accused the retailer of encouraging its employees to join the strike but Zara said it was just ensuring its shops were not understaffed if transport was disrupted.
In August the chief executive of airline Cathay Pacific stood down after the company shifted its stance on whether employees could join protests.
And in the same month Versace had to apologise to China after one of its T-shirts appeared to imply Hong Kong and Macau were independent territories."
"By Bob Long
I notice someone running advertisements saying that as livestock are greenhouse emitters, we should all become vegetarians.
But this business about blaming livestock for greenhouse gas emissions is nonsense. It’s true that livestock do emit CO2 and/or methane (CH4) – but that’s only part of the story. From where does the carbon come that comprises that CO2 or CH4? From the food that the livestock eat. That is plants, which extract CO2 from the atmosphere. So animals don’t generate carbon products – they simply recycle them. In short, livestock are already carbon neutral. Likewise, so are humans (as far as our eating, burping and farting goes) – we eat either carbon neutral animals, or plants.
In fact if the vegetarians claim livestock are bad with respect to greenhouse gas emissions, then becoming vegetarian makes themselves no better than those animals, because livestock are vegetarians, too!

 **[Dale Nimmo](https://theconversation.com/profiles/dale-nimmo-15432)**  
[Charles Sturt University](https://theconversation.com/institutions/charles-sturt-university-849)



Have you ever wondered how our native wildlife manage to stay alive when an inferno is ripping through their homes, and afterwards when there is little to eat and nowhere to hide? The answer is adaptation and old-fashioned ingenuity. 



Australia’s bushfire season is far from over, and the cost to wildlife has been epic. A [sobering estimate](https://sydney.edu.au/news-opinion/news/2020/01/03/a-statement-about-the-480-million-animals-killed-in-nsw-bushfire.html) has put the number of animals killed across eastern Australia at 480 million – and that’s a conservative figure.



But let’s look at some uplifting facts: how animals survive, and what challenges they overcome in the days and weeks after a fire.



In 2018, a staff member at Audubon Zoo in the United States accidentally burned pastry, and [noticed something peculiar](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10164-019-00628-z). In nearby enclosures ten sleepy lizards, or _Tiliqua rugosa_ , began pacing and rapidly flicking their tongues. But sleepy lizards in rooms unaffected by smoke remained burrowed and calm. 



It was obvious the lizards sensed the smoke from the burnt pastry, probably through olfaction, or sense of smell (which is enhanced by [tongue flicking](https://theconversation.com/explainer-why-do-snakes-flick-their-tongues-29935)). So the lizards were responding as they would to a bushfire. 



In Australia, experiments have shown smoke also awakens [Gould’s long-eared bats](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0031938417304419) and [fat-tailed dunnarts](https://www.une.edu.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0018/111825/StawskiMatthewsKoertnerGeiser_SmokeAshTorporActivity_PhysiolBehav2015.pdf), enabling their escape from fire.



Animals also recognise the distinct sounds of fire. Reed frogs [flee towards cover](https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rspb.2002.1974) and eastern-red bats wake from torpor [when played the crackling sounds of fire](https://sbdn.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/Scesny-MS-Thesis-2006-Red-bats-and-fire-detection.pdf). 



Other species detect fire for different reasons. Fire beetles from the genus _[Melanophila](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melanophila)_ depend on fire for reproduction, as their larvae develop in the wood of burned trees. They can detect fire chemicals [at very low concentrations](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/j.2161-4296.2008.tb00424.x), as well as infrared radiation from fires. 



The beetles can detect very distant fires; [one study](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article/related?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0037627) suggests individuals of some species identify a fire from 130km away. 



Once an animal becomes aware of an approaching fire, it’s decision time: stay or go?



It’s common to see large animals fleeing a fire, such as the kangaroos filmed [hopping from a fire front in Monaro](https://www.facebook.com/abcinsydney/videos/3094496487228353/?t=3) in New South Wales a few days ago. Kangaroos and wallabies make haste to [dams](https://twitter.com/matthewjohngill/status/1211986832763707392) and creek lines, sometimes even [doubling back through a fire front](https://www.publish.csiro.au/wr/Fulltext/WR08029) to find safety in areas already burned. 



Other animals prefer to stay put, seeking refuge in burrows or under rocks. Smaller animals will happily [crash a wombat burrow](https://media.australianmuseum.net.au/media/dd/Uploads/Documents/38347/ams370_vXVIII_05_LowRes.ffb19ac.pdf) if it means surviving a fire. Burrows buffer animals from the heat of fires, depending on their depth and nearby [fuel loads](https://www.jstor.org/stable/pdf/2404417.pdf?refreqid=excelsior%3A123188cf5406548889c46d62508dae77). 



From here, animals can [repopulate the charred landscape as it recovers](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/ecog.02251). For example, [evidence suggests](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/ecog.02251) populations of the agile antechinus (a small carnivorous marsupial) and the bush rat recovered primarily from _within_ the footprint of Victoria’s Black Saturday fires.



The hours, days, and weeks after fire bring a new set of challenges. Food resources will often be scarce, and in the barren landscape some animals, such as lizards and smaller mammals, [are more visible to hungry predators](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0006320715002086).



[Birds of prey arrive quickly at fires](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/ece3.3401). [Several species](https://bioone.org/journals/Journal-of-Ethnobiology/volume-37/issue-4/0278-0771-37.4.700/Intentional-Fire-Spreading-by-Firehawk-Raptors-in-Northern-Australia/10.2993/0278-0771-37.4.700.full) in northern Australia have been observed intentionally spreading fires by transporting burning sticks in their talons or beaks.



[One US study](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/ece3.3401) published in 2017 recorded a seven-fold increase in raptor activity during fire. They begin hunting as the fires burn, and [hang around for weeks or months to capitalise on vulnerable prey](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1365-2028.1987.tb01088.x). 



In Australia, introduced predators can also be drawn to fires. Feral cats have been observed travelling up to 12.5km from their home ranges [towards recently burned](https://openresearch-repository.anu.edu.au/bitstream/1885/153672/2/01_McGregor_Extraterritorial_hunting_2016.pdf) savanna ecosystems, potentially drawn by distant smoke plumes promising new prey.



[A 2016 study](https://bioone.org/journals/Wildlife-Research/volume-42/issue-8/WR15011/Amplified-predation-after-fire-suppresses-rodent-populations-in-Australias-tropical/10.1071/WR15011.full) found a native rodent was 21 times more likely to die in areas exposed to intense fire compared to unburned areas, mostly due to predation by feral cats. Red foxes have an [affinity for burned areas too](https://besjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/1365-2656.13153). 



So should a little critter hunker down, or begin the hazardous search for a new home?



Perhaps because of the risks of moving through an exposed landscape, several Australian mammals have learnt to minimise movement following fire. This might allow some mammal populations to recover from within a fire footprint.



Native mammals have been found [hiding in beds of ash](https://media.australianmuseum.net.au/media/dd/Uploads/Documents/38347/ams370_vXVIII_05_LowRes.ffb19ac.pdf) after fires. 



Short-beaked echidnas seek refuge and, when finding it, [lower their body temperature and limit activity](https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/full/10.1098/rspb.2016.0382), so reducing the amount of food they need for energy. Despite their spiny defences, echidnas have been found more often [in the stomachs of foxes following fire](https://academic.oup.com/jmammal/article/98/3/835/3063279), so staying put in a little refuge is a good move.



Small marsupials such as brown and yellow-footed antechinus also [use torpor to suppress their energy use](https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/full/10.1098/rsbl.2015.0134) and therefore the need to seek food.



Not all wildlife have adapted to stay put after a fire, and moving in search of a safe haven might be the best option.



Animals might take short, information-gathering missions from their refuges into the fireground before embarking on a risky trek. They may, for example, spot a large, unburned tree that would make good habitat, and so move towards it. Without such cues to orient their movement, animals spend more time travelling, wasting precious energy reserves and [increasing the risk ](https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/full/10.1098/rspb.2008.1958)of becoming predator food. 



Australia’s animals have a long, impressive history of co-existing with fire. However, a [recent study](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/brv.12486) I led with 27 colleagues considered how relatively recent threats make things much harder for animals in fire-prone landscapes.



Some native species are not accustomed to dealing with red foxes and feral cats, and so might overlook cues that indicate their presence, and make the bad decision to move through a burned landscape when they should stay put. 



When fires burn habitat in agricultural or urban landscapes, animals might encounter not just predators but vehicles, livestock and harmful chemicals. 



And as this bushfire season has made brutally clear, climate change is increasing the scale and intensity of bushfires. This reduces the number of small refuges such as fallen logs, increases the distance animals must cover to find new habitat and leaves fewer cues to direct them to safer places.



We still have a lot to learn about how Australia’s wildlife detect and respond to fire. Filling in the knowledge gaps might lead to new ways of helping wildlife adapt to our rapidly changing world.

"Think about the way plastic pollution has been reported in recent years and you’re probably picturing plastic packaging, films and microfibres. But Christmas brings a deluge of another relatively short-lived plastic product that has received a lot less attention – children’s toys.  Children’s toys form a large and growing global market worth USD$90.4 billion in 2018. Unlike low weight packaging and film, toys often contain far larger quantities of high-quality virgin plastic material – and they usually last a lot longer than their owner’s interest, such is the rapid pace of child development.  We wanted to find out which toys are best for the planet, to help parents make a sustainable choice of gifts for their children at Christmas. Our research considered a wide range of children’s toys and compared high-value branded toys with those that were cheaper and unbranded. By studying the life cycles of a range of children’s toys, we were able to determine their environmental impact and calculate how much energy goes into making and using each toy throughout its lifespan. We calculated the energy used to extract and process the raw materials, ship the product, deliver any power requirements such as batteries as well as energy that is lost, used or recovered through recycling or disposing of the toy at the end of its life. We found that toys that are kept longer, resold or donated secondhand, have a lower yearly environmental impact overall, as this is likely to negate the manufacture and purchase of new toys. Toys that maintained their interest and relevance to children over time, had multiple uses or could added to as part of a collection had the greatest potential for longer lifespans. We also considered the secondhand prices of toys online and asked the opinions of secondhand retailers such as charity shops and parents and childcare workers. As you might expect, the secondhand value of a toy is greater for those that are initially more expensive. Higher-value branded products were more likely to be resold whereas cheaper alternatives were more likely to be sent to landfill or donated rather than sold. So which toys were the most and least sustainable? Construction toys such as Lego and Meccano scored well because they can be used for longer and are suitable for children over a wider age range. These collections can be added to and customised, ensuring that they remain challenging and enjoyable as the child grows. Such toys have maintained their popularity over generations and so retain a good residual secondhand value and are more likely to be resold. The least sustainable toys were typically those that contained electronics. These toys require larger amounts of energy during manufacture, and the electronics hamper their capacity to be recycled. Electronic toys also rely on batteries and tend to only be relevant to younger children, giving them a short lifespan. They are often relatively cheap when new, limiting their value in secondhand sales. Some electronic soft toys are particularly hard to clean, meaning that they are often discarded rather than donated. For early development playthings, the parents and carers we interviewed strongly preferred wooden toys. Secondhand retailers said that wooden toys such as stacking rings and blocks retain relatively high secondhand values, and can have second – or even third – lives. But plastic toys shouldn’t necessarily be demonised – especially products like Lego. Good quality plastic toys are typically highly durable and are easily cleaned before resale.

      Dreaming of a green Christmas? Here are five ways to make it more sustainable


 Top tips for toy purchases this Christmas: Buy secondhand wherever possible. Consider signing up to a local toy library if there’s one in your area. For a small fee per toy or a subscription you can borrow toys as you would a book in a normal library. Avoid electronic toys, especially for lower age groups where a child’s capabilities and interests change rapidly.  Consider how long the toy may be relevant to your child. If buying short-lived toys such as art and craft-based toys, try to ensure that the materials are biodegradable or reusable."
"For the first time, biologists have succeeded in growing human stem cells in pig embryos, shifting from science fiction to the realm of the possible the idea of developing human organs in animals for later transplant. The approach involves generating stem cells from a patient’s skin, growing the desired new organ in a large animal like a pig, and then harvesting it for transplant into the patient’s body. Since the organ would be made of a patient’s own cells, there would be little risk of immune rejection. The    pigs would be examples of chimeras, animals composed of two different genomes. They would be generated by implanting human stem cells into an early pig embryo, resulting in an animal composed of mixed pig and human cells. One team of biologists, led by Jun Wu and Juan Carlos Izpisua Belmonte at the Salk Institute, has shown for the first time that human stem cells can contribute to forming the tissues of a pig, despite the 90 million years of evolution between the two species. Another group, headed by Tomoyuki Yamaguchi and Hideyuki Sato of the University of Tokyo, and Hiromitsu Nakauchi of Stanford, has reversed diabetes in mice by inserting pancreas glands composed of mouse cells that were grown in a rat. The Salk team’s report is published in Thursday’s issue of Cell and the   team’s in Wednesday’s issue of Nature. The two reports together establish the feasibility of trying to grow replacement human organs in animals, though such a goal is still far off. “I think this is very promising work in principle,” said Rudolf Jaenisch, a stem cell expert at the Whitehead Institute in Cambridge, Mass. Many technical and ethical barriers have yet to be overcome, but the research is advancing alongside the acute need for organs some 76, 000 people in the United States alone are awaiting transplants. Creating chimeras, especially those with human cells, may prove controversial, given the possibility that test animals could be humanized in undesirable ways. One would be if human cells should be incorporated into a pig’s brain, endowing it with human qualities. Almost no one wants a talking pig. Another untoward outcome would be if human cells should come to compose the pig’s reproductive tissues. Few people want to see what might result from the union between a pig with human sperm and a sow with human eggs. In 2005, Senator Sam Brownback of Kansas introduced a bill imposing a $1 million fine on anyone creating and profiting from a chimera with human cells in its brain or reproductive tissues. That bill went nowhere, but in deference to public concerns the National Institutes of Health in 2015 instituted a moratorium on using public funds to insert human cells into animal embryos. The N. I. H. proposed last August to lift the ban, but to require grant proposals involving the insertion of human stem cells into early animal embryos to be examined by an expert committee. The public comment period on the proposal drew 22, 000 responses that it reviewed. . The ban is still in place, and it’s unclear whether the Trump administration would continue to consider lifting the moratorium or whether new objections would be raised to using public funds for this line of research. “We have no indication one way or another that they have any opinions on this,” said Carrie D. Wolinetz, the associate director for science policy at the N. I. H. Insertion of human stem cells into the early embryos of monkeys was prohibited in 2009, and remains so because monkeys, given their evolutionary closeness to humans, might easily have their brains altered by human cells. Biologists’ interest in chimeras has been prompted by the limited success in coaxing medically useful tissues from stem cells grown in glassware.   human stem cells were first derived from human embryos in 1998 and from ordinary adult tissue cells in 2007. After each discovery there were hopes of converting the cells into therapeutic tissues by exposing them in glassware to the sequence of natural chemicals that in the living embryo directs them into constructing the heart, brain, lungs and other organs. But no one knows exactly what sequence of chemicals is required for the generation of each different tissue or organ. This may be why glassware experiments with stem cells have not yet lived up to their full promise. Some biologists believe a better approach may be to grow stem cells not in glassware but in a developing embryo, where they will be exposed to the natural sequence of chemicals required to induce each type of organ. “In the last 18 years, hundreds of labs, including ours, have tried to generate different cell types from human pluripotent stem cells in the culture dish with a cocktail of factors,” Dr. Izpisua Belmonte said. “But the cocktails are not identical to what the cells experience in the embryo. So I thought, ‘Why not let nature do the job? ’” Dr. Izpisua Belmonte’s and Dr. Nakauchi’s teams have both pursued a strategy of directing the human donor cells to generate specific organs in the recipient species. This is desirable for both technical and ethical reasons. Dr. Nakauchi has disabled the master gene in rats for making a pancreas so that when mouse stem cells are injected into the early embryo of such a rat, the growing embryo has no choice but to construct its pancreas of pure mouse cells, instead of the usual mixture of rat and mouse cells. Generating inviting homes for the donor cells may reduce the risk that they will be incorporated in nontarget tissues like the brain or reproductive tissues. Also, an organ made purely of donor cells can be transplanted into the donor animal with minimal fear of rejection. In practice, about 10 percent of the mouse pancreases generated in rats was composed of rat cells, because the rat supplies the blood vessels for the organ. But the rat blood vessels seem to be quickly replaced when the organs are transferred to mice. The mice with their new pancreases lived in good health for a year after the transplant. They came from the same inbred strain as the donor mice, so they did not reject their new organs. The result provides proof of principle that Type 1 diabetes can be treated by growing a pancreas from an individual’s cells in another animal, Dr. Nakauchi and colleagues conclude. The next step is to repeat the experiment in pigs, which produce organs of a more suitable size for use in humans. Dr. Izpisua Belmonte’s team has now shown that human stem cells do survive in pig embryos and help form their organs, although not very efficiently. “The human cell doesn’t contribute much. To the brain we observed little or no contribution at all,” said his colleague Dr. Wu. “This is good news because we can guide the human cells to the organ we want. ” Both Dr. Izpisua Belmonte and Dr. Nakauchi said there was a long way to go before human organs could successfully be grown in animals like pigs. Chimeras will be more immediately useful in studying human embryogenesis, testing drugs and following the progress of disease. To achieve the goal of growing human organs for transplant, researchers must first engineer pigs that cannot make the organ of interest. In mice, this has already been done for the pancreas, heart and eye. They must then show that human stem cells can construct such an organ in a pig. Since the pig will supply the blood vessels and nerves, these will need to be replaced by the recipient’s cells after transplant without triggering immune rejection. If rejection does occur, the researchers will have to knock out the pig’s vasculature genes and arrange for these too to be humanized. Complex organs, like the heart, will be harder to grow than those like the pancreas which has a single kind of progenitor cell. All these steps, though they seem feasible, will require several years to develop and test. Both scientists expressed confidence that ethical concerns about chimera research could be addressed. Chimeras are typically mosaics in which each organ is a mixture of the host and donor cells. But new techniques like the   gene editing system should allow the human cells in a pig embryo both to be channeled into organs of interest and to be excluded from tissues of concern like the brain and reproductive tissues. “This isn’t dangerous research. We’re not creating monsters,” Dr. Nakauchi said. “There isn’t a need to get into a debate about moral humanization if scientists target the organs where the human cells will go,” said Insoo Hyun, a medical ethicist at Case Western Reserve University. “Scientists are not making chimeras just for fun  —   it’s to relieve the dire shortage of transplantable organs. ” Concern about human cells’ incorporation into a lower animal’s brain is not without basis. Dr. Steven Goldman of the University of Rochester Medical Center found in 2013 that mice injected with a special type of human brain cell had enhanced learning abilities. But other forms of humanized mice, such as mice engineered to have a human immune system, are routine laboratory animals that seem to occasion little angst. Dr. Izpisua Belmonte’s insertion of human stem cells into pig embryos was not affected by the N. I. H. moratorium on such chimeras because he used private funds. His experiment was approved by the authorities in Spain and in California, and following their advice, the development of the pig chimeras was stopped after four weeks in the womb. Dr. Nakauchi moved his lab to Stanford from Tokyo in 2014 because Japanese regulations do not allow chimera research, only to be hit with the N. I. H. moratorium a year later, which prevented him from making chimeras with human cells. His mouse pancreas experiment has taken eight or nine years to complete. “I have been in a very frustrating situation,” he said."

As a scientist, I bristle when lies dressed up as “science” are used to influence political discourse. The latest example is the global‐​warming disaster flick, _The Day After Tomorrow_.



This film is propaganda designed to shift the policy of this nation on climate change. At least that’s what I take from producer Mark Gordon’s comment that “part of the reason we made this movie” was to “raise consciousness about the environment.”



Fox spokesman Jeffrey Godsick says, “The real power of the movie is to raise consciousness on the issue of (global warming).”



‘Nuff said.



Oh, the plot. Global warming causes the Gulf Stream to shut down. This current normally brings tropical warmth northward and makes Europe much more comfortable than it should be at its northerly latitude. The heat stays stuck in the tropics, the polar regions get colder, and the atmosphere suddenly flips over in a “superstorm.” The frigid stratosphere trades places with our habitable troposphere, and in a matter of days, an ice age ensues. Temperatures drop 100 degrees an hour in Canada. Hurricanes ravage Belfast. Folks in Japan are clobbered by bowling‐​ball‐​size hailstones. If we had only listened to concerned scientists and stopped global warming when we could.



Each one of these phenomena is physically impossible.



Start with the Gulf Stream. Carl Wunsch, a professor of physical oceanography at Massachusetts Institute of Technology, knows more about ocean currents than most anyone. He thinks the nonsense in _The Day After Tomorrow_ detracts from the seriousness of the global‐​warming issue. So he recently wrote in the prestigious science journal _Nature_ that the scenario depicted in the movie requires one to “turn off the wind system, or to stop the Earth’s rotation, or both.”



The stratosphere will become the troposphere when all three laws of thermodynamics are repealed. Hailstones can’t reach bowling‐​ball size because their growth is limited by gravity. Hurricanes can’t hit Belfast because the intervening island of Ireland would destroy them.



How do I know so much about a movie that isn’t out yet? I’ve seen the promos, and I’ve read and reviewed the book upon which it is based, The _Coming Global Superstorm_ by Art Bell and Whitley Strieber. In Strieber’s previous work, _Communion_ , he explained that he was told of the Earth’s upcoming apocalypse by aliens. And how this knowledge was communicated is much more the purview of an adult Web site than a family newspaper. What’s on the movie’s Web site is worse — nothing but out‐​and‐​out distortion.



It also insists that what is depicted on the screen has already started.



“Did you know,” says the site, that there were more tornadoes recorded in May 2003 than in any other month?



I looked up federal tornado statistics, and indeed they’re going up, and there was a peak in May 2003. Then I determined the number of radar stations and their type. When our first radar‐​tracking network was established in the 1960s and ‘70s, the number of tornadoes rose proportionally, then leveled off until the new Doppler radars came online in 1988. It took a decade to put this system in place, and the number of reported tornadoes went up accordingly.



Then I plotted the number of severe tornadoes. If anything, it’s going down. So the flashy Doppler radars are merely detecting more weak storms that cause little, if any, damage.



The Web site also implies that global warming is making hurricanes worse. Christopher Landsea, the world’s most aptly named hurricane scientist, has studied the maximum winds in these storms as measured by aircraft and finds a significant decline.



Global warming? Some scientists think climate change strengthens El Niño, the large atmospheric oscillation responsible for a variety of weather — both good and bad. El Niños are known to rip apart hurricanes. So it’s more likely that climate change is weakening these storms than enhancing them.



Will Godsick and Gordon get their way? They’re sure being aided and abetted by MoveOn​.org, the liberal advocacy group and billionaire George Soros’ policy toy. They’ve got Al Gore front and center, plumping the film. They’ve got their Web site using the movie to drum up support for legislation by Sens. John McCain, R‐​Ariz., and Joe Lieberman, D‐​Conn., to reduce carbon‐​dioxide emissions, which only failed by 12 votes last fall. There’s a huge drought out West, which a _New York Times_ editorial blamed on global warming. The issue is hot enough to influence votes out there.



Remember that humans have slightly warmed the planet some in recent decades, but the correlation between Western drought and warming is zero.



Far be it from me to criticize anyone’s freedom of expression. But remember that propaganda can have consequences. McCain’s and Lieberman’s measure mimics the United Nations’ infamous Kyoto Protocol on global warming, which many scientists know will do nothing measurable about planetary temperature within the policy‐​relevant future. But it will cost money.



This isn’t Hollywood’s first attempt to scare people into its way of thinking. How about Jane Fonda in the 1979 anti‐​nuclear‐​power flick, _The China Syndrome_?



Twelve days after its release, the accident at Three Mile Island occurred. Despite the fact that it released only tiny amounts of radiation, the politics of that hysteria effectively killed any new nuclear plant.



Analogize the Western drought to Three Mile Island, and you get the idea.



Or how about the 1983 movie _The Day After_ , whose purpose was to strengthen the nuclear‐​freeze movement. It failed.



 _The Day After Tomorrow_ is only one more day than _The Day After_ , and it deserves the same fate. Lies cloaked as science should never determine how we live our lives.

"Take a handful of soil and hold it up to your nose. That fresh, earthy aroma is organic matter, part of which is carbon. What you can smell is the whiff of a solution for dealing with climate change.  Global soil resources contain more organic carbon than the world’s atmosphere and all of its plants combined. When plants photosynthesise, they take carbon out of the atmosphere and when they die, that carbon is returned to the soil.  Storing more carbon in the soil helps to remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. But it also helps release nutrients for plant growth and improves the structure of the soil, enhancing how well it retains water.

      France has a great plan for its soil – and it's not just about wine


 Maintaining these soil ecosystem services will become more important over the next few decades. By 2050, the global population is estimated to soar to more than 9 billion, and that will mean a much greater demand on the world’s soil. In business, when demand for a product grows, you increase its production. But for soil, it’s a different story.  Soil is largely made at the bedrock deep below the Earth’s surface, and it is a slow process. Across the world, soil erosion, which is accelerated by some agricultural activities, is exceeding the rates at which new soils can form. As a soil thins, its productivity wanes. Less soil means a lower capacity to store nutrients, water and carbon. The long-term ability for soils to slow climate change and feed the world is under threat. How many years might the world’s soils have left to support crop production? To store and purify water? To sequester enough atmospheric carbon to halt the climate emergency? Until now, there have been few measurements of how fast soil is being formed and eroded on land currently supporting agriculture. Efforts to understand this have been similar to forecasting a bank balance using just the expenditures.   Our research is the first in the world to make a clear scientific estimate of soil lifespans, using measured rates of soil formation and erosion, giving farmers and scientists a more accurate idea of how sustainable the world’s soil resources are. Measuring soil formation at an arable farm in Nottinghamshire, UK, we estimated that the uppermost 30 centimetres could be eroded in as little as 138 years, with the underlying sandstone bedrock emerging in 212 years. This may not seem like an urgent crisis. But given that these soils have been functioning for the last 10,000 years, this projection could be the final 1% of their lifespan. In other regions of the world, soils that have been subject to centuries of intensive agriculture have already thinned significantly. In sub-Saharan Africa, Asia, and Latin America and the Caribbean, the threat of soil erosion is high and soil functioning is considered to be deteriorating.  In these regions, where rates of soil erosion are often greater than those for the UK, soil lifespans may be much shorter. Since the demands on soil will only intensify as the global population grows, societies will need to adapt to reverse the trajectory of soil thinning and, instead, find ways of thickening soils and extending their lifespans.

      Our new research is tracing the development of the world's vital non-living nature


 Discuss soil conservation and you join a conversation sustained over thousands of years. Nearly every civilisation has, to varying degrees, contributed to the debate. As a result, we’re lucky today to have an extensive and well-tested toolkit at our disposal with which to save the world’s soils.  These include relatively minor changes in agricultural practices. For example, planting crops across, rather than down, a hillslope can interrupt the flow of water and stop it from picking up and removing soil. Planting trees and ensuring soils are always vegetated with a cover crop such as clover between cropping seasons can also slow water and trap soil. In May 2019, I attended the Global Symposium on Soil Erosion in Rome. A lot of water (and soil) has passed underneath the Pons Fabricius bridge since ancient Roman farmers stood and discussed soil conservation over their hedgerows.  The symposium brought not only farmers together, but scientists, government officials, and land managers too. Soil erosion is a global issue, so conversations between people with different backgrounds and skills are essential. But the message that emerged from the symposium was relatively simple. For a decent future for all, we must save the world’s soils. And the clock is ticking."

What’s one big difference between the left and the right?



Tens of thousands of armed, angry right-wingers hold a political rally, and there’s no violence, just one minor arrest – and they leave the place cleaner than they found it.



Right-wing scum!



A gun-rights rally in Richmond that brought thousands of people from across the country to protest a push by Virginia Democrats for comprehensive gun control ended peacefully without any major incidents.



This is despite the legacy media trying to play up scare-stories of violence and “far-right fascists”, for all they were worth.



Threats of violence had escalated in the days leading up to Monday’s demonstration following reports that white supremacists, armed militia and other extremist groups were planning to attend.



 **Gov. Ralph Northam** , a Democrat, had declared a state of emergency late last week and beefed up security around the Capitol…



The president of the Virginia Citizens Defense League – the nonprofit organizer of the rally – told Fox News that it wasn’t the pro-gun groups who had been stoking fear of potential violence at the event.



“It’s the Democrats,” **Philip Van Cleave** said. “It’s almost like they want something to happen. It sounds crazy, but they keep doing it and you have to start wondering if that’s intentional.”



Get a few dozen left-wingers like Antifa together and, like all bullies and thugs, they start to feel all big and brave with their mates around them. Violence inevitably follows. Along with dozens of arrests. The sole arrest out of these 20 000 gun-totin’ far-right fascists was for…a bandana.



The Joint Information Center, made up of representatives from the Capitol, Richmond and Virginia State Police, estimated 6,000 people were allowed into a fenced-in area of Capitol Square.



They estimated another 16,000 were outside the gates, though event organizers said many more had turned out. Many of those outside the barrier carried long firearms and wore bright orange stickers that read “Guns Save Lives.”



Capitol Police said a 21-year-old woman had been arrested and charged with one felony count of wearing a mask in public. Law enforcement said they warned the woman twice to remove a bandana covering her face but she had refused.



Even worse than their deliberate, provocative law-abiding peacefulness, these fascists actually picked up their garbage!



Protesters in support of the Second Amendment sought to leave Richmond, Virginia cleaner than they found it this morning.



Video from WSET reporter **Caroline Eaker** shows demonstrators collecting garbage in plastic bags.



The man called it “a birthday present for Ralph Northam,” the commonwealth’s governor.



That stands in stark contrast to the self-declared environmentalists who take to the streets.

"**China's leaders are signalling that they are preparing to change how they deal with Hong Kong, following months of pro-democracy protests.**
Shen Chunyao, director of the Hong Kong, Macau and Basic Law Commission, told reporters they were looking at ways to ""perfect"" how Hong Kong's chief executive is appointed and removed.
He did not elaborate on what exactly might change.
The statement could further inflame protests, which began in June.
There were demonstrations on Friday and more are expected over the weekend.
Initially protesters were demonstrating against proposals to allow extradition to mainland China.
These proposals have now been dropped, but the protests widened to include four more demands, including the implementation of complete universal suffrage (the right of almost all adults to vote in elections).
The protests, the largest since President Xi Jinping took office in 2012, have presented a serious challenge to China's leaders, who have painted the demonstrators as dangerous separatists and accused foreign powers of backing them.
**by Stephen McDonell, BBC China correspondent**
It's on! â¦but what is ""it""?
A four-day plenum session in the Chinese capital this week clearly had the Hong Kong political crisis way up on its agenda.
Shen Chunyao, a senior official from the Hong Kong and Macau Basic Law Committee, was one of the speakers at a press conference after the session. This is no accident.
He said they were looking to ""perfect"" the system of appointing and replacing Hong Kong's leader. What does that mean?
The chief executive is currently selected by a committee stacked with pro-Beijing loyalists; protesters are calling instead for direct elections to choose the city's leader. There's nothing to indicate that any changes would be moving in the direction activists want but, in truth, we simply don't know and the party seems to like it that way.
The communiquÃ© also pledged to establish ""a legal system and enforcement mechanism for safeguarding national security"" in Hong Kong.
Analysts think this could mean the central government introducing national security laws which could be imposed on Hong Kong from Beijing but - again - who knows?
Mr Shen said ""of course"" the topic of the protests was discussed at the plenum, a meeting of China's ruling Communist Party leaders which took place behind closed doors this week
He said the leaders discussed ways ""to improve the central government's mechanism of appointing and removing Hong Kong's chief executive and other key officials"", adding that Beijing would ""improve the central government's system of governance over the region"".
Currently, Hong Kong - a former British colony - operates on a basis known as ""one country, two systems"", giving residents unique freedoms which mainland China does not enjoy.
But protesters say those freedoms have eroded. Meanwhile, the plenum has emphasised that ""one country"" is the foundation for ""two systems"", according to news agency Reuters."

"SEOUL, South Korea  —   The   defector from North Korea in years said on Wednesday that the days of the country’s leadership were “numbered,” and that its attempts to control outside information were not working because of corruption and discontent. “I am sure that more defections of my colleagues will take place, since North Korea is already on a slippery slope,” the defector, Thae   said during a news conference in Seoul, the capital of South Korea. “The traditional structures of the North Korean system are crumbling. ” Mr. Thae had been the North’s No. 2 diplomat in London until he fled to the South last summer with his family. South Korea has hailed his defection as a sign of growing disillusionment among North Korean elites with the country’s leader, Kim  . Since December, Mr. Thae has given a series of interviews to share his dire view of today’s North Korea. Mr. Thae’s diagnosis of Mr. Kim’s rule is hardly new. Defectors from the North, as well as some conservative analysts and policy makers in the South, widely share that view. Still, it signaled a drastic change of roles for Mr. Thae. Before his defection, he was a career diplomat, fluent in English, who had served in Britain, Denmark and Sweden, often delivering passionate speeches glorifying the Kim family that has ruled North Korea for seven decades. In the South, Mr. Thae, now affiliated with the Institute for National Security Strategy, a think tank arm of the National Intelligence Service, has vowed to spend the rest of his life trying to bring down the North Korean government. Mr. Thae said he had high expectations when Mr. Kim took power after the death of his father, Kim   in 2011. Schooled for several years in Switzerland, Mr. Kim was expected to help modernize his impoverished country. Instead, he resorted to a “reign of terror” by executing scores of officials, including his uncle Jang   whom he thought posed a challenge to his power, Mr. Thae said. The former diplomat said he had come up with a detailed plan for his defection, first ensuring that his two sons joined him and his wife in London. (North Korean diplomats are required to leave a child in the North, a measure intended to prevent their defection.) He declined to reveal details of his defection plan and the circumstances. While in London, his sons began asking questions, like why the North Korean government executed people in public without a proper trial, Mr. Thae said. Their English friends taunted them with questions, like why Mr. Kim had smoked a cigarette inside a nursery. The day Mr. Thae broached his plan for defection with his sons, he told them that he wanted to break the “chain of slavery” for them, he recalled. They wanted to know if they would have free access to the internet, books and movies in the South, he said. The best way to force change in the isolated North, he continued, is to disseminate outside information there to help ordinary citizens eventually rebel. South Korean TV dramas and movies smuggled from China are already popular in the North, he said. Another sign of Mr. Kim’s weakening control, Mr. Thae said, is evident at the unofficial markets in North Korea where women trade goods, mostly smuggled from China. The vendors used to be called “grasshoppers” because they would pack and flee whenever they saw the police approaching. Now, they are called “ticks” because they refuse to budge, demanding a right to make a living, Mr. Thae said. Such resistance, even if small in scale, is unprecedented, he added. The spread of outside news and market activities could eventually doom Mr. Kim because his government “can be held in place and maintained only by idolizing Kim   like a god,” Mr. Thae said. “If he tries to introduce a   economy to North Korean society, then there will be no place for Kim   in North Korea, and he knows that. ” But the leader’s efforts to clamp down on information and products from outside North Korea have been unsuccessful because the police accept bribes in exchange for freeing smugglers and people caught watching banned movies and dramas. “Kim  ’s days are numbered,” Mr. Thae said on Wednesday. After months of debriefing by the authorities in South Korea, Mr. Thae used meetings with the country’s politicians and the news media to suggest that North Korea was determined to be recognized as a nuclear power, just as India and Pakistan are. Last year, the North conducted two nuclear tests and launched more than 20 ballistic missiles, and it has openly vowed to develop the ability to hit the United States with a nuclear warhead. “It won’t happen,” Donald J. Trump, then   said at the time. During the election campaign, Mr. Trump had said he was willing to sit down with Mr. Kim and perhaps have a hamburger with him. On Wednesday, Mr. Thae warned against compromising with the North, arguing that sanctions were effective. In recent interviews with local news outlets, he said that North Korea had lost annual income worth tens of millions dollars, after Britain froze accounts last year held by its   insurance company as part of sanctions recommended by the United Nations. Until then, the company had claimed large insurance payments through fabricated documents, he said. Mr. Kim wanted to negotiate a compromise, under which the United States and South Korea would cancel their annual joint military exercises and lift sanctions on the North in return for a moratorium on North Korean missile and nuclear tests, Mr. Thae said. But such a deal would validate Mr. Kim’s argument that he had been forced to develop nuclear weapons as a reaction to American hostility, he said. “That is really a trap Kim   wants,” Mr. Thae said."

It seems that some on the left are panicking that their death-grip on taxpayer-funded academia may be slipping. Former Labor senator **Kim Carr** (a notorious head kicker for Labor’s Socialist Left faction) is horrified that Australia’s Education Minister wants taxpayer money spent, not just on Australian research, but, horror of horrors, research that **isn’t** specifically slanted to denigrate our nation.



Even worse, the wicked conservative government seems to have the unmitigated gall to believe that government-funded leftist academics **don’t** have a God-given right to tell the rest of us what to think.



Do Australians really need “fewer people telling us what to think”? Federal Education Minister **Dan Tehan** wrote that on this page on Monday.



The very nerve! I mean, let people start thinking for themselves, and, before you know it, you have a **Trump** , a **Morrison** , a **Bolsonaro** , **Orban** or **Johnson** winning democratic elections.



What’s the point of even orchestrating decades of the [Long March through the institutions](https://thebfd.co.nz/2019/06/how-the-long-march-left-are-erasing-the-enlightment/), if the left can’t even claim their rightful places as our superiors?



If these funds are to be alloc­ated by the normal peer-review process and without political interference, as Tehan assures us they will be, the outcome may well be that some of our present disputes become more acute.



This is true enough, in that the leftist academic establishment will fight furiously to hold onto what it has come to regard as its right and privilege to control the national discourse. One need only look at the righteous meltdown from the establishment left when the Ramsay Foundation attempted to establish a [Centre for Western Civilization ](https://thebfd.co.nz/2019/10/academic-idiots-are-betraying-australia/)at just one university.



The “normal peer-review process” Carr lauds is, in fact, at the heart of the problem. **The stifling leftist death-grip on academia is such a stranglehold that “peer-review” actually means “pal review”.** The last thing this leftist echo-chamber tolerates is independent thought.



He wants historians and other humanities scholars to do what they do, so long as they don’t tell us what to think.



Perhaps he means that what they do is all right if they agree with what he thinks.



Perhaps Carr might want to consider the old adage about pots and kettles?



In trying to demonise the Morrison government, Carr, the fossilised old lefty, descends into farcical cherry-picking.



It will be remembered that Tehan’s predecessor as minister, **Simon Birmingham** , vetoed 11 grant applications in the humanities and social sciences that had been recommended by the ARC…



The 11 projects Birmingham decided were not in the national interest included: research into the social impact of shutting down the Australian car industry; responses to climate change by the MCG and other sporting venues; and a comparative study of indigenous politics in the US and Australia.



He also rejected an application by an internationally renowned musicologist who was conducting research into birdsong.



Well, gosh – however can we as a nation live without knowing the finer points of how sporting venues are responding to climate change? 



Carr might also have been more honest to outline some of the other, oh-so-vital research that Tehan kyboshed. Such as “Beauty and ugliness as persuasive tools in changing China’s gender norms”, “Post-orientalist arts in the Strait of Gibraltar”, and “Soviet cinema in Hollywood before the blacklist”.



Well, I don’t know about you, but I can’t sleep at night for worrying about China’s gender norms and post-orientalist arts in the Strait of Gibraltar.



If Carr was trying to destroy the perception of academia as a bunch of out-of-touch leftists circle-jerking each other at the taxpayer’s expense, he certainly has an odd way of going about it.

"The essential ingredient for all growing plants is CO2 in the atmosphere. But organic matter in the soil is also of value for the plant life on which we all depend. It can only be put into the soil by growing plants (including fungi) and the bacteria, worms and other microbes that live on and beside the plants. All plant and soil carbon comes, in the end, from CO2 in the atmosphere.

Leaves collect carbon and oxygen from the air, roots collect minerals, water and nitrogen plus some carbon from the soil. Plants can live without carbon in soil (as in hydroponics), but not without carbon dioxide in the air.
The biggest stupidity in the carbon debate is treating carbon dioxide as an atmospheric pollutant. All food for plants and animals comes from this gas of life – it is not a pollutant.
The second biggest stupidity in the soil carbon debate is the biofuel myth that we can use the “waste” from crops or grasslands to produce motor spirit without affecting soil fertility and productivity. There is no “waste”in a sustainable farming operation. All organic “waste” should be mulched back into the soil, to feed the soil microbes that add humus, that holds mineral nutrients and soil moisture. Every tonne of carbon trucked off from a bit of land reduces soil productivity and has to be replaced from the CO2 in the air.
Once the biofuel gets burnt in motors, it gets back to the soil or the oceans eventually via carbon dioxide in the air (unless some fool has buried the CO2 in geo-sequestration cemeteries).

"**The number of refugees fleeing the northern Tigray region of Ethiopia - where federal and regional forces are engaged in fighting - has reduced drastically after soldiers were deployed to the border with Sudan.**
The BBC first spotted the soldiers on Wednesday, at the Hamdayet border crossing point, and has been hearing testimonies from refugees who say their relatives are being blocked from leaving Ethiopia.
""I arrived yesterday morning and I wanted to go back home to bring my family here,"" said one man who did not want to be identified. Speaking on the banks of River Sittet in Hamdayet, he told the BBC he had been unable to return to Tigray to get his relatives because ""there are soldiers on the border and those who had gone before me were asked not to return"".
The Ethiopian government has not responded to repeated BBC requests for comment on the accusation.
Across the river that straddles the border, about a dozen soldiers stand at intervals on hilltops looking in the direction of Tigray. Boats parked on both sides of what is usually a busy crossing point are largely unused.
Dozens of refugees have gathered to look at the newly deployed federal soldiers on the Ethiopian side of the border. Others - both refugees and Sudanese - have been down to the river to fetch water or wash. A group of children have been swimming and playing in the water.
But mystery lies in the land beyond this river. An information blackout in Tigray has meant that separated families have been unable to communicate.
Human Rights Watch, quoting refugees who have recently arrived in Sudan, has reported that Ethiopian soldiers have been blocking civilians in Humera, about 20km (12.5 miles) from the border, which it says has resulted in ""a massive drop in the number of refugees reaching Sudan"".
Data from the United Nations High Commission for Refugees (UNHCR) shows that new refugee numbers peaked around 10 November, with more than 6,800 people crossing into Sudan in a single day. The average number arriving daily has been 3,000, officials told the BBC. However, since Ethiopian troops were deployed along the border, the number has dropped to about 700 a day.
An 11-year-old girl was among those who arrived before refugee movement was restricted. She fled alone from her grandmother's home, where she had heard gunfire - her grandmother was too old to run.
""I had to spend the night in the wilderness. I was frightened. I had no clothes and no money,"" she said. ""After that I saw someone driving a tractor and begged him to drive me to the border.""
Once she had crossed the Sittet river, she gave out her father's phone number. Father and daughter were reunited at the Um Raquba refugee camp on Wednesday. Her father, who walked around the camp protectively holding her hand, said she had witnessed people getting shot.
Earth movers have been clearing ground for more construction at the camp, located about 70km from the border. A new World Food Programme tent was being set up when we arrived. Many refugees were also busy digging holes in the ground, mounting poles or covering the makeshift structures with wide mats to make new shelters.
In just three weeks, more than 43,000 refugees have fled into Sudan, according to the UNHCR. Aid agencies have been struggling to keep up with the rising numbers. ""Our humanitarian response is overstretched,"" UNHCR said, adding: ""Support is urgently needed.""
The Ethiopian government appears keen not only to keep people from fleeing, but also to return any refugees to the country.
After meeting envoys from the African Union on Friday, Ethiopian Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed said in a statement that the government was ready to ""receive, rehabilitate and resettle citizens that have fled by setting up four camps established to rehabilitate returnees before resettling them back into their original locales"".
What he meant by ""rehabilitation"" was not immediately clear.
The federal government has also said it would provide humanitarian assistance access to refugees and displaced people in the northern Tigray region. Before the offensive was launched on 4 November, the region was already hosting about 100,000 Eritrean refugees in four camps, according to the UNHCR.
Last week, the organisation said it had not heard from staff in the camps in five days. ""We are very worried,"" UNHCR spokesman Babar Baloch said in a statement, while calling for unimpeded access to the camps. ""Rations were provided until the end of November, so it is increasingly critical for humanitarian workers to have access and for additional food to be distributed before refugees run out.""
Back in Sudan, refugees remain in limbo. Some are waiting at the Hamdayet border crossing, hoping that their families will join them. Then, they could hop onto the almost daily convoys of lorries modified to carry passengers through the rugged terrain in eastern Sudan to refugee camps.
But in the camps, many also hope the crisis will be resolved soon, allowing them to get back to their normal lives - and children like the 11-year-old who travelled alone could return to school or play with their friends."

As Australian PM **Scott Morrison** attempts to reclaim the political narrative from the firestorm surrounding the 2019-20 bushfire disaster, many rank-and-file Coalition voters have expressed concern that the government is surrendering to climate change alarmism.



As usual, the Greens are ideologically blinded to every obvious cause behind the fires, particularly environmental policies which have largely prevented any meaningful effort to reduce the extraordinary fuel loads piling up in both state-managed forests and private land. No, for the Greens, as with everything, the only cause they can see is climate change. At the height of the fires, with police and emergency services stretched to the limit, the Greens chose to block major cities with protests reminiscent of millenarian flagellants howling and weeping through the ruins of mediaeval Europe.



There were signs that Morrison was catching the green disease, in some sort of anxiety to appease the Gaiaist nutters. Naturally, Coalition voters, who made their feelings about the climate bogeyman clear in no uncertain terms at the ballot box last May, are less than happy.



But the Coalition appears to be reasserting the common-sense approach that won the last election. First, the minor Coalition partners:



New Nationals Deputy Leader **David Littleproud** has reaffirmed his view that Australia must rely on coal power as part of its energy mix.



A day after he became deputy leader and ahead of the new government ministry being unveiled where he is expected to become Agriculture Minister, Mr Littleproud said Australia is “taking real action” on emissions reductions and that “it’s not just Australia that has to act”.



“Instead of beating ourselves up… we’re one of the few nations that actually met Kyoto, we’re the ones with some credibility in this.” Mr Littleproud told ABC Radio National.



The reaffirmation of climate commonsense is being echoed all the way up to the prime minister’s office. But, once again, a minority of Liberal “wets” are desperate to pander to the green-left elite.



Scott Morrison says he will not “be bullied” into adopting tougher pro-climate action policies, as his own Liberal MPs raise fears they could lose affluent, inner-city seats without a new approach.



The “climate wars” broke out in the first Coalition party room meeting of the year yesterday, with Liberals **Katie Allen** , **Fiona Martin** , **Tim Wilson** and **Trent Zimmerman** saying the Coalition would lose city seats if they did not take climate change seriously.



Some of those names will be odiously familiar to the Coalition’s conservative base. Wilson and Zimmerman, in particular, were the major agitators behind the putsch to force through 2017’s shonky “Australian Marriage Law Postal Survey” which ultimately lumbered Australia with, not just gay marriage, but its associated slippery-slope nonsense like Tasmania’s ridiculous transgender laws.



Nothing quite shows the new reality of Australian conservative politics than this rag-tag of doctor’s wives and soaking-wet inner-city progressives in blue ties roosting in Melbourne and Sydney’s trendy, rich suburbs, while formerly rusted-on Labor seats across the outer suburbs and rural Queensland and WA swing solidly conservative.



 **Scott Morrison knows that these “Quiet Australians” are the ones whose support he really needs.**



The Prime Minister on Wednesday said he would not just listen to “the inner-city” and would not adopt any climate policies that involved new taxes or punishing industry.



“We listen to Australians right across the country. Not just in the inner-city but the far flung parts of remote Australia, of our bush and regional communities,” he told the Nine Network.



“And it’s important to listen to everybody to take people forward on practical balanced actions that doesn’t write people’s industries off and put taxes on people,” he told the Nine Network.



“Action on climate change does not mean taxing people. It is about technology, not taxation. We won’t be bullied into higher taxes and electricity prices.”



Just as no American politician of any ambition could afford to **not** pander to the evangelical right during the hey-day of the Theocons, the religious zeal of the green-left today is such that nearly every politician seems to feel obliged to mouth off the appropriate platitudes. Morrison seems to be saying just enough to meet the new religious obligation, while keeping an eye firmly on the reality of just what the Coalition base, not a claque of inner-city “progressives”, really wants.

"Climate change had a higher profile in the UK election campaign than ever before, with parties competing hard over their offer to concerned voters. But this was a debate that the Conservatives – who won a landslide majority – largely stood back from. Their manifesto was light on detail compared to the other parties, and Boris Johnson chose not to take part in the first ever UK televised leaders’ debate on climate. Conservative candidates were conspicuous by their absence in local climate hustings, too. Neither was climate mentioned in their legislative plan for the first hundred days. The Conservative government did legislate for a net zero carbon emissions target back in June, following the advice of the Committee on Climate Change. And there was an explicit manifesto pledge to deliver on this target, with no signs of backtracking. In his speech to the party faithful on the morning of his election, Johnson declared his ambition to “make this country the cleanest, greenest on Earth, with the most far-reaching environmental programme”, adding: And you the people of this country voted to be carbon-neutral in this election - you voted to be carbon-neutral by 2050. And we’ll do it. But targets don’t reduce carbon. Policies do. And despite its much-admired Climate Change Act, the UK’s policy record lately has not been good. The Committee on Climate Change have repeatedly warned that the UK is off track to meet future commitments, a verdict shared by the independent Climate Action Tracker project, which assesses each country’s performance against the Paris Agreement. It rated the UK as “insufficient”, with policies compatible with a 3°C world – not the 1.5°C level that we desperately need. If the new government is serious about its commitment, it will have to signal this soon, and with confidence. Steps that it could and should take straight away include: instigating a swift review of governance for net-zero, giving responsibility and resources to other government departments, and, crucially, to local areas, to deliver on carbon strategy prioritising climate and environmental protection in negotiations for a trading relationship with the European Union moving quickly to consult on a phase-out date for petrol and diesel vehicles, as promised in its manifesto removing the de facto ban on onshore wind energy, which the Committee on Climate Change advised needs to increase in capacity by 1GW a year confirming its opposition to fracking, and making its moratorium permanent pledging to formally consider the results of the national citizens’ assembly on climate change, Climate Assembly UK, due to report in 2020. More fundamentally, the Conservatives need to develop a much clearer climate strategy. Despite a commitment to the emissions target, they do not yet have a confident story to tell about the way they will achieve it, and how that fits with their party’s philosophy and values. Back in July, 41 Conservative MPs proposed just such a story, arguing that “tackling the existential threat of environmental breakdown offers our divided country a new national project … this unifying mission can bring economic regeneration and natural restoration to all parts of the country”. But this debate has not yet managed to break through the hurly burly of Brexit. The new government will need to be quick, and decisive. The upsurge in public concern on climate, and calls for radical action, show no signs of abating. The Green Party nearly doubled its share of the vote, though they still only have one MP to show for it. Having spent the past couple of years making a general call to climate action, protesters are now likely to take aim at specific policies and projects, such as airport expansion and the new coal mines proposed in Cumbria and Northumberland, as well as the money that the UK continues to invest in fossil fuels, at home and abroad. They will be buoyed by their success in rendering toxic the sponsorship of the arts by fossil interests, and will focus relentlessly on removing the fossil fuel majors’ social license to operate. And it’s not just protesters who could be thorns in the side of the new government. A sizeable green business lobby, including coalitions such as The Aldersgate Group and We Mean Business, will be calling for ambitious policy which supports the many businesses who want to be part of the transition to net zero. Though the Conservative manifesto promised funds for green technologies, the amounts are tiny compared to support for high-carbon infrastructure including roads, airports and oil and gas extraction, and these contradictions will provide constant tension. Next year will show whether the Conservatives’ enthusiasm for carbon targets translates into an enthusiasm for climate policies. In late 2020, all eyes will be on the UK, as it hosts COP26, the most important international climate summit since Paris in 2015, in Glasgow. The government will want to tell world leaders a good story on domestic action. It still has time to write one."
"**Photographer Lauren Crothers grew up in Hong Kong. Now based in New York, she was drawn back to the territory to document the recent protests that began against proposals to allow extradition to mainland China, but have grown into a wider pro-democracy movement. Here, Crothers talks about her portraits of the protesters.**
For months, I'd been watching and reading intently as the protest movement in Hong Kong evolved. By September, I decided to go back. Hong Kong is where I was born and raised; it's where my journalism career began and I've spent more of my life there than anywhere else. While I felt a natural compulsion to return and make photographs, I wanted to take a different approach.
I decided on a simple studio-style portrait series as a way of providing a slower, more isolated visual narrative of the people involved in this movement.
The only way to really do that was to work with available light against a neutral background and it had to be in the midst of one of the gatherings.
Although I'm very familiar with Hong Kong and the routes people had been using to march and gather, logistically, I was still anxious I had set myself up to fail. However, I worked with a fantastic fixer who recommended we try to take the pictures during a planned anti-totalitarianism rally at the end of September, heading from Causeway Bay toward Admiralty.
Because I needed to be able to set up a backdrop, and potentially break down, very quickly, I brought a cheap, small set of studio poles and backdrop clips. I packed several yards of different coloured translucent fabrics on the off-chance people would want to be fully anonymous - but on the day, I defaulted to the black background.
I'd gone to the fifth anniversary of the Umbrella Movement the night before and felt confident enough people were covering their faces and therefore a sense of anonymity was already being established for those who wanted it.
The start of the march was punctuated with a few skirmishes and rounds of tear-gas but as police retreated and people started marching, we ducked into a side street and quickly set up.
Luckily, it was a reliable and safe spot from which to work, while being in close proximity to the start of the march. Together, we managed to invite 20 people to have their pictures taken.
There were many, many people over the course of the few hours that declined, which is fair enough. I know my little set-up was an odd sight; not to mention the rally was flowing at a pretty good clip and I assume people didn't want to be separated from their friends.
My only directions to participants were to stand straight on or slightly facing the left or right. How they posed was up to them.
Less than a week after I photographed the protesters, Hong Kong Chief Executive Carrie Lam announced a ban on masks worn at street rallies, which I think has made the series take on more value. All but one participant wore some kind of mask or face covering.
While I did end up photographing at other rallies, I didn't take the ""studio"" with me again while I was still in town; I felt I'd chanced my arm already and was worried about a situation changing and becoming more dangerous.
While I was in Hong Kong, an Indonesian journalist was blinded in one eye by a rubber bullet, and an 18-year-old protester was shot in the chest after attacking a police officer.
Returning to Hong Kong this time was surreal and at times overwhelming and I have no idea when or how this will all end. All I can hope for is that no-one else is injured and no lives are lost.

Guest essay by Eric Worrall
ON the 24th December this year, Montreal was a poster child for the “new normal” – mild weather, no snow in sight. All that came to an abrupt end on the 29th, when Montreal strayed off narrative with a record breaking snowfall.
From the 24th;
Montreal’s Christmas Eve record-breaking temperature matches Los Angeles
Dec. 24 high of 16 C matches cities synonymous with sunny, warm weather at this time of year
…
The balmy temperature was the last thing Anaum and Muhammed Sajanlal were expecting when the siblings arrived in Montreal from Kuwait recently.
They had big plans for winter fun.
“I was looking forward to building a snowman because we see in the movies and cartoons that they build lots of snowmen. We can’t do that in Kuwait,” said Anaum, 11, on CBC Montreal’s Daybreak.

Fast forward to December 29th;
Montreal saw a record snowfall for a Dec. 29 on Tuesday after 39.2 centimetres of snow blanketed the city and caused delays at the airport and left streets a mess for motorists and pedestrians.
Environment Canada confirmed the record, which eclipsed the 30.5 cm of snow that fell on Dec. 29 in 1954.
A few more centimetres were expected Wednesday, but no other major accumulations are in the forecast for the moment, Environment Canada told the Montreal Gazette.
City crews and contractors began the lengthy cleanup process at 7 a.m. on Wednesday, with all of the city’s boroughs getting to work by 7 p.m. to clear as much snow as possible before a pause for New Year’s Eve kicks in at 7 p.m. on Dec. 31.
Clearing operations are to resume Jan. 2 at 7 a.m.
Read more: http://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/montreal-sets-new-snowfall-record-after-tuesdays-storm
No doubt all that snow was due to CO2 causing climate alarmists to make fools of themselves. Thankfully civic authorities in Montreal ignored the hype; Mayor Denis Coderre’s new snow clearing programme appears to be a resounding success.

 **George**



The justification being circulated by the COL for plunging NZ into debt is that borrowing money has never been cheaper. But less than two years ago Labour and Goff discovered a far cheaper method of raising capital, a 12.5% regional fuel tax. No borrowing, no interest, and no conscience. The first year of embezzlement raised $150 million. The presumption was that it would help fund the fast rail project to the airport but it hasn’t, and to this day fast rail remains a figment of Twyford’s and Goff’s imaginations. The point is, why is this tax still being applied?



Would you believe, now that it is an election year, suddenly Auckland is awash with borrowed Government money. With so much borrowed money being splashed around, surely the need for the regional fuel tax has become redundant; after all, “money has never been cheaper” – unless you steal it of course. Delusion is Ardern’s strong suit.



 **Delusion 1:** “A once in a lifetime opportunity to invest in New Zealand – modernising our infrastructure, preparing for climate change and helping grow the economy”. Once in a lifetime? Guess what this is called Jacinda: “housekeeping”. Every administration since 1856 has been modernising our infrastructure and helping to grow our economy. However you are the first administration that has insanely borrowed money in preparation for climate change.



 **Delusion 2** : Do you remember your speech regarding KiwiBuild at the 2018 Labour Party conference? It was only thirteen months ago.



“It was a huge day. I was standing near the front of one of the families’ new homes when I overheard Phil Twyford say to one of the people gathered at the street party “this is one of the most important days of my political life”. You continued “And I can see why. KiwiBuild is an example of the government seeing a problem, and FIXING IT?”



Seven months later Twyford was sacked from his KiwiBuild portfolio. That must have been the second most important day of his political life. Delusional to the end.



 **Delusion 3** : And this gem from your same speech:



“And yet we all know that some of our critics gloomily forewarned that Labour in government wouldn’t be able to balance the books. But Grant has proved the naysayers wrong. He has kept a firm grip on the country’s finances and he is focused on running surpluses which is a vital part of our plan. **A surplus is a safety net** ”.



  
Not in an election year apparently! Three years ago Labour’s election promises were calculated to contain an 11 billion dollar fiscal hole. The amount borrowed was $10 billion. Who told the truth? Delusional to the end.



 **Delusion 4:** If you are prepared to spread this manure to the Party faithful, how can the electorate rely on you to run an honest and factual campaign? They don’t and you won’t of course.

Blizzard said the ban was for breaking tournament rules that players must not offend people or damage its image.
The interview aired on the official Hearthstone Taiwan video stream.
The stream was reportedly cut immediately after his statement and switched to showing adverts.
Hearthstone is played with a deck of virtual cards featuring heroes, relics and spells based on Blizzard's Warcraft titles.
Chung, who plays under the name Blitzchung, has been a regular top-10 player in the Asia-Pacific region since 2015 and has featured in Blizzard's roster of top Hearthstone players.
Many other players have taken now to social media to complain about Blizzard ""caving in"" to China.
Blizzard issued a statement, saying: ""Grandmasters is the highest tier of Hearthstone e-sports and we take tournament rule violations very seriously.
""While we stand by one's right to express individual thoughts and opinions, players and other participants that elect to participate in our e-sports competitions must abide by the official competition rules.""
As well as the year-long ban and loss of prize money Chung has been removed from the Grandmaster list that made him eligible to take part in top tournaments.
Blizzard said it would also stop working with the two video presenters who conducted the interview.
In a statement given to gaming news website InvenGlobal, Chung said his comments had been ""another form of participation of the protest"".
He added: ""It could cause me a lot of trouble, even my personal safety in real life.
""But I think it's my duty to say something about the issue."""
"SAN FRANCISCO  —   Google and Facebook have been taking steps to curb the number of false news articles propagated across their sites. On Wednesday, the Silicon Valley companies showed that they were still in the early stages of their battle to limit misinformation online. In a blog post, Google said it had permanently banned nearly 200 publishers from its AdSense advertising network near the end of last year, after putting into effect a policy in November to choke off websites that try to deceive users from its online ad service. On the same day, Facebook introduced changes to its Trending Topics feature  —   a part of the social network that some have blamed for spreading false information  —   to better promote reliable news articles. Yet taken together, the efforts showed how the fight against fake news remains a work in progress. Google’s bans were a drop in the bucket compared with the almost two million publishers that use AdSense. Facebook’s new measures were part of a continuing series of small experiments by the company to find out what worked best in displaying news to its users. “We genuinely asked Google and Facebook for ‘moonshots,’” said Jason Kint, the chief executive of Digital Content Next, an online publishing industry group. “We appreciate the work, but based on the numbers, that’s hardly even running in place. ” Google and Facebook have been in something of a   situation in recent months when it comes to fake news. Both companies have been grappling with a widespread backlash over how their sites may have spread rumors on a vast scale, and how little responsibility they take for any of the content that appears on their platforms. The issue came to a head after the American presidential election, when commentators accused Facebook in particular of swaying voters to President Trump through misleading and untrue news articles. In response, both companies have tried various measures to limit fake news. Google in November said it would ban sites that spread misinformation from AdSense as a way to impair how such sites make money. That same month, Facebook updated some of its policy language, which already said it would not display ads on sites that show misleading or illegal content, to include fake news sites. Facebook has since introduced other changes, including consulting   news organizations like The Associated Press and ABC News about the accuracy of articles that users report as being false. Google’s blog post on Wednesday was the first time the company explained the results of its moves against publishers that spread misinformation. The search giant said it reviewed 550 sites “suspected of misrepresenting content to users, including impersonating news organizations” in November and December. It took action against 340 of those sites and kicked nearly 200 publishers off its network permanently. Google was careful not to say that these were fake news sites, only sites that deceive users by misrepresenting themselves or their content. This month, Media Matters noted that Google changed the language of its advertising policy, removing the words “fake news. ” Google said the language change noted by Media Matters involved examples that help explain its policy but were not changes to the actual policy. Google declined to identify the sites or publishers it banned. Before taking steps to thwart fake news publishers, Google had an existing policy that outlawed publishers of “misrepresentative content,” such as websites peddling   schemes or counterfeit goods. It expanded this policy to include sites impersonating news organizations. Google was pulled into the fake news debate when Mediaite reported that, in the days after the election, the top result on a Google search for “final election vote count 2016” was a link to an article that incorrectly stated that Mr. Trump, who won the Electoral College, was ahead of his Democratic challenger, Hillary Clinton, in the popular vote. Google said that its search algorithms fell short but that the company would continue to work to improve its results. The AdSense system is a major revenue driver for independent web publishers who rely on the network to deliver display advertising on their sites. The publishers are paid when a reader views or clicks on those ads, with a portion of the proceeds going to Google. AdSense is one of the largest advertising networks on the web with nearly two million publishers using the system. Facebook did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the number of sites it has banned since November. Trending Topics is a feature on the social network that tells people what popular topics are being discussed on the site. Apart from more transparency around headlines, the changes to the feature on Wednesday included identifying popular topics through the number of publishers posting articles on Facebook about a piece of news, rather than engagement around a single article. “Today’s update may also help prevent hoaxes and fake news from appearing in Trending because the updated system identifies groups of articles shared on Facebook instead of relying solely on mentions of a topic,” the company said in a blog post. Still, industry watchers remain skeptical about the efficacy of these moves. “Nothing drives clicks better than when the headline is exactly what people want to hear or believe,” Ian Schafer, the chief executive and founder of Deep Focus, a digital advertising agency, referring specifically to Google. Mr. Schafer said that without significant changes to the economics and technology of online ads, banning individual sites would not produce change in the long run."
"What follows is an expanded version of a complaint sent to the ACCC. (The ACCC complaint form limits the amount of text than can be entered.)

I wish to complain about the Australian Government “Climate Change” advertisement currently showing on Australian TV (August, 2008). The text of the advertisement is as follows:

“Scientists warn Australia will be hit hard by climate change, with temperatures rising, water more scarce, and economists warn to protect our economy we must act now. We’re developing a Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme to tackle climate change, putting a limit on carbon pollution, and encouraging cleaner energy solutions. Think ‘climate’, think ‘change’. We can’t afford not to.”
I claim the advertisement fails these Advertising Standards Bureau Truth and Accuracy issues:

Misleading or deceptive advertising.
Misrepresentation in advertising.
The exploitation of community concerns in relation to portraying a product or service as benefiting the environment, if it does not.


The advertisement says, “scientists warn”, without qualification or reference to whom those scientists are. There are many scientists who dispute that climate change will cause significant problems. [http://www.petitionproject.org/; http://www.climatescienceinternational.org/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=37&Itemid=1; http://epw.senate.gov/public/index.cfm?FuseAction=Minority.SenateReport]
There is no qualification of what “hard hit” means.
There is no qualification of how high temperatures are supposedly going to rise; thus it is impossible to know from the advertisement whether such rises are significant and will thus result in a “hard hit”.
There is no qualification of whether “more scare” water applies to certain areas of Australia, nor of how significant such scarcity will be.
The reference to “economists warn” does not reference those economists, or that there are dissenting economists with differing views.
The advertisement uses the term “carbon pollution”. That is a meaningless (and misleading and deceptive) phrase. Carbon is an element. In the context of the climate change discussion, carbon as an element is not part of the discussion. The advertisement should refer (at least) to carbon dioxide, which is a gas.
The advertisement states that “carbon”, hence carbon dioxide, is a pollutant. But carbon dioxide is an essential gas present in trace amounts in the atmosphere. Without it, life on earth would not exist. Except in high concentrations, carbon dioxide is harmless to humans. There is considerable doubt that increases in carbon dioxide levels in the atmosphere are a significant cause of increased temperatures. [http://icecap.us/images/uploads/Evans-CO2DoesNotCauseGW.pdf; http://www.weatherquestions.com/Roy-Spencer-on-global-warming.htm]
The advertisement implies all climate change is something to avoid (“We’re developing a Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme to tackle climate change…”), but does not mention that climate has been changing for thousands of years, with the earth having been both colder and warmer than it is now. That is a misrepresentation of facts. [http://www.weatherquestions.com/Roy-Spencer-on-global-warming.htm#2000]
The advertisement exploits community concerns by attempting to cause fear by using the phrases “hard hit”, “must act now” and “can’t afford not to”.
The claim that we “must act now” are misleading because it implies temperatures are rising at a dangerous rate. In fact, global temperatures since 1998 have not passed that 1998 peak, and early 2008 global average temperatures are marginally less than the equivalent period of 1988 (repeating: 1988, not 1998). [http://wattsupwiththat.wordpress.com/2008/07/02/what-a-difference-20-years-makes/; http://www.weatherquestions.com/Roy-Spencer-on-global-warming.htm#2000]
The claim that a Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme will “tackle climate change”, presumably successfully, is false and deceptive. Australian greenhouse gas emissions are less than 1.5% of global emissions, so even if such a scheme were to be totally successful in eliminating all Australian emissions, the effect globally would be minuscule.
The phrase “We can’t afford not to” is misleading and deceptive. There is no qualification as to what the costs will be, so it is impossible for the advertisement to so claim.
The advertisement displays images of both cooling towers and “smoke stacks”. Both are deceptive. In the case of cooling towers, the only emission is of condensed water vapour. In the case of the smoke stacks, there is a misleading confusion of particulate pollution with colourless carbon dioxide gas.

The advertisement thus fails, in many instances, the tests for truth and accuracy.

"WASHINGTON  —   Vice President Mike Pence will speak on Friday to a gathering of   activists on the National Mall, a sign of the movement’s new and growing authority in a government now dominated by Republicans. The organizers for the event, the March for Life, had extended invitations to President Trump and Mr. Pence. A senior White House official confirmed that Mr. Pence would address the marchers. Mr. Pence’s appearance will come just a few days before Mr. Trump is expected to reveal his nominee for the Supreme Court seat left vacant by the death of Justice  Antonin Scalia  last year. Mr. Trump has said his pick, like Mr. Scalia, would oppose abortion rights, one of several promises he has made to roll back legal protections for the procedure. Other Republican presidents, including Ronald Reagan and George W. Bush, have spoken to the march, but remotely.   leaders see the Trump administration’s commitment to their cause and the looming Supreme Court nomination battle as a tipping point after eight years of a Democratic administration. The symbolism of hearing from Mr. Pence and another senior Trump administration official, Kellyanne Conway, at the march is hard to overlook. Mr. Trump eventually won over many reluctant   leaders who had chafed at his past support for abortion rights and his history of being a    role model for religious conservatives. Mr. Trump’s pledges to them, which he made in writing before the election, have gone a long way to rebuilding trust.   activists say they are among the most detailed and serious pledges a president has made to their cause. They include a vow to sign a nationwide ban on abortion at 20 weeks of pregnancy and a commitment to ensuring that his Supreme Court appointments are against the procedure."
"**Has China really banned PewDiePie?**
You would be forgiven for thinking so. After all, several major international news websites have written headlines about the world's most popular YouTuber being ""wiped"" or ""banned"" from the internet in China.
But there is one tiny problem - it did not happen.
Fanpages for PewDiePie still exist on Chinese social media, and a cursory search for his name on Baidu - China's Google - returns 8.28 million results.
PewDiePie himself originally claimed to have been banned in a video on Saturday but he later appeared to make light of the supposed block, suggesting he was not being completely serious.
He joked on Twitter that he had punched a wall in outrage.
""Well boys, we did it,"" he said in Saturday's video, which has been viewed 6.5m times. ""I'm banned from China.""
He continued: ""I spoke about the Hong Kong protests, and showed their leader being mocked for looking like Winnie the Pooh.""
He added searches for his name now bring up no results on certain forums and video platforms.
But did not mention that searches for him on video sites like iQiyi and Tencent Video still return tens of thousands of results.
Chinese authorities have banned any comparison between President Xi Jinping and Disney character Winnie the Pooh since 2017.
Put simply, the government is extremely sensitive about how the president is regarded and seeks to maintain the perception he is loved and praised by the country's 1.4bn population.
The Pooh comparisons were propelled back into the public consciousness in October 2019 when a South Park episode heavily criticised the Chinese government.
The show was subsequently largely made unavailable in China, with any search for it on social media and video websites returning no results.
But this has not happened to PewDiePie: Some content related to the YouTuber has indeed been made inaccessible online, such as a Baidu-run forum about him which has removed messages and even prevented people from posting new comments.
But there is no evidence to suggest this was done on the orders of the government.
In China, the general rule for censorship is: if something is too violent, sexualised, or goes against the government's message, it will be banned from the country.
Several manga and anime (Japanese comics and cartoons) are banned for the first two reasons.
Meanwhile celebrities are usually barred for the third reason. For example, Lady Gaga was reportedly denied a Chinese visa in 2016 over her meeting with the Dalai Lama.
With regards to PewDiePie, the censorship of the forum seems to be Baidu acting out of an abundance of caution.
The government has certainly not demanded that the search engine erase mentions of PewDiePie. A search for his name still returns more than eight million results.
A similar search on China's Twitter-like social media site Weibo produces plenty of results, including videos translated by Chinese fans and fanpages.
So what does a ban backed by the Chinese government look like?
Well, consider this search on Baidu for President Xi's daughter, Xi Mingze.
This is what a blanket ban looks like in China: an internet search for the president's daughter produces zero results, as though she does not exist.
One thing to remember is PewDiePie found success on a social media platform which cannot be accessed in China.
YouTube has been unavailable since 2009, so celebrities who gained mass popularity there are not necessarily similarly popular in China. And of course the country has its own massive established base of online celebrities that draws from a huge pool of more than 400 million live-streamers.
So while it is conceivable his comments have attracted censors' attention, PewDiePie simply has not been banned from the internet in China.
He might just not be popular enough for the censors to bother with."

In January 2016, Cathryn Townsend set out to live among “the loveless people.” So named by anthropologist Colin Turnbull, the Ik are a tribe of some 11,600 hunter-gatherers and subsistence farmers living in an arid and harsh mountainous region of Uganda.



Turnbull studied the Ik in the 1960s and famously characterized them as “inhospitable and generally mean” in his book _The Mountain People._ He documented how young children were abandoned to starve and how people would snatch food from the elderly. Townsend, a Rutgers University anthropologist, visited the Ik decades later to see how a culture that supposedly lacked basic kindness operated.



Her interest stemmed from an ongoing, multidisciplinary investigation called [The Human Generosity Project](http://www.humangenerosity.org/), which examines why and how human cooperation, in the form of generosity, threads its way through different cultures. The project began in 2014, through a partnership between Lee Cronk, a Rutgers University anthropologist, and Athena Aktipis, a psychologist at Arizona State University. Together, the pair wanted to investigate the cultural and biological factors behind generous behaviour. Today, through this project, more than 20 participating researchers use an array of tools, including economic simulations and computer modelling, to study altruism and cooperation at nine field sites.



In certain communities, giving to those in need, with no expectation of return, is normalized and expected. The project researchers have found such behaviour around the world, including among herders and hunter-gatherers in East Africa. And [findings thus far](http://www.humangenerosity.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Chapter-for-Global-perspectives-on-long-term-community-resource-management-draft-for-posting.pdf) suggest that such generous societies are more likely to survive during difficult times.



If that pattern holds up, lessons from The Human Generosity Project could be vital as the world faces a multitude of unpredictable challenges from the onslaught of climate change and increasing economic inequality. “Ultimately, it would be nice if we could encourage higher levels of cooperation and higher levels of generosity,” Cronk says.



Townsend, a member of the project, went to study the Ik to find a counterexample to generous cultures. She and her colleagues wanted to see how an allegedly “selfish” society operated. But when she arrived, she found something different: Even among “the loveless people,” there was a thriving tradition of generosity.



Generosity, as Townsend, Cronk, and their colleagues study it, can be thought of as a form of insurance. In certain communities, when disaster strikes, people spring into action to help one another, as though an unwritten contract stated: _When it’s really bad, I’ll help you because you would help me in the same circumstances_. The Human Generosity Project researchers call this spirit of reciprocal giving “need-based transfer.”



In August 2017, as Hurricane Harvey deluged Houston, Texas, for example, an informal network of boat owners from Louisiana who first emerged during Hurricane Katrina more than a decade earlier streamed into Texas to rescue those trapped in the flood. They call themselves the “Cajun Navy,” and they, too, live in flood-prone regions.



Such volunteerism is not the only way to respond to a crisis. “Humans have been organizing to manage risk associated with injury and illness since time immemorial,” Aktipis notes. In contrast to need-based transfer, many modern societies offer a market-based alternative in the form of insurance companies, which help people pool risk against future hazards. Participants pay into a network with the presumption that they will be able to tap it if injury, illness, or disaster occurs.



Aktipis explains that although insurance offers an efficient solution, in that it rapidly gathers money in one place, it’s not a perfect fix. “Oftentimes [insurance] doesn’t actually cover you when you need it,” Aktipis says. For instance, as wildfires swept through California in 2018, some residents discovered that their homeowners insurance would no longer cover them because their homes were [too close to dry brush](https://eu.vcstar.com/story/money/business/2018/08/03/california-homeowners-insurance-dropped-fire-season/788621002/).



Need-based transfer, on the other hand, is based on relationships, making it a more reliable solution. You care about your neighbours, and they care about you. “[It] insures against the uninsurable,” Aktipis says.



One of the best examples of such giving comes from Maasai herders in southern Kenya and northern Tanzania who are connected by their _[osotua](https://www.sapiens.org/culture/can-vampire-bats-teach-us-friendship/)_[network](https://www.sapiens.org/culture/can-vampire-bats-teach-us-friendship/). (The word osotua means umbilical cord in the Maasai’s language.) If one of the members needs help, others in the network support him or her by giving livestock or labor, without any expectation of payback.



Anthropologist and Human Generosity Project researcher Dennis Sonkoi, himself a member of the Maasai, says he didn’t truly appreciate the protective power of osotua until he came to the United States from Kenya in 2008. At the time, he wanted to learn new resource management techniques to safeguard his homeland’s still mostly pristine forests. When he met Cronk and discussed generosity, however, he realized Maasai cultural practices, such as osotua, had likely spared his homeland’s natural resources from development thus far. It was like a “pin dropping in my thoughts,” says Sonkoi.



Computer modelling confirmed what Sonkoi had deduced. Aktipis and her colleagues used an algorithm to compare outcomes in three kinds of community: one using need-based transfer, another in which sharing resources occurs with the expectation of repayment (a practice called account keeping), and a third in which there is no sharing at all. The test was modelled after the Maasai pastoral lifestyle, which involves sharing cattle. The simulation would randomly generate drought or disease, and the researchers could see how the herds endured in each simulated society. Both forms of sharing, the simulation revealed, resulted in better herd survival than no sharing of cattle. But need-based transfer led to more pooling of resources, longer survival of the herd, and greater wealth equality than account keeping.



To date, The Human Generosity Project has turned up many examples of need-based transfer. In Fiji, for instance, extended families in villages practice _kerekere_ , the act of sharing resources when requested, without expectation of short-term repayment. In the arid and semi-arid U.S. Southwest, ranchers fill in with free labour in the event that a fellow rancher is recovering from illness or injury. They call this practice “neighbouring.” In Central Appalachia, which includes some of the poorest communities in the U.S., neighbours still help each other by providing free labour without being asked.



But Townsend journeyed to Uganda to see a community with a very different reputation from these altruistic societies that first served as a focal point for the project. In his book, Turnbull painted a dramatic portrait of the Ik, warning in the preface that the reader would be shocked by the tribe and tempted to think “how primitive … how savage … how disgusting” and “how inhuman.” (The book, incidentally, left its mark on the tribe and on Western culture, inspiring a play in 1975 called _The Iks_ by director Peter Brook and appearing in Richard Dawkins’ _The Selfish Gene_.)



But “loveless” is not at all how Townsend would describe the community she came to live with in 2016. Among a tribe that had been derided as cruel, she found notable acts of generosity. For example, she witnessed how the community provided meals for an elderly man who lived alone and shared food with Townsend without her needing to ask. “They’re really people who have very little, but the little they do have is stuff that they’re willing to share,” she says.



Townsend probes generous behaviour among the Ik using an experiment called the “[dictator game](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs10683-011-9283-7).” One person (the “dictator”) is given the choice to distribute a sum of money to another player. She tweaks the game to see whether various factors will affect how much the “dictator” gives.



In general, Townsend says, the Ik are “fairly normal” in what they give away when comparing them to how members of other societies play the game. In other words, there is nothing inherently more generous or selfish about the Ik.



Turnbull, it turned out, had studied the Ik during a famine that plagued the region in 1965 and 1966. It was a time that a neighbouring tribe still calls a “year of one cup,” in reference to the meager annual rations they received from the government: one cup of maize per person.



That period of the Ik’s history revealed that there can be limits to cooperation and generosity. Extreme deprivation may prevent a community from caring for its own. But these circumstances can change. The Ik survived and, Townsend found, they maintain a culture of sharing with extended families and neighbours in need of food, shelter, or labour. Among the much-maligned “loveless people,” there was a rich tradition of need-based transfer.



The Ik’s choice to share food based on need indicates that they have passed the starting point for complex cooperative behaviour, Townsend says. When individuals begin to move beyond the most basic need to survive, forms of cooperation that further ensure survival emerge, such as need-based transfers, trade, or something she calls “demand sharing,” where successful members of a society share their surplus by default—a pattern akin to taxation.



Looking across communities, Townsend and other Human Generosity Project researchers have concluded that the world is not divided into generous versus selfish societies. Rather, charity and reciprocity are baked into human civilization. It’s the mix of cooperation and risk-pooling strategies (such as account keeping, need-based transfer, or market-based insurance) that varies—and it’s probable that societies benefit from combining them.



Going forward, The Human Generosity Project aims to understand which approaches are most beneficial in given circumstances in order to inject these concepts into other cultures. “It’s really about taking these findings and translating them into interventions that can help build the social infrastructure for dealing with challenges of the future, whether they’re disaster response or resource management,” Aktipis says.



Scaling up solutions can be difficult. [Aktipis has found](http://www.humangenerosity.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Aktipis-2016-Evolutionary_Applications.pdf) that the bigger the society, the harder it is to detect cheaters in a need-based transfer system. However, Aktipis writes that a society’s belief in the supernatural may play a particularly strong role in helping people solidify generous behaviour. The Maasai, for instance, consider osotua so sacred that it would be unthinkable to take advantage of that bond. Christians in the U.S. may experience something similar when the collection plate comes by at church.



“I don’t think we share or are generous to each other for any one reason,” says Wesley Allen-Arave, a University of New Mexico anthropologist who is not affiliated with The Human Generosity Project. Allen-Arave interviewed more than 500 households in the United States about charitable giving and found that while people sometimes give to help others in need, they give much more often when they have a personal relationship with the person asking for donations.



And Townsend, too, has seen spirituality tip the scales. If she adjusts the dictator game to mention the _kijawikå_ , earth spirits in whom the Ik believe, the Ik become even more generous. They believe the _kijawikå_ will reward the generous and punish the stingy.



But she’s also observed an additional, intriguing pattern—one that further nuances our understanding of societies in need. As Townsend was conducting the dictator game, she noticed that those people who had experienced trauma in the past were more generous than others who had not. It’s an aspect of the Ik she aims to explore with further research. “It seems that might be some kind of catalyst for extraordinary generous behaviour,” Townsend says.



In retrospect, it’s ironic that the Ik were meant to be a prime example of a selfish society. To this day, the Ik barely get by. They face challenges from other tribes and drought, but they stay alive by sticking together, according to Townsend.



“The way that they cope,” Townsend says, “is not by being selfish but by sharing.”

Guest essay by Eric Worrall
Swiss Chocolate Makers are working hard to ensure that a warmer world will still be able to enjoy premium chocolate treats.
According to The Daily Meal;
Swiss Chocolatier Barry Callebaut Creates Heat-Resistant Chocolate to Survive Global Warming
Swiss chocolate company Barry Callebaut has created heat-resistant chocolate in an effort to expand to more tropical climates.
Other chocolate companies, like Nestlé and Hershey, are also developing heat-tolerant chocolates to sell in warmer regions.
In an effort to introduce its products to new markets, including warmer climates, Swiss chocolate company Barry Callebaut has introduced commercially available heat-resistant luxury chocolate, a new blend that can resist temperatures up to 38 degrees Celsius or 100.4 degrees Fahrenheit — four degrees higher than normal.
Read more: http://www.thedailymeal.com/cook/swiss-chocolatier-barry-callebaut-creates-heat-resistant-chocolate-survive-global-warming/122815
As someone who lives on the Southern edge of the Australian tropics, I see this as an important development in food technology. My wife keeps all her chocolate in the fridge, which cuts down space for storing beer fresh vegetables. If this new kind of chocolate can be stored outside of the fridge, it will reduce pressure on me to buy a bigger fridge, which will help save the planet.

The Week That Was: 2015-08-29 (August 29, 2015) Brought to You by SEPP (www.SEPP.org) The Science and Environmental Policy Project
THIS WEEK: By Ken Haapala, President, Science and Environmental Policy Project (SEPP)
Divergence: It is summertime in the US, and temperatures are warmer. Several readers have asked TWTW for comments on the recent claims that July 2015 was the hottest month ever and similar announcements by certain US government entities, including branches of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA). These entities are making strong public statements that the globe continues to warm, and the future is dire. A humorist could comment that the closer we are to the 21st session of the Conference of the Parties (COP-21) of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) to be held in Paris from November 30 to December 11, the hotter the globe becomes.
However, there are three significant forms of divergence that are being demonstrated. One divergence is the increasing difference between atmospheric temperatures and surface temperatures. The second divergence is the growing difference between temperatures forecast by models and observed temperatures, particularly atmospheric temperatures. This leads to the third divergence, the difference between the activities of what can be called the Climate Establishment and what is observed in nature.
The atmospheric temperatures are reported by two independent entities: the largely NASA-financed UAH entity at the University of Alabama in Huntsville, and Remote Sensing Systems (RSS) in California. The surface temperatures are reported by NOAA, NASA, and Hadley Centre of the UK Met Office, combined with those of the Climatic Research Unit (CRU) of the University of East Anglia. These measurements depend, in part, on the historic record maintained by NOAA’s National Climatic Data Center (NCDC). Unfortunately, for more than two decades, the historic record of the surface temperatures has been adjusted numerous times, without adequate records of the details and the effects. The net effect is an inflation of a warming trend, particularly obvious in the US where excellent historic records continue to exist. The UAH data have been adjusted, but the adjustments and effects have been publically recorded.
The divergence between the temperatures forecasted by the global climate models and the observed temperatures is becoming extremely obvious, particularly with the observed atmospheric temperatures. The adjustments to surface temperatures lessen this divergence somewhat, particular with the latest adjustments by the NCDC, where superior measurements taken by fixed or floating buoys were inflated to correspond with earlier, inferior measurements taken by ships. The director of NCDC, Tom Karl, was a lead author in the paper announcing this change. As a result, we should see announcements that sea surface temperatures, and global surface temperatures, are increasing, although the increase may be strictly an artifact of human adjustments rather than an occurrence in nature.
The questionable adjustments in reported surface temperatures leads to the third form of increasing divergence – the differences between what is reported by the Climate Establishment and what is occurring in nature. The Climate Establishment can be defined as those who embrace the findings of the UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), particularly the assertion of a high confidence, a high degree of certainty, that human emissions of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases are causing unprecedented and dangerous global warming. Simply because data is adjusted to reflect the IPCC view, does not mean that the IPCC view is occurring.
The greenhouse effect takes place in the atmosphere, yet it is not being observed in the atmosphere. The satellite data, independently verified by four sets of weather balloon data, clearly shows it is not. There has been no significant warming for about 18 years. These data are the most comprehensive temperature data existing and are largely independent of other human influences that bias surface data such as urbanization, including building of structures and impervious surfaces, and other changes in land use. Those who broadcast claims of the hottest year ever, based on adjusted surface data, are actually emphasizing the divergence between science practiced by the Climate Establishment and Nature, and are not engaged in a natural science.
Unfortunately, many government entities and government-funded entities are involved in the Climate Establishment. The leaders of such government entities and funding entities demonstrate a lack of concern for institutional credibility, no respect for the scientific bases on which such institutions were built, including those who came before them and those who will replace them, and will leave their institutions in an inferior condition, rather than strengthen them.
It is important to note that not all government-funded entities are so involved. The National Space Science & Technology Center (NSSTC) at the University of Alabama in Huntsville (UAH), which is largely funded by the federal government (NASA) is a notable exception.

Ice Ages: Nature Communications published a new study proclaiming evidence that greenhouse gas concentrations drive the advance and retreat of glaciers, including those in the last Ice Age. The assertion was immediately emphasized by various organizations in the mass media. The opening sentence illustrates the quality of the work: “The ongoing retreat of glaciers globally is one of the clearest manifestations of recent global warming associated with rising greenhouse gas concentrations.” At best, the statement is a logical fallacy, petitio principii, better known as “begging the question.” That is, the main point of contention, the influence of greenhouses gases on temperatures, is assumed to be conceded.
The logic used in the abstract is similar to that Al Gore used in his film “An Inconvenient Truth.” Studies of carbon dioxide (CO2) and temperatures from ice cores with finer resolution than used by Gore showed that the inflection points [significant change in direction] do not match, and the CO2 inflection points lagged behind temperature inflection points by up to 8 to 10 centuries. If CO2 is the primary driver of temperature change, changes in its concentration should occur first.
In informal correspondence, physicist Donald Rapp, author of Ice Ages and Interglacials: Measurements, Interpretation, and Models, makes similar observations about the study, and states that the authors may have confused cause with effect. He emphasizes that no one really understands why and how the last ice age ended over a 10,000 year period from about 18,000 to 8,000 years ago. The hypotheses that have been advanced are highly speculative. We know that as the earth came out of the ice age, CO2 levels rose as the oceans warmed, but why did the oceans warm? See links under Un-Science or Non-Science?
*********************
Dramatic Sea Level Rise? A newly formed NASA Sea Level Change Team issued a press release stating it found dramatic increase in sea levels. According to team member Steve Nerem: “Given what we know now about how the ocean expands as it warms and how ice sheets and glaciers are adding water to the seas, it’s pretty certain we are locked into at least 3 feet of sea level rise, and probably more.” The date not specified, except it is sometime in the future. Further, it may be completely unrelated to carbon dioxide.
The press release goes on to state: “Scientists estimate that about one-third of sea level rise is caused by expansion of warmer ocean water, one-third is due to ice loss from the massive Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets, and the remaining third results from melting mountain glaciers. But, the fate of the polar ice sheets could change that ratio and produce more rapid increases in the coming decades.”
If the claims can be substantiated, the findings are significant, and disturbing. But as of August 29, there is little else to review other than the press release. The world-wide sea level rise that is claimed to be observed, 3 inches since 1992, significantly exceeds that observed using traditional tidal gauges. We must await the details, otherwise the whole episode just becomes an example of science by press release. See links under Lowering Standards.

Limits of Knowledge: The New York Times has an op-ed with the provocative, and perhaps misunderstood headline “The Case for Teaching Ignorance.” Understanding the limits of knowledge is an important part of education. Learning to form penetrating questions are often critical to advancing knowledge. The approach explained in the article is refreshing, compared with the unfounded certainty commonly found in professional life. See link under Other News that May Be of Interest.
*********************
Other Causes of Warming? According to recently published research in Advances in Space Research, the surface temperatures of many rocky planets and moons in the solar system can accurately be predicted over a broad range of atmospheric conditions and radiative regimes only using two forcing variables: top-of-the-atmosphere solar irradiance and total surface atmospheric pressure. The planets and moons considered are Venus, Earth, the Moon, Mars, Titan (a moon of Saturn), and Triton (a moon of Neptune). If the research is verified, then the case for global warming from increased greenhouses gases becomes weaker.
This analysis brings up an interesting issue raised by some global warming alarmists. At the surface, the atmospheric pressure of Venus is about 90 times that of earth at its surface. As the ideal gas laws indicate, this pressure, alone, will result in far greater temperatures on Venus than on earth. The atmosphere of Venus is about 96% carbon dioxide. Yet, many alarmists have warned that Venus is an example of what will happen on earth with the an increased greenhouse effect, not pressure, if human created greenhouse gases accumulate in the atmosphere from three to four parts per 10,000.

1. Why Is the EPA Cleaning Up Mines?
Private mining companies have already shown they are better equipped to deal with the mess.
By Rhett Larson, WSJ, Aug 21, 2015
http://www.wsj.com/articles/why-is-the-epa-cleaning-up-mines-1440196476
SUMMARY: The author, an associate professor of law at Arizona State University, opens with the blunt statement: “Images of the bright-yellow Animas River in Colorado, fouled by millions of gallons of toxic wastewater accidentally released from an abandoned mine by contractors working for the Environmental Protection Agency last week, prompt a serious question: Why was the EPA even managing this waste in the first place? Mining companies that have the skills and experience to clean up such sites should be doing this work.”
“There are more than 557,000 abandoned hard rock mines in 32 states throughout the country. These sites often have been inactive for decades, and the responsible party either no longer exists or cannot be found. Abandoned mines can have devastating effects on the environment, and mismanaging them can lead to catastrophic spills like the one in the Animas River. Acids, heavy metals and toxic sediments from these spills can persist for years, preventing use of the water and harming agriculture, fishing, wildlife and recreation.”
The author cites specific examples of successful clean-up operations performed by private companies, then states that mining companies are reluctant to take on such tasks. If the EPA “disaster had occurred at the hand of a mining company, the firm and its leaders would face a public relations nightmare, and perhaps a legal one. Mining companies are understandably reluctant to risk such liability without some assurance that they will not be punished for accidents resulting from reasonable efforts to clean up somebody else’s mess.
 
“Three reforms can get the best people involved in cleaning up pollution from abandoned mines. First, mining companies that voluntarily agree to help remediate orphaned mines should be eligible for “Good Samaritan” permits for cleanup operations. These permits could provide that, if mining companies use the best available pollution prevention measures and otherwise comply with permit requirements, they would be shielded from liability under state and federal law.
 
“Second, companies that generate net ecological benefits by remediating orphaned mines should qualify for expedited permitting for other projects. New mines typically must obtain permits under the Clean Water Act, Clean Air Act and other environmental laws before they begin operations. When a mining company agrees to remediate an orphaned site in connection with a new mining project, the regulatory system should make such permits less expensive and easier to obtain.
 
“Third, states could form environmental credit markets that would enable mining companies to make money from activities that help the environment. When a mining company remediates an abandoned mine and improves water quality, it could receive credits allowing certain other limited discharges into that river or aquifer, so long as those discharges do not violate water quality standards. Even if the mining company does not itself have any use for the credits, it could sell them to another firm—say, a manufacturer whose operations release pollutants into the water.

2. Improved Storm Modeling Since Katrina Changes Insurance Equation
By Ben DiPietro, WSJ, Aug 27, 2015
http://blogs.wsj.com/riskandcompliance/2015/08/27/improved-catastrophe-modeling-since-katrina-changes-insurance-equation/
SUMMARY: “Hurricane Katrina changed the way insurance companies and some corporations build catastrophe models and calculate the potential damage from a big storm, leading to more accurate damage predictions, better risk assessments and more strategic and cost-effective insurance policy decisions, some risk management experts said.
 
“Catastrophe storm models from when Katrina hit 10 years ago were fairly crude and largely used by insurers to assess portfolio exposure–basically attempting to understand how much risk a company or insurer had in a given geography, wind zone, earthquake zone or flood zone, said Steve Truono, vice president of global risk management and insurance at Starwood Hotels & Resorts. But those models in many cases were inaccurate and weren’t necessarily developed or tailored to address complications that might arise, he said.”
The article emphasizes the more accurate modeling by insurances companies of the costs of replacing losses, including how they collect and assess data from storms, rather than better modeling of significant storms. All this applies to risk management as seen at the corporate level.

3. The EPA’s Own Email Problem
Another government employee, another private account, another crashed hard drive.
By Kimberley Strassel, WSJ, Aug 27, 2015
http://www.wsj.com/articles/the-epas-own-email-problem-1440718297
Discussing the subpoena of Phillip North by a federal court in regard to EPA’s denial to a permit for the Pebble mine in Alaska, the author states: government workers don’t use private email because it is “convenient.” “They use private email to engage in practices that may be unsavory, or embarrassing, or even illegal. Let’s be clear about that.
 
“Mr. North was, until a few years ago, a biologist at the Environmental Protection Agency, based in Alaska. Around 2005 he became enmeshed in reviewing the Pebble Partnership’s proposal to develop a mine there. Mr. North has openly admitted that he was opposed to this idea early on, and he is entitled to his opinion. Still, as a government employee his first duty is to follow the law.
 
“In the normal course of law, Pebble would file for permits and the Army Corps of Engineers would get the first say over approval. The EPA has a secondary role. But records show that EPA officials, including Mr. North, had no intention of letting the process get that far. They set about to “pre-emptively” veto the mine, before Pebble could even file for permits. But for the EPA to so flagrantly insert itself into the process, it needed cause. This is where Mr. North and his private email come in.
 
“The biologist was deeply involved in most of the work on Pebble, and would later brag about his role in killing the project. He had briefed high-level officials; drafted an early “options paper” laying out the veto strategy; and taken a star role in the “science” the EPA would use to justify the 2014 veto. But perhaps Mr. North’s biggest contribution was as serving as a liaison to (and coordinating with) anti-mine activists.
 
“The EPA would ultimately claim that it acted ‘in response to petitions’ filed against the mine in 2010 by Native American tribes. But those petitions didn’t spring from nowhere. According to documents Pebble has given a federal court, Mr. North was working with those outside activists to engineer the petitions—from inside the EPA. He also worked with the activists, including a lawyer representing the tribes, to hone the EPA’s veto strategy. And he did this via a private email address. Why? Because he shouldn’t have been doing any of it.”
 
It gets weirder, in that Mr. North was one of those Obama employees whose government hard drives conveniently crashed. Only after Congress started investigating the Pebble scandal did the EPA inform lawmakers that Mr. North’s crash just happened to wipe out documents from the period in question.
 
“Mr. North, meanwhile, has fled the country. He retired from the EPA in the spring of 2013. The House Oversight Committee in July of that year asked him to appear for an interview. They went round and round on a possible date, until in October 2013 he claimed he was on a world boat tour, and that moreover his boat had suffered damage. He also hired a lawyer, who has not made Mr. North available for in-person or telephone interviews. He’s thought to be in Australia.
 
“That’s why Pebble in mid-August asked a federal court to subpoena Mr. North and his documents. The EPA for its part has continued to suggest that Mr. North was only a junior employee who had no real role in the veto process.”
After quoting the judge who expressed that the court would be surprised if the EPA were not as anxious as Pebble to obtain testimony and access to documents controlled by Mr. North, the author concludes that agencies such as the EPA “know exactly why their employees use private email. And they know the release of it means nothing but trouble.”

Sweden’s Nuclear Shutdown A Sign Of What’s To Come
By Michael McDonald, Oil Price.com, Aug 27, 2015
http://oilprice.com/Alternative-Energy/Nuclear-Power/Swedens-Nuclear-Shutdown-A-Sign-Of-Whats-To-Come.html
“Sweden is a prime example of this. The country generates almost 35 percent of its electricity from nuclear power – just shy of the amount that it generates from all renewable sources combined.
“As governments around the world have opted to subsidize renewable power while taxing other forms of power, renewable supplies have increased. This supply increase in turn has pushed down wholesale power prices, which has led to lower profits for conventional utility companies. Then as renewable use has expanded, production costs have fallen dramatically leading to still more investment in renewables, greater supply of wholesale electricity, and even more pain for utility companies.”

Whither field hydrology? The need for discovery science and outrageous hydrological hypotheses
By Burt and McDonnell, AGU, Aug 21, 2015
http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/2014WR016839/full?campaign=wlytk-41855.4225462963
“We chronicle the decline in field work and note that it is not only the quantity of field work that is diminishing but its character is changing too: from discovery science to data collection for model parameterization. While the latter is a necessary activity, the loss of the former is a major concern if we are to advance the science of watershed hydrology.”

"A response to the Green Paper on Climate Change – a comment by Viv Forbes, Chairman of the Carbon Sense Coalition. 16 July 2008
The Climate will fluctuate.
It always has, it always will.
Get used to it.
The Government Green Paper completely ignores the main question – should Canberra try to control the weather, or is it better to foster a strong Australia able to cope with whatever climate change brings us?
The Government also justifies the need for action on completely worthless long term forecasts of Australia’s weather.

Not even the IPCC claims an ability to forecast the weather beyond a few days, but the CSIRO has sullied its reputation by pretending they can project temperature and rainfall 30 years into the future. Why have they not revealed the calculations for these predictions? In the corporate world, anyone making such wild unsubstantiated claims would be quickly disciplined by the regulators. Public figures who repeat and embellish these scaremongering prophecies lack common sense and should also be called to account.
The only credible weather forecast for such a long period is “It will Fluctuate”.
Minister Wong obviously believes that if we give her enough powers to tax and regulate, she can change the world’s weather.
This belief is as silly as the CSIRO weather forecasts out to 2040. Man has never been able to control the weather and there is no credible evidence that his activities have caused unusual weather. In fact, despite all the hot air about carbon emissions, the world has not warmed since 1998 and has been cooling for the last 6 years. Moreover, we have had extreme droughts, floods, ice ages and global warming long before man started using coal and oil.
Minister Wong should make sure Australia has the industrial ability and economic strength to cope with any adverse weather that occurs, be it floods, fires, droughts, snow, heat, cyclones or tsunamis.
Poor people cannot cope with Climate Change and the Rudd/Garnaut/Wong carbon taxes will make every Australian poorer.
This Deep Green Paper should be recycled and replaced by an enlightened White Paper outlining how to make Australia strong and prosperous. This will provide the best insurance for our children against any climate change.

"In the last century, countries across the world have dammed rivers, built infrastructure and expanded industry and agriculture – all in the name of developing society. To do so, we harnessed water, mined minerals and metals, and mastered land and its inhabitants. Indeed, the use and abuse of nature has been par for the course in human progress. But these actions are not without consequence. Aside from the developing climate and ecological crises, the way individuals, businesses and states relate to land constructs their identities. When these identities are challenged, it can define political arenas. As my ongoing research in India shows, it’s not just us who shape the land – the land shapes us too. When humans undertake large development projects, we quite literally shape land. In levelling the earth, digging, or removing longstanding features such as boulders, we physically manipulate it. We also alter the microbial, animal, plant and human populations that existed on it before.  Development projects legally redefine land too. For example, in western India, I’ve been following a massive private development project centred around cement production. The project covers three thousand hectares on the coast of the Arabian Sea. It includes factories, mining operations, a port, a power plant and a settlement equipped with schools, shopping centres and a hospital. Much of this is on land that was until recently recognised as for common use. Humans clearly remake land for their needs. But this process of influence doesn’t just go one way. Our relationships with land can fundamentally reshape our governments, markets, politics and societies. Land marked for development is often passed off as wasted space. But such lands usually have a long history of supporting humans and wildlife. My research indicates that the land on which the cement project was built was home to a range of fishworking communities, pastoralists, forest produce pickers and farmers, as well as a wide range of animals and plants, and vital natural carbon stores including mangroves. This fits an age old pattern. For centuries, humans have been privileging narratives of untouched or unproductive land ripe to be capitalised on. Communities who inhabit such land have often built up working and spiritual relationships over generations, making it a central part of their identity. To the affected communities in western India, the development project means the loss of a mother, a nurturer, their connection to their ancestors, and their deities resident in the soil, rivers and coast. Such clashes between displaced citizens and businesses looking to profit – shaped by their varying relationships with the land – deeply influence the political landscape. In India, the state has largely supported private companies over the local populations, marking the government as pro-business. To justify this position and continue garnering votes, the country’s ruling party has routinely stoked nationalist sentiment and played up fears of terrorism. For example, some politicians have used political tensions with nearby Pakistan to accuse dispossessed workers in the area of being connected with terrorism – without evidence. The government supports this perception by deploying security forces to guard ports, mines and factories. Across the country, the state consistently portrays the rush of new development projects as a positive, nation-building exercise. Protesters, activists, students, dissenting journalists other people who don’t agree with this narrative are now openly termed anti-nationals.  Authoritarian nationalism and fears of terrorism have gripped India in recent years, and the deep bond with land felt by local people has played a central role in the rhetoric politicians have constructed to justify developing on it. Struggles over land and nature shape local politics too. Land struggles often give rise to political leaders who fight for the rights of local people and oppose national agendas. Election battlegrounds in my field sites weigh job promises of state collaborators with pledges to protect land from outsiders. These battlegrounds would never have developed had the land locals inhabited not deeply influenced their way of life and identity, and put these relationships in contest with a nationalist state and big business. Similar stories to India’s are found all over the world. States such as Brazil, Mozambique, Indonesia, and Malaysia all engage in various shades of political manoeuvres to justify pro-business attitudes. These are a direct result of nature’s deep influence over the identity of communities inhabiting affected land. States, businesses, individuals and the political interplay between them are all labelled and shaped by the natural world. Being aware of this helps us to bring nature to the forefront of our everyday lives. If we can keep it there, perhaps the next century of human development won’t come at such cost to the natural world. Click here to subscribe to our climate action newsletter.

Share this...FacebookTwitterYesterday the online German news weekly FOCUS here wrote an article that is certainly more bad news for Germany’s electricity consumers, who are already paying among the highest rates in the world.
One of Germany’s major power grid operators, Tennet, announced it is “massively increasing power grid fees” and that “power is going to be more expensive“.
Exploding costs, unstable supply
This is another setback for German power consumers, who have seen their power bills explode since Germany enacted the renewable energy feed in tariffs into law as part of the Energiewende (transition to renewable energies).

Average electric power rates for German households in €-cents. The largest cost driver by far is the feed-in tariff for green energies. Source BDEW.
German power used to be affordable, and highly reliable. But all that has changed since climate hysteria and the green movement took over 15 years ago. Today German power is among the most expensive worldwide.
FOCUS writes:

Power companies will have to deal with a higher electric bill next year. Power grid operator Tennet is increasing its price massively, and bases this on the resulting costs of the Energiewende.”

FOCUS quotes Tennet Director Urban Keussen:

Our power grid fees will increase 80 percent on January 1st.”

For a three-person household, this will mean another 30 euros burden annually, says Keussen.
“Grid stabilization emergency measures”
Moreover the highly volatile wind and solar energies have made the German grid highly unstable and have recently seen it on the verge of collapse. The major problem is that the power grid has been far from adequately expanded to accommodate the briskly expanding solar and wind energy capacity, thus leading to gigantic transmission bottlenecks and massive grid instability.
In fact the added costs in grid fees will have very little to do with grid expansion itself. Rather they are mostly due to “grid stabilization emergency measures” to prevent a total collapse.  FOCUS writes:
The lion’s share of the increase in grid fees from Tennet are due to grid stabilization emergency measures,’ said Keussen. ‘Only 5% are because of grid expansion.'”
FOCUS adds that in 2015 alone “bottleneck management” led to costs totaling about 1 billion euros.

The mainstream media has lit up the past few days with headlines of “alarming” news coming out of Antarctica highlighting new research on a more rapid than expected loss of ice from glaciers there.   
  
But, as typical with blame-it-on-humans climate change stories, the coverage lacks detail, depth, and implication as well as being curiously timed.   
  
We explain.   
  
The research, by a team led by University of Cal-Irvine doctoral candidate Tyler Sutterley, first appeared online at the journal _Geophysical Research Letters_ on November 15th, about two weeks before Thanksgiving. So why is it making headlines now? Probably because the National Aeronautics and Space Administration issued a press release on the new paper on December 2nd. Why wait so long? Because on December 1st, the United Nations kicked off its annual climate confab and the Obama administration is keen on orchestrating its release of scary-sounding climate stories so as to attempt to generate support for its executively commanded (i.e., avoiding Congress) carbon dioxide reduction initiatives that will be on display there. This also explains the recent National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration speculation that 2014 is going to be the “warmest year on record”—another headline grabber—two months before all the data will be collected and analyzed.   
  
This is all predictable—and will essentially be unsuccessful.   
  
Missing from the hype are the broader facts.   
  
The new Sutterley research finds that glaciers in the Amundsen Sea Embayment region along the coast of West Antarctica are speeding up and losing ice. This is potentially important because the ice loss contributes to global sea level rise. The press coverage is aimed to make this sound alarming—“This West Antarctic region sheds a Mount Everest-sized amount of ice every two years, study says” screamed the _Washington Post_.   
  
Wow! That sounds like a lot. Turns out, it isn’t.   




The global oceans are vast. Adding a “Mount Everest-sized amount of ice every two years” to them results in a sea level rise of 0.02 inches per year. But “New Study Finds Antarctic Glaciers Currently Raise Sea Level by Two-Hundredths of an Inch Annually” doesn’t have the same ring to it.   
  
Nor does the coverage draw much attention to the fact that the Amundsen Sea Embayment is but one of a great many watersheds across Antarctica that empty into the sea. A study published in _Nature_ magazine back in 2012 by Matt King and colleagues provided a more comprehensive look at glacier behavior across Antarctica. They did report, in agreement with the Sutterley findings, that glacial loss in the Amundsen Sea Embayment was rapid, but they also reported that for other large areas of Antarctica, ice loss was minimal or even negative (i.e., ice was accumulating). Figure 1, taken from the King paper, presents the broader and more relevant perspective (note that the Amundsen Sea Embayment is made up by the areas labelled 21 and 22 in Figure 1).   






  
  
_Figure 1. Best estimate of rate of ice loss from watershed across Antarctica. The Amundsen Sea Embayment, the focus of the Sutterley study, is encompassed by areas labeled 21 and 22 (taken from King et al., 2012)._   
  
We discussed the King and colleagues study in more detail when it first came out. We concluded:   




So King and colleagues’ latest refinement puts the Antarctic contribution to global sea level rise at a rate of about one-fifth of a millimeter per year (or in English units, 0.71 inches per century).   
  
Without a significantly large acceleration—and recall the King et al. found none—this is something that we can all live with for a long time to come.



The strategically timed new findings being hyped this week do not change this conclusion.

"**The main hospital in the capital of Ethiopia's northern region of Tigray is ""dangerously low"" on supplies as it treats the wounded from the fighting around the city, the Red Cross says.**
On Saturday, Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed had said that federal forces had taken control of the city.
He described it as the ""last phase"" in the three-week long conflict with the Tigray People's Liberation Front.
But the TPLF leader vowed to fight on, in a statement to Reuters.
Few details have emerged from Tigray throughout the fighting as communications have been cut.
The statement from the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) provides a rare insight into events on the ground during the conflict - in which hundreds have reportedly died and tens of thousands have fled their homes.
The ICRC said the Ethiopian Red Cross ambulances had taken ""injured and deceased people"" to the Ayder Referral Hospital.
On a visit to the hospital, ICRC staff found ""80% of patients to be suffering from trauma injuries"" adding that other services had to be suspended ""so that limited staff and resources could be devoted to emergency medical care"".
""The hospital is running dangerously low on sutures, antibiotics, anticoagulants, painkillers, and even gloves,"" ICRC head in Ethiopia Maria Soledad said.
The hospital is also running low on body bags for the deceased, the Geneva-based organisation said.
The ICRC, however, did not give any figures for the numbers injured or dead. Neither did it say whether the victims were civilians or military personnel.
In a statement on Twitter on Saturday, Mr Abiy said the army was in full control of Mekelle and that this ""marks the completion of the [military's] last phase"".
""I am pleased to share that we have completed and ceased the military operations in the Tigray region,"" he said.
He added that the army had released thousands of soldiers taken by the TPLF and was in control of the airport and regional offices, saying that the operation had been carried out with ""due care for citizens"".
The prime minister has consistently described the TPLF leadership as a ""criminal clique"" and said that the police will ""bring them to the court of law"".
In a text message to Reuters, TPLF leader Debretsion Gebremichael did not directly comment on the situation on the ground, but said of the government forces: ""Their brutality can only add [to] our resolve to fight these invaders to the last.""
He added: ""This is about defending our right to self-determination.""
Mr Debretsion's whereabouts are unknown.
A TPLF statement read out on regional Tigray TV said: ""Fascistic bombings have caused civilian deaths and injuries. The Tigray government has vowed that it would take retaliatory actions against the barbaric bombings"".
Analysts say the TPLF could now be preparing to return to the mountains to launch a guerrilla war against the federal government.
The UN had warned of possible war crimes if the Ethiopian army attacked Mekelle.
It has also expressed concerns about the lack of access for humanitarian workers.
The Ethiopian authorities said on Thursday that ""a humanitarian access route"" overseen by the government would be opened, adding they were ""committed to work with UN agencies... to protect civilians and those who need it"".
Also on Thursday, Ethiopian troops were deployed along Tigray's border with Sudan, preventing people fleeing the violence from leaving the country, according to refugees.
In an update released on Saturday, the UN said that more than 40,000 Ethiopians had crossed over since the fighting began in early November.
Ethiopia's state-appointed Human Rights Commission has accused a Tigrayan youth group of being behind a massacre this month in which it says more than 600 non-Tigrayan civilians in the town of Mai-Kadra were killed. The TPLF denied involvement.
In a meeting on Friday, Mr Abiy told African peace envoys that civilians would be protected.
The TPLF fighters, drawn mostly from a paramilitary unit and a well-drilled local militia, are thought to number about 250,000.
The organisation was founded in the 1970s and spearheaded the uprising against Marxist dictator Mengistu Haile Mariam, who was toppled in 1991.
It then went on to be the dominant political force in the country until Mr Abiy became prime minister in 2018.
Mr Debretsion has said the Tigray forces were ""ready to die in defence of our right to administer our region"".
The conflict is rooted in longstanding tension between Ethiopia's government and the TPLF, sparked by Mr Abiy's moves to sideline the party.
When Mr Abiy postponed a national election because of coronavirus in June, relations further deteriorated.
The TPLF said the government's mandate to rule had expired, arguing that Mr Abiy had not been tested in a national election.
In September the party held its own election, which the government said was ""illegal"".
In early November, TPLF fighters entered a military base in Mekelle which led to the start of the federal army's operation in Tigray."

You’d think that even running a fish and chip shop would teach you a little diplomacy. You know, simple stuff like don’t be rude to customers and especially the regular ones that spend the most. _Newshub_[reports](https://www.newshub.co.nz/home/politics/2020/01/jacinda-ardern-dismisses-phone-call-from-australian-pm-scott-morrison-during-coronavirus-update.html).



Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern has been caught awkwardly ignoring a call from Australian leader Scott Morrison during a press conference – a move The Project co-host Jeremy Corbett has likened to “treating ScoMo like he’s treated climate change”.



[…]While answering a question regarding a trans-Tasman collaboration to evacuate Australasians from Wuhan, the epicentre of the virus outbreak in China, Ardern looked down at her buzzing phone on the lectern.



[…]She brushed off the interruption, adding that New Zealand and Australia are “in close contact” over “the work we are doing on the ground” and “the situation of our citizens and residents”.



So let’s see. A press conference is more important than answering a call from our closest, and one of our most important, allies. Not that it would have surprised the Aussies of [course](https://thebfd.co.nz/2020/01/australian-govt-has-had-enough-of-arderns-sanctimonious-hypocrisy/).



[…]The Project co-host Jeremy Corbett couldn’t help but take a dig at the situation on Tuesday’s episode.



“Our closest ally, she screens the call – treating ScoMo like he’s treated climate change,” he quipped.



Jeremy Corbett can take his fake “bloke” humour and go f*ck himself as far as I’m concerned. Here he’s shown himself to be nothing but a leftist twat. The only ones who think the Aussie PM has been ignoring climate change are the climate alarmist left.



And if you’re looking for proof that NZ comedy has gone one hundred percent political and has been taken over by the Left there it is right there.

"[Original source: www.sepp.org/policy%20declarations/LDrevised.html]
As independent scientists researching atmospheric and climate problems, we — along with many of our fellow citizens -– are apprehensive about the Climate Treaty conference scheduled for Kyoto, Japan, in December 1997. This gathering of politicians from some 160 signatory nations aims to impose — on citizens of the industrialized nations, but not on others — a system of global environmental regulations that include quotas and punitive taxes on energy fuels.

Fossil fuels provide today’s principal energy source, and energy is essential for all economic growth. Stabilizing atmospheric carbon dioxide — the announced goal of the Climate Treaty — would require that fuel use be cut by as much as 60 to 80 percent — worldwide!In a world in which poverty is the greatest social pollutant, any restriction on energy use that inhibits economic growth should be viewed with caution. We understand the motivation to eliminate what are perceived to be the driving forces behind a potential climate change; but we believe the emerging Kyoto protocol — to curtail carbon dioxide emissions from only part of the world community — is dangerously simplistic, quite ineffective, and economically destructive to jobs and standards-of-living.
More to the point, we consider the scientific basis of the 1992 Global Climate Treaty to be flawed and its goal to be unrealistic. The policies to implement the Treaty are, as of now, based solely on unproven scientific theories, imperfect computer models — and the unsupported assumptions that catastrophic global warming follows from the burning of fossil fuels and requires immediate action. We do not agree. We believe that the dire predictions of a future warming have not been validated by the existing climate record. These predictions are based on nothing more than theoretical models and cannot be relied on.
As the debate unfolds, it has become increasingly clear that –- contrary to the conventional wisdom — there does not exist today a general scientific consensus about the importance of greenhouse warming from rising levels of carbon dioxide. In fact, many climate specialists now agree that actual observations from weather satellites show no global warming whatsoever–in direct contradiction to computer model results.
Historically, climate has always been a factor in human affairs -– with warmer periods, such as the medieval “climate optimum,” playing an important role in economic expansion and in the welfare of nations that depend primarily on agriculture. Colder periods have caused crop failures, and led to famines, disease, and other documented human misery. We must, therefore, remain sensitive to any and all human activities that could affect future climate.
However, based on all the evidence available to us, we cannot subscribe to the politically inspired world view that envisages climate catastrophes and calls for hasty actions. For this reason, we consider the drastic emission control policies likely to be endorsed by the Kyoto conference — lacking credible support from the underlying science — to be ill-advised and premature.

"Agriculture has changed significantly in the past century. Bigger machines, bigger farms and bigger budgets allow fewer farmers to produce more food. Changes in science and policy have also resulted in an industry in which power over what we grow and eat is increasingly held by very few. Consider one of agriculture’s most basic inputs: the seed. Although there have long been farmers and merchants who specialised in growing and selling seeds, it wasn’t until the 20th century that people started talking about seed production as an industrial process. Thanks to changes in farming, science and government regulations, most of the “elite” seed that is bought and sold around the world today is mass produced and mass marketed — by just four transnational corporations. This transition has made many people uneasy. As a result, a new movement is growing, one that aims to wrest power back through the renewal of an age-old agricultural task: setting aside some seeds from each season’s harvest to plant in the next. Community gardeners, home growers and small-scale farmers increasingly insist that seeds should be something they produce themselves, or get from a friend or neighbour, rather than something they buy off the shelf.  For some, seed saving is a way of keeping history alive, for example by growing the vegetables their grandparents enjoyed. For others, it’s a way to save money, or to connect with their community. And today, it is increasingly a political statement – a choice that allows consumers to avoid fruits, vegetables and other foods produced at an industrial scale. Depending on the grower, it may even be all of these — and more. Many seed savers are motivated by the idea that their actions contribute to keeping diverse crop varieties from disappearing, especially those ignored by industrial farms or commercial seed companies in their pursuit of profit. Organisations such as the Heritage Seed Library (UK) and the Seed Savers Exchange (US), and the growers they represent, routinely connect the individual acts of growing, storing and sharing seed with a global conservation mission. In cultivating awareness of this connection, they have transformed a timeless task into a powerful political act. So how exactly did this transformation occur? New historical research shows that concerned citizens and organisations worked hard to make it happen. The Heritage Seed Library, today a part of the British non-profit Garden Organic, offers a case in point. This collection of 800 or so local and rare vegetable varieties has its roots in a campaign to save endangered vegetables that Garden Organic launched in the 1970s, back when it was known as the Henry Doubleday Research Association, or HDRA. At the time, the HDRA was well established as source of expert advice on organic gardening in Britain. Its director Lawrence Hills had founded the organisation in 1954 to encourage gardeners to experiment with natural pest deterrents, green manures and other alternatives to the synthetic chemicals that were becoming common in agriculture.  Among the many subjects on which the HDRA offered advice from its earliest days was helping “own growers” — backyard gardeners, allotment holders, and others growing food to eat themselves — to decide what varieties to plant. Hills was adamant that newer types of tomatoes, carrots and green beans lacked the flavours of earlier generations and performed worse in small-scale cultivation. He was therefore dismayed to learn in the early 1970s that changes in British agricultural regulations would make it difficult for seed companies to sell “old-fashioned varieties”. He feared, rightly, that the small market for such seeds would not justify the price that a company would now have to pay to register these for legal sale. If seed companies weren’t stocking them – and growers accustomed to buying their seed weren’t saving them – these old-fashioned varieties would simply disappear. In a 1975 letter to the Times, Hills announced an initiative of the HDRA intended to address this impending extinction crisis: establishing a collection of Europe’s “vanishing vegetables” at the HDRA.  Hills asked fellow gardeners to help him locate as many uncommon varieties as possible. Ambitious as it was, that collection was only the start. The HDRA soon began a campaign to start a “seed bank”. Hills envisioned that this long-term storage facility would gather and preserve vegetable varieties from around the world. In this sense, it would be just like a few already existing international seed banks, which ensured that diverse seeds would be available for plant breeders in the future. Unlike those seed banks (also called “genebanks”), the vegetable collection that Hills imagined would have a public-facing component, a “seed library” that any grower, regardless of professional expertise, would be able to access. Both seed bank and seed library eventually came to fruition, though not in a single institution. When it became apparent during planning that a government-supported Vegetable Gene Bank would mainly serve professional researchers, Hills and HDRA staff organised The Heritage Vegetable Seed Library for Research and Experiment — later shortened to the Heritage Seed Library — to serve the needs of ordinary gardeners. Launched in February 1978, the library gave away seed of its rare varieties to subscribing members.  The Heritage Seed Library was the more innovative of the two projects, and arguably the more transformative of British vegetable conservation in the long term. This was because it emphasised the need for the active participation of individual gardeners to to achieve conservation goals. The library only functioned with the help of “seed guardians” who helped keep it stocked with seed. HDRA also encouraged library users to learn how to save their own seed. Together with other HDRA initiatives, the seed library helped cement the idea that conservation of vegetable diversity would only succeed through the commitment of ordinary gardeners to purchasing, growing, saving and circulating seeds of useful or delicious varieties. Today, many home and allotment garderners who save seeds see themselves as protectors of endangered plants – and their gardens as repositories of important biodiversity. They believe that their stewardship of vegetable diversity contributes to the possibilities for a better, fairer global food system in the future. The history of the HDRA reminds us that there was — and still is — work involved in connecting these individual acts of seed saving to the future of the world’s food."

I often get emails asking me to comment in detail on an article on global warming that pretends the “problem” is worse than it is. Here is my reply to one such request.
Earth is a wilder [no], warmer [no] place since last climate deal made in 1997
By SETH BORENSTEIN, November 29, 2015 [At least he got the date right]
PARIS (AP) — This time, it’s a hotter [Satellites show no global warming for the 223 months (i.e., 18 years 7 months) since April 1997], waterier [Water vapour is difficult to measure, but some records show no change in water vapour except in the vital mid-troposphere, where it has actually declined], wilder Earth [The IPCC, both in its 2012 Special Report on Extreme Weather and in its 2013 Fourth Assessment Report, says there has been no particular overall trend in storminess, floods or droughts] that world leaders are trying to save [They are not trying to save the world: Bjorn Lomborg has reliably calculated that the effect of honouring all nations’ Paris pledges will be to reduce global temperature by 0.05-0.17 C° by 2100 compared with having no pledges, and the cost of getting that reduction will be $1 trillion]. 
The last time that the nations of the world struck a binding agreement to fight global warming was 1997, in Kyoto, Japan [It wasn’t binding: any nation had the right to give a year’s notice and just walk away, and one or two have done so]. As leaders gather for a conference in Paris on Monday to try to do more, it’s clear things have changed dramatically over the past 18 years [But according to the mean of the RSS and UAHv6 satellite records there’s been no global warming in all that time, so none of the changes that have occurred could have been caused by warming].

Some differences can be measured: degrees on a thermometer [a zero trend since April 1997], trillions of tons of melting ice [global sea-ice shows little change in extent or trend since satellite monitoring began 37 years ago], a rise in sea level of a couple of inches [the ENVISAT satellite showed that sea level is rising at a rate equivalent to 1.3 inches per century]. Epic weather disasters, including punishing droughts [declining for the past 30 years globally], killer heat waves [but killer cold snaps kill far more] and monster storms [nothing unprecedented], have plagued Earth [But no more than usual].

As a result, climate change is seen as a more urgent and concrete problem than it was last time [on no evidence: the rate of global warming since 1990, on all datasets, is well below the least rate predicted with “substantial confidence” by the IPCC in that year, and is only half to one-third of its central prediction].

“At the time of Kyoto, if someone talked about climate change, they were talking about something that was abstract in the future,” said Marcia McNutt, the former U.S. Geological Survey director who was picked to run the National Academies of Sciences. “Now, we’re talking about changing climate, something that’s happening now. You can point to event after event that is happening in the here and now that is a direct result of changing climate.” [The climate has been changing for 4 billion years: time to get used to it. Since there has been no global warming for 18 years 7 months, the extreme-weather events that are now occurring must be of natural and not manmade origin].
Other, nonphysical changes since 1997 make many experts more optimistic than in previous climate negotiations [for instance, Professor Richard Tol has said no net harm will occur unless there is at least 3.5 C° warming, but modellers’ reductions in their estimates of how the climate responds to direct warming caused by CO2 imply that not more than 0.5 C° of global warming will occur by 2100, even if we do very little to mitigate warming].
For one, improved technology is pointing to the possibility of a world weaned from fossil fuels, which emit heat-trapping gases [But the gases don’t trap anything like as much heat as was originally thought]. Businesses and countries are more serious about doing something, in the face of evidence that some of science’s worst-case scenarios are coming to pass [There is no evidence that worst-case scenarios are coming to pass, for the good and sufficient reason that for almost two decades, despite a considerable increase in Man’s emission of greenhouse gases, there has been no global warming at all to trigger those “worst-case scenarios”].

“I am quite stunned by how much the Earth has changed since 1997,” [except that global temperature has not changed since 1997, so any other changes were not caused by rising temperature] Princeton University’s Bill Anderegg said in an email. “In many cases (e.g. Arctic sea ice loss [which has been more or less matched by gains in Antarctic sea ice], forest die-off due to drought) [The most comprehensive recent drought survey, conducted just last year, found that the fraction of the Earth’s land surface suffering drought has declined throughout the period of record], the speed of climate change is proceeding even faster than we thought it would two decades ago.”[In 1995 the IPCC had issued predictions of warming that were in some respects even more extreme than those it had made in 1990: but there has been no statistically-significant global warming since 1990, and none at all since 1997]
Some of the cold numbers on global warming since 1997 [There has been no global warming since 1997]:
—The West Antarctic and Greenland ice sheets have lost 5.5 trillion tons of ice, or 5 trillion metric tons, according to Andrew Shepherd at the University of Leeds, who used NASA and European satellite data [Even if this were true, and there is plenty of evidence that it is not, it was not caused by global warming because there has not been any, and the analysis omits the 80% of global land-based ice that is on the East Antarctic ice sheet, and the ice there has been growing].

—The five-year average surface global temperature for January to October has risen by nearly two-thirds of a degree Fahrenheit, or 0.36 degrees Celsius, between 1993-97 and 2011-15, according to the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration [The correct statistical approach is to maximize degrees of freedom by using as many data points as possible, and the monthly NOAA global temperature data from 1995 to the present show a warming of less than 0.3 C°, equivalent to just 1.6 C°/century; however, until two years ago the NOAA data showed no warming since the late 1990s, just as the satellite data did, but NOAA tampered with the record in preparation for Paris and suddenly a warming trend has appeared: Congress is investigating, as is the former vice-chancellor of Buckingham University in the UK].

In 1997, Earth set a record for the hottest year, but it didn’t last. Records were set in 1998, 2005, 2010 and 2014, and it is sure to happen again in 2015 when the results are in from the year, according to NOAA [Its results have been tampered with in a manner that, when set against the satellite record, seems suspicious: hence the Congressional investigation. The satellites do not show 2014 as the warmest year, and will not show 2015 as the warmest year either. Besides, the weather was warmer in the mediaeval, Roman, Minoan, Old-Kingdom, and Holocene warm periods, so there is nothing special about today’s temperatures].

—The average glacier has lost about 39 feet, or 12 meters, of ice thickness since 1997, according to Samuel Nussbaumer at the World Glacier Monitoring Service in Switzerland [but that organization has taken measurements of mass balance at only 230, or one-seventh of one per cent, of the world’s 160,000+ glaciers. It has done very little work in Antarctica, which contains about 90% of the world’s ice mass, and which, except for a small area of West Antarctica, has not warmed or lost ice mass throughout the satellite era].
—With 1.2 billion more people in the world, carbon dioxide emissions from the burning of fossil fuels climbed nearly 50 percent between 1997 and 2013, according to the U.S. Department of Energy. The world is spewing more than 100 million tons of carbon dioxide a day now [and yet, 265 years after the Industrial Revolution began, to the nearest tenth of one per cent there is no CO2 in the atmosphere at all, for the atmosphere is big and our emissions are small by comparison].
—The seas have risen nearly 2 1/2 inches, or 6.2 centimeters, on average since 1997, according to calculations by the University of Colorado [However, the GRACE gravitational-anomaly satellites showed no sea-level rise at all from 2003-2008, and the ENVISAT satellite showed sea level rising at a rate equivalent to 1.3 inches/century from 2004 to 2012, and the sea-level rise found by the University of Colorado is smaller than the intercalibration errors between the series of laser-altimetry satellites it relies upon; the sea level rise comes chiefly from an artificial and unjustifiable “glacial isostatic adjustment”; and Professor Mörner’s best estimate is that sea level is rising no faster this century than last – i.e., at about 20 cm/century].

—At its low point during the summer, the Arctic sea ice is on average 820,000 square miles smaller than it was 18 years ago, according to the National Snow and Ice Data Center. That’s a loss equal in area to Texas, California, Montana, New Mexico and Arizona combined [But, compared with the large annual summer-to-winter fluctuations, the loss is quite small, and it is largely compensated by an increase in Antarctic sea-ice extent].


—The five deadliest heat waves of the past century — in Europe in 2003, Russia in 2010, India and Pakistan this year, Western Europe in 2006 and southern Asia in 1998 — have come in the past 18 years, according to the International Disaster Database run by the Centre for Research on the Epidemiology of Disaster in Belgium [The centre, inferentially for political reasons connected with its funding, has not made any studies of loss of life caused by extreme cold, which, however, kills roughly 20 times as many people as extreme heat. Warmer weather would actually bring about fewer deaths than colder weather. In a single cold winter in just one country, the UK, four years ago, there were 31,000 excess deaths; the European heatwave may have killed 35,000-70,000 across Europe as a whole. The centre’s website returns only one search result for the word “cold” on its database, and that is a reference to the “Cold War”].
—The number of weather and climate disasters worldwide has increased 42 percent, though deaths are down 58 percent [This increase, to the extent that it exists, for no reference is provided, is likely to be attributable to better reporting: the IPCC is quite clear that there is no evidence for increased extreme weather in almost all categories]. From 1993 to 1997, the world averaged 221 weather disasters that killed 3,248 people a year. From 2010 to 2014, the yearly average of weather disasters was up to 313, while deaths dropped to 1,364, according to the disaster database [In fact, the annual number of deaths from extreme weather worldwide is at its lowest point in the satellite era, according to the Global Warming Policy Foundation: and that is what we should expect, given better forecasting of individual extreme events and a small increase in warmer weather, which reduces temperature-related deaths].

Eighteen years ago, the discussion was far more about average temperatures, not the freakish extremes. Now, scientists and others realize it is in the more frequent extremes that people are truly experiencing climate change [The reason why mean temperatures were the topic 18 years ago is that they had increased for 20 since 1976, largely influenced by the phase-change in that year from the cooling to the warming phase of the Pacific Decadal Oscillation Index, and the reason why Mr Borenstein does not want to focus on mean temperatures now is that they have not increased, and, since they have not increased, there is no reason to blame Man for any consequential increase in extreme temperatures].
Witness the “large downpours, floods, mudslides, the deeper and longer droughts, rising sea levels from the melting ice, forest fires,” former Vice President Al Gore, who helped negotiate the 1997 agreement, told The Associated Press. “There’s a long list of events that people can see and feel viscerally right now. Every night on the television news is like a nature hike through the Book of Revelation.” [But Al Gore is no scientist and, when his claims of disaster were subjected to court scrutiny in the London High Court in 2007 Mr Justice Burton said, “The Armageddon scenario that he depicts is not based on any scientific view.”]

Studies have shown that man-made climate change contributed in a number of recent weather disasters. Among those that climate scientists highlight as most significant: the 2003 European heat wave that killed 70,000 people in the deadliest such disaster in a century [even if one accepts the tampering by which the original estimate of 35,000 deaths (probably an exaggeration in itself) was doubled, just three typical British winters will cause more excess deaths than that one-off Europe-wide heatwave, which is known to have been caused not by global warming but by a blocking high]; Hurricane Sandy, worsened by sea level rise, which caused more than $67 billion in damage and claimed 159 lives [Sandy was also not caused by global warming but by a rare coincidence of three storms from different directions over a major population centre, and sea level at the New York Battery tide-gauge shows just 11 inches’ increase in 100 years, most of that before Man could have had any influence]; the 2010 Russian heat wave that left more than 55,000 dead [such events are neither new nor more commonplace now than formerly: the great multi-decadal drought in the Great Plans of the US before 1950 was far worse]; the drought still gripping California [the IPCC has repeatedly said one should not assign blame for individual weather events to global warming, and Hao et al. 2014 showed that the fraction of the globe under drought has been declining for 30 years]; and Typhoon Haiyan, which killed more than 6,000 in the Philippines in 2013 [but recorded history shows many far worse storms: in 1881, for instance, more than 20,000 corpses were recovered from the shoreline near Manila after a typhoon, and in those days the population was far smaller than today].
Still, “while the Earth is a lot more dangerous on one side [except that, on the evidence it isn’t: and, to this day, the believers have been unable or unwilling to state what the ideal global mean surface temperature is, and what variance either side of that temperature is net-beneficial], the technologies are a lot better than they were,” said Jeffrey Sachs, director of Columbia University’s Earth Institute. Solar and wind have come down tremendously in price [but they are still up to 20 times costlier per MWh generated than coal], so much so that a Texas utility gives away wind-generated electricity at night [That is because every wind turbine has to be backed up by a fossil-fuelled power station running at inefficient, highly-CO2-emitting idle-speed, so that, according to Professor Hughes of Edinburgh University, under most operating conditions wind power actually emits more CO2 than a coal-fired power station: accordingly, a grid surplus arises every time the wind blows, particularly when electricity demand is low at night-time].

Another big change is China. In Kyoto, China and developing countries weren’t required to cut emissions. Global warming was seen as a problem for the U.S. and other rich nations to solve. But now China — by far the world’s No. 1 carbon polluter — has reached agreement with the U.S. to slow emissions and has become a leader in solar power. [In fact, China has made no definite commitment of any kind; has absolutely refused to allow any international monitoring or control of its emissions; already emits one-third of all CO2 worldwide; has recently been found to have understated its emissions by as much as one-sixth; has built hundreds of surplus coal-fired power stations so that in a few years it can get the kudos for announcing a halt to its building programme; and is a “leader” in solar power only to the extent that, at huge environmental cost and using rigged low wages, it manufactures cheap and often unreliable solar panels for export].
“The negotiations are no longer defined by rich and poor,” Gore said. “There’s a range of countries in the middle, emerging economies, and thankfully some of them have stepped up to shoulder some of the responsibility.” [That’s as may be, but the “countries in the middle” will make little difference to global emissions either way, and in any event there will be no cuts in global CO2 emissions before mid-century at the earliest because China and India, the world’s two largest populations, will continue to burn cheap coal in ever-larger quantities, and have already begun to gain a massive commercial advantage by supplying coal-fired electricity at prices not more than one-third of the mean Western electricity price].
U.N. climate chief Christiana Figueres said there’s far less foot-dragging in negotiations: “There is not a single country that tells me they don’t want a good Paris agreement.” [And I want motherhood and apple pie too, but whatever happens in Paris will, on Bjorn Lomborg’s calculations, and on those of Professor Tol, make a barely measurable difference at a huge cost, and will not be necessary even if the predicted warming actually occurs, which on the record of the past couple of decades it will not].
Figueres said that while the Kyoto agreement dictated to individual nations how much they must cut, what comes out of Paris will be based on what the more than 150 countries say they can do. That tends to work better, she said. [Yeah, right: translate this as “The questioners have won, the consensus is absent, the science isn’t there, even if it was it would be cheaper to let warming happen and adapt the day after tomorrow than to try to prevent it today, and we can’t get a binding agreement anyway”].
It has to, Figueres said. “The urgency is much clearer now than it used to be.” [No, it isn’t. How can it be, given that on all terrestrial and satellite temperature records there has been at most half the warming that the IPCC originally predicted in 1990? The IPCC itself has been compelled almost to halve its predictions of medium-term warming, so there is far less “urgency” than there was. Indeed, there is now no urgency at all. The climate scare has died, but it will not be given a decent burial until the corpse smells so foul that the profiteers of doom can no longer make any money out of it at taxpayers’ expense].

 **Wendy**



Simon Bridges ruling out **NZ First** as a prospective coalition partner has come with mixed public reaction, but approval from many National supporters. Even some non-supporters have voiced their approval of Bridges’ nailing his colours to the mast and ‘get(ting) some guts’ to quote former PM Sir John Key. Heavens, even a [BFD poll](https://thebfd.co.nz/2020/02/the-bfd-pop-up-poll-simon-bridges-announcement/) gives his decision around 70% support, on a site where criticism of Bridges abounds.



 _Newshub_ reports that hours earlier **Laurence Yule** when asked his opinion of Peters had said [“Winston is one of the most successful politicians in New Zealand”](https://www.tvnz.co.nz/one-news/new-zealand/national-mp-praises-winston-peters-very-successful-just-hours-before-simon-bridges-calls-him-untrustworthy). _Newshub_ editorialise that Yule has “a different view”. I disagree. Yule has an opinion, which National allows their politicians to express.



It is a fact what Yule said. Longevity is a good indicator of success in politics and putting aside how he achieved it, Peters has stuck around for some 40 years and kept his party together. That in itself is a success. Bridges would quite likely agree with Yule on that point.



Yule does not have a different opinion from Bridges. His comment on Peters is quite apart from their decision to ditch NZ First and he likely agrees with Bridges’ decision.



This is something the left, which includes most of the media, cannot comprehend. When you dislike someone, it has to be on a nuclear scale, no room for big picture, nuance, logic, reason or digging down for finer details and complete with personal attacks.



On the surface, successful though Peters may have been to last this long, when we dig down- into the finer details we find it is the way he has done it and the choices he has made that has determined Bridges’ decision. The name ‘charlatan’ has been attached to Peters over the years and for good reason. 



A recent example would be him declaring he was going into ‘good faith’ negotiations with both major parties after the last election whilst surreptitiously [taking a lawsuit](https://www.rnz.co.nz/news/political/403234/bennett-tolley-avoid-financial-damages-in-peters-privacy-case) against two of their MPs. His coming up short with no convictions, having successfully smeared the two women, received very little coverage from the media: more wreckage the politician leaves in his wake from his decades in politics. 



**Editor’s note:**



_The judge is yet to deliver his verdict. Anne Tolley admitted under cross-examination to having discussed Winston’s private super details with a) her staff, b) the ministry, c) her husband, d) her sister. The lawsuit follows the actions of National in leaking as you can’t have a lawsuit without there first being a cause. That cause was National leaking his information. Barry Soper gave evidence that it was National who did it (a National staffer)._



Bridges uses this in his announcement as a reason why they cannot trust Peters, and he has struck a chord with many people who remember this drawn-out 2-year lawsuit. 



**Richard Harman** in a recent [_Politik_ piece](https://www.politik.co.nz/2020/01/24/what-ardern-is-really-all-about/) and left-leaning politicians like Ardern talk about the ‘tribal’ right in a negative way as they oppose nationalism. They ideally would like to leave immigration decisions to bodies like the UN.



May I suggest it is the left who are more fiercely ‘tribal’ and often motivated by fear of disagreeing with the mob. When do you ever see a Labour MP come out in criticism of Ardern or their policies? Rarely. 



We all knew that **Judith Collins** opposed the Carbon Zero Bill for a long time, and that other MPs have been against the party’s status quo on some issues. They have, no doubt, long discussions on issues to reach consensus. MPs are not afraid to disagree as freedom of thought and speech is not just part of their ideology but practised as part of their party’s culture 



Four Republicans opposed voting to stop witnesses in the US impeachment trial. In the end, two absconded. The Democrats all voted in favour, despite talk some were opposed. I believe this will be repeated in the final vote despite talk of some Dems absconding. 



Republican politicians in the early days criticised Trump. (Some, like **Mitt Romney** , still do). Senior Senator **Lindsay Graham** was one. He now is fiercely loyal. They are not vilified for their opinion, apart from Trump’s tweets, which they ignore. It’s called freedom of speech. Their actions show their support for him, all likely voting for his acquittal.



The left fall into line as their rules are more regimented, they are forced by fear and ideology to comply. Like manmade climate change where the left’s ideology is in unison, the science is settled.



The _Newshub_ writer who said that Yule has a “different view” fails to recognise the nuances in this issue. Or they could have been out to create a headline deliberately ignoring the obvious, or are just not very bright. Take your pick.



It’s OK to have personal opinions, particularly if you are on the right of the political divide. However, actions speak louder than words. National have expressed their real feelings and intentions through their actions against a man who has become their enemy, not a potential coalition partner. Bridges has called Peters’s bluff. The stage is set for a dramatic campaign.

"Enjoy the guacamole as you watch the Super Bowl on Feb. 5. Some of the ingredients might be a little more expensive next year. House Republicans and President Trump have been talking about imposing a 20 percent tax on imported goods, with a White House spokesman suggesting on Thursday that such a tax might start with goods from Mexico. With the tax, the price for some heavily imported items could go up. But other foods produced mainly in the United States might become slightly cheaper. While many details remain unclear, here are a few indications of how the tax might work and how it would affect prices in the fruit and vegetable aisle at the supermarket. A third of all avocados eaten by Americans are grown in the United States and the rest are imported. More than nine of every 10 imported avocados come from Mexico, while most of the rest come from Chile, Peru and the Dominican Republic. The average retail price of an avocado varies considerably. Prices can creep up toward $1. 50 for the Super Bowl and Fourth of July, the two biggest spikes in demand. The retail price falls toward $1 apiece around Christmas, as demand falters but the trees, grown in mild, subtropical climates, keep producing. Organically grown avocados have been commanding a premium of about 30 percent lately, a premium that has widened over the last few years. The tax would not end up being 20 percent of a $1 to $1. 50 avocado, which would be 20 to 30 cents. That is because the import tax would only be on what is known a the dutiable value  —   the wholesale price of the avocado assessed when it crosses the border. That does not include the cost of trucking it from the border to a grocery store in the United States, the store’s rent, the store’s bills for   and other utilities, or the wages for the store’s staff. None of these costs would be subject to the tax, but can help determine the retail price of the avocado. For the first 11 months of last year, the average wholesale price of avocados crossing the border was 50 cents apiece. So a 20 percent tax on that wholesale price at the border would only add a dime to the cost of each avocado. It takes four or five years for a newly planted avocado tree to bear fruit. If an import tax were to be imposed on foreign avocados, American farmers could not increase production quickly. That means many Americans might have to pay for taxed avocados imported from Mexico and elsewhere for a few years, or potentially do without. That is right  —   a good guacamole needs onions, lime juice and a few other ingredients as well. Just look at onions. Seven out of eight onions eaten by Americans are grown in the United States. They also tend to be grown by companies  —   even the   onion farmers tend to incorporate their farms  —   so they owe corporate tax. That is notable because various plans being circulated call for a border tax to be used to help reduce the corporate profits tax. Right now, the corporate profits tax is 35 percent. Multinationals like Apple actually pay a lot less, in part because much of their profits are held offshore. That is harder for an onion farmer to do, although there are tax breaks for farmers. With those qualifiers, the introduction of a border tax is expected to produce enough revenue to offset the losses from lowering the tax on corporate profits to 25 percent, 20 percent or even 15 percent, depending on the proposal. That would ultimately help cut the tax bill for onion farmers. The whole idea behind the House Republicans’ plan is that companies producing in the United States should pay lower taxes, so those companies can hire more workers. The tax burden would be shifted toward importers, but also toward people who buy imported goods. Companies tend to pass on the cost of taxes to consumers, while pocketing any tax savings, when there are only a few businesses in the industry and limited competition. The opposite can also be true: companies in highly competitive industries tend to pay extra taxes out of their own profits, because raising prices might result in lower market share. In those cases, they tend to pass on tax savings to consumers. Onion farmers might also use their tax savings to hire more workers and export more. The United States imports a few more onions than it exports, but most onion farmers simply grow for the domestic market. A corporate tax cut linked to a border tax might prompt them to expand globally, which is the whole idea behind a border tax. That is tough to predict, and also depends on inflation and other factors, not just the border tax. The odds are that a border tax would drive up the cost of guacamole, because avocados, not onions, account for most of the cost of making it, and most avocados are imported. But the details of the tax, and how markets respond to it, will also make a big difference."

Guest Post by Bob Tisdale
It’s been a few weeks since the U.N.’s Paris Climate Conference (COP21) ended. Mainstream media from around the globe praised the impotent agreement, as though anyone expects political promises to be kept. The COP21 agreement reminded me of the proverb A promise is a comfort for a fool.
Fantasy headlines read:

This is the end of fossil fuels (CNN)
Historic Paris climate pact puts world on green path (TheHindu)
COP21 Delegates vote to adopt historic deal (EuroNews)
COP21: President Obama celebrates Paris deal that ‘transformed the US’ (Independent)

There are many more.
But one headline made me laugh out loud. It still makes me smile. It was penned by none other than SkepticalScience’s Dana Nuccitelli, whose article was posted at his home blog SkepticalScience and at TheGuardian two weeks ago. His headline read:
The Paris agreement signals that deniers have lost the climate wars
Mr. Nuccitelli needs to ask himself why the U.N.’s climate agreement is non-binding…why the “shalls” were replaced with “shoulds”…why the teeth of the agreement were extracted…why commitments became empty promises. (See proverb above.) Answer: Republican members of congress—who Mr. Nuccitelli would most assuredly classify as deniers—would never have ratified an agreement that actually commits the United States to reducing greenhouse gas emissions.
I have yet to find another post-COP21 headline that made me laugh as hard, though the Independent’s “COP21: President Obama celebrates Paris deal that ‘transformed the US’” came in a close second.

"The actor and performance artist Shia LaBeouf was arrested early Thursday morning on misdemeanor assault and harassment charges while protesting President Trump at a livestream art installation in Queens. In videos online, Mr. LaBeouf  —   who has a history of provocative behavior and a record of arrests for minor offenses  —   expresses outrage, evidently aimed at Mr. Trump, and uses   language to ask how the public can make it normal “to be a Nazi out here. ” In one video, a small gathering of fellow protesters chants “He will not divide us” as the bearded Mr. LaBeouf speaks. A police officer approaches, and Mr. LaBeouf appears to get into a verbal altercation with him before the officer places him in handcuffs and escorts him out of the camera’s view. Mr. LaBeouf was arrested just after 12. 30 a. m. and charged with misdemeanor assault and with harassment, according to Detective Adam Navarro of the New York City Police Department. He was issued a desk appearance ticket and instructed to come to court on April 4. He was not jailed. Detective Navarro said that the police were called after Mr. LaBeouf got into an argument with another man at the installation, pulled off the man’s scarf and, in the process, scratched his face. The man did not need to be hospitalized, the detective said. The livestream is part of Mr. LaBeouf’s latest art project, “He Will Not Divide Us,” a collaboration with the artists Nastja Sade Ronkko and Luke Turner. On Inauguration Day, the actor placed a camera outside the Museum of the Moving Image, in Astoria, Queens, and invited members of the public to repeat the words “he will not divide us” into the camera. The aim is to keep streaming images of people repeating the words,   throughout Mr. Trump’s time in office. Representatives for Mr. LaBeouf did not immediately reply to requests for comment on Thursday morning. The arrest is not Mr. LaBeouf’s first   with the law: In 2014, while at a Broadway performance of the musical “Cabaret,” he was arrested and later charged with disorderly conduct and criminal trespass. The actor first rose to prominence as a child performer on the Disney Channel television series “Even Stevens,” and in 2008 starred in Steven Spielberg’s “Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull. ” More recently, he has drawn as much attention for his unusual art projects as for his acting. In November 2015, Mr. LaBeouf arranged a   marathon of all of his movies at the Angelika Film Center in Manhattan. The next month, he set up shop in an art gallery in Liverpool, England, asking people to call him and “touch his soul. ”"
"LOS ANGELES  —   When “Zoot Suit” first opened at the Mark Taper Forum in 1978, little about the production screamed hit. Much of the cast had scant acting experience. The story itself was a Brechtian take on a relatively obscure unsolved murder in 1942 Los Angeles its climax involved a humiliating assault on a Latino man by racist United States servicemen. Just a decade earlier, its writer and director, Luis Valdez, was creating short skits for audiences of striking farmworkers in the fields of the Central Valley in California. But audiences kept coming, and coming, selling out show after packed show. Fans came one week and returned with their families the next Jerry Garcia of the Grateful Dead is said to have seen the play 22 times. After running for 11 months to   audiences, first at the Taper and then at the Aquarius Theater in Hollywood, “Zoot Suit” moved to New York’s Winter Garden in 1979, where it became the first Chicano theatrical production on Broadway. Mr. Valdez then directed a   version, which was released in 1982. “We had no idea any of this would happen, man,” he said. “It was like this huge explosion. ” On Tuesday, Jan. 31, a revival of “Zoot Suit” begins its run at the Taper, kicking off the theater’s   season. A fantastical reimagining of the   Sleepy Lagoon murder case, in which 12 Latino youths were unjustly convicted by a biased judge, “Zoot Suit” features racist prosecutors and lovelorn kids, lively swing tunes and family squabbles. The infamous Zoot Suit riots, a series of racially motivated attacks against   youths in the summer of 1943, figures in as well. Looming over it all is El Pachuco, a mythical trickster figure who can stop time and materialize wherever he pleases (think Prospero, but with a lot more panache) and “The Press,” a barking headline made flesh. The show is both a homecoming and a reunion. Four decades after its world premiere, Mr. Valdez, who is 76, is back as director. Daniel Valdez (Luis’s brother) and Rose Portillo, who in 1978 portrayed Henry Reyna and Della Barrios, the young lovers at the heart of the play, this time around play Henry’s parents. “I got kind of choked up the first time I heard those words all over again,” Daniel Valdez said. “Coming back to it is a little like coming home. ” In the intervening years, Latino playwrights, from Cherrie Moraga to Luis Alfaro, have made their mark on American theater. Karen Zacarias started the Young Playwrights’ Theater in 1995 in 2003, Nilo Cruz became the first Latino to win a Pulitzer for drama. Then there’s   Miranda. But no other Latino play has had the cultural impact of “Zoot Suit,” not to mention its influence on generations of subsequent Latino playwrights. On a recent morning, the cast rehearsed a scene set in a Los Angeles dance hall. Several men wore   trousers, long watch chains dangling from their belts the women sported   tights and sneakers. The men were strutting, the women spinning, but when a rival gang arrived, colorful curses flew, then fists, and before you knew it, the switchblades were out. El Pachuco snapped his fingers, stopping time just as Henry was about to cut his rival’s throat. “That’s exactly what the play needs right now,” he said. “Two more Mexicans killing each other. ” The relevance of this scene in the Trump era isn’t lost on the cast and crew. Much of the play focuses on how   are vilified in the United States as violent criminals and perpetual outsiders  —   “this ain’t your country,” El Pachuco tells Henry early on. “That was part of the reason I felt that I had to be in this production,” said Demián Bichir, the   actor who plays El Pachuco. “There couldn’t be a better opportunity for the arts to respond to so much nonsense and ignorance and stupidity. ” (When not acting, Mr. Bichir, who is Mexican, is an American Civil Liberties Union celebrity ambassador for immigration rights.) For Luis Valdez, mixing the political and the theatrical is nothing new. Dressed all in black, his voice a rich baritone, he recalled the years that led up to “Zoot Suit. ” In 1965, he founded El Teatro Campesino, a theater troupe and “cultural arm” of Cesar Chavez’s United Farm Workers. The group staged   skits, which he wrote and directed, in halls and on the backs of flatbed trucks. After the troupe left the farm workers’ group in 1967, Mr. Valdez continued to write plays that examined the Chicano experience, including “Bandito!” and “I Don’t Have to Show You No Stinking Badges!” “I call him the father of contemporary Chicano theater,” said Jorge Huerta, who wrote the book “Chicano Theater: Themes and Forms. ” “Not only did he found the Teatro Campesino, the teatro inspired other teatros, an entire movement from the West Coast to the Midwest all the way to the Dakotas. ” In 1977, Mr. Valdez met with Gordon Davidson, who was the director of the Taper then, about creating something for its New Theater for Now series. He arrived clutching a pamphlet about the Sleepy Lagoon murder that he had gotten years earlier from David Sanchez, the founder of the   organization the Brown Berets. “He essentially gave me carte blanche,” he said. Mr. Valdez set to work on the play, combining elements of Aztec mythology (Tezcatlipoca’s    colors, for example, mirror El Pachuco’s zoot suit) prison letters from the defendants culled from U. C. L. A. Library’s special collections department and court transcripts. In one courtroom sequence from the 1982 film, a police officer testifies that pachucos have an “inborn” tendency for violence inherited from “the bloodthirsty Aztecs. ” “I took that from the transcripts,” Mr. Valdez said. “I didn’t invent that stuff. That wasn’t agitprop. ” “The Second Zoot Suit Riot begins,” an ad in a local newspaper declared in 1978. “That was probably hatched right here in this office,” Mr. Valdez laughed. “But there was a rush for tickets, so in that sense, it was a riot. A good riot. An artistic riot. ” The play helped start the career of Edward James Olmos, who played El Pachuco in Los Angeles and on Broadway, as well as in the film. Mr. Valdez soon shifted his focus to movies as well  —   his 1987 Ritchie Valens biopic “La Bamba” was both a critical and   hit  —   but he’s still best known for “Zoot Suit,” which broke Los Angeles theater records for ticket sales during its first run. The Taper, which also hosted the world premiere productions of “Angels in America” and “Children of a Lesser God,” hopes to create a similar buzz this time around. Univision and Hoy sponsored a party at the theater to celebrate the first day of ticket sales, complete with   dancers and live swing music. The AltaMed Art Collection in Los Angeles is lending art that will be on display in the theater lobby. Strong sales have prompted the Taper to extend the show’s   run another week, through March 19 even after adding the additional shows, 35 high school groups remain on a waiting list to see special student matinees. “We do   shows a year, and you can feel the excitement among the staff about having this show rehearse in our building,” said Michael Ritchie, artistic director of the Center Theater Group, which includes the Taper. “You can feel the buzz in the hallways. ” Those hallways aren’t far from many places, historic and infamous, brought to life in the play. Los Angeles’s Hall of Justice, where the young men were tried and convicted, is two blocks away flash points of the riots erupted in the area. “Some of the riots actually took place very near where we’re rehearsing,” Daniel Valdez said. “Temple and Main, right down the street. ” A big difference between this production and the 1978 one is the level of the cast’s experience. “In those days, there weren’t many Latinos looking for a career in theater, so we were working with a lot of   actors,” Daniel Valdez added. “We had people who had never really been onstage. Now, watching the casting calls and the dance auditions, they’re absolutely amazing. ” The nationwide call drew 800 actors for 25 parts, and most cast members have backgrounds in film and TV. Mr. Bichir (“The Hateful Eight,” “Weeds”) a star in his native Mexico before coming to Los Angeles, was nominated for an Academy Award for his role in the 2011 film “A Better Life” Jeanine Mason, a   actor and dancer from Miami who plays Della, was the youngest competitor to win the Fox series “So You Think You Can Dance. ” Though the play was written in 1978 and set in 1942, Mr. Valdez feels its story is timeless, its themes part of an   historical cycle. He traces lines from the   internment camps to the Zoot Suit Riots, from Black Lives Matter to the vilification of Muslims. “And now the Mexicans are getting it again, thanks to Trump,” he said. “It’s like the closing of a complete circle. ” At a table reading between dance rehearsals, Mr. Bichir and Tom G. McMahon had questions for Mr. Valdez about how to tackle their roles as El Pachuco and the Press. In many ways, they’re more archetypes than people, jumping in and out of the action at will. The challenge, Mr. Valdez said, is finding the human in the trickster spirit. The play presents lots of similar challenges for audiences. “My play has the same relationship to a normal realistic play as a zoot suit has to a normal suit,” Mr. Valdez said. “It’s different. The lengths are longer. There’s more fabric. But it’s very cool! And I think that’s part of the appeal. ”"

Richard Harman has [done some sterling work in exposing the dirty deals done with sheep by **Murray McCully**](https://www.politik.co.nz/2020/02/10/damning-final-verdict-on-mccullys-saudi-sheep-deal/). The details are finally public and it isn’t very good reading for a supposedly least corrupt country in the world:



The CEOs of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade and New Zealand Trade and Enterprise have **delivered a final nail in the coffin of Murray McCully’s Saudi Arabian “Agri-Hub”.**



The pair have **authored a damning letter** finally responding to then -Auditor General, Lyn Provost’s , highly critical report on the project which she produced in 2016 when National — and McCully — were still in power.



The letter was sent to the Office of he Auditor General only last week.



The controversy dates back to 2010 when the-then National Government banned live sheep exports which angered a Saudi Arabian Investor, Hmood Khalaf, who had set up a Hawkes Bay farm specifically for the purpose of raising fat-tailed sheep for the Saudi Arabian live sheep market.



The sheep were required for slaughter and consumption during the annual Haj pilgrimage to Mecca,



Through a series of contacts, he eventually persuaded the then Foreign Minister, Murray McCully, to steer through Cabinet a proposal for a New Zealand sheep farm in Saudi Arabia for which he would supply breeding stock for from the Hawkes Bay. (Breeding stock were not included in the live sheep ban.)



McCully argued that the ban had led to a deterioration in relations with Saudi Arabia and jeopardised New Zealand’s chances of securing a free trade agreement with the Gulf Co-operation Council of Arabian peninsula states.



As part of the package **$4 million was paid to Khalaf but there has never any Cabinet paper or minute produced to show that the Cabinet properly authorised the money.**



Nearly five years ago, in June 2015 then-Auditor General, Lyn Provost, received letters from members of Parliament and a petition from about 10,000 New Zealanders asking for an inquiry into the Saudi Arabia Food Security Partnership.



 **The Auditor General produced a report in October 2016 which found that there were significant shortcomings in the paper put to Cabinet.**



“In my view, settlement of a grievance was provided under the guise of a contract for services,” she said.



“The Saudi Arabia Food Security Partnership was the result of a need to resolve a diplomatic issue and, in the view of Ministers, to settle a Saudi Arabian investor’s grievance.”



Then Opposition MP, now Trade Minister, **David Parker claimed in 2015** that McCully was “ **the first Minister in history to back a multi-million dollar facilitation arrangement which in other jurisdictions is called a bribe.”**



There can be no other way to view the unapproved cash trousered by Khalaf. It was dodgy then, and it dodgy today. The CEOs of Ministry of Foreign Affairs and New Zealand Trade and Enterprise have responded to the Auditor General’s report.



[…] the **fine print in their response is more devastating.**



“T **he economic benefits** anticipated under the Agrihub **did not materialise,** ” the report says.



“NZTE sought to leverage the Agrihub through showcasing New Zealand firms involved in the project’s implementation.



“NZTE participated in the Saudi Agriculture Show in 2015 and 2016 to help support the two companies involved in the Agrihub that were looking for commercial opportunities in Saudi Arabia.



“Further to this, NZTE’s platform at the 2016 exhibition included two additional companies that were not involved in the commercial implementation of the Agrihub project.



“ **After two years of participation, no distributor in Saudi Arabia sought to purchase the products available.** As a result, both companies withdrew their interest and their focus on the Saudi market.”



Sounds like an expensive sham that the taxpayers have funded for no benefit whatsoever.



Cris and Seed concluded that “The advent of the Agrihub did not translate into progress as **the FTA has now been stalled for a decade**. The Agrihub also **failed to generate the economic benefits** that had been hoped for at the time. It is MFAT and NZTE’s assessment then that at the conclusion of the process, **the $11.5 million Saudi Arabia Food Partnership Agreement did not provide value for money** – similar arrangements should not be recommended or utilised again.”



That is a damning assessment on what was essentially a fraud perpetrated on the New Zealand taxpayer. It was all supposed to result in a free trade agreement in the Middle East, it never did.



 **Murray McCully** didn’t follow cabinet processes, not for the first time. He also [didn’t follow cabinet processes in sponsoring the anti-Israel Resolution 2334 at the UN](http://www.jwire.com.au/mccully-supported-un-resolution-2334-without-cabinet-approval/). From here it looks like Murray McCully did whatever he liked and successive Prime Ministers, **John Key** and **Bill English** , let him. That is a sad reflection on them too.



The worry is the malign influence of McCully is still around because he and his cohort **Michelle Boag** are still meddling in New Zealand politics by facilitating National’s green proxy party, **Vernon Tava** ‘s [Sustainable New Zealand Party](https://sustainablenz.org.nz/). McCully and Boag are also part of the [Maori Carbon Foundation](https://www.maoricarbonfoundation.com/about-us/governance/) which is looking to cash in on another scam, climate change. 



We now know that McCully did dirty deeds with sheep in the Middle East.

"A statement by Viv Forbes, Chairman of the Carbon Sense Coalition.
[PDF version of this document is here; 32KB]
As the TV turns nightly to Beijing, we can expect chilling pictures and doomsday comments about the “Asian Pollution” and the “Beijing Smog”. This will induce media and political scaremongers to use these images to sell dud products like the “Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme”.
It is not carbon dioxide from burning coal that pollutes the skies of Asia and Africa. Carbon dioxide (CO2) is a naturally occurring, clean, invisible, beneficial gas. CO2 is an essential part of the natural world but a very minor trace constituent of our atmosphere.

The major gases in the atmosphere are Nitrogen (78%), Oxygen (21%) and Argon (less than 1%). These three gases make up 99.9% of the atmosphere (ignoring the variable water vapour which can rise to 4%). Seven other trace gases, including CO2, together make up less than 0.1% and CO2 is less than 0.04%.
This trace amount of CO2 in the atmosphere is the aerial food store for all plants, and thus also sustains all animals, including humans. CO2 is a boon to life, not a pollutant.
Moreover, the claim that man’s emissions will cause dangerous global warming is strongly and increasingly disputed by scientists and is not supported by historical evidence. It also defies common sense to believe that such a minor natural gas can cause all the climate disasters that are blamed on it.
We are about to hang an innocent hero.
Asia’s visible pollution is largely caused by the crude and inefficient open air combustion of low quality fuels. It is caused by millions of open-air cooking fires in India, China, North Korea and Africa using scavenged fuels like cow dung, cardboard, wood, and low quality coal and coke; by thousands of backyard brickworks and small dirty furnaces along the Yangtze River and in other places; by forest clearing fires in Indonesia and bush and grass fires elsewhere; and by millions of small obsolete and dirty wood, charcoal and coal stoves, heaters, boilers and furnaces all over Asia and Africa. Similar pollution is obvious in places in South America. “Open fires” was the cause of similar smogs in England as recently as the 1950’s.
Open-air combustion of poor quality carbon fuels produces not only the harmless clean so-called “greenhouse” gases of water vapour and carbon dioxide, but also real pollutants such as soot, smoke, ash, dust, unburnt fuel and chemicals containing sulphur, chlorine, nitrogen, fluorine, and metals. In confined unventilated places, open fires can also produce the very poisonous gas, carbon monoxide – this is the one that will quickly kill the canary. China also emits more sulphur dioxide than anywhere else in the world. This chokes their people, causes acid rain and damages buildings.
The elements contained in smoke pollution all came from rich ancient soils in the first place, and are needed in soils today in trace quantities to maintain the health of plants and animals. In dilute quantities, they are not a problem in the atmosphere, and rain recycles them to enrich the soil. But when concentrated in city air, they can be visible, annoying, corrosive or even toxic.
The “Asian Brown Cloud”, is a haze of pollution about 3 km thick and sometimes covering an area as big as Australia. The brown haze obscures the sun in some polluted Asian cities and at times this cloud drifts right across the Pacific Ocean and is noticed as far away as the west coast of America.
This pollution is already affecting local climate and community health. In Arctic areas, soot drifts onto snow making it darker in colour which allows it to absorb more heat from the sun. This process may be contributing to melting glaciers in China and the Himalayas.
The western world went through this pollution phase half a century ago, and although improvements can still be made, we have banished the notorious smoke pollution in places like London, Manchester and Pittsburgh.
Today’s Beijing Smog is a tame affair compared some air pollution events of the past.
For the century ended in about 1960, London smoke pollution was so bad that the city became known as “The Big Smoke”. Children developed rickets from the lack of sunshine, plants and animals died and lung disease was widespread. Mike Williamson, a Brisbane resident who lived in Yorkshire at that time, says that the smog was sometimes so dense that a driver could not see the curb, and the passenger was obliged to walk along the edge of the road with a torch to lead the way. Mike says “Buses stopped running and trains ran with difficulty because signals could not be seen. Detonators were placed on the rail tracks to warn trains of potential dangers.”
England’s last and worst ever pollution event, “The Black Fog” of 1952, was triggered by a temperature inversion over London. Visibility was reduced to less than one foot and 4,000 Londoners died from SO2 poisoning (50 in one small London park alone).
This shock brought action.
Two things cleared the Big Smoke from London and Manchester. Firstly was the passage of the Clean Air Act in 1956 – cooking and heating with open fires of wood and coal was banned in big cities. But bans would not have worked without other better heating options. No matter what the laws say, people will use whatever fuel they can find to keep warm and cook their food. Londoners only stopped burning wood and coal in their homes when electricity and smokeless fuel came available. The government encouraged people to use electricity – it was called “Coal by Wire”. Clean coal-powered electricity saved the forests from destruction and cleared the smog from the air.
The western world has largely beaten its city smogs, firstly with inventions such as the chimney and the stove, secondly with clean air legislation and anti-pollution technology and finally with the magic of electricity – the clean, silent, invisible “Coal by Wire”.
This clean energy can be generated reliably 24 hours a day, using high quality coal in non polluting power stations located far from densely populated areas. It is then transported silently and cleanly with zero pollution and minimal loss of energy to deliver lighting, heating, cooling, cooking and motive power into the most humble home in the poorest suburb. It is the magic of the modern world.
To fly over a modern non-polluting coal-fired power station at say 10,000 m is to put things into perspective – a puny cooling tower or two emitting wisps of water vapour (steam). They also emit carbon dioxide, but this is invisible and harmless (in fact generally beneficial). These wisps of steam are regularly displayed dishonestly on TV to illustrate the supposed pollution caused by coal power (or they dig up a picture of an old dirty polluting power station). There is almost no pollution, no noise, no smoke and no landscapes of forests of whirling blades and solar panels in a modern coal burning power station. In fact those wisps of steam are often the only visible evidence that massive energy conversion is taking place inside – coal into electricity.
Yet that facility and its linked coal mine can supply a whole city with heat, light and power for machines as diverse as the handyman’s drill, the kitchen toaster or the locomotives that move train-loads of commuters in safety and comfort during rain, hail, snow or heatwave.
“Coal by Wire” has already banished most of the terrible pollution that affected cities such as London, Manchester and Pittsburgh, and allowed the regrowth of American forests. City pollution now comes not from coal, but from cars sitting in traffic jams caused by poor road design, inefficient traffic controls and lack of sensible pricing for congested roads.
Today’s irrational and hysterical focus on harmless carbon dioxide by governments and media is misdirected and counter-productive. It is diverting attention and resources from damaging pollution which is altering local climate and affecting many areas of the world. And it is delaying the spread of coal powered electricity to many areas now desperate for clean invisible power.
It is also giving an enormous boost to the demand for nuclear power, for all the wrong reasons.
The world pollution problem which is most obvious now in Asia, presents a real opportunity for Australian energy companies to make profits and clean up the environment. All Australians will benefit from a stronger economy and from the satisfaction that will come from being able to point to the contribution we can make to cleaning up the REAL pollution represented by the smog over the Olympic Stadium.
Instead of trying to lead the world to commit Kyoto suicide, Australian politicians should be promoting clean non-polluting modern power stations burning high quality Australian coals. Just one well designed, well scrubbed, Australian designed coal power plant running on Australian coal could provide the light, heating, cooling and entertainment silently and invisibly to the front door for about 3 million Asian homes, housing maybe 10 million people. No wonder the Chinese are importing coal and building modern power stations as quickly as they can. They recognise clearly that their huge cities need “Coal by Wire”.
History shows that people cannot and will not live without energy in their homes. Unless we allow coal to supply clean silent invisible electric energy, the people will continue to burn dung, wood, cardboard, trees, oil, charcoal or reject coal to get their warmth or cook their food.
If Asians had access to better fuel, it would allow cow dung to be used for soil improvement and would encourage forest regrowth in areas denuded by centuries of scavenging for fire wood.
Russian scientists are not conned by the Kyoto hysteria focussed on the harmless natural gas, carbon dioxide. In fact the Russian Academy of Science advised President Putin that the Kyoto Protocol had “no scientific foundation” (Putin joined Kyoto for other very sound political and economic reasons that had nothing to do with global warming).
Man’s emissions of CO2 are a miniscule factor in determining Earth’s temperature. But while we are wasting decades of time and buckets of money trying to catch and imprison this harmless Will o’ the Wisp, an ominous brown smelly choking cloud of real pollution is growing in our northern skies.
Russian ecologist Dr Sergei Golubchikov has the last word:
“Ecological treaties should seek to curb emissions of sulphur dioxide, nitrogen oxides, heavy metals and other highly-toxic pollutants instead of targeting carbon dioxide, which is a non-toxic gas whose impact on global warming has not been proved.”

Share this...FacebookTwitterAs of mid-September, there have already been 77 peer-reviewed scientific papers authored by several hundred scientists linking solar activity to climate change.  There were 43 as of the end of June, as seen here.   In other words, there have been 34 more papers linking solar forcing to climate change made available online just since July.
This publication rate for 2016 is slightly ahead of the pace of published papers linking solar forcing to climate change for  2015 (95 Solar-Climate papers ) and 2014 (93 Solar-Climate papers).   At this rate, it is likely that a list of 300+ scientific papers linking solar forcing to climate change will have been made available between 2014 and 2016.
In addition, there have already been 41 papers published in science journals this year linking natural oceanic oscillations (i.e., ENSO, NAO, AMO, PDO) to climate changes.  There were 27 such papers as of the end of June.
The solar-ocean oscillation climate connection has gained widespread acceptance in the scientific community.  For example, see “35 New Scientific Publications Confirm Ocean Cycles, Sun Are the Main Climate Drivers”
The latest papers linking solar activity as well as ocean oscillations to climate changes are listed below.   Not only do these papers describe solar activity and ocean oscillations as the dominant mechanisms of climate change, they provide evidence that the modern, post-1950 period does not contain the highest temperatures of the last few hundred years.  In fact, these papers each document that temperatures during some periods of the 1700s and/or 1800s were just as warm or warmer than present temperatures.
That periods with much lower CO2 concentrations (of about 280 parts per million, or 0.028% of atmospheric gases) could have warmer-than-now temperatures (with present CO2 concentrations reaching 400 parts per million) defies claims that variations in CO2 primarily (or even exclusively) determine the temperature of the planet’s water and air, and that natural variations in solar activity, ocean heat distribution/cycling, clouds, volcanic activity…play little to no role in long-term climate change.
Perhaps this CO2-drives-climate paradigm needs to be updated to reflect the growing body of scientific evidence that the Sun and natural ocean cycling are primarily what drive temperature variations — not CO2.

Comparison between the records and multi-decadal atmospheric circulation patterns and climatic external forcings indicates that Mediterranean circulation destabilisation occurs during positive North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) and negative Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation (AMO) phases, reduced solar activity and strong tropical volcanic eruptions. They may have recurrently produced favourable deep-water formation conditions, both increasing salinity and reducing temperature on multi-decadal time scales.
[B]oth NAO and AMO are of importance for the Mediterranean climate variability. In particular, at multidedacal scales, positive NAO phases lead to decreased precipitation (i.e. higher salinity) while negative AMO leads to reduced SSTs. Both processes may have favoured deep-water formation events on relatively long time scales.
Thermohaline circulation destabilisations in the Mediterranean circulation also seem to be linked to reduced solar activity (ref. 40; Fig. 4D) and to frequent volcanic eruptions (ref. 41; Fig. 4E). Solar activity modulates patterns in surface temperature and pressure that resemble NAO phases, through dynamical coupling processes between the stratosphere and the troposphere that transmit the solar signal to the Earth’s surface. The increase in sulphur aerosols from tropical volcanic emissions produces stratospheric and surface conditions that resemble the positive NAO phase and cause decrease in oceanic heat content, with long-lived temperature anomalies extending to the mid-depth and deep ocean, an increase in sea ice volume and enhancement in the overturning circulation of the North Atlantic Ocean following these eruptions. These phenomena may have shaped the North Atlantic atmospheric pattern, which in turn may have led to Aegean SSTs cooling and thus surface buoyancy loss and enhanced Eastern Mediterranean deep-water formation during EMT-like events.

2. Lyu et al., 2016   (China)
The reconstructed April–July MMT series exhibited six cold and seven warm periods. The longest cold period lasted from AD 1645 to 1677 (33 years), with an average temperature of 0.5 ◦C below the mean value. The longest warm period, however, lasted from AD 1767 to 1785 (19 years), and the average temperature was 0.69 ◦C above the mean value (Table 4). Four cold (1605–1616, 1645–1677, 1911–1924, and 1951–1969) and warm (1795–1807, 1838– 1848, 1856–1873, and 1991–2008) periods were consistent with other results of tree-ring reconstructions in northeast China (Shao and Wu, 1997; Yin et al., 2009; Wang et al., 2012; Zhu et al., 2015). In addition, two cold periods (1645– 1677 and 1684–1691) were consistent with the Maunder Minimum (1645–1715), an interval of decreased solar irradiance (Bard et al., 2000). … The three temperature series exhibited significantly low temperature periods during the 1950s–1970s, which coincided with a slight decrease in solar activity from AD 1940 to 1970 (Beer et al., 2000; Fig. 7).
[P]revious studies suggest that climate change in northeast China was also linked to the solar activities and global land–sea atmospheric circulation during certain pre-instrumental periods (Chen et al., 2006; Wang et al., 2011; Liu et al., 2013). It is generally accepted that the climate warms during periods of strong solar activity (e.g., the Medieval Warm Period) and cools during periods of low solar activity (e.g., the Little Ice Age; Lean and Rind, 1999; Bond et al., 2001).

“Reconstruction of April-July minimum temperature on Laobai Mountain for the last 414 years [1600-2014].  The smoothed line indicates the 11-year moving average, and blue dots represent minimum freezing events.”
3. Sunkara and Tiwari, 2016  (India)
To study the imprints of the solar–ENSO–geomagnetic activity on the Indian subcontinent, we have applied singular spectral analysis (SSA) and wavelet analysis to the tree-ring temperature variability record from the Western Himalayas. Other data used in the present study are the solar sunspot number (SSN), geomagnetic indices (aa index), and the Southern Oscillation Index (SOI) for the common time period of 1876–2000. Both SSA and wavelet spectral analyses reveal the presence of 5–7-year short-term ENSO variations and the 11-year solar cycle, indicating the possible combined influences of solar–geomagnetic activities and ENSO on the Indian temperature. Another prominent signal corresponding to 33-year periodicity in the tree-ring record suggests the Sun-temperature variability link probably induced by changes in the basic state of the Earth’s atmosphere. In order to complement the above findings, we performed a wavelet analysis of SSA reconstructed time series, which agrees well with our earlier results and increases the signal-to-noise ratio, thereby showing the strong influence of solar–geomagnetic activity and ENSO throughout the entire period. The solar flares are considered responsible for causing the atmospheric circulation patterns. The net effect of solar–geomagnetic processes on the temperature record might suggest counteracting influences on shorter (about 5–6-year) and longer (about 11–12-year) timescales. The present analyses suggest that the influence of solar activities on the Indian temperature variability operates in part indirectly through coupling of ENSO on multilateral timescales. The analyses, hence, provide credible evidence of teleconnections of tropical Pacific climatic variability and Indian climate ranging from inter-annual to decadal timescales and also suggest the possible role of exogenic triggering in reorganizing the global Earth–ocean–atmospheric systems.

A 368-year maximum temperature reconstruction
During the period 1875–1955, late summer temperature fluctuated less strongly than before or thereafter. In general, the average length of cold periods was shorter than that of warm periods. The cold period of 1869–1877 was the longest and coldest cool period had a mean of 17.63°C. The longest warm period extended from 1655 to 1668, and the warmest period in AD 1719–1730 had a mean of 20.37°C. However, we should point out that the rapid warming during the 20th century was not especially obvious in our reconstructed RLST.
[S]even cold periods and three warm periods were identified during the past 368 years (Fig. 4d). All the cold periods were during the Maunder (1708–1711) or Dalton (1818– 1821, 1824–1828, 1832–1836, and 1839–1842) solar minima periods, except for the cold periods of 1765–1769 and 1869–1877 (Eddy, 1976; Shindell et al., 1999), which indicated that RLST [mean maximum temperature] variations in the NWSP [northwestern Sichuan Plateau, China ] might be driven by solar activity (Fig. 7b). On the other hand, volcanic eruptions in the corresponding periods might also be a cooling factor (Fig. 7b). A longer cold period (e.g., 1820s–1840s) was interrupted by transient warming, thus forming a plurality of discontinuous short cold periods. Warm periods of 1719–1730 and 1858–1859 both had more sunspots (Eddy, 1976; Shindell et al., 1999) and lower volcanic forcing (Fig. 7b). The cold (1765–1769 or 1869–1877) and warm (1655–1668) periods were highly consistent with other studies (Fig. 7).
 

          Possible Forcing Mechanism
Accompanied by significant peaks at 60.2 and 73 years, the continuously periodicities around 49–114 years in our regional temperature reconstruction might tentatively be related to PDO, Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation (AMO; En- field et al., 2001) as well as solar activity (Eddy, 1976; Shindell et al., 1999; Peristykh and Damon, 2003; Raspopov et al., 2004; Braun et al., 2005). The AMO was an important driver of multidecadal variations in summer climate not only in North America and western Europe (Kerr, 2000; Sutton and Hodson, 2005) but also in the East Asia (Feng and Hu, 2008; Liang et al., 2008; Wang et al., 2011, 2015; Zhu et al., 2011). The 60.2-year peak associated with AMO demonstrated that multidecadal variations in late summer temperature in the NWSP NWSP [northwestern Sichuan Plateau, China]  might be controlled by AMO.
[S]ignificant multidecadal- and centennial-scale cycles of our temperature reconstruction might include the signs of solar activity, such as the Gleissberg cycles (Peristykh and Damon, 2003), Suess cycles (Braun et al., 2005), Bruckner cycles (Raspopov et al., 2004), and Schwabe cycles (Braun et al., 2005). The Maunder (ca. AD 1645–1715) and Dalton (ca. AD 1790–1840) solar minima periods were generally associated with temperature depressions (Eddy, 1976), and the Damon (ca. AD 1890– 1920) solar maximum period occurred in a relatively warm period, which further confirmed that late summer temperature variation in the NWSP [northwestern Sichuan Plateau, China]  might be driven by solar activity (Fig. 7b).
Conclusion: Overall, the RLST [mean maximum temperature] variability in the NWSP [northwestern Sichuan Plateau, China ]  might be associated with global land–sea atmospheric circulation (e.g., ENSO, PDO, or AMO) as well as solar and volcanic forcing.

"Recent floods in England have been described as unprecedented or even “biblical” events, often with the misguided assumption that they were unavoidable or unpredictable. That is not the case. Over the past few decades, development practice in England has led to more than 300,000 homes being built in high flood risk areas. In this sense, the planning system has actually created (not reduced) flood risk. The flooding in northern England was indeed extensive, with about 500 homes flooded and more than 1,000 properties evacuated in Doncaster, and major transport disruption across several counties. Subsequent media coverage did highlight the many ways that flooding can be stopped, but key articles tended to focus on typically capital-intensive solutions: flood walls, river embankments, demountable flood barriers or dredging (the benefits of which are highly debatable). The overarching message was that these events are unpredictable and unprecedented, and the only way to properly deal with them is to invest millions in large physical infrastructure.  While these are helpful suggestions, they only address part of the problem. There is another root cause of flooding that appears not to get so much airtime, namely the role of a fractured planning system that still enables developers to build homes in high flood risk areas. Urban planning in England is highly regulated and has often been accused of constraining development or in some cases stymieing private sector investments. A 2006 government policy statement attempted to direct development away from areas at highest risk – in simple terms, the intention was to promote building appropriate things in appropriate locations.  However, in 2012, the then coalition government published a new National Planning Policy Framework for England, which replaced existing policy and meant there was no longer clear guidance to prevent building in flood plains. To complicate matters further, the Growth and Infrastructure Act in 2013 released large areas of greenfield land for development. The act effectively gave developers a right to submit major planning applications directly to central government and thus proposals and decisions could evade not only communities but also local planning authorities.  As a result of these legislative changes, there is now a better chance of vulnerable homes being built in flood-prone areas. So how has this policy landscape impacted the number of homes/apartments (typically referred to as “dwellings” in government data) being build in flood risk areas? The below table shows numbers of new dwellings built between 1989 and 2016 within areas of high flood risk (technically Flood Zone 3: “floodplains” with a one in 100-year return period and “coastal areas” with a one in 200-year return period). The average proportion of new dwellings built in areas of high flood risk has fluctuated annually between 7% and 11% with some regions such as London, Yorkshire and Humber, and the East Midlands regularly surpassing these averages. This adds up to more than 300,000 new homes being built since 1989 that are at risk of flooding. Despite a plethora of guidance for planners and apparent restrictions on developers, this building persists. Over this period, the continued “free-market” development of flood plains in England has had an unexpected effect. Developers have increasingly been using flood plains to build social housing for low income families, homes for the elderly/disabled as well as schools and hospitals. One 2009 study identified 2,374 schools and 89 hospitals in flood prone areas of England. Planning policy has thus caused some of the most vulnerable members of society to occupy highly flood-prone areas. Urban areas have been creating flood risk. And this is largely due to the government’s focus on making land – low cost, flood prone land – available for development.  Therefore, when considering “extreme” flood events and the highly expensive defence and protection solutions, we should not lose sight of how government policies have consistently created more risk – in England, at least. To see how different things could be, just compare England to Scotland. North of the border, flood policy is controlled separately by the devolved government, which tends to deal with the risk rather better."

Northwest passage routes. Stock Image: WikipediaTORONTO, September 29, 2015  – Despite climate change, sea ice in the (NWP) remains too thick and treacherous for it to be a regular commercial Arctic shipping route for many decades, according to new research out of York University.
Prior to this research, there was little information about the thickness of sea ice in the NWP, which meanders through the Canadian Arctic Archipelago. Yet, next to ice coverage and type, sea ice thickness plays the most important role in assessing shipping hazards and predicting ice break-up.
“While everyone only looks at ice extent or area, because it is so easy to do with satellites, we study ice thickness, which is important to assess overall changes of ice volume, and helps to understand why and where the ice is most vulnerable to summer melt,” says lead researcher York Professor Christian Haas, the Canada Research Chair for Arctic Sea Ice Geophysics.
The research paper, “Ice Thickness in the Northwest Passage“, was published in the journalGeophysical Research Letters .
Haas and his team, including Stephen Howell of Environment Canada, measured first-year and multiyear ice thickness in the Canadian Arctic Archipelago using an airplane equipped with an electromagnetic induction sounder or EM bird. They surveyed the ice in April and May of 2011 and again in 2015. It is considered the first large-scale assessment of ice thickness in the area.
The surveys found a modal thickness of 1.8 to two metres in most regions of the NWP and mean thickness of between two and three metres. Ice originating from the Arctic Ocean showed a mean thickness of more than three metres on average. Some multiyear ice regions contained much thicker, deformed ice that was more than 100 m wide and more than four metres thick.
“This is the first-ever such survey in the Northwest Passage, and we were surprised to find this much thick ice in the region in late winter, despite the fact that there is more and more open water in recent years during late summer,” says Haas. “This points to the importance of ice transport from the high Arctic and melt processes during the spring season, which critically depend on weather conditions and how they affect the melting of thick ice.”
Although the results were obtained in late winter when no ships travel the route, they will impact how ice break-up and summer ice conditions develop and are currently predicted, and help forecast the opening and navigability of the NWP during summer. It will also affect how sea ice hazards are assessed during the shipping season and provide baseline data going forward.
The NWP, comprised of a series of gulfs, straits, sounds and channels that connect the Beaufort Sea in the west with Baffin Bay in the east, is a much shorter route for moving goods between the Pacific and Atlantic regions than the Panama and Suez Canals. At the moment, this year’s annual summer minimum Arctic-wide ice coverage is the fourth lowest on record, with similar low coverage in the NWP, according to information provided by the Canadian Ice Service.
How climate change will affect the summer ice in the NWP in the future, however, is difficult to predict, says Haas. Further melting could cause more multiyear ice from the Arctic Ocean to drift into the NWP, making it less, not more passable.
###
Abstract
Recently, the feasibility of commercial shipping in the ice-prone Northwest Passage (NWP) has attracted a lot of attention. However, very little ice thickness information actually exists. We present results of the first ever airborne electromagnetic ice thickness surveys over the NWP carried out in April and May 2011 and 2015 over first-year and multiyear ice. These show modal thicknesses between 1.8 and 2.0 m in all regions. Mean thicknesses over 3 m and thick, deformed ice were observed over some multiyear ice regimes shown to originate from the Arctic Ocean. Thick ice features more than 100 m wide and thicker than 4 m occurred frequently. Results indicate that even in today’s climate, ice conditions must still be considered severe. These results have important implications for the prediction of ice breakup and summer ice conditions, and the assessment of sea ice hazards during the summer shipping season.

"Two areas farmed by Israelis for more than 50 years have recently been returned to neighbouring Jordan. The first, al Ghamr (known in Israel as Zofar), is located south of the Dead Sea in the Naqab/Negev desert. The second, al Baqura (Naharayim) is found at the fertile point where a major tributary joins the Jordan River. The association with water bodies is no coincidence: neither land would have been occupied in the first place were it not for the water that the Israeli army and kibbutzim required to sustain the farms.  The return of the lands was made possible by remarkably far-sighted clauses inserted in a 1994 peace treaty between Jordan and Israel. Unfortunately, the parts of the same agreement concerning water could not be more myopic, and ensure that one of the most arid countries in the world – Jordan – remains parched.  Meanwhile, Palestinian farmers do not have enough water. This situation is locked in by a water agreement signed with Israel in 1995, as part of the “Oslo II” process. And as the water levels drop, tensions rise. It gets worse with every scorching summer. As it controls the most water but needs it the least, Israel has the choice to negotiate fairer agreements. But what must be challenged first is the thinking that led to the agreements in the first place – an economic doctrine which sees water as nothing more than a commodity to be sold or traded, and a political ideology that is fixated on holding on to as much water as possible.  The effects of the commodification of water are crystal clear at al Baqura. There, the Yarmouk river flows westwards and used to meet the Jordan River mainstream which flows south between Jordan (the country) on one side and Israel and the Palestine West Bank on the other. But these days almost every drop of the Yarmouk not used by farmers in Syria and Jordan is hoovered into a reservoir by farmers in Israel.  The Jordan River itself has run dry ever since 1964, when Israel cornered sole use of Lake Tiberias (aka the Sea of Galilee, or Lake Kinneret) near the river’s source. The Dead Sea at the river’s endpoint has been (apologies) dying, ever since.  Innovators in Israel have in the meantime perfected drip irrigation techniques, implemented impressive schemes which re-use wastewater, and built so many desalination plants that some commentators suggest it now has too much water. Meanwhile Jordan is increasingly parched, as it hosts millions of people who have fled wars in Kuwait, Iraq, and Syria. With no surface water of its own to speak of, Jordan resorts to desalination on its tiny coastline at Aqaba. It has been encouraged to pump the expensive flows from there to the neighbouring Israeli city of Eilat, in exchange for freshwater Israel is to pump back to Jordan from (the contested) Lake Tiberias.  The Palestinian residents of the West Bank actually have less water available now than when Oslo II was signed. In Gaza, desalination is too expensive for most, and with wastewater contaminating the groundwater, “superbugs” are creating a toxic “biosphere of war”. Israel does sell a small amount of freshwater to Gaza, but most of the water it channels from Tiberias 200km to the north stops at the border – tantalisingly in view of the Gazans but out of their reach, reserved instead to grow potatoes that are exported to (a rather wetter) Europe. There is a tendency to blame climate change or refugees for these policy choices, probably because they cannot talk back. But those who created the mess are the ones who should and can change it. While the Israeli state doesn’t need so much water, the distribution of control over the Jordan River and associated aquifers remains a mirror reflection of the relative power between the rival states. Israel controls more water than Jordan and the Palestinians combined, and more than double its entitlement when measured against the principles of the 1997 UN Watercourses Convention.  Water that Israel promised Jordan back in the 1994 peace treaty has still not materialised. In the West Bank, Israel’s choice to hoard is expressed through the Oslo-created Israeli-Palestinian joint water committee. Because the committee approves the water lines that every new settlement in the West Bank needs, but blocks projects for Palestinian villages, water becomes an effective tool of colonialism or even ethnic cleansing.  It would be straightforward to invoke guidance from the UN Watercourses Convention, if all that was required to end the Jordan River conflict was updating the agreements. The convention details how water can be shared “equitably and reasonably” and all the states involved signed up – bar Israel. But first we must challenge the idea that water is a commodity that can be hoarded away or sold only to the highest bidder. But given the extent to which the practice is entrenched in the political and economic systems of the region, evidence and argument are not enough on their own. Researchers can highlight the damage caused by water policy, and environmentalists may question the rationale of exporting desert-grown crops to Europe. Eventually, the task is to replace the blinding ideologies with a strong sense of justice, so that unfair water sharing comes to be seen as unacceptable as slavery.  The required policy and legislation will flow naturally, once this future is seen. It happened at al Baqura and al Ghamr, and it can happen with water."
"“Riverdale,” the new high school noir on CW, is a dark, weird reimagining of the Archie Comics franchise. Which raises the question: What was the   version? The comics I read as a kid were an    palimpsest, in which kids with ’70s haircuts and ’50s lifestyles tooled around in Archie Andrews’s ’  jalopy. Recently, the franchise has been redesigned and reconceived. In one series, an adult Archie dies. In another, he and the gang flee an outbreak of zombies, one of whom is his old pal Jughead Jones. The steamy “Riverdale,” which begins Thursday, owes more to those newer iterations. (The showrunner, Roberto   is the chief creative officer of Archie Comics.) It chucks the comics’ old clichés for a new pastiche, drawn from decades of moody teen dramas, that occasionally adds up to something new. The familiar characters are back, as are landmarks like Pop’s Chock’lit Shoppe. But it’s a dark, bitter milkshake that “Riverdale” concocts, built on the suspicion that any town this squeaky clean must be hiding decay, corruption and secrets. And jeepers, are there secrets. The big one surrounds the murder of Jason Blossom (Trevor Stines) who disappeared while on an outing in the woods with his   twin sister Cheryl (Madelaine Petsch). Archie (K. J. Apa)  —   an aspiring musician with   abs  —   witnessed a key bit of evidence but can’t talk because of the circumstances: He was hooking up with his music teacher, Ms. Grundy (Sarah Habel) now a sultry knockout. The whole Archieverse is hotter and more haunted. Veronica Lodge (Camila Mendes) the spellbinding rich girl, is now a transplant from Manhattan whose father is in jail for fraud. Betty Cooper (Lili Reinhart) still pining away in Archie’s   has an older sister who had a breakdown after an entanglement with Jason. It’s a more diverse Riverdale, too, if mainly among the supporting characters. Kevin Keller (Casey Cott) a gay student, was introduced in the recent comics. The mayor, the principal and the girl group Josie and the Pussycats are all  . When Archie asks Josie (Ashleigh Murray) if he might write songs for her group, she scolds him for his white privilege, and he soberly concedes her point. Meet our new Archiekins: not just ripped, but woke. The malt shop is still in business, but the   is closing down. The town is beset with bullying, sexual harassment and abuse. Jughead (Cole Sprouse) the wry,   sidekick of the comics, is now a dour, emo narrator. “Get closer,” he says, “and you start seeing the shadows underneath. ” Finding the corrosion under the    chassis of   America is itself an old trope. “Riverdale” flirts with the kinky darkness of David Lynch’s “Blue Velvet,” as well as “Twin Peaks,” whose Mädchen Amick plays Betty’s     mother. But the series is closer to teen intrigues like “Pretty Little Liars” and “Gossip Girl. ” “Riverdale” is very conscious of its influences  —   too much so at times. It’s a blizzard of knowing references and characters talking about one another as characters. “You may be a stock character from a ’90s teen movie,” Cheryl snipes at Veronica, “but I’m not. ” She’s right  —   Cheryl is more like a stock character from “Glee. ” Her line is typical of much of the dialogue in “Riverdale”: It’s clever, but it sounds written. Still, the show has a welcome sense of humor about itself. “Riverdale” is more an ensemble show than the story of Archie, which is fortunate, because here he’s written and played as a flat, brooding bore. In another touch of   he spars with his father, played by Luke Perry, who practically invented soulful teen brooding on “Beverly Hills 90210. ” Archie’s gal pals are far more interesting, especially the new, more complex Betty. In the excellent third episode, she and Veronica join forces for a revenge plot against some   jocks  —   a theme, lately, in series like MTV’s “ . ” Ms. Reinhart plays her vigilante turn with a gusto that conveys years of Betty’s repressing her feelings, and the two girls’ bonding complicates their inevitable love triangle with Archie. (That dynamic is very “Dawson’s Creek,” whose Greg Berlanti is an executive producer here.) The early episodes get better the deeper they delve into the murder mystery, despite false notes like members of a biker gang who look like extras from “Grease. ” If the tone is not yet consistent, the aesthetic is, a strong sign that “Riverdale” knows what it wants to be. The terrific art direction warps the   iconography into something haunting and lurid. Take Archie and the Blossom twins’ hair  —   so red that it’s clownish, like dyed cotton candy. What the original comics drew as milky and wholesome, “Riverdale” dials up to ghostly and unnatural. The old world of Archie was saccharine, down to the 1969 single by spinoff pop group the Archies, “Sugar, Sugar” (which gets an update in the series from the Pussycats). This “Riverdale” suggests that so much sugar, over time, can’t help but make a town a little sick."

You Ought to Have a Look _is a feature from the Center for the Study of Science posted by Patrick J. Michaels and Paul C. (“Chip”) Knappenberger. While this section will feature all of the areas of interest that we are emphasizing, the prominence of the climate issue is driving a tremendous amount of web traffic. Here we post a few of the best in recent days, along with our color commentary._   
  
\---   
  
A lot of buzz around the web was generated late this week with the announcement from the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration that 2014 topped their list as the warmest year since their records began in the late 1800s.   
  
While most of the mainstream media coverage focused on the record-setting temperatures and breathlessly spoke of how this was further indication that humans are warming the climate, the blogosphere was full of articles throwing cold water on this overheated rhetoric by pointing out that despite the past year’s warm temperatures, 1) global warming continues to occur at only a snail’s pace, and 2) this pace is far beneath that projected by the world’s collection of climate models—models developed for the specific purpose of projecting future climate changes. With each passing year, their performance becomes worse and worse. That is the big story about 2014’s temperatures.   
  
Here are some sites that astutely picked up on that:   
  
Over at _Climate Etc._, Judy Curry has her say in “‘Warmest year’, ‘pause’, and all that.” Her bottom line?   




Berkeley Earth sums it up well with this statement:   
  
_That is, of course, an indication that the Earth’s average temperature for the last decade has changed very little._   
  
The key issue remains the growing discrepancy between the climate model projections and the observations: 2014 just made the discrepancy larger.   
  
Speculation about ‘warmest year’ and end of ‘pause’ implies a near term prediction of surface temperatures—that they will be warmer. I’ve made my projection—global surface temperatures will remain mostly flat for at least another decade. However, I’m not willing to place much $$ on that bet, since I suspect that Mother Nature will manage to surprise us. (I will be particularly surprised if the rate of warming in the next decade is at the levels expected by the IPCC.)



At the Global Warming Policy Foundation, David Whitehouse takes on the 2014 temperature record and its implications in this article “2014: Global Temperature Stalls Another Year.” Like Curry, Whitehouse hits the nail on the head:   




The only conclusion to be drawn from the addition of 2014 data is that the post-1997 standstill seen in global annual average surface temperature has continued for one more year, making it now about 17 years in duration. This is the opposite of what is claimed in the NASA press release.   
  
It is clear beyond doubt by now that there is a growing discrepancy between computer climate projections and real-world data that questions their ability to produce meaningful projections about future climatic conditions.



And over at _Watts Up With That_ , Bob Tisdale has a guest post titled “Does the Uptick in Global Surface Temperatures in 2014 Help the Growing Difference between Climate Models and Reality?” You've probably already guessed his answer:   




As illustrated and discussed, while global surface temperatures rose slightly in 2014, the minor uptick did little to overcome the growing difference between observed global surface temperature and the projections of global surface warming by the climate models used by the IPCC.



As you may have noticed, we couldn’t agree more with all of this.

Over at Heterodox Academy, we have been hearing from students who are concerned that their universities exhibit a rigid ideological orthodoxy, with dissenting faculty members almost nonexistent and dissenting students afraid to speak their minds. We agree that this sort of academic climate is profoundly unhealthy: It tends to stifle the sort of uncensored intellectual inquiry that produces groundbreaking scholarship and robust education. Indeed, the Supreme Court itself has cautioned against a “pall of orthodoxy” in education: “The classroom is peculiarly the marketplace of ideas. The Nation’s future depends upon leaders trained through wide exposure to that robust exchange of ideas which discovers truth out of a multitude of tongues, [rather] than through any kind of authoritative selection.” _Keyishian v. Board of Regents_ , 385 U. S. 589, 603 (1967) (internal quotations omitted).



Yale University understood this very well, for a time. And the University of Chicago understands it now. But, alas, this basic principle has been forgotten on countless campuses across the country. Heterodox Academy has, therefore, launched a new initiative to empower students to call for a more heterodox education. In collaboration with several students, we have generated three short resolutions that students may use to reaffirm the central importance of free speech and intellectual diversity on campus. Students who want an uncensored and heterodox education may propose these resolutions to their student governments, publicize them in student newspapers and use them to press for official policy changes:



 **[B]e it resolved that [our school] is a Heterodox University**



We make the following specific requests to the faculty and administration:



 **1) Adopt the Chicago Principles on Freedom of Expression**



A clear way for the university to show commitment to viewpoint diversity is by adopting the University of Chicago’s Principles on Freedom of Expression, which state in part:



The University’s fundamental commitment is to the principle that debate or deliberation may not be suppressed because the ideas put forth are thought by some or even by most members of the University community to be offensive, unwise, immoral, or wrong‐​headed. It is for the individual members of the University community, not for the University as an institution, to make those judgments for themselves, and to act on those judgments not by seeking to suppress speech, but by openly and vigorously contesting the ideas that they oppose. Indeed, fostering the ability of members of the University community to engage in such debate and deliberation in an effective and responsible manner is an essential part of the University’s educational mission.



We request that the Faculty Senate endorse the “Chicago Principles” as official university policy.



 **2) Implement a non‐​obstruction policy for protests**



We support the right of all students to protest against speakers and writers with whom they disagree, but we ask that protests be done in a way that does not deprive other students of their rights to speak and hear. When members of our community shout down a speaker, or take other actions intended to make it more difficult for a speaker to speak or for an audience to hear, they are practicing obstruction, censorship, and sometimes intimidation, not free speech. Such practices have no place in any academic community. We request that the university formulate and enforce a non‐​obstruction policy. As stated in the Chicago Principles: “The University has a solemn responsibility not only to promote a lively and fearless freedom of debate and deliberation, but also to protect that freedom when others attempt to restrict it.”



 **3) Improve viewpoint diversity**



We request that the university include viewpoint diversity, and particularly political diversity, in its diversity policies and in its efforts to diversify the faculty and the curriculum. We want to encounter a range of viewpoints in the classroom, just as we will after we graduate.



Adoption of these resolutions will mark a school as a “Heterodox University” — a safe space for intellectual diversity and uncensored speech. Heterodox Academy stands ready to help tailor these resolutions to specific universities and to help support students who wish to promote these principles. For more information, clickhere.

You Ought to Have a Look _is a feature from the Center for the Study of Science posted by Patrick J. Michaels and Paul C. (“Chip”) Knappenberger. While this section will feature all the areas of interest that we are emphasizing, the prominence of the climate issue is driving a tremendous amount of web traffic. ere we post a few of the best in recent days, along with our color commentary._   
  
\---   
  
Since the Earth Day coverage this year seemed rather meager—a sign, perhaps, that everyone is growing tired of the pessimistic drone that defines the current environmental movement—it is possible that you may have overlooked a few stories out there that shine a more positive light on the human condition and the way forward.   
  
You ought to take a few minutes and take Alex Epstein’s short course from Prager University. It is presented in the form of a 5-minute video titled “Why You Should Love Fossil Fuel.” Here's course description:   




Every year on Earth Day we learn how bad humanity's economic development is for the health of the planet. But maybe this is the wrong message. Maybe we should instead reflect on how human progress, even use of fossil fuels, has made our environment cleaner and healthier. Alex Epstein of the Center for Industrial Progress explains.



We hope you like this, because you’ll undoubtedly be hearing much more from Alex in the future as we are happy that he has joined us at the Center for Study of Science as one of Cato’s newest adjunct scholars.   




Also trying to bring a positive light to our future and change the course of modern environmentalism are Michael Schellenberger and Ted Nordhaus from the Breakthrough Institute. These guys are co-authors of the _Ecomodernist Manifesto_ that we highlighted in these pages last issue. For Earth Day, they wrote a piece for _USA Today_ titled “Want to Save the Planet? Say Bye-bye to Nature.” They mean “bye-bye” not in the sense of nature going away, but that we (humans) should bid it farewell as we exit. Here is the lead:   




Since before the first Earth Day in 1970, environmentalists have argued that solving environmental problems required humans to get closer to nature. The ""back to the land"" movement urged people to leave cities, which were viewed as crowded and polluted. Renewable energy was recommended because it integrates human civilization into natural energy flows, such as water, biofuels and the sun. Similarly, organic agriculture was better because it integrated farmers and consumers into the natural rhythms of nature.   
  
In recent years, though, a growing number of environmental scientists and activists are saying that the best way to protect nature is not by returning to it, but rather by leaving it alone.



This fits closely with the idea that technology and advanced society leads to better environmental protection—an opinion that we share. You ought have a look.   
  
And also, be sure not to miss the _Wall Street Journal_ op-ed penned by Rep. Lamar Smith (R-TX), who chairs the House Committee on Science, Space and Technology. Last week, Smith's committee held a hearing on the justification and feasibility of the Obama administration’s recently announced “UN Climate Pledge.” Rep. Smith’s op-ed was in response to President Obama fossil-fuel-burning Earth Day foray into the Florida Everglades to tell us that we need to take action to restrict the burning of fossil fuels in the name of mitigating climate change. While we have a good suggestion for the President as to some fossil-fuel saving measures that immediately come to mind, we’ll bite our tongue because they wouldn’t have any impact on the climate anyway. In fact, this is true for all emissions-limiting actions that come from the United States—a point that Rep. Lamar stresses in his _WSJ_ piece (with help from information originating from our work and conveyed to him via last week’s testimony of Dr. Judy Curry).   
  
In the end, Rep. Smith astutely concludes:   




When assessing climate change, we should focus on good science, not politically correct science.

The “green” forests of the future?
Guest essay by Eric Worrall
Is the artificial tree the solution to climate change? There have been a number of stories advocating artificial trees recently. Proponents of artificial trees believe that normal trees haven’t got the capacity to deliver the CO2 reductions they want. They insist we should try to improve on nature, by replacing natural respiration, with industrial scale absorption and disposal of CO2.
For example, consider the following story;
Is an artificial tree part of the solution to climate change? These guys think so.
… What if we had a way to suck that excess the CO2 right back out of the sky?
Well, actually, we do, says Chris Jones, a chemical engineer at Georgia Tech in Atlanta.
“These are our best ways of capturing CO2 from the air,” Jones says as he walks under a canopy of trees on the school’s campus. “Trees evolved over millions of years to do this very efficiently.”
Physicist Klaus Lackner stands beside a miniature greenhouse in his lab at ASU’s Center for Negative Carbon Emissions, in which he’s testing out the properties of his “artificial tree. Lackner says he expects a square mile of artificial trees could suck as much as ten million tons of CO2 a year out of the atmosphere. Credit: Ari Daniel Thing is, we just don’t have enough trees to fix our CO2 problem. In fact, the earth has fewer acres of trees every year. But Jones says that even if we planted trees everywhere we could, they still wouldn’t be able to pull enough CO2 out of the air to offset our emissions.
Which for Jones means one thing. “We have to come up with a chemical tree that can effectively extract CO2 out of the air,” he says.
Essentially mimic nature, only do her one better.

Is it just me, or is there something deeply unsettling about the modern green movement, and its infatuation with technological monstrosities? They build bird frying solar collectors, and bird and bat chopping windmills, to save the birds and bats. They ignore devastating industrial pollution in China, to ensure the supply of Rare Earth elements required to build their wind turbines and electric cars. And now they want to build artificial trees, because they think natural trees aren’t up to the job.
How much of the natural world do greens intend to bulldoze, dig, pave over, pollute, incinerate or slice up, in order to save “nature”?

"**China's president has issued a warning against dissent, saying any attempt to divide China will end in ""bodies smashed and bones ground to powder"".**
Xi Jinping's comments came during a state visit to Nepal on Sunday, Chinese state broadcaster CCTV said.
He didn't mention any particular region but it was seen as a warning to Hong Kong, where anti-Beijing protests have been ongoing for months.
Peaceful rallies in Hong Kong again descended into clashes on Sunday.
Public transport stations and shops deemed to be pro-Beijing were damaged.
""Anyone who attempts to split any region from China will perish, with their bodies smashed and bones ground to powder,"" Mr Xi said, according to a foreign ministry statement issued on Sunday.
""Any external forces that support the splitting of China can only be regarded as delusional by the Chinese people,"" he said.
Since the start of the Hong Kong protest movement four months ago, China has blamed ""external forces"" for fuelling the unrest, and accused the US and UK of interfering in Chinese domestic affairs.
Xi Jinping has yet to make any direct comment on the ongoing protests in Hong Kong, so this will be seen as a rare and strong warning.
Beijing has so far said it believes Hong Kong's police force is capable of handling the crisis. But protesters fear Beijing could send in troops to end the violence on the streets.
This is widely seen as an unlikely scenario because of the serious consequences. Few observers believe China would repeat its 1989 crackdown on pro-democracy activists in Tiananmen Square in Beijing, for examples where hundreds are believed to have died.
Hong Kong is a part of China, but has a high level of autonomy - it has its own legal and justice system and far more freedoms than people have on the mainland.
There has been growing anti-Beijing sentiment for some time, but the latest wave of protests started in June. It was triggered by a proposal to bring in a new law which would have meant criminal suspects could be sent to mainland China to stand trial.
Many were afraid this law could end up being used by the government in Beijing to persecute Hong Kongers who criticise it. Critics said it would undermine Hong Kong's judicial independence.
The government responded to the initial massive protests by saying the bill would be withdrawn, but by that point the protests had escalated.
The protesters now want their ""five demands"" to be met, which include full democracy for Hong Kong and an inquiry into what they say has been an excessive use of force by the police.
Protests have taken place every weekend since June and have happened in every district of the territory, causing widespread disruption.
More than 2,300 people have been arrested since the civil disobedience began.
On Sunday, several neighbourhoods saw rallies, and by the afternoon at least 27 stations on the MTR - Hong Kong's metro - were closed.
Police said they had used ""minimum force"" to disperse protesters, but television footage showed weekend shoppers caught in the chaos. Some were filmed screaming and apparently injured as officers rushed into a shopping centre.
Petrol bombs were thrown at Mong Kok police station, and one officer was slashed in the neck, authorities say. He is in a stable condition in hospital, the South China Morning Post reports.
Overnight on Sunday, one group of protesters hauled a three-metre-high (9ft) statue of a protester on to Lion Rock, a famous outcrop overlooking Hong Kong.
The statue, Lady Liberty, has become a symbol of the rallies, and sports a gas mask, goggles and a helmet.
She represents an injured protester who demonstrators believe was shot in the eye by a police projectile.
The group of several dozen, some wearing head lamps, climbed the 500m peak during a thunderstorm. The statue held a black banner that read: ""Revolution of our time, Liberate Hong Kong."""
"Unborn babies whose mothers breathed in smoke from a major coalmine fire in Victoria in 2014 were more likely to suffer respiratory infections in their early childhood, according to a new study. Coughing, wheezing and diagnosed cases of respiratory infections all went up among 79 children tracked between two and four years after the fire that choked the town of Morwell in February and March 2014. Published in the Medical Journal of Australia, the research found young children exposed to the smoke from the Hazelwood coalmine were less affected, but parents reported their children were using asthma inhalers more often. The finding that unborn children were more at risk was “unexpected” the researchers wrote, “as inhalation is presumed to be the primary route of exposure to air pollutants”. The researchers have warned that impacts on pregnant mothers and their unborn children need to be considered as climate change was driving an increased risk bushfires, exposing more people to smoke. Multiple fires started at the open-cut mine on 9 February 2014 and an inquiry found it was likely they were ignited by embers from nearby bushfires. The research was led by Dr Fay Johnston, an associate professor at the Menzies Institute for Medical Research at the University of Tasmania. Prof Graeme Zosky, deputy director of the Menzies Institute for Medical Research and a co-author on the study, said there had been many studies on the health impacts of long-term exposure to air pollution but much less was known about the impacts of short-term exposure to high-levels of pollution, particular on pregnant women. He said the impacts on unborn children that unfolded years later were compared to 81 young children also exposed to the smoke. Results were compared to impacts on Morwell children born after the fires and who were not exposed to the smoke. In the research, the authors wrote: “Our findings suggest an increased susceptibility to acute respiratory infections during childhood after exposure in utero to a severe air pollution episode.” The numbers of severe smoke events from bushfires was likely to increase because of climate change, the authors wrote. “Protecting pregnant women and young children from episodic severe smoke events should be central to public health responses to poor air quality,” they concluded. The study relied on parental reports of children’s health compared to reports from parents of children that were born after the fires had gone out. As daily exposure to fine particles in the air from the fires went up, so did reports two to four years later of children coughing, sneezing and diagnosis from doctors of upper respiratory infections. The researchers said that in utero exposure to smoke could have a larger impact on the long term respiratory health of children in their first two years of life. In a submission to an inquiry into the fire, the Victorian Council of Social Service noted children in Morwell were already disadvantaged compared to other places in Victoria. That submission also said the state’s chief health officer at the time had advised that vulnerable people – including the elderly, young children and pregnant women – should relocate away from the smoke. Dr Jo McCubbin, a paediatrician from Sale, 60 kilometres east of Morwell, remembers smelling the fires in early 2014 and seeing soot condensed in drops of dew on her windows. She said: “This was a five-week exposure but it was enough for us to be concerned, but it did take a long time for pregnant mothers to be included in the warnings. “The study is important because it tells us we can’t ignore what happened to these children and their families. Also it tells us this is an Australia-wide problem because that short and sharp impact happened to people all over Australia with the most recent fires.” A separate 2019 study found that children from the town aged under two at the time of the fire had reduced lung function when they were examined three years later. In July 2019, four companies were each found guilty in Victoria’s Supreme Court on three charges related to pollution the air. Those companies – Hazelwood Pacific Pty Ltd, Australian Power Partners BV, Hazelwood Churchill Pty Ltd and National Power Australia Investments Ltd were collectively fined $340,000 over the blaze. The sentences were suppressed until May 2020 to allow a related case to be heard. Victoria Environmental Protection Authority chief executive Dr Cathy Wilkinson described the incident as “grand-scale pollution that affected the environment and every member of the community”."
"Can I finally admit that my role model was a sitcom character? Mary Richards  —   played to perfection by the beloved Mary Tyler Moore  —   was more than a role model, she was a template. Even in fashion and home décor  —   my choices mimicked hers. Mary Tyler Moore had shown up just when everything about women’s lives was about to change. Her show debuted in 1970, when I was 19, still in college and not imagining a career in television  —   or a career in anything. But two years after Mary first joyfully threw her tam hat up in the air and joined   in Minneapolis, I began my television career in a city also ending in ’apolis. That part is coincidental, of course  —   but my home? Mary lived in a studio apartment with a pullout sofa bed, and not coincidentally so did I. And if my apartment was not quite so charming, it wasn’t for lack of copying. I didn’t yet have a style of my own, so whenever possible I borrowed Mary’s. A few years later, when to outward appearances, I was making it on my own, I was on the cover of Chicago Tribune magazine holding a   find  —   a large gold number “5”  —   for Channel 5, my new broadcast home. But in truth, the inspiration was Mary. She had a big   “M. ” It was affixed to the wall, part of the furniture, just like her highboy chest of drawers. I also had one of those. In Chicago, I moved up into a   condo in a high rise. Mary had also moved out of her studio and into a condo where she gives herself a housewarming. Her parties  —   this was a running gag  —   were always dull. Sitting alone on the floor after her last guest has left, she surveys her modern new home and says, “I HATE IT. ” I loved her for that. The ’70s were my formative years, and when my career got way out ahead of me, I still had Mary to fill in some gaps. We viewers were never given a peek inside her   closet, but Mary would walk out of it in one cute outfit after another usually a smart knit. I gravitated in that direction, too  —   if not with the same effect. For my farewell show in Chicago, on the eve of my debut on the “Today” show, I chose a knit ensemble in alternating wide stripes of brown, orange and white  —   possibly inspired by the colorations of a clown fish. I was thinking of Mary. Not long after, Tom Brokaw looked at me across the anchor desk one morning and said, “Burn the dress. ” Not Mary’s fault. I’m sometimes described as a “pioneer” in broadcast journalism  —   which is preposterous. The chair I settled into in 1976 had been recently vacated by the real thing, Barbara Walters. Barbara was indisputably the   woman in television news at that time, but she was not the best known or most beloved. That distinction belonged to “Mary. ” “The Mary Tyler Moore Show” started several years before two words, “and women,” were inserted into an F. C. C. affirmative action clause pertaining to television station hiring. That might have helped women like me get a job, but Mary Richards may already have opened as many doors she had made a woman in the newsroom seem normal. Mary was ahead of her time, but not too far. She was not superwoman she was someone you could be. She was someone you wanted to be. Mary was plucky, but not driven. When starting a new life in Minneapolis, she was just looking for a job, not a career. And though uncommonly beautiful, Mary made it O. K. to be dateless on a Saturday night  —   which I often was. (I wasn’t alone. On Saturday nights, as Oprah recalled, she would put the conditioner in her hair during “The Bob Newhart Show” and rinse it out before “Mary. ”) Mary Tyler Moore, was “our Mary. ” She was the right woman at the right time. And I loved her for it."

“In 1894, the Times of London estimated that by 1950 every street in the city would be buried nine feet deep in horse manure. One New York prognosticator of the 1890s concluded that by 1930 the horse droppings would rise to Manhattan’s third-story windows.” No Fracking Consensus:
We may now laugh at the above perceived problem, or the additional things as mentioned by Gary Pearse below. But how will people in 50 years from now judge “us”? Will they laugh at our collective inability to see past our noses? Should we approach things differently?
The previous post with September data produced many gems among the over 500 comments. Unfortunately, I cannot use all gems in this post. I intend to use others in later posts. However for now, I will recopy two posts, one by Leo Smith and the other by Gary Pearse.

Robert G Brown is one of the few people I look up to, not because he has solved the problem of Climate (change) but because he accurately understands the almost complete impossibility of understanding it!
Years ago someone said to me that, faced with a problem that you didn’t know how to solve, you must go back to first principles. None of the theories and equations helping? Start from scratch and develop new ones!
Robert G Brown reminds us that the ‘easy’ problems that we can solve with the application of linear differential equations (and in a sense, scientific theories are simply differential equations, like F=ma) have already been solved, and that what remain are the fiendishly hard problems, that, even if we can identify the differential equations that govern system behaviour, are practically incalculable because of the inherent non linearity of multiple terms, all of which affect each other.
In essence this approach – finding the underlying (partial) differential equations – won’t work, not because we get the raw science wrong, but because the integration of those partials over time leads us into sensitivity issues and chaotic behaviours that is essentially the nature of the beast. Larger and larger supercomputers merely extend the size of the area we can predict with some degree of accuracy, from the minuscule to the pathetically small.
And this is why even this brave attempt to identify all the variables, and even establish the correct partial differential equations based upon them will not result in a computer model that accurately predicts the climate.
The only approach that I have ever come across that partially works, is to examine the possible cases and eliminate those that are completely unstable – that is if we consider all possible climates in terms of stability, we will find that huge collections of them are so mightily unstable that should perturbation of the system by e.g. volcanic eruption or meteor strike or even releases of lots of lovely CO2, cause the system to enter such a region, the overwhelming tendency would be to revert back to a more stable region.
That is, we might be able to map climate into zones of possible quasi stability, and zones of impossible instability. If you like instead of working out what the climate will be, we could at least ascertain what it simply couldn’t be. And then leave the rest as ‘what it could and might be’.
This alone is probably what an organisation like the IPCC should be tasked with – what are the possible states of future climate, what are their potential probabilities, and impacts, and how should we meet the challenges – not by attempting to stop them happening, but by identifying the physical and social and economic changes necessary to adapt to them.
In my time beyond engineering as a business man, I learnt a Golden rule. Do not expend effort on attempting to change that which is inevitable, nor attempting to solve that which is – for whatever reason, effectively insoluble: Rather use the techniques of pragmatism – as practised by both engineers, and oddly enough, the military, and consider all the possibilities, do the research or reconnaissance to ascertain which of them are likely, plan accordingly, make tentative steps forward, and as soon as it appears that the situation is not as it appeared to be, change the plan without shame.
In other words, going back to first principles, as a putative agent of government, what the real question is, is not ‘where is the climate going’ but ‘where might the climate go, with what probability, and, given that its unlikely we can in all honesty stop it, what should be a meaningful response that preserves as much of civilisation as is practicable’?
I know that the final answer would be along the lines of :
‘Almost anywhere within a degree or two, a few cm or so of sea level, a few cm or so of rainfall, and indeed along the any of the lines that the historical record have already shown us is certainly possible’ and as to what we ought to do about it, the final answer there would be: ‘be prepared with a contingency fund, to meet whatever Nature sends, but don’t waste a single halfpenny on trying to stop it or second guessing what its going to do, because frankly the mathematics is insoluble to that level of detail’.
And to PROVE that the ‘mathematics is insoluble to that level of detail’ is the first step.
It’s not just a matter of finding the right equations, don’t waste time on that. Because the simpler job is to prove that even if you did find them they wouldn’t actually allow the integration to a realistic and useful prediction anyway.
All we need to do is to have enough of the relevant parameters to show that the problem is chaotic and non linear, calculate the size of computer needed to give an answer in real time, rather than hindcasting, and that will show that all climate science of the sort that is claimed is ‘settled’ is in fact completely useless.
Not that it will change a damned thing politically, because the mathematics to do that would be beyond nearly everyone – especially ‘climate scientists’ who are mainly, at best, third rate alchemists – and as we know, that which passeth all understanding, is in the end a matter of faith to those whom it passeth….
(The above ends Leo’s post.)

Leo, I believe your approach is eminently doable and, in part, is done! How many kinds of weather are there anyway? In the polar regions, what, 2-3, in the temperate zones 5 or 6, and in the tropics 2-3. Empirically it has reached these temperatures, these rainfalls/snowfalls (or lack thereof), these intensities and numbers of storms of a couple of types and the secondary effects – rates of sea-level change, droughts, fires etc. Also some physical, non weather stuff – volcanoes, tsunami, earthquakes, extraterrestrial bolides. We should be spending more money on tracking all the asteroids while we are at it and planning possible things that might be done.
I have a soft hypothesis -actually it might be better termed an axiom- that PREDICTIONS OF DOOMSTERS WILL NEVER COME TRUE. Such predictions are made using linear thinking of the kind discussed here for which a supportive legitimate mathematical expression is impossible. In the case of Malthusian disasters, their predictions are even less possible because they miss out the confounding principal component of human ingenuity in their thinking. Our cities didn’t end up being buried in horse manure (Malthus), the industrial revolution didn’t starve itself out by 1900 because of the shortage of coal (Jevons), we didn’t starve to death by 2000 and run out of mineral resources (Club of Rome, Holdren, Ehrlich) nor did we freeze to death by that date with the imminent man-made new ice age on the way (by the same people). Saudi oil minister Sheik Ahmed Zaki Yamani said it best in a 2005 interview with New York Times discussing peak oil: “The Stone Age didn’t end for lack of stone, and the oil age will end long before the world runs out of oil.”
The Club of Rome’s 1972 “Limits to Growth” and others by the same group in recent years were totally blown away. We have doubled the 1972 world population and have 7B people living better and longer than the 3.5B of 1972. That there are still apparently well educated persons making such doomster predictions is evidence more of their misfit psychology than the application of sound methods. All these predictions are made by biologists and social scientists whose training and knowledge are linear and more akin to accounting than to creative science. Such disciplines give the air of erudition but they are precisely the least equipped to make such predictions. Knowing the sex rituals of the chameleon, which do not change over a very long time if at all, or counting tiger turds in the jungle to calculate population, are not the kind of skills required to properly attempt to forecast the future of mankind and the planet.
Mention should also be made here of the inevitability of unexpected consequences (themselves arising from the same kind of lack of unpredictability inherent in “doom” and climate science) that have and will abound in any action that might be designed by doomsters to correct the perceived fantasy. Some of their geoengineering ideas are downright scary and definitely not the work of engineers (although I guess you could buy one). These aspects definitely also brand doomster climate scientists as political activists and social scientists.
(The above ends Gary’s comment.)
Before continuing with my regular post, I would like to point out some highlights in the October data and put these highlights into perspective.
The GISS anomaly for October at 104 smashed the previous all time high mark of 97 from January 2007.
However for RSS, its October value of 0.440 was beaten in October 1998 at 0.461. Furthermore, all of the first 10 months of 1998 beat 0.440. In addition, it was beaten for several months in 2010.
UAH6.0beta4 did have its highest October on record at 0.427. However all of the first 9 months of 1998 beat that mark. In addition, it was beaten for several months in 2010.
Hadcrut4 set an October record at 0.811. However this does not beat its all time high anomaly of 0.832 set in January of 2007.
GISS and Hadcrut4 and Hadsst3 will set new records in 2015, however both satellites will not get higher than third place. I am assuming of course that Dr. Spencer is not about to be replaced very soon by you know who.
In the sections below, as in previous posts, we will present you with the latest facts. The information will be presented in three sections and an appendix. The first section will show for how long there has been no warming on some data sets. At the moment, only the satellite data have flat periods of longer than a year. The second section will show for how long there has been no statistically significant warming on several data sets. The third section will show how 2015 so far compares with 2014 and the warmest years and months on record so far. For three of the data sets, 2014 also happens to be the warmest year. The appendix will illustrate sections 1 and 2 in a different way. Graphs and a table will be used to illustrate the data.
Section 1
This analysis uses the latest month for which data is available on WoodForTrees.com (WFT). All of the data on WFT is also available at the specific sources as outlined below. We start with the present date and go to the furthest month in the past where the slope is a least slightly negative on at least one calculation. So if the slope from September is 4 x 10^-4 but it is – 4 x 10^-4 from October, we give the time from October so no one can accuse us of being less than honest if we say the slope is flat from a certain month.
1. For GISS, the slope is not flat for any period that is worth mentioning.
2. For Hadcrut4, the slope is not flat for any period that is worth mentioning.
3. For Hadsst3, the slope is not flat for any period that is worth mentioning.
4. For UAH, the slope is flat since May 1997 or 18 years and 6 months. (goes to October using version 6.0)
5. For RSS, the slope is flat since February 1997 or 18 years and 9 months. (goes to October)
The next graph shows just the lines to illustrate the above. Think of it as a sideways bar graph where the lengths of the lines indicate the relative times where the slope is 0. In addition, the upward sloping blue line at the top indicates that CO2 has steadily increased over this period.
Note that the UAH5.6 from WFT needed a detrend to show the slope is zero for UAH6.0.
WoodForTrees.org – Paul Clark – Click the pic to view at­ source
When two things are plotted as I have done, the left only shows a temperature anomaly.
The actual numbers are meaningless since the two slopes are essentially zero. No numbers are given for CO2. Some have asked that the log of the concentration of CO2 be plotted. However WFT does not give this option. The upward sloping CO2 line only shows that while CO2 has been going up over the last 18 years, the temperatures have been flat for varying periods on the two sets.
Section 2
For this analysis, data was retrieved from Nick Stokes’ Trendviewer available on his website. This analysis indicates for how long there has not been statistically significant warming according to Nick’s criteria. Data go to their latest update for each set. In every case, note that the lower error bar is negative so a slope of 0 cannot be ruled out from the month indicated.
On several different data sets, there has been no statistically significant warming for between 11 and 22 years according to Nick’s criteria. Cl stands for the confidence limits at the 95% level.
The details for several sets are below.
For UAH6.0: Since January 1993: Cl from -0.018 to 1.669
This is 22 years and 10 months.
For RSS: Since April 1993: Cl from -0.033 to 1.566
This is 22 years and 7 months.
For Hadcrut4.4: Since January 2001: Cl from -0.048 to 1.334
This is 14 years and 9 months.
For Hadsst3: Since October 1995: Cl from -0.001 to 2.010
This is 20 years and 1 month.
For GISS: Since September 2004: Cl from -0.036 to 2.172
This is 11 years and 2 months.
Section 3
This section shows data about 2015 and other information in the form of a table. The table shows the five data sources along the top and other places so they should be visible at all times. The sources are UAH, RSS, Hadcrut4, Hadsst3, and GISS.
Down the column, are the following:
1. 14ra: This is the final ranking for 2014 on each data set.
2. 14a: Here I give the average anomaly for 2014.
3. year: This indicates the warmest year on record so far for that particular data set. Note that the satellite data sets have 1998 as the warmest year and the others have 2014 as the warmest year.
4. ano: This is the average of the monthly anomalies of the warmest year just above.
5. mon: This is the month where that particular data set showed the highest anomaly. The months are identified by the first three letters of the month and the last two numbers of the year.
6. ano: This is the anomaly of the month just above.
7. y/m: This is the longest period of time where the slope is not positive given in years/months. So 16/2 means that for 16 years and 2 months the slope is essentially 0. Periods of under a year are not counted and are shown as “0”.
8. sig: This the first month for which warming is not statistically significant according to Nick’s criteria. The first three letters of the month are followed by the last two numbers of the year.
9. sy/m: This is the years and months for row 8. Depending on when the update was last done, the months may be off by one month.
10. Jan: This is the January 2015 anomaly for that particular data set.
11. Feb: This is the February 2015 anomaly for that particular data set, etc.
20. ave: This is the average anomaly of all months to date taken by adding all numbers and dividing by the number of months.
21. rnk: This is the rank that each particular data set would have for 2015 without regards to error bars and assuming no changes. Think of it as an update 50 minutes into a game.

As you can see, all lines have been offset so they all start at the same place in January 2015. This makes it easy to compare January 2015 with the latest anomaly.
Appendix
In this part, we are summarizing data for each set separately.
RSS
The slope is flat since February 1997 or 18 years and 9 months. (goes to October)
For RSS: There is no statistically significant warming since April 1993: Cl from -0.033 to 1.566.
The RSS average anomaly so far for 2015 is 0.331. This ties it at 3rd place. 1998 was the warmest at 0.55. The highest ever monthly anomaly was in April of 1998 when it reached 0.857. The anomaly in 2014 was 0.255 and it was ranked 6th.
UAH6.0beta4
The slope is flat since May 1997 or 18 years and 6 months. (goes to October using version 6.0beta4)
For UAH: There is no statistically significant warming since January 1993: Cl from -0.018 to 1.669. (This is using version 6.0 according to Nick’s program.)
The UAH average anomaly so far for 2015 is 0.244. This would rank it at 3rd place. 1998 was the warmest at 0.482. The highest ever monthly anomaly was in April of 1998 when it reached 0.742. The anomaly in 2014 was 0.186 and it was ranked 5th.
Hadcrut4.4
The slope is not flat for any period that is worth mentioning.
For Hadcrut4: There is no statistically significant warming since January 2001: Cl from -0.048 to 1.334.
The Hadcrut4 average anomaly so far for 2015 is 0.714. This would set a new record if it stayed this way. The highest ever monthly anomaly was in January of 2007 when it reached 0.832. The anomaly in 2014 was 0.564 and this set a new record.
Hadsst3
For Hadsst3, the slope is not flat for any period that is worth mentioning. For Hadsst3: There is no statistically significant warming since October 1995: Cl from -0.001 to 2.010.
The Hadsst3 average anomaly so far for 2015 is 0.570. This would set a new record if it stayed this way. The highest ever monthly anomaly was in August of 2014 when it reached 0.644. This is prior to 2015. The anomaly in 2014 was 0.479 and this set a new record.
GISS
The slope is not flat for any period that is worth mentioning.
For GISS: There is no statistically significant warming since September 2004: Cl from -0.036 to 2.172.
The GISS average anomaly so far for 2015 is 0.82. This would set a new record if it stayed this way. The highest ever monthly anomaly was in January of 2007 when it reached 0.97. This is prior to October 2015 when a new all time record of 1.04 was set. The anomaly in 2014 was 0.74 and it set a new record.
Conclusion
Do you feel we are going about our climate studies in the proper manner? If not, what changes would you suggest?

You Ought to Have a Look _is a feature from the Center for the Study of Science posted by Patrick J. Michaels and Paul C. (“Chip”) Knappenberger. While this section will feature all of the areas of interest that we are emphasizing, the prominence of the climate issue is driving a tremendous amount of web traffic. Here we post a few of the best in recent days, along with our color commentary._   
  
_—_   
  
Over the past couple of weeks, prominent members of the climate science/climate policy community have come under attack for not toeing the (Presidential) party line when it comes to how human-caused climate change is being billed and sold via the President’ Climate Action Plan.   
  
The attacks began with Harvard Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics researcher Willie Soon, and thanks to the attention afforded by Justin Gillis in the _New York Times_ , were expanded by Representative Raul Grijalva (D-AZ), to include Richard Lindzen, David Legates, John Christy, Judith Curry, Robert Balling, Roger Pielke Jr., and Steven Hayward.   
  
In this _You Ought to Have a Look_ , we provide links to the subsequent public comments from those researchers under question (who have made them available) in response to this line of investigation—one which many have termed a “witch hunt.""   




Here they are:   
  
Dr. Willie Soon, Harvard Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics   
Statement by Dr. Willie Soon   
  
Dr. Richard Lindzen, _professor emeritus of atmospheric sciences at MIT and a distinguished senior fellow of the Cato Institute  
_The Political Assault on Climate Skeptics   
  
Dr. Steven Hayward, Ronald Reagan Professor of Public Policy 2014-2016, School of Pubic Policy, Pepperdine University   
Are You Now, or Have You Ever Been, a Climate Skeptic?   
The Climate Beclowning Continues

Running Updates on the ""Witch Hunt""   
  
Judith Curry, School of Earth and Atmospheric Sciences, Georgia Institute of Technology   
Conflicts of Interest in Climate Science   
  
  
  
Additionally, there are other comments out there, almost all negatively inclined to Rep. Grijalva’s investigation and its assault on academic freedom.   
  
Here are a few of the more prominent:   
  
American Meteorological Society   
Letter to Grijalva   
  
_Nature_ Magazine   
Gone Fishing   
  
American Geophysical Union   
Protecting Academic Freedom and Holding Ourselves Accountable   
  
It is well-worth looking through these responses to see just how ill-advised this campaign is widely-considered to be.

"The European Commission launched its much-anticipated “Green Deal” on December 11. The project has been spearheaded by European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, whose presidential tenure began recently on December 1 2019. The central thrust of the Green Deal is a relentless momentum towards making the EU climate neutral by 2050. This marries up formal political-legal EU ambition with the international Paris Agreement, where average global temperature rise is to be kept well below 2℃.  This headline intention of a Green Deal is to take the form of a pioneering “European Climate Law” – one of the most innovative legal regimes ever seriously proposed in the history of environmental law, which intends to deliver the world’s first climate-neutral continent. Efforts towards this 2050 objective will be supported by the expansion of carbon emissions pricing, which already exists in a well-developed form in the EU, most notably under the EU Emissions Trading Scheme. A new “carbon border adjustment mechanism” – basically a carbon border tax targeting imports from non-EU countries with less strict climate policies – will also be brought in to assist. The proposal also includes an emphasis on boosting competitiveness, ensuring a just transition across the EU, protecting the natural environment and biodiversity, strategic development of sustainable food policy, and a circular economy action plan. It proposes an economy-wide transition, meaning that it endeavours to drive decarbonisation across the breadth of the EU’s socio-economic sectors. This means in principle that truly profound changes are in store across everything from energy generation, to transport, agriculture, and so on. The Green Deal presents itself as a “growth strategy”. In broad terms, it says that a low carbon transition under the Paris Agreement can be an opportunity to simultaneously modernise the economy while seizing genuine green growth opportunities. This perspective is no doubt correct. But in the confused world of contemporary geopolitics the accuracy of the approach is often less important than the extent of the power aligned against the it. President Donald Trump, for example, has consistently asserted that progressive climate action amounts to an expensive means of damaging an economy – a position diametrically opposed to the EU’s “decarbonisation equals growth” type of ideology.  This disparity becomes more clear when one reaches paragraph 2.2.1 of the Green Deal proposals, where the commission estimates that “achieving the current 2030 climate and energy targets will require €260 billion of additional annual investment”. Yet this is far from being a Trumpian waste of money. Instead, the commission’s outlook is that the green financing that will be pumped into the Green Deal over time will stimulate and expand the economy, and the EU’s coffers will gradually overflow. In other words “it takes money to make money”. Profound differences in ideological approach cannot be interpreted in isolation, given our globalised world. So significant future trade negotiations between the EU and US may run into problems, for example in relation to the Green Deal’s carbon border tax. The carbon border tax, for instance, could raise tensions with the “economic nationalism” of some current and former people in the Trump administration. They have tended towards aggressive tariff and quota responses to what they have perceived as trade-barrier manoeuvres negatively impacting the administration’s “America First” orientation. However, the announcement of the Green Deal is currently just that – an announcement. The intended regime has yet to be passed into EU law and policy (the commission intends to propose the European Climate Law by March 2020). Recent history demonstrates that the complex machinery of EU governance makes substantial changes to its climate and energy regime no easy task.  The EU has been a relatively progressive actor on climate change over the past two decades, but the commission’s new set of intended commitments pushes the envelope farther than anything seen before. Some member states such as Ireland and Poland have severely struggled to meet even current EU climate obligations. Given the gravity of climate change, the EU institutions are right to press the case for making Europe the first climate-neutral continent by 2050. But they must also bring the member states along with them. And that, in the global saying of climate activists, really does require system change, not climate change."

We are seeing a great deal of debate at the moment over ~~teaching~~ brain-washing of students with a [climate alarmism curriculum.](https://thebfd.co.nz/2020/01/teaching-global-warming-in-schools-provides-a-great-opportunity/) Chief among the proposals is to have students adopt a vegan diet, all to save the planet. Meat-eating is said to contribute a horrendous negative amount to the perils of climate change.



The vegan nasties have ramped up their pressure, raiding supermarkets and harassing and haranguing meat-eaters. But it seems the science isn’t with either the vegans or the climate alarmists.



Vegans face a moral dilemma – animal welfare or climate change. Dr Graeme Coles, a Canterbury-based nutrition scientist, has done the calculations.



He estimates that **someone getting their minimum essential amino acid requirements from plant-based foods excrete more climate-damaging material than the same person getting them from animal products.**



“ **Avoiding animal protein in the diet means excreting 32g/day more nitrous oxides than people on omnivorous diets”** he says.



 **“The extra nitrous oxides from a vegan’s diet are equivalent to the emissions associated with two return journeys annually from New Zealand to London”.**



Oh dear, vegan farts and burps are very bad for the environment.



The problem for vegans is that **plant-derived protein is of markedly lower nutritional value than animal-derived protein.**



This is because of its low content of essential amino acids. A combination of amino acids is needed in order to maintain muscle and the immune system; if there is a limiting amino acid then other amino acids (and the nitrogen they contain) will be wasted.



Further problems are associated with the measures that plants have evolved to prevent predation. These are termed “antinutritional factors” – **the nutrients appear to be present but can’t be accessed by the digestive system.**



 **In order to overcome this, humans apply treatments such as soaking, heating, acidification, or pulverisation.** Treatment **takes time and energy, which increases the greenhouse gases associated with the food.**



Stick that in your hemp bong and smoke it.



Soybeans are the only staple crop also considered a protein crop. Soy ranks sixth for provision of calories globally, and soybeans are approximately 36 per cent protein when dry. After soaking overnight and cooking for a couple of hours, the protein is 17 per cent.



But soy’s high concentrations of antinutritional components mean that only a portion of the soybean protein is digested; the estimate is approximately 73 per cent, in comparison with 80-100 per cent from animal proteins.



Furthermore, the antinutritional factors delay the digestion of soy and other proteins in the diet. Other legumes have considerably lower protein quality and are generally less than 60 per cent digestible.



And on top of that soy is high in phytoestrogen, or a plant-based estrogen, which if consumed in large quantities turns you into an effete half-man with the constitution of a wilted pansy otherwise known as soy-boys.



In contrast, most of **the protein in meat, egg and dairy is digested in the first part of the small intestine, which enhances rate of absorption**. Processing animal products is easier too: beef is 26-34 per cent protein, and cooking takes five minutes (depending on the taste of the consumer).



Meat, delicious and climate-friendly too.



 **There is another problem with plants, even before food reaches the human mouth: wastage.** Food that is suitable for humans to eat is also suitable for other consumers – termed pests.



Whether the pests have legs (mammals, reptiles, birds, insects), no legs (nematodes, slugs, snails), or are fungi, bacteria or viruses, they destroy plants and stored plant products.



Glasshouses or vertical farms mitigate against predation but are not practicable for staple crops such as maize, rice and wheat (the top three global staple crops). Nor are they suitable for potatoes, cassava or soybeans (the next three).



In fact, **glasshouses and vertical farming are suitable only for relatively high-value crops, which provide vitamins and variety but not carbohydrates or proteins.**



Technological developments might change this in the future, as might the price that people are prepared to pay, but in the meantime the bulk of crops are grown outdoors and protected by the farmer with nets and sprays.



This protection is only partially successful.



Veganism seems very wasteful. But wait, it gets way worse:



In the developed world wastage occurs at and after harvesting. In the UK, **up to 30 per cent of vegetable crops aren’t harvested at all** because they do not meet exacting market standards for appearance.



 **Harvesting itself leaves much material in the field – over 80 per cent of broccoli, 6 per cent of wheat, 50 per cent of pineapple. More is lost in storage.**



Of the produce that does reach the supermarket, **promotions encourage customers to purchase excess, which, in the case of perishable foodstuffs, inevitably generates wastage in the home.** ImechE estimates that **between 30 per cent and 50 per cent of what has been bought in developed countries is thrown away by the purchaser.**



Therefore, **an unintended consequence of moving to a plant-based diet is increased waste** including all the resources that went into the wasted food.



This includes the nutrients, water and fossil fuels, and the land area that has produced waste, not food.



Fussy eaters and fussy consumers as well. It doesn’t seem like they are saving the planet much at all; in fact, it looks like they are harming the planet because of their stupid diet.



The most efficient way of processing plant proteins into consumable and useful proteins that the human body can use is animals. They eat the plants, processing them into useful proteins, then we eat them.



Don’t expect vegans to take this information well as they have enfeebled their minds with their plant-based diet.



So, you can stick your fake meat patties where the sun doesn’t shine. You know vegans are stupid because they keep trying to make vegetables look like meat. There should be consumer laws that prevent companies from calling plant-based foods meat.



Finally, if are still convinced that your plant-based existence is still warranted, then consider this video and sit crying into your soy latte at your hypocrisy:

"Labor’s Senate leader, Penny Wong, has said the ALP wins elections when leaders convince voters they are “champions of progress and trusted custodians of the economy”, in a rebuke to the rightwing frontbencher Joel Fitzgibbon. Fitzgibbon had suggested Labor could split if it fails to reconcile its progressive and blue-collar constituencies.  But Wong told Guardian Australia: “Our winning leaders did not see conflict between fairness, economic growth and a sustainable future; they knew these values to be mutually dependent.” She said Labor needed to protect existing jobs “while creating new jobs and taking Australia forward”. Wong on Thursday declared “all of us in Labor” needed to focus on the Morrison government’s “policy vacuum” on climate and energy. Fitzgibbon’s latest public intervention has angered a number of his shadow cabinet colleagues. After the shadow resources minister floated in a podcast a potential split sometime in the future, Tanya Plibersek, the party’s former deputy leader and the shadow education minister, told Guardian Australia: “It’s beyond me why anyone is talking about this when we have vulnerable people dying in nursing homes.” “People need to get their priorities straight,” she said. Fitzgibbon has been at public loggerheads with the shadow minister for climate change and energy Mark Butler over the direction of Labor’s climate policy after the 2019 election defeat, and more recently over taxpayer-supported gas development. Fitzgibbon, the veteran New South Wales rightwinger, suffered a substantial swing against him at the election in his Hunter Valley coalmining seat, and has made it clear that he thinks Labor has swung too heavily in favouring its progressive inner-city constituency over its traditional blue collar base. While Fitzgibbon has signed up to Labor’s post-election policy of net zero emissions by 2050, he has argued the emissions reduction target for 2030 should be the same as the Coalition’s. He has been rebuked for his front-running on policy during the past fortnight by both Butler and the Labor leader Anthony Albanese. In the new podcast, reported by the Australian, Fitzgibbon says: “I am very fearful about how the Labor party will manage … [to] juggle these two electoral bases and I do fear that, it won’t be in my time, but the party might end up splitting.” While Fitzgibbon’s arguments have some support internally, his regular incursions have also infuriated other colleagues. Several regional Labor MPs took to social media on Thursday to blast Fitzgibbon for suggesting Labor couldn’t fuse constituencies it has been fusing successfully since the Whitlam era. Albanese at the weekend used an interview with Guardian Australia to criticise Fitzgibbon for backing taxpayer subsidies for gas development in advance of seeing a concrete proposal from the Morrison government. On Thursday Albanese said it was entirely possible for Labor to represent the interests of both its constituencies, and he insisted any “modern” political party needed to deal with the risks of climate change. Albanese said Labor evolved with the times. “The Labor party has changed over a period of time. There were once people in the Labor party who supported the White Australia policy. It was one of our founding planks. We changed. “The Labor party used to support absolute protection and not opening up the economy, which the Hawke and Keating governments did. The Labor party, for a long time, like Australian society, didn’t support equality for women, or equality on the basis of people’s sexuality. “The Labor party is a modern party. Part of what any modern party with any self-respect will be about is dealing with the effects of climate change,” he said. Albanese said the split Fitzgibbon mused about was something that might happen, not in his lifetime. The Labor leader said he was “concerned about today”. “I’m concerned about the relatives of the people I’ve met with this morning and aged care. I’m concerned about immediate issues.” He said Labor’s mid-century position on emissions reduction was now a mainstream view championed by environmentalists, major business groups and farmers. He said this view was held by most of the country: “Everyone except the Liberal and National party who are out of step with mainstream opinion.” Albanese said Fitzgibbon should remain on the front bench because he was an important member of the team. The Labor leader is close to both Fitzgibbon and Butler, who are both significant figures in the right and left factions. Fitzgibbon used an interview on the ABC on Thursday morning to make it clear he remained a supporter of Albanese’s leadership of Labor, but in implicit criticism of Butler, he declared colleagues needed to give Albanese “space” to take Labor back to the political centre. Fitzgibbon also made it plain he would continue his public campaign. “Anthony Albanese is showing, in my view, a very strong leadership, taking the party back to the centre ground where I think most Australians want us to be,” Fitzgibbon said."

Share this...FacebookTwitterHere’s more fallout from the climate-religious attempts to suppress a scientist who dares to offer alternative ideas to global warming dogma.
Hat-tip Die kalte Sonne here.

On Augsut 16, 2016, in the German Wirtschaftswoche (Business Week) Cora Stephan looked at the dubious attempts to suppress and censor science.
Climate science that does not fit the global narrative
[…] No significant increase in the global mean temperature has taken place, a point that was even conceeded by climate scientist Mojib Latif, who is a follower of the greenhouse hypothesis. Yet no one is about to allow his research institute to be busted up, and especially not our ‘climate pope’ [Hans-Joachim] Schellnhuber. Also the ‘climate chancellow’ is well aware of the papal announcement of a climate catastrophe. The call on the guilty conscience of man is and remains a helpful instrument for rule in the sense of: if you do not do what you are told, then the world will come to an end. That not only works on children. No matter what ‘climate skeptics’ may tell us, with a bit of creativity every doomsayser brings reality in harmony with the theory. And the theory says that it is mankind that is causing a climate catastrophe with its emissions of CO2. Climate chancellor Angela Merkel here is infallible – even if recently she has had other things to worry about. […] Climatologists apparently attempted to suppress the publication of propositions [Zharkova’s]. They even refuse to exchange controversial ideas. Such behavior causes scientists to turn into religious warriors who feel automatically compelled to regard divergent opinions as blasphemy because articles of faith may never be falsified. What is correct? In all cases productive doubt, and always: The free exchange of ideas and hypotheses, the disentanglement of politics, morality and science. However foremost: the unconditional freedom of science.”

"Mary Tyler Moore, whose iconic television roles reflected the changing place of women in   America, died on Wednesday, eliciting an outpouring of tributes on social media. Dick Van Dyke, who played Ms. Moore’s husband in the 1960s sitcom “The Dick Van Dyke Show,” said on Twitter that Ms. Moore had changed his life for the better. Other former   and   friends also shared their grief and gratitude online. They included the actors Ed Asner, who played her boss at a local television station in the 1970s sitcom “The Mary Tyler Moore Show,” Ben Stiller and Patricia Arquette, who   with her in the 1996 movie “Flirting With Disaster,” and Michael Keaton, who appeared on her   variety show “Mary. ” Some remembered Ms. Moore as a role model who portrayed strong female characters onscreen. They included Oprah Winfrey, who has said she grew up inspired by Ms. Moore, as well as Ellen Degeneres, Marlee Matlin and George Takei, all of whom described Ms. Moore as a trailblazer. The comedian and actor Stephen Fry said he was rehearsing on Wednesday at the stage where “The Mary Tyler Moore Show” was produced, adding that he and others observed a minute of silence in her honor. Female journalists felt a special affinity for Ms. Moore, who starred in that show as Mary Richards, a news producer at a Minneapolis television station."

The firm has defended this on the grounds that it needs to be sure of their identity as the process cannot be reversed.
Activision Blizzard is behind some of the most popular console, PC and mobile video games, including Call of Duty, Overwatch, World of Warcraft and Candy Crush.
Now some players, who have been unable to wipe their accounts, are threatening to tell their banks to block the company from deducting payments.
Protests began after the firm banned professional video game player, Ng Wai ""Blitzchung"" Chung.
After playing its Hearthstone online card game at a tournament, Blitzchung had called out in Mandarin, ""Liberate Hong Kong, revolution of our age,"" during a live-streamed interview.
The organisers wrote in a statement that the 21-year-old had broken competition rules and would not receive any prize money.
On 8 October, he was told he would not be allowed to compete professionally at Hearthstone for one year.
The hashtag #Blizzardboycott subsequently trended on Twitter.
And since then, the firm has faced a growing backlash from both customers and some employees.
The Daily Beast news site reported that a small group of workers at the company's Los Angeles office staged a walkout in protest.
The matter has also drawn the attention of US politicians.
The row threatens to overshadow one of the firm's biggest releases of the year - its latest Call of Duty console title - which is due to go on sale on 25 October."
"■ President Trump, at a political gathering of congressional Republicans, asks, “Where’s my C. I. A. director?” ■ A new Quinnipiac University poll put President Trump’s approval rating at 36 percent, compared to Barack Obama’s 59 percent in the opening weeks of his presidency. ■ The professional golfer Bernhard Langer released a statement saying he never told President Trump a story of voter fraud that Mr. Trump relayed to congressional leaders. President Trump may be unaware that America’s spy chiefs are not supposed to be creatures of partisan politics. Speaking on Thursday in Philadelphia at an annual retreat for Republican lawmakers, Mr. Trump seemed to think Mike Pompeo, the new director of the Central Intelligence Agency, would be among the senators, representatives and party operatives hooting and hollering in the crowd. “Where is Pompeo? Where the hell is he?” Mr. Trump said, scanning the crowd. The answer, in case Mr. Trump has not yet figured it out: Mr. Pompeo was not in Philadelphia. The C. I. A. like the military, is supposed to be apolitical, and its chief does not have a direct role in creating administration policies. Though Mr. Pompeo has attended the Republican retreat in years past  —   he was a Republican representative before taking over the C. I. A. on Monday  —   it would be considered highly inappropriate for him to take part in his new role running the country’s premier intelligence agency. It was not the first time that Mr. Trump appeared to mix partisan politics and C. I. A business. He accused the C. I. A. ’s previous leadership of playing politics after American intelligence agencies said they believed that Russia tried to help him win the election. Then, on Saturday, he gave a speech at C. I. A. headquarters that was filled with campaign trail rhetoric. The speech was widely criticized by former C. I. A. officials from both Republican and Democratic administrations. But Mr. Trump, in an interview on Wednesday with ABC News, cast the visit to C. I. A. as a highlight of his first days in office. “That speech was a home run,” he said. “I got a standing ovation. In fact, they said it was the biggest standing ovation since Peyton Manning had won the Super Bowl, and they said it was equal. I got a standing ovation. It lasted for a long period of time. ” President Trump, now famously touchy about his approval ratings, is not doing well on that front. A new Quinnipiac University poll put his approval rating among American voters at 36 percent, 33 percent among women. In Quinnipiac’s first poll of Barack Obama’s presidency, Mr. Trump’s predecessor stood at 59 percent. Republican lawmakers who might be considering distancing themselves from their president should consider this: Mr. Trump’s   rating among Republicans is 81 percent to 3 percent. Independent voters are the problem. They are more split, with 45 percent disapproving and 35 percent approving of the job that the president is doing. Gathered with the top leaders of Congress, President Trump on Monday apparently relayed the story in all seriousness: the pro golfer Bernhard Langer had told him a story that really stuck with him. As Mr. Trump relayed it, Mr. Langer had been in line to vote in Florida when he was told by an official that he could not cast a ballot. But people all around him who looked far more suspect  —   Mr. Trump tossed out the names of Latin American countries that the voters might have come from  —   were allowed to draw up provisional ballots. There was a problem with the story: Mr. Langer is a German citizen. But Mr. Langer says he never talked to Mr. Trump, that he was told the story by a friend, then told the story to a friend who told it to someone with ties to the White House  —   who apparently told it to Mr. Trump. He certainly never tried to vote in Florida. So, if the story was important to Mr. Trump’s erroneous belief that millions of illegal immigrants gave Hillary Clinton her 2. 8   win in the popular vote, it was based on   information. There’s a slight problem with President Trump’s Great Wall with Mexico: the Tohono O’odham Nation. The Native American tribe controls about 75 miles of the border of the United States and Mexico that slices through its sovereign territory. Tribal leaders are already saying that the wall is not going to divide its territory. Verlon M. Jose, the Tohono O’odham Nation’s vice chairman, was not subtle when discussing the wall when he spoke in November to Native News Online: “Over my dead body. ” Tribal officials did say they are willing to meet with President Trump to discuss the matter further. As Mr. Jose said: There may be a Gingrich in the Vatican just yet. Callista Gingrich, the wife of Newt Gingrich, the former House speaker and a friend of Mr. Trump’s, is in the running to be ambassador to the Holy See, according to a person briefed on the discussions. Mr. Gingrich, reached by telephone, said that he was aware that his wife had been on a list for the job, but declined to say where things stood. The former speaker took himself out of the running for a cabinet post after it became clear that Mr. Trump was looking elsewhere for a secretary of state. Mr. Trump has known Newt and Callista Gingrich socially for years. They’re members of his golf club in Virginia, and have been at his club,    in Palm Beach, Fla. Mr. Gingrich was one of the people Mr. Trump consulted in 2015 when he had already determined he would run for president. But Mrs. Gingrich is the former speaker’s third wife  —   not something the church takes a shine to. Others who are being considered for the role include William Simon Jr. a friend of Rudolph W. Giuliani. Four senior management officials at the State Department resigned on Wednesday, leaving the department without the top managers charged with running the administrative, consular and foreign mission operations until their successors are in place. “As is standard with every transition, the outgoing administration, in coordination with the incoming one, requested all politically appointed officers submit letters of resignation,” Mark Toner, the department’s acting spokesman, said in a statement, adding: “Of the officers whose resignations were accepted, some will continue in the foreign service in other positions, and others will retire by choice or because they have exceeded the time limits of their grade in service. ” The most senior official to leave is Patrick F. Kennedy, the department’s longtime undersecretary for management, who oversees finances, security, facilities and consular services. But his departure had been expected, in part because of his vigorous defense of   of State Hillary’s Clinton’s handling of the attack on the diplomatic compound in Benghazi, Libya. He also sought the F. B. I. ’s help in downgrading the security classification of an email from Mrs. Clinton’s private server. Rex Tillerson, nominated to be secretary of state, is not expected to be confirmed by the Senate until next week. Nominations for the department’s deputy positions have yet to be announced or submitted. House Speaker Paul D. Ryan and Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the majority leader, said Thursday morning that in spite of President Trump’s perpetual tweet storms, distracting television interviews, occasional lies, and intraparty slights, they are with him on policy. “We are on the same page with the White House,” Mr. Ryan told reporters in Philadelphia, before a visit from Mr. Trump to the congressional Republican’s policy conference. On the list: a costly wall along the border with Mexico, which Mr. Ryan said would be paid for with a supplemental funding request from the White House and existing federal funding to secure the border. Also on the list is a new tax code and a replacement for the Affordable Care Act  —   easy! (Remember, Congress dithered for weeks and months to scrape together aid for the victims of tropical storm Sandy, to combat the Zika virus and to help the   residents of Flint, Mich. while conservatives looked for offsetting spending cuts.) As for Trump’s distractions, the leaders seemed to say that’s his special sideshow. “This is going to be an unconventional presidency,” Mr. Ryan conceded, adding, “that is something we are all going to have to get used to. ” Mr. McConnell also shrugged off questions about Mr. Trump compromising the United States’ relationship with Mexico. “We intend to address the wall issue ourselves, and the president can deal with his relations with other countries on that issue and other issues,” Mr. McConnell said. The Republican chairmen of the House and Senate veterans’ affairs committees dashed off a letter to President Trump Thursday demanding to know whether his executive order freezing federal hiring applied to the Department of Veterans Affairs. Surely you didn’t mean the department under our jurisdiction, suggested Senator Johnny Isakson of Georgia and Representative Phil Roe of Tennessee: Don’t be surprised if more such letters emerge as the hiring freeze starts to bite. In a week in which President Trump is busy unraveling much of Barack Obama’s legacy, the former president was defended from an unusual quarter Thursday morning: Mr. Trump. In an   post on Twitter, Mr. Trump expressed outrage that Chelsea Manning, the former Army intelligence analyst whose sentence for leaking American secrets was commuted by Mr. Obama, had criticized the 44th president for not being strong enough. Even though Mr. Trump repeatedly characterized Mr. Obama the same way during last year’s campaign  —   “weak attitude and pathetic president,” “so weak and so bad,” “he’s been weak, he’s been ineffective”  —   he evidently thought Ms. Manning was ungracious to do so. Mr. Trump seemed to be referring to a column that Ms. Manning wrote in The Guardian newspaper, in which she argued that Mr. Obama left “very few permanent accomplishments” because he was too willing to compromise. The column was largely a criticism of Republicans never giving Mr. Obama a chance, but it suggested that he had not been strong enough to resist them. “The one simple lesson to draw from President Obama’s legacy: Do not start off with a compromise,” Ms. Manning wrote. “They won’t meet you in the middle. Instead, what we need is an unapologetic progressive leader. ” Wonder where Mr. Trump got his idea?"

Humour/Satire



Schools wanting to teach global warming have a great opportunity to integrate many aspects of education into one enjoyable topic. Children today are engaged with the topic of global warming so this provides a tremendous opportunity to educate them. 



The use of [Greta Thunberg ](https://thebfd.co.nz/2019/12/an-open-letter-to-greta-from-philosopher-jason-d-hill/)in the curriculum is a masterstroke. Greta can actually see CO2, so a classroom exercise involving filling a jar with air and asking how many children in the class can see the invisible gas in it, will identify any children with psychiatric disorders that may have not previously been diagnosed.



Greta laments the fact that her childhood has been stolen, so a group exercise could involve asking how many others in the class feel they have had their childhood stolen by global warming. This could lead on to a lesson about other examples of children in history who through famine, war, epidemics, sex exploitation, violence or death have had no childhood. Footage of children slaving in lithium mines to produce batteries for electric cars so that children who have an irrational fear of the climate can get their childhood back, will reassure the children by showing them that others less fortunate than themselves are doing the suffering for them.



Once the children get used to the fact that spoilt, privileged, rich children in developed countries are more the victims than poverty-stricken children in third world countries who are denied basics like power because burning coal is upsetting the rich children, they are then ready to be climate activists like Greta. 



The topic of sea-level rise could involve a trip to the beach but teachers will have to be very careful to ensure the children are not terrified when they see the relentless march of the sea. Perhaps they should go when the tide is going out to reduce the trauma. Drawing a line on the sand where the sea level used to be 100 years ago could involve an exercise in maths and will show the children how catastrophic the 2 or 3-millimeter annual rise has been so far. This may not alarm the children enough so additional lines showing the 100-meter sea level rise that is predicted by next week or whenever will help.



A list showing all the predictions climate scientists have made over the last thirty years or so about the devastating impact of global warming could be matched in a correlation exercise with [how many have actually occurred.](https://thebfd.co.nz/2019/10/climate-emergency-fails-summary/) Discussing the numerous predictions will take a full class day but the second part where the ones that came true are covered should not take very long.



Climate deniers and how to treat them will provide an opportunity to clarify to the children that all the talk about the importance of diversity and inclusivity was just talk and global warming is too important to bother with ideological niceties like that. 



Hate speech and mental illness can be covered by explaining to the children that it is OK for the [Minister of Climate Change](https://thebfd.co.nz/2020/01/the-child-molesters-of-the-mind-pervert-more-nz-children/) to bully people with hate speech by calling them “ **climate deniers** ” because it is really important to put down any people who ask awkward questions you don’t like. The children will be a bit confused about this and that provides a good opportunity to explain that bullying is OK if you are right and that, with regard to global warming, name-calling is a more reliable option than anything scientific. 



History can be covered by listing the many times in history when people thought the world was going to end. The children will no doubt question why it is any different this time from the failed doomsday prophesies of the past, and that is a great opportunity to explain to them that it is different this time because it is only climate change deniers who don’t believe the world is going to end soon and they must be wrong because they are deniers.



Data collection and research can be covered by getting the children to google search the official climate records of the New Zealand Government to find out how many more extreme weather events are occurring now because of the 1 degree of warming we have suffered since pre-industrial times. As long as the children only use official sites, such as NIWA and the Government’s Ministry for the Environment, they will find the 1 degree of warming has caused a decrease in extreme rainfall, flooding, wind and no change in drought. That will confuse them because the Minister for Climate Change says things have gotten worse. This is a good time to warn the children about the prevalence of fake news on the internet, even in official Government climate records, and that unless it supports the narrative of catastrophic global warming, it is fake news. 



Lastly, economics and the existence of gender, age and race discrimination can be covered by explaining to the children that the blame for global warming rests squarely at the feet of capitalism and greed and it is all the fault of old white men. 



In conclusion not only can a lot of important academic topics be covered under the global warming curriculum but, more importantly for children of today, social issues and learning to conform and not to question will be to the fore; which is another benefit of the curriculum because these are the traits that are increasingly valued in our modern society.

"Labor and the Greens will both vote in the Senate to disallow a $3.3m grant to Shine Energy to conduct a feasibility study into a new coal-fired power station in north Queensland. The grant to study the proposed Collinsville plant was promised by the Coalition before the 2019 election. It became controversial after Guardian Australia revealed it was awarded on an ad hoc basis, rather than via a competitive process, despite the project having been rejected by a separate electricity underwriting program.  On Friday, the federal energy and emissions reduction minister, Angus Taylor, revealed he would table the instrument granting the funding in parliament next week, framing the exercise as a test for Labor to “show they support jobs and lower ­power prices in regional Australia”. The Greens told Guardian Australia they would move to disallow it. Labor’s climate spokesman, Mark Butler, denounced the project as a waste of taxpayer money, in a sign Labor would support a disallowance. The Coalition and One Nation, however, have enough Senate votes to block the move, meaning that barring unexpected absences a vote will likely be more symbolic than a major threat to the $3.3m study. Labor has spent much of the week publicly debating the future of fossil fuels, with senior leftwing figures Penny Wong and Tanya Plibersek rebuking shadow agriculture minister Joel Fitzgibbon for speculating the party could split if it does not do more for its blue-collar constituency. But despite differences over the future of emissions reduction policy and the role of gas, Fitzgibbon has acknowledged Australia “won’t have a new coal-fired generator because the market will never build one”. Butler said Labor doesn’t support “any taxpayer funds for new coal-fired power stations”. “Neither does the Queensland LNP,” he told Guardian Australia. “One thing the Queensland Labor government and the Queensland opposition can agree on is this taxpayer-funded project doesn’t stack up. New coal power stations mean higher power prices, the industry has called them ‘uninvestable’, and only the anti-renewables Morrison government is willing to spend money on projects like this.” Butler said Taylor “needs to spend less time wasting taxpayer money on new coal projects that will not deliver cheap power”. He called on the government to “accept Labor’s call for a bipartisan energy policy” and help deliver “real jobs and cheaper power to Queensland and the rest of the country”, through certainty that will deliver renewables. The Greens leader, Adam Bandt, said Labor and the crossbench could combine to “stop $3.3 million of public money being spent on coal and potentially block this climate destroying coal-fired power station from going ahead”. “I can save everyone the money on this feasibility study: we already know that it’s not feasible to open up new coal, oil and gas projects. “Our climate is in crisis, and we simply can’t afford to open up new fossil fuel projects that will put our health, environment, and agricultural industry at risk.” Shine was invited to apply for the grant two days after the government announced it would be the recipient on 8 February. The Department of Industry, Science, Energy and Resources has insisted the process of drawing up “specific grant guidelines” for a one-off grant is “normal practice” but Labor has referred the grant to the auditor general. The Queensland Greens senator, Larissa Waters, said the Shine Energy grant “needs a light shone on it” because it was awarded by “criteria drafted after the fact to justify an already chosen winner”. “Shine Energy has no relevant experience and couldn’t get funding from existing programs, so the government created a new slush fund,” she said. The Australian Conservation Foundation has criticised the project in an August briefing paper, stating there is “no credible evidence a new coal-fired power station is needed to supply electricity in north Queensland or that it would reduce electricity prices as alleged when the grant was announced”. The ACF is concerned Shine Energy “has no prior energy project experience” and that “the guidelines for the funding were developed specifically for Shine Energy”."
"The New Zealand government has set a target of 90% of electricity to be generated by renewable energy by 2050. This submission by a New Zealand Engineer, Bryan Leyland, documents the abysmal performance of wind power projects and  shows there is no chance that this target will be achieved. He also documents the failure of IPCC computer forecasts of global temperature, and the correlation between cosmic rays and temperature. He concludes that the sun drives earth’s climate and National Energy Policy is unnecessary and unachievable. Full submission is here [PDF, 731 KB].

"Humans have been fascinated by the colour-changing abilities of chameleons for a long time. Aristotle himself, the forefather of Western philosophy and also a keen zoologist, mentioned the lizard’s ability in his Historia Animālium, noting that the “change of colour takes place over the whole body,” suggesting the chameleon had a “timorous soul”. The reasons chameleons change colour vary, including in response to temperature and light, and certainly the background-matching behaviour that comes to mind when most think of a chameleon. But a 2008 study of the South African dwarf chameleons provided compelling evidence that evolution has favoured the ability to stand out against one’s background rather than blend in – to impress potential mates, for example. This, coupled with behavioural descriptions of rapid colour change during social interactions, strongly suggests chameleons have evolved their dynamic colour palette as a means of communication. To understand how an animal’s colours can serve as reliable signals to others requires an objective means of quantifying such colours and colour changes. Luckily there have been a number of recent advances in the photographic quantification of colours. Scientists can now use pictures to quantify animal colouration, and use mathematical and physiological models to get an impression of how colours and shades would stimulate an animal’s photoreceptors. In other words we can use photography and computing to measure the colours of animals in the way that animals see them. In a study published in the journal Biology Letters, we used these photographic techniques to quantify the colour and colour changes of chameleons – as seen by chameleons – during aggressive social interactions. Our research focused on contests between adult male veiled chameleons (Chamaeleo calyptratus), a species known for its pugnacious disposition. By filming and photographing the encounters from behind a blind we examined the recordings of each chameleon throughout the trial. The aim was to measure the colour of 28 different body regions in order to uncover if and how the colours were linked to the chameleons’ behaviour. Not knowing whether to focus on the speed of colour change, the amount of colour change, or the final colouration displayed, we measured all three. We found that the lairy lizards most likely to approach their opponents, thereby escalating an encounter, were those that displayed the brightest stripes. This suggests that a male chameleon stepping into a fight may be able to assess just how  keen his opponent is by evaluating the brightness of his opponent’s stripes. What’s more, we also discovered chameleons with more brightly coloured heads whose colours changed more quickly were more likely to win aggressive encounters. So if you, as a chameleon, quarrel with another who reveals an intensely coloured, rapidly changing head – something that should be apparent as he marches directly towards you – then you may have messed with the wrong lizard. But what benefit comes from signalling to your competitor information about your motivation or fighting ability? It seems that by flagging up very brightly its willingness to rumble in the jungle, the chameleon can ensure  aggressive encounters are less costly. Considering a fight could potentially result in serious injury, it’s much better if opponents can be made to back down, without any physical contact being made. This seems to be what is happening with chameleons, where we found that many contests between aggressive chameleons were resolved without any physical fisticuffs. If the information content of chameleon colour signals was perfect, no contests would actually need to escalate into the head-butting, lunging, biting fracas that we regularly observed. This suggests that chameleons can get information from one another based on their colour, but that this information isn’t always 100% reliable – or that they choose to ignore it in a display of rash, headstrong behaviour. Just like humans do, in other words. Humans have devised many and varied means to exchange information with one another, from words to morse code to email. However, as we can frequently influence the behaviour of others from what we communicate, there is sometimes a temptation to misrepresent ourselves, or the truth. Lying can sometimes provide short-term benefits to the liar, but there are frequently large costs in being identified as an unreliable person. These costs exist in the animal kingdom as well, albeit in different forms, and are thought to play a role in the evolution of stable signalling strategies. While our recent work suggests chameleons possess the means to communicate information through their colour changes, we don’t yet understand how these colourful messages are interpreted, how they influence behaviour, and what mechanisms ensure that a chameleon can accurately assess competitors based on external appearance. Time to get back to the chameleons! "
"Opponents of abortion watching the women’s march on their televisions last Saturday stewed as they saw the Planned Parenthood logo over the stage and the actress Scarlett Johansson praising the group for the gynecological care she received as a teenager. But for these viewers, there was an even bigger problem. The women’s march had drawn an estimated   people to Washington, and many more to simultaneous demonstrations around the country, dominating the nation’s news coverage just six days before abortion foes were holding their annual march. Since then, the organizers of that march have been telling their followers: You’d better turn out on Friday. This year’s   march in Washington  —   the 44th annual March for Life  —   was expected to be a celebratory event at which abortion opponents could finally savor a few victories. The new president, Donald J. Trump, is already delivering on his promises to sign a slate of   measures. He has promised to nominate a Supreme Court justice who could overturn Roe v. Wade, the decision that legalized abortion 44 years ago. And a Congress dominated by Republicans is poised to cut funding for Planned Parenthood, the nation’s largest abortion provider. But a new sense of urgency, anxiety and maybe a little envy has accompanied this year’s event, with   organizers suddenly realizing they had a tough act to follow. “We’re definitely pulling out all the stops this year to try to get people to come,” said Amelia Irvine, president of Georgetown Right to Life at Georgetown University in Washington. National organizers of the March for Life said that while they were hopeful of a large turnout on Friday, they did not have any way to gauge how many would attend. This year’s event will have two major draws: Vice President Mike Pence and Kellyanne Conway, who managed Mr. Trump’s campaign and is now a White House counselor, are scheduled to speak. No president or vice president has ever addressed the march in person. Last year, many marchers were deterred by a snowstorm that trapped some buses en route and stranded some marchers in town for days afterward. Organizers said that since so many had to cancel last year, there is   energy this year. One of the largest turnouts was in 2013, the 40th anniversary of Roe v. Wade and the march itself. Some abortion opponents claimed that as many as 650, 000 marchers showed up. But for this and every year, the March for Life organization itself played it conservative, estimating that the marchers numbered in “the tens of thousands. ” “I don’t think that these numbers are the most important,” said Jeanne Mancini, president of the March for Life, in a telephone interview. “The number most important for us is 58 million, which is the number of Americans that have been lost to abortion. ” She said that calls and emails began pouring into March for Life’s offices last Sunday from women who are opposed to abortion and were disturbed to see the strong abortion rights message coming from the stage of the women’s march in Washington. “We are hearing from a lot of women who felt like their voices weren’t represented last weekend,” said Mrs. Mancini, who called in volunteers to handle the deluge. But it is unclear whether that anger will translate into attendance at the March for Life. Though many marchers come to the city by car or train, one gauge of expected attendance  —   bus parking permits  —   suggests the event will be smaller than last weekend’s women’s march. As of Wednesday only 92 permits had been issued for the March for Life, according to Events DC and the city’s Department of Transportation, which handle the permits. Some 1, 800 permits were issued for the women’s march, and 450 for Mr. Trump’s inauguration, the transportation department said. The march has become an increasingly youthful event, attracting busloads of college, high school and middle school students from across the country, many from Catholic and evangelical Christian schools. This year, the University of Notre Dame, the famed Catholic college in Indiana, is sending 700 students on 13 charter buses, one of the largest campus contingents, said Emily Burns, vice president of communications with Notre Dame Right to Life. She said that she and many of her club members shared many of the feminist goals of the women’s march, such as preventing sexual assault and violence against women, and were uncomfortable being seen as in competition with the women’s march. “This definitely is not a competition for us,” Ms. Burns said. “But we are hoping that with the numbers we bring year after year, maybe we receive a bit more coverage this year. ” There is widespread resentment in the   movement that the media has not devoted much coverage to the March for Life in the past, perhaps because it happens every year. This year, a large coalition of   groups have banded together to pressure television and cable networks to devote the same kind of media coverage to the March for Life as they devoted to the women’s march. Still, compared with   supporters, organizers of Friday’s march may have a smaller base of people to draw from. A survey released by the Pew Research Center in October found that 59 percent of Americans said that abortion should be legal in all or most cases, while 37 percent said it should be illegal in all or most cases. Although there were wide gaps between Democrats and Republicans, overall support for legal abortion was at its highest level since 1995, the survey found. At Georgetown University, which is a Catholic and Jesuit college, Ms. Irvine is expecting only 30 to 40 students to attend the March for Life, despite her group’s efforts. Some students who would have wanted to attend could not, she said, because Friday is a class day and the university would not excuse absences from classes or labs to attend the march. The numbers appear far lower than Georgetown’s turnout for the women’s march, said Ms. Irvine: “Our entire school basically went. ” She said it would be unfair to compare the size of the two marches, however, because Washington is a liberal city in which a vast majority of residents voted for Hillary Clinton over Mr. Trump. “I do think there will be comparison,” she said, “but I don’t think it will be an accurate representation of what the public actually thinks. ”"

When I first saw the New Conservative launch in 2018, I panned the idea. “The new conservatives are just as boring as the old” was my response. I didn’t expect to hear much of them ever again, but then something unexpected happened. I got a message from deputy leader **Elliot Ikilei** , who told me that he had read my critically dismissive review, he thought I had some good points, and he wanted to meet up to talk about it. That one simple olive branch changed my life and I know he’s extended many more like it to others. Perhaps enough to alter the course of this nation.



I initially thought the name would be a dud, but in hindsight, it’s very clever. There’s a lot of talk now about a “new conservatism” that’s infused with traditionalism and populism. One of my favourite commentators proclaims daily that “a new conservative age is rising” throughout the world. In that context the party name is perfect.



The final New Conservative meeting for 2019 was in Botany. They ran dozens of meetings up and down the country last year, often attended by over a hundred people. There’s enthusiasm that’s not reflected in the polls. It’s a chicken and egg problem because most prospective voters will only vote for you if they think you’ll win. Despite this, New Conservative is building up a grassroots movement and much of their rhetoric is honed in on fighting the culture war. For me, that’s key.



There were three speakers at that meeting: Leighton Baker, Elliot Ikilei, and Victoria O’Brien.



 **Leighton Baker** , party leader and builder by trade, was far more polished than I expected. He’s got a great stump speech, he was funny, charming, and played the crowd well. Does Leighton Baker have what it takes to storm parliament in 2020? I don’t know, but what I can say is that he brings some normalcy and stability to New Zealand’s conservative politics that has been repeatedly tarnished by weirdos. He’s a brave man to give it a go, and he is most certainly dedicated to restoring the image of New Zealand conservatism. He says that to him it’s all about family and freedom.



 **Elliot Ikilei** , deputy leader, preceded his own speech with a Samoan dance routine. (He told me later it raised a few eyebrows out in the provinces.) Elliot highlights that the two foundational pillars of Greek democracy and Christian morality that underpin civilisation are both under unprecedented attack by our government and the bureaucracy. He exposes the degeneracy taught to children as young as five in government schools and through social programmes. He plays up his own Pacific heritage, throws in a few phrases of Samoan and Maori, and says that western culture is superior to all other cultures as it can be adopted by all ethnicities and transcends all cultures. **That’s a line you won’t hear from any other politician.** “Our civilisation is the greatest ever built”, he says with energy and passion. Those statements would likely have been front-page news if they had been said anywhere outside of a **New Conservative** meeting.



 **Victoria O’Brien** their firearms spokeswoman gave her first speech at this meeting. She was able to demonstrate the importance of the freedom to access information from her own experience of **authoritarianism** in Singapore. She brings a lot of knowledge and credibility to the New Conservative firearms policy, having been an E-endorsement holder at the time the recent amendments started to roll in. Like Leighton and Elliot, she expresses her reluctance for getting into politics, but all three are doing this because someone has to. They’re worried about losing the country they love to the progressive darkness.



The people running New Conservative are not career politicians, lobbyists, or public personalities. They’re just everyday New Zealanders from front-line jobs trying to do what has never been done before: get a fresh party over the 5% electoral threshold. I’ve encountered many who don’t believe they’ll get there— perhaps I don’t really either—but that does not matter to me. There’s no one else for a conservative to vote for.



It’s not all perfect either. Some aspects of the organisation still look slightly amateurish, which is to be expected from a party with no wealthy donors. I’ve complained about the lack of a distinct economic vision, but that’s easy to fix in due time. New Conservative is definitely not a “Christian party”, as some would accuse it of being, but it is based on timeless values and the primacy of the family.



There’s plenty of room to contrast New Conservative with **National** and **ACT.** National is always chasing the elusive “centre vote”. On abortion, they trot out the Clinton line. On climate change, they pretend to believe it because they think it will get votes. On immigration, they just want more cheap labour to prop up the facade of GDP growth. Yes, National has a few conservative electorate MPs, but they wield insignificant power in the party at the moment. The ACT party are as socially progressive as the Greens, they support mild climate change action, and on immigration, it’s a similar story to National. Only New Conservative embraces social conservatism, family values, calls out the climate scam, and has a net-zero immigration policy. Between ACT and NC there is also a great chasm on a philosophical level with **libertarian individualism** pitted against the **conservative focus on the family, morality, and nation.** I’ll tell you what National’s philosophy is once I figure it out.



There’s a bit of common ground between these parties, but unless you’re a single-issue voter who wants your one issue represented in parliament, then that’s not good enough. There’s no point in voting to win a small battle and lose the bigger war. That’s why the question of New Conservative reaching the electoral threshold is irrelevant to me: that issue must be approached as a case of ‘when’ rather than ‘if’.



I understand some of those in the wider conservative demographic who won’t be joining the New Conservative movement. There’s no obligation to support a party if you don’t believe it will follow through on the issues most dear to you or if you’ve lost hope in politics altogether. I still caution anyone from placing their faith in politics or politicians, but the **progressives have accelerated their attempts to silence us.** [My experience over the past year](https://thebfd.co.nz/2020/01/breaking-the-raids-have-begun-all-for-a-22-bunny-gun/) has made it abundantly clear to me, once you get yourself into this game of thrones, you either keep playing it or you end up dead.



There are plenty of signs that point to the viability of a solid right-wing conservative party in New Zealand’s parliament, but there’s a lot of work to be done. No one says it’s going to be easy, but don’t let anyone tell you it’s impossible.



New Conservative NZ is more than a political party, it’s a movement. Politics remains downstream from culture, so a grassroots social movement is core to eventual political action. This is not just about an election, this is about the heart and soul of the land we call home, whether by choice or by birth. Don’t just vote, but focus on developing what matters in your own life, family, and community. Conservatism is about conserving the natural order and the best of our traditions. It’s about preserving our way of life and developing our unique identity among the nations. It’s about stewardship of our natural resources and beautiful landscapes. If you believe that there’s a more conservative, nationalist-populist, and traditionalist future for New Zealand, then please consider joining the movement.

You Ought to Have a Look _is a feature from the Center for the Study of Science posted by Patrick J. Michaels and Paul C. (“Chip”) Knappenberger. While this section will feature all of the areas of interest that we are emphasizing, the prominence of the climate issue is driving a tremendous amount of web traffic. Here we post a few of the best in recent days, along with our color commentary._   
  
__—__   
  
We’ll start out with one of the best quotes we’ve come across in recent memory. It’s from the inimitable Matt Ridley in his piece, ""The Green Scare Problem"" from the _Wall Street Journal_ last week:   




Making dire predictions is what environmental groups do for a living, and it’s a competitive market, so they exaggerate.



Ridley goes on to describe a growingly familiar list of now-failed environmental apocalypses that had been, at one point in time, predicted to befall us—pesticides, ozone hole, acid rain, GMOs, etc. Climate change calamity, as is being pushed by President Obama and the EPA to justify their ever-expanding restrictions of our carbon dioxide emissions, is the latest addition to Ridley’s list. Ridley’s main point is that the “we’re doomed if we don’t do what the environmental pressure groups tell us, and saved if we do” push “has frequently turned out to be really bad advice.” Ridley foresees more of the same from Obama’s Clean Power. We’re inclined to agree.   
  
Be sure to check out Matt’s full column in which he backs up his opinions. It well worth the time spent reading.   
  
When it comes to selling the Clean Power Plan, President Obama and his EPA go to such extreme lengths that they run up against (and often exceed) the bounds of sound science. We’ve addressed many of these transgressions. Climate impact of the Plan? Zilch. Health impacts from the Plan. Non-existent. Economic stimulus of the Plan? Negative. Validity of calling “carbon dioxide emissions” “carbon pollution”? None.   
  
To expand a bit upon the latter, we tracked the historical usage of the phrases “carbon dioxide emissions” and “carbon pollution” in press releases issued by the EPA since 1994. “Carbon dioxide emissions” is the scientifically appropriate description of well, carbon dioxide emissions, while “carbon pollution” is grossly inaccurate and, well, deceptive. Our figure tracks how the EPA has moved away from science and towards propaganda in recent years, no doubt, in concert with the President and his push for limits to carbon dioxide emissions under his Climate Action Plan announced in 2013 (and telegraphed years earlier).

When a straight up telling of the situation fails to impress, try dressing it up with something a bit scarier-sounding.   
  
And finally, if the Obama Administration isn’t going to have its hands full dealing with challenges by states and industries who are opposed to the Clean Power Plan for myriad reasons, it’ll also have to defend itself against a lawsuit from a group of youths who think that the Clean Power Plan doesn’t go far enough:   




They are asking for a court order to force Obama to immediately implement a national plan to decrease atmospheric concentrations of carbon dioxide to 350 parts per million -- a level many scientists agree is the highest safe concentration permissible -- by the end of this century. The concentration of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere has already hit 400 parts per million.   
  
""It's really important that the court step in and do their jobs when there's such intense violation of constitutional rights happening,"" [Julia] Olson [lead council on the case] said.



Nothing like a lawsuit that is suing for the impossible!

"**In recent weeks, mass protests have broken out in countries from Lebanon to Spain to Chile and Bolivia. All are different - with distinct causes, methods and goals - but there are some common themes that connect them.**
While thousands of miles apart, protests have begun for similar reasons in several countries, and some have taken inspiration from each other on how to organise and advance their goals.
Here's a look at the issues at stake - and what binds many of those taking to the streets.
Many of those protesting are people who have long felt shut out of the wealth of their country. In several cases, a rise in prices for key services has proved the final straw.
Demonstrations began in Ecuador last month when the government announced that it was scrapping decades-old fuel subsidies as part of public spending cuts agreed with the International Monetary Fund (IMF). The change led to a sharp rise in petrol prices, which many said they could not afford. Indigenous groups feared that the measure would result in increased costs for public transport and food, and that their rural communities would be hardest hit.
Protesters blocked highways, stormed parliament and clashed with security forces as they demanded an end to austerity and the return of fuel subsidies. The government backed down after days of mass protests and the action came to an end.
Bolivian President Evo Morales, who resigned in November following weeks of protests, introduced public works projects and social programmes to tackle inequality when he took office in 2006. Extreme poverty then stood at 38% and had fallen to 17% by 2018.
However, his critics said that in the past two years levels of extreme poverty in Bolivia had again been on the rise.
A hike in transport prices has also sparked protests in Chile. The government blamed higher energy costs and a weaker currency for its decision to increase bus and metro fares, but protesters said it was just the latest measure to squeeze the poor.
As demonstrators clashed with security forces on Friday evening, President SebastiÃ¡n PiÃ±era was pictured dining in an upmarket Italian restaurant - a sign, some said, of the chasm between Chile's political elite and the people on the streets.
Chile is one of Latin America's wealthiest countries but also one of its most unequal - it has the worst levels of income equality among the 36 member nations of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD).
Like in Ecuador, the government backtracked and suspended its fare hike in an effort to quell the protests. But the protests continued, growing to take in wider grievances.
""This is not a simple protest over the rise of metro fares, this is an outpouring for years of oppression that have hit mainly the poorest,"" one student taking part in the action told Reuters news agency.
Lebanon has seen similar unrest, with plans to tax WhatsApp calls prompting wider protests about economic problems, inequality and corruption.
With debt levels soaring, the government has been trying to implement economic reforms to secure a major aid package from international donors. But many ordinary people say they are suffering under the country's economic policies and that government mismanagement is to blame for their troubles.
""We are not here over the WhatsApp, we are here over everything: over fuel, food, bread, over everything,"" said Abdullah, a protester in Beirut.
Claims of government corruption are at the heart of several of the protests, and are closely linked to the issue of inequality.
In Lebanon, protesters argue that while they are suffering under an economic crisis, the country's leaders have been using their positions of power to enrich themselves, through kickbacks and favourable deals.
""I've seen a lot of things here but I have never seen such a corrupt government in Lebanon,"" said 50-year-old protester Rabab.
The government on Monday approved a package of reforms, including slashing politicians' salaries, in an effort to quell the unrest.
People in Iraq have also been calling for the end of a political system that they say has failed them. One of the main points of contention there is the way government appointments are made on the basis of sectarian or ethnic quotas, instead of on merit.
Demonstrators argue that this has allowed leaders to abuse public funds to reward themselves and their followers, with very little benefit to most citizens.
Protests against alleged government corruption have also taken place in Egypt. The rare demonstrations in September were prompted by a call from Mohamed Ali, an Egyptian businessman living in self-imposed exile in Spain, who accused President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi and the military of corruption.
His allegations that Mr Sisi and his government have been mishandling funds resonated with many Egyptians who have grown increasingly disaffected by austerity measures.
In Bolivia's 2019 presidential election, many voters cited corruption as their biggest concern and blamed Evo Morales for failing to tackle the issue.
In some countries, protesters are angered by political systems in which they feel trapped.
Demonstrations in Hong Kong began this summer over a bill that would have allowed criminal suspects to be extradited to mainland China in certain circumstances. Hong Kong is part of China but its people enjoy special freedoms and there is a deep sense of fear that Beijing wants to exert greater control.
Like fellow protesters in Chile and Lebanon, the mass action in Hong Kong led to the withdrawal of the controversial legislation, but the protests themselves continued. Among their demands, protesters now want complete universal suffrage, an independent inquiry into alleged police brutality and amnesty for demonstrators who have been arrested.
Their tactics have inspired political activists halfway across the world. Hundreds of thousands of people have rallied in Barcelona to express anger over the jailing of Catalan separatist leaders. The separatists were convicted on 14 October of sedition over their role in a 2017 referendum outlawed by the Spanish courts and a subsequent declaration of independence.
Shortly after the sentence was given, people in Barcelona received a message on a popular encrypted messaging service telling them to go to Barcelona's El Prat airport, mimicking a tactic used by Hong Kong protesters.
As they made their way to the airport, a group of youths shouted: ""We're going to do a Hong Kong"", according to local media reports.
Catalan protesters have also been distributing infographics made in Hong Kong that detail how demonstrators can protect themselves from police water cannon and tear gas. ""Now people must be in the streets, all revolts start there, look at Hong Kong,"" one protester in Barcelona told AFP news agency.
In Bolivia, Evo Morales's decision to run for a fourth consecutive term in October angered many voters.
In a 2016 referendum, a majority had voted ""no"" to dropping the limit of term numbers that Bolivians could serve. But Mr Morales's party took the issue to the constitutional court, which abolished the term limits altogether.
Of course, many of the protests that you hear about will have been linked to the environment and climate change. Activists from the Extinction Rebellion movement have been protesting in cities around the world, as they demand urgent action from governments.
The protests have taken place in countries including the US, UK, Germany, Spain, Austria, France and New Zealand. Participants have glued and chained themselves to roads and vehicles, and tried to disrupt busy city centres.
""We have no choice but to rebel until our government declares a climate and ecological emergency and takes the action that is required to save us,"" said Australian activist Jane Morton.
Young people around the world have also been joining weekly school strikes, inspired by 16-year-old Swedish activist Greta Thunberg. Millions last month joined a global climate strike led by schoolchildren, from handfuls of demonstrators on Pacific islands to mass rallies in cities like Melbourne, Mumbai, Berlin and New York.
""We are skipping our lessons to teach you one,"" one sign read.
Earlier this year, Evo Morales faced protests over huge fires which raged in protected eastern areas of Bolivia.
Demonstrators called for him to revoke a decree that authorised ""controlled burning"" to help farmers create bigger plots for crops."
"HAENGCHI VILLAGE, South Korea  —   Each day hundreds of visitors, many with young children, make a pilgrimage to Haengchi Village, where Ban   was born 72 years ago. They wander through a replica of Mr. Ban’s old   house. They learn about his personal journey to the United Nations, where he was secretary general for 10 years. Despite criticism of his tenure there, Mr. Ban is seen as a role model by vast numbers of South Koreans. School textbooks, for example, celebrate him as a “man who made South Korea proud. ” And many South Koreans want Mr. Ban to be their next president, succeeding Park   whom the National Assembly voted to impeach last month on corruption charges. When Mr. Ban arrived home on Jan. 12, crowds of   turned out at the airport, waving flags and shouting, “Ban   please save this country!” Yet there is also deep skepticism about his potential presidential bid, especially among the nation’s progressives. They say he is trying to be part of the establishment yet against it at the same time  —   a “Mr. ” in the words of critics. (The word “ban” in Korean means “half. ”) Mr. Ban calls himself “a child of the United Nations,” part of a generation of South Koreans who remembered United Nations handouts in the destitute years after the   Korean War, as well as   United Nations Forces who fought in the war. Many of his contemporaries view the United States as South Korea’s savior and protector. “I am ready to give my all to uniting the divided country and making South Korea a   nation,” Mr. Ban said. “As United Nations secretary general, I have seen why some nations prosper and why some fail. ” His advocates say he is a seasoned,   diplomat who can best deal with both North Korea’s advancing nuclear weapons program and President Trump, who has raised questions about Washington’s trade and defense commitments to its allies. One of the first things Mr. Ban did after his homecoming was support the deployment of an American missile defense system that has angered North Korea and China. Critics say his place in the establishment makes him unsuitable as a figure who can restore trust in government. They believe the political class has been disgraced by Ms. Park’s corruption scandal and yet is also desperate for a candidate it can support in an election that could take place as early as this spring. The Constitutional Court is expected to rule in the coming weeks whether Ms. Park should be formally unseated. As Mr. Ban crisscrossed the country after his return, paying homage to the dead at national cemeteries and shaking hands with street vendors, his detractors trailed him, holding signs that called him “an opportunist,” or worse. “He has spent his entire life on the sunny side,” said Moon   an opposition leader who comes in ahead of Mr. Ban in surveys on presidential hopefuls. “He is not the kind who shares the people’s desperate desire for change. ” Lee   who served as South Korea’s prime minister when Mr. Ban was its foreign minister from 2004 to 2006, called Mr. Ban “a diplomat who looks twice but does not leap. ” Mr. Ban won his United Nations job 10 years ago with the support of Roh   then the president, a progressive who handpicked him as a candidate. Critics called Mr. Ban a turncoat when he later appeared to align himself closely with conservatives, including Ms. Park. His popularity rating as a presidential contender has plummeted in the wake of Ms. Park’s scandal. Since he has returned home, Mr. Ban has defined himself as a “progressive conservative” who can mend an ideologically fractured country. But some local news media suspect him of   while he tries to find an ally among the existing political parties or to woo enough lawmakers away to form his own. They also call him a “slippery eel,” accusing him of being notoriously vague on tough questions, a trait that has sometimes served him well as a diplomat but now is under harsher scrutiny as he considers a presidential bid. As United Nations secretary general, he praised the deeply unpopular agreement Ms. Park struck with Japan to end a dispute over “comfort women,” or Korean sex slaves for Japan’s World War II army. But as a presidential hopeful, he began raising questions about the deal, saying that an agreement that failed to satisfy the surviving victims was not enough. With his popularity ratings stuck behind Mr. Moon’s, the usually   Mr. Ban began bridling at criticism. When journalists recently dogged him with hard questions and then wrote articles that accused him of being   over the comfort women issue, he called them names. (He later apologized.) He has also called himself a Mr. Clean, responding to the outcry over Ms. Park’s scandal. But to people weary of recurring corruption scandals among political leaders and their families, Mr. Ban’s claim has already lost some of its luster this month, the United States indicted his nephew, who is a New York real estate broker, and his younger brother in South Korea on charges of attempting to pay bribes to facilitate a Korean company’s sale of a   commercial building in Vietnam. Mr. Ban denies involvement. Yet here in his home province of Chungcheong, pride in Mr. Ban is compared to a personality cult by his critics. Streets, marathons and   contests are named after him. Songs are written about him, including one that calls him “Korea’s favorite son who embraced five oceans and six continents. ” In Eumseong, the seat of the county that includes this village, a park displays a circle of bronze busts of Mr. Ban and other former United Nations secretaries general. And this hamlet, which has only a dozen households, is a veritable Ban   theme park. A monument erected by the local Ban clan calls him a “sacred peak of the world” whose “warm smile dissipated international conflicts. ” Visitors stroll around the “Ban   Peace Land,” a small park with a granite monument in the shape of the United Nations headquarters surrounded by flags of member states. In the “Ban   Memorial Hall,” biographical sketches and video clippings tell how Mr. Ban, with his quiet tenacity and “warm charisma,” overcame his humble origin and became the “president of the world. ” “If I sleep now, I may dream, but if I study now, my dream will come true,” goes one of the 19 Ban   sayings in a museum handout. Older villagers remember the young Mr. Ban walking on a dirt road with his eyes fixated on an English textbook. (His English skills gave him his first big break: As a teenager in 1962, he excelled at an   contest, winning a Red   trip to the White House, where he met President John F. Kennedy and resolved to become a diplomat.) A roadside motel here added more rooms because so many newlyweds believed that if their firstborns were conceived with the blessing of the energy of the mountains surrounding the village, they would grow up to be luminaries like Mr. Ban. “I brought my children here so they can learn from Secretary General Ban’s life that there is no easy way in life but that if you try hard, your dream comes true,” said Lee   42, who recently visited here with his daughter and son. Kim   65, a   owner who recently visited Mr. Ban’s birthplace, said Mr. Ban’s “vast experiences and  ” will make him a great president, enabling him to avoid the kind of mistakes that led to Ms. Park’s scandal. “It’s an honor to have him in our country,” he said. But another visitor, Kim   also a Ban fan, feared that Mr. Ban might not survive the thrust and parry of domestic politics. “I wonder why he risks ruining his image by entering domestic politics,” he said. “It’s a mud pit, and he could end up losing all. ”"

Guest Post by Bob Tisdale
In this post, we’re going to discuss one of the three adjustments with the greatest impacts on the new NOAA “pause buster” sea surface temperature dataset. That is, I’m going to discuss and illustrate that NOAA based one of their recent adjustments (the adjustment with the greatest impact during the slowdown in global warming) on the outputs of one climate model…clarification: one obsolete earlier-generation climate model…and that if we examine the consensus of the latest generation of climate models, we see that NOAA may have adjusted away a relationship that the consensus of newer models indicates should exist…assuming that yet another of NOAA’s assumptions is correct.
BACKGROUND 
NOAA revised their global surface temperature product earlier this year to show more global warming during the post-1998 period. Those data manipulations supposedly ended the slowdown in global warming over that period. The changes to NOAA’s global surface temperature product were presented in three studies. The greatest changes were made to the sea surface temperature portion, and those changes were discussed in the papers Huang et al. (2015) and Liu et al. (2015). Those two studies published in February 2015 slipped by the mainstream media, unnoticed. The alarmists, however, did not miss the Karl et al. (2015) paper Possible Artifacts of Data Biases in the Recent Global Warming Hiatus (paywalled, full paper here). While the revisions included changes to the NOAA global surface temperature product since its start in the 1850s, Karl et al. (2015) focused on the periods of 1998 to 2014 and 2000 to 2014…periods during which NOAA had adjusted the sea surface temperature portion to the extent that they claimed the slowdown in global warming never existed.
The claims were misdirection of course, because, even with NOAA’s changes to the surface temperature record, there is still an ever-growing difference between observations and climate model-based predictions of global warming. In other words, the manipulations of the NOAA global surface temperature records decreased the difference between models and data, but those modifications did not eliminate them.
U.S. Congressperson Lamar Smith is the chairman of the House of Representatives Committee on Science, Space and Technology. Like many persons, Representative Smith questions NOAA’s changes to their surface temperature record. Recently, Representative Smith has been formally requesting NOAA emails regarding the changes to the global surface temperature record, and, as of yet, Dr. Kathryn Sullivan of NOAA has not produced those emails. There are a multitude of news articles about the Smith-NOAA dispute, but they are not the subject of this post.
This post discusses the primary adjustment that had the greatest impact on the “pause busting” nature of the new NOAA global sea surface temperature reconstruction. My finding is that NOAA may have adjusted away a difference between ship-based sea surface temperature measurements and night marine air temperature that should exist according to the consensus of the climate models used in the latest IPCC 5th Assessment Report. Once again, this assumes that yet another of NOAA’s assumptions is correct.
ADDITIONAL BACKGROUND: OCEAN SURFACE TEMPERATURE BIAS CORRECTIONS 
Different methods were used to sample sea surface temperatures since the start of the surface temperature record in the mid-1800s: buckets of different materials (wood, canvas, insulated), engine room intakes, and buoys (moored and floating). Additionally, the temperature of the air above ocean surfaces has been recorded aboard ships…a metric called marine air temperature. Each method has its own sampling errors, uncertainties and biases. (For those new to the subject, see Kent et al. (2010) Effects of instrumentation changes on ocean surface temperature measured in situ. It has a detailed and relatively easy-to-understand overview. Also see Kennedy (2014) A review of uncertainty in in situ measurements and data sets of sea-surface temperature. A copy of the submitted paper is here.)
Beginning in the mid-1990s, data suppliers have been accounting for the biases that come from the different types of buckets and from the transition from buckets to ship inlets. Additionally, the ship-buoy bias has also been discussed in papers since the early 2000s. The ocean temperatures sampled from engine-room intakes (ERI) on ships are slightly warmer than the temperatures sampled by buoys. But data suppliers had not attempted to account for the ship-buoy bias until recently because of the large uncertainties of the ship-inlet and buoy temperature measurements and due to the massive uncertainties of the ship-buoy bias. (See Reynolds et al. 2002. Also see Kennedy et al. (2011) Part 1 and Part 2 for documentation of those uncertainties.)
For their new “pause-buster” data, NOAA:

adjusted the ship data using the UKMO HadNMAT2 night marine air temperature data as a reference. This of course assumes the night marine air temperature data vary at the same rates as sea surface temperatures (both day and night).
adjusted the buoy data to account for the difference in temperature between ship inlets and buoys where both exist. The effects of this would vary over the past few decades because the ratio of buoy and ship-based measurements changed with time. There has been an increase in buoy samples and a decrease in ship-based measurements.
weighted the buoy data more than ship data during periods when both ship and buoy data exist. This was done to account for the different accuracies of the ship and buoy temperature measurements…buoy data have been shown to be more accurate than the ship inlet data.

According to Karl et al. (2015) the adjustments to the ship data (based on night marine air temperature data) had the greatest impact on the trends from 2000 to 2014:
Of the 11 improvements in ERSST version 4 (13), the continuation of the ship correction had the largest impact on trends for the 2000-2014 time period, accounting for 0.030°C of the 0.064°C trend difference with version 3b. (The buoy offset correction contributed 0.014°C dec-1 to the difference, and the additional weight given to the buoys because of their greater accuracy contributed 0.012°C dec-1. See supplementary materials for details.)
In this post, we’re going to overlook the ship-buoy bias adjustment and the weighting of buoys and ship inlet data, they’ve been discussed in numerous other blog posts, and we’re going to concentrate on…
NOAA’S ASSUMPTIONS FOR USING NIGHT MARINE AIR TEMPERATURE DATA TO ADJUST SHIP-BASED SEA SURFACE TEMPERATURE MEASUREMENTS
NOAA made numerous assumptions to justify using night marine air temperature data to adjust the ship-based sea surface temperature measurements. They’ve listed them in Huang et al. (2015) paper Extended Reconstructed Sea Surface Temperature Version 4 (ERSST.v4) – Part I: Upgrades and Intercomparisons. There they write on page 919 (where NMAT is night marine air temperature and SST is sea surface temperature):
The bias adjustment for ship SSTs in ERSST.v4 is originally proposed by Smith and Reynolds (2002) and involves using NMAT as a reference. NMAT is selected because the differences from SST are more stable than daytime marine air temperatures, which can have a large range due to solar heating of the ships decks and of the instruments themselves. To formulate the bias adjustment, however, it is necessary to assume that
1) the difference between SST and NMAT is near constant during the climatological period (1971–2000);
2) the climatological difference of SST and NMAT is constant in other periods;
3) the NMAT is less biased (more homogeneous) than the SST data to which it is being compared;
4) the mix of SST measurement methods (bucket or ERI) is invariant across the global oceans, and the spatial pattern of biases follows the climatological difference of SST and NMAT in the modern time (1971–2000); and
5) biases vary relatively slowly and smoothly with time.
We only need to examine the first two of NOAA’s assumptions.
NOAA then went on two describe how they tested their first two assumptions:
To test the first two assumptions, which are assuming broad physical coherence between two highly correlated but physically distinct measurands, the average difference between SST and near-surface air temperature (SAT) of day and night at 2m is calculated by subsampling monthly outputs of the GFDL CM2.1 coupled model with monthly observation masks from 1875 to 2000 (Fig. 4). The model SAT is used since the model bias is assumed to be the same during daytime and nighttime. It is found that the first two assumptions are valid since the model simulations indicate that the difference of SST and SAT is near constant and its linear trend is weak in all four different latitudinal zones (Fig. 4)…
Huang et al. are not very specific about the meaning of “monthly observation masks”. Does it mean that NOAA has masked all grids that do not contain ship data? I suspect that’s the case.
IMPORTANT NOTE: In the following, I have not taken the step of masking the grids without ship data, because I’m attempting to illustrate the global (without polar oceans) climate model-expected relationship between marine air temperature and sea surface temperature. [End note.]
Curiously, NOAA is assuming the modeled relationship between sea surface temperature and marine air temperature (both day and night) is the same as the relationship between night marine air temperature and sea surface temperature, the latter of which includes both day and night measurements. That is, NOAA is using night marine air temperature (not marine air temperature, both day and night) to adjust sea surface temperature, yet they’re presenting modeled sea surface temperatures and marine air temperatures (both day and night) for justification. Is this addressed by “The model SAT is used since the model bias is assumed to be the same during daytime and nighttime”? That seems to be the case.
My Figure 1 is Figure 4 from Huang et al (2015).

Figure 1
First, note that the climate model-based graph in their Figure 1 ends in 2000. That’s odd because we’re very interested in the period of 2000 to 2014. Second, they listed the trends for 1875 to 2000 in the caption for their Figure 4, but they failed to show the trend for their climatological period of 1971 to 2000 (See their assumption 1 above).
Third, and very important, the GFDL CM 2.1 coupled ocean-atmosphere climate model from the NOAA Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory (GFDL) is a curious choice for use in a study in 2015. On the GFDL webpage about the new and improved GFDL CM3 model, they begin:
GFDL’s successful model, CM2.1 (Delworth et al., 2006), was used as the starting point to develop the next-generation CM3 coupled model.
In other words, the 10-year-old GFDL CM 2.1 climate model could be considered obsolete inasmuch as it has been replaced by the GFDL CM3. The GFDL CM 2.1 was supported by Delworth et al. (2006) GFDL’s CM2 Global Coupled Climate Models. Part I: Formulation and Simulation Characteristics. The abstract notes it was used for the IPCC’s 4th assessment report back in 2007.
We know from past experience that there can be wide ranges in the absolute values of surface temperatures from model to model and wide ranges in their trends. NOAA’s use of one earlier-generation climate model could lead anyone to believe NOAA selected (cherry-picked) that single earlier-generation GFDL CM 2.1 climate model because it provided them with the results they wanted.
So let’s take a look at the multi-model mean of all the new-and-improved climate models used by the IPCC for their 5th Assessment Report in 2013. Those models are stored in the CMIP5 archive, and their multi-model mean (along with the outputs of the individual models) are available at the KNMI Climate Explorer. The multi-model mean (the average of the models) basically represents the consensus (the groupthink) of the climate modeling groups on how sea surface temperatures and marine air temperatures (in this example) respond to the climate forcings used to drive the models. Due to the wide ranges of climate model outputs, using the average of all of the models in the CMIP5 archive (the multi-model mean) assures that we cannot be accused of cherry-picking one climate model that supports an agenda. And, to give you an advanced warning, we only need to examine the climate model outputs for the global oceans, excluding the polar oceans (60S-60N); that is we won’t need to examine the additional subdivisions presented in Figure 4 from Huang et al (2015) (my Figure 1).
We’ll start with period of 1875 to 2000 shown in Huang et al. Figure 4. The top graph in Figure 2 presents the modeled difference between the simulated global (60S-60N) sea surface temperatures and marine air temperatures during NOAA’s selected period of 1875 to 2000, with the marine air temperatures (TAS, with land surfaces masked) subtracted from the sea surface temperatures. Over this period, only the historic climate forcings were used by the modeling groups. For NOAA’s selected period of 1875 to 2000, the consensus of the latest generation of climate models show the modeled difference between the global (60S-60N) sea surface and marine air temperatures declining at a rate of -0.008 deg C/decade…exactly the same as the -0.008 deg C/decade (-0.08 deg C/century) claimed by NOAA for the period of 1875-2000. That would appear at first to confirm the results of Huang et al. (2025)  (2015). The bottom graph in Figure 2 illustrates, for the same timeframe, the multi-model mean of the simulated sea surface temperatures and marine air temperatures, which serve as the bases for the top graph. I’ve included the model outputs for 2000 to 2014 (dashed curves) in both graphs as a reference as well.

Figure 2
Note, however, in the top graph of Figure 2 there is a noticeable change in trend starting in the mid-1970s, with a sharp decline thereafter.
So let’s examine the trend for NOAA’s climatological period of 1971 to 2000. See Figure 3. For NOAA’s climatological period of 1971 to 2000, the consensus of the latest generation of climate models show the modeled difference between the global (60S-60N) sea surface and marine air temperatures declining at an increased rate of -0.021 deg C/decade…far greater than the -0.008 deg C/decade (-0.08 deg C/century) claimed by NOAA for the period of 1875-2000.

Figure 3
Referring to the bottom graph of Figure 3, the modeled marine air temperatures are warming slightly faster than the modeled sea surface temperatures over NOAA’s climatological period. In other words, the consensus of the new-and-improved climate models contradicts the NOAA (Huang et al. 2015) finding about their first assumption for using marine air temperatures to adjust the biases in sea surface temperatures measured from ships…or any sea surface temperature data.
But we’re really not interested in the period of 1971 to 2000. We’re more interested in the period of 2000 to 2014, because it was the period NOAA (Karl et al. 2015) used for their claim, “the continuation of the ship correction had the largest impact on trends for the 2000-2014 time period, accounting for 0.030°C of the 0.064°C trend difference with version 3b.”
Figure 4 is similar to Figures 2 and 3, but in Figure 4 we’re illustrating the model results for the period of 2000 to 2014. The only difference is, these models now the models also include projected forcings, in addition to historic forcings. The transition from historic to projected forcings occurs at 2005/2006 in most models. (It’s not a feature I selected.) But I did select the RCP6.0 forcing scenario, because I did not want to be accused of cherry-picking the worst-case RCP8.5 scenario.
Not too surprisingly, in the top graph of Figure 4, the multi-model mean (the consensus) of the new-and-improved climate models shows a drop in the temperature difference between the sea surface temperatures and marine air temperatures. In fact, the -0.027 deg C/decade trend of the modeled temperature difference is comparable to the 0.030 deg C/decade adjustment NOAA made (using night marine air temperatures) to the ship data for the period of 2000 to 2014.

Figure 4
That is, using the newer models, the consensus (the groupthink) of the modeling groups expects that marine air would warm faster than the surfaces of the oceans for 2000 to 2014…at a rate that is comparable to the “correction” applied to the ship data using night marine air temperature. This invalidates the second of NOAA’s assumptions that “the climatological difference of SST and NMAT is constant in other periods”. It clearly is not.
Simply put, NOAA appears to have adjusted out a difference between ship temperature measurements and night marine air temperature that should exist according to the consensus of the newer climate models. That assumes that NOAA’s other grand assumption…“The model SAT is used since the model bias is assumed to be the same during daytime and nighttime”…is correct.
Let’s put that into perspective. NOAA appears to have assumed that night marine air temperatures warmed at the same rate as marine air temperature (day and night). They used marine air temperatures in place of night marine air temperatures to verify their first two assumptions. Also consider that the consensus of the latest generation of climate models indicate that marine air temperatures should be warming at a higher rate than sea surface temperatures since about the mid-1970s. Yet, taking those considerations into account, NOAA’s end product, their new “pause-buster” ERSST.v4 data, shows the opposite relationship. Their new sea surface temperature data show a noticeably higher warming rate than the night marine air temperature data (HadNMAT2) they used as a reference. See Figure 5, which is Figure 1 from the post Open Letter to Tom Karl of NOAA/NCEI Regarding “Hiatus Busting” Paper.

Figure 5
Note: That graph ends in 2010 because the HadNMAT2 data end then. That of course raises the question: how does NOAA (unjustifiably) adjust the ship data after 2010? [End note.]
Bottom line: according to the latest generation of climate models, marine air temperature should warm faster than sea surface temperatures, but not in NOAA’s much-tinkered-with world.
CLOSING
Again, my illustrations show the expected global (60S-60N) relationships between marine air temperatures (day and night) and sea surface temperatures because NOAA used them to verify a relationship between night marine air temperatures and sea surface temperatures.
Also, I have not masked the model results so that they only include the grids with ship-based sea surface temperatures, as NOAA appears to have done. But, according to the consensus of the climate models used by the IPCC for their 5th Assessment Report, the expected relationship globally (60S-60N) is that Marine Air Temperature has warmed faster than Sea Surface Temperatures since the mid-1970s.
I suspect, when Congressman Lamar Smith’s whistleblowers are concerned about rushing the Karl et al. (2015) study “before appropriate reviews of the underlying science and new methodologies used”, they’re discussing:

the uncertainties of the bias adjustments,
the uncertainties of the data,
of course the basic methodologies, including how NOAA distributed those adjustments around the oceans, and
most importantly, for the “underlying science”, how NOAA appears to have adjusted out a difference between ship temperature measurements and night marine air temperature that should exist according to the consensus of the newer climate models—once again assuming that NOAA’s other grand assumption…“The model SAT is used since the model bias is assumed to be the same during daytime and nighttime”…is correct.

Maybe, in time, Dr. Sullivan of NOAA will produce the emails requested by Representative Smith so that we can confirm my suspicions and the suspicions of many others.

Director, Australian Family Coalition



Earlier this week a 21-year-old university student from Queensland [took his own life.](https://thebfd.co.nz/2020/01/wilson-gavin-is-a-hero-but-just-hours-after-his-death-tolerant-progressives-still-arent-done-vilifying-him/)



Wilson Gavin was a young same-sex attracted man who didn’t fit the expected narrative. A pro-life and pro-family activist, Wilson was vocal in his defence of life, marriage and family. He was also a devout man of faith.



By all accounts, Wilson was a kind-hearted soul who spent a great deal of his time helping the less fortunate and trying to leave this place better than he found it.



His death came soon after he participated in a student protest against an instance of [“drag queen story time”](https://thebfd.co.nz/2020/01/rainbow-activists-bully-gay-man-to-suicide/) for children in a public library.



Footage and coverage of the protest was circulated online, and Wilson soon became the target of shocking vitriol. Sadly, trolling and hatred are commonplace on social media, especially in forums like Twitter.



I’ve received unsolicited hate mail and threats myself, particularly during 2017’s marriage debate. I’ve also been “doxxed” (that is, had my family’s home address shared online).



But my experiences pale in comparison with the size, speed and ferocity of the avalanche of hate Wilson suffered.



And let’s not forget: the target was a 21-year-old student.



What can we say about a society where people think it’s OK to bully a young person – indeed, anyone! – to the point of suicide?



At the very least, it’s sick. In certain quarters, it’s toxic.



Even after his death, the attacks on Wilson haven’t ceased. Some are even seeking to gain mileage out of it, implying that the death of a same-sex attracted man spells out the need for continued Rainbow activism and for “anti-bullying” programs such as “Safe Schools”.



I don’t believe I ever met Wilson, although he interacted with AFC on Facebook on numerous occasions.



I’m sorry I will never have the chance now. He sounded upbeat, dedicated and amiable – someone unafraid to speak up for the things he cared about. What a tragedy that his life ended so early.



And how sad that many people will be too scared to share their views in future for fear of reprisals.



And that’s a point I’d like to reflect on.



Many people are afraid to share their views.



People feel the need to hide or water down their beliefs for all sorts of reasons: professional security, harmony with family and friends, or simply not wanting to be pigeonholed as a “bigot”, a “hater”, etc.



That’s why we need to do more to support and look out for each other.



Not so long ago, the idea of drag queens reading books to children in libraries would have been unthinkable. Now, we have to defend our position.



Let that sink in for a minute. It’s crazy, but it’s true.



In such a climate, it’s incumbent upon us to lift each other up – to assure each other that it’s OK to believe in radical ideas like family, faith and freedom.



Maybe you might even make a point of reaching out to someone after reading this email?



If you would like to read more about Wilson Gavin, you might be interested in [this article](https://www.lifesitenews.com/news/friends-remember-hero-student-found-dead-after-protest-against-drag-queen-event-for-kids).



And this [heartfelt statement](https://www.brisbanetimes.com.au/national/queensland/a-message-from-wilson-gavin-s-family-20200116-p53s13.html) has been issued by his family.



I’m at a loss for words in trying to summarise this incredibly sad story. 



I can only hope that some good comes from it.

Guest essay by Uli Weber, Geophysicist, Germany
Since the G7-summit at Elmau Castle (2015) and the climate summit COP21 in Paris (2015) the declared political aim of all governments of the world is a global decarbonisation until the year 2100 to save our planet from anthropogenic global warming (AGW). The AGW-paradigm is allegedly supported by 97% of all climate scientists worldwide and global decarbonisation has even been recommended by religious leaders.
And recently, on the 22nd of April 2016, representatives from about 170 nations officially signed the Paris Climate Convention for global decarbonisation at the United Nations in New York.
But are we really been forced by future anthropogenic global warming to ruin our life-standards through such a complete disruption of our present technological basis?
Mainstream climate sciences held carbon dioxide (CO2) from the industrial use of fossil energies responsible to amplify the natural greenhouse effect until the earth becomes uninhabitable. Legions of AGW-protagonists worldwide, paid with billions of dollars from official scientific funds, private foundations, and environmental NGOs promote the public perception of an anthropogenic climate warming and call their AGW-Paradigm to be “settled science”. Furthermore, these protagonists claim “the debate is over” for their paradigm in an adverse interpretation of the true spirit of sciences and become supported by a biased majority of the public media.
Unprofitable scientific arts from outside climate sciences push themselves next to the meat-pots of climate-alarm with a rising number of papers from psychologists and historians which criticise the heretical influence from a scientific minority, slandered as “climate-deniers”, on the public recognition of AGW arguments. Recently, some climate active politicians even aim to silence “climate deniers” by trying to criminalize their scientific standpoint. Such independent climate scientists with diverging scientific results on global warming are performing their scientific work mainly with poor budgets or even on a free voluntary basis. And instead of a fair and open scientific debate about their arguments they usually become publicly denounced in their personal credibility while mainstream climate sciences try to exorcize them from the scientific community.
It seems today that the moral of sciences has become progressively infected from its well-paid trustees and their political and medial supporters by the virus of noble cause corruption aiming for a better carbon-free world in future.
Facing such aimed global decarbonisation to happen we may not forget that through the cultural evolution of mankind the available energy per capita has been repeatedly multiplied and has improved the standards of living for us all:

Stone Age (= small local villages): Available energy per capita was about the 3-6-fold of the basic human need.
Times of Agriculture (= advanced regional civilisations): Available energy per capita was about the 18-24-fold of the basic human need.
Industrial Times (= networked global city): Available energy per capita is about the 70-80-fold of the basic human need.

The industrial use of fossil energies since begin of industrialisation has sustainable increased the public health, our individual life expectancy, our common life standards, the general quality and availability of food, the public and individual transport, communications, and the affordable technologies for everyone.
That means our recent civilisation is existentially dependent on technologies fed by fossil fuels.
The basic principle of anthropogenic global warming could be easily understood by everyone without any scientific education:
The higher the atmospheric CO2 content rises the more will the global mean temperature increase.
Consequently, it is believed by an overwhelming majority of citizens in the industry nations that mankind’s consumption of fossil energies will cause anthropogenic global warming through the emission of CO2.

But is the feared relationship between CO2 and global warming really settled science? 
The AGW-paradigm stands in fundamental contradiction to several scientific and economic facts:

Missing reversibility of climate models: Computer models for the future climate progression are not even capable to simulate the natural climate backward to the beginning of systematic temperature records about the year 1850. This inherent imperfection of recent climate models proves that neither all parameters which influence our climate, nor their effective magnitude, nor their factual interaction are correctly implemented in the climate computer models. With these imperfect models climate sciences calculate the course of global temperatures far into future while politicians anchor their arguments for a global decarbonisation on such results.
Climate sciences are incapable to separate the drivers of climate change: No quantitative separation between the factual contributions of natural and anthropogenic drivers to global climate forcing has been published to date. The measurements of global temperature data started around the year 1850, at the end of the historical “Little Ice Age” and begin of industrialisation. There must have been a natural rise of temperatures since then because this “Little Ice Age” has ended without manmade contributions. But in contrary, climate sciences account the whole temperature rise since on AGW with the argument of early industrialisation, although the rise of temperature was much faster than the global course of industrial development.
Climate models ignore the influence of the natural solar cycles on global climate. The known solar cycles (Schwabe, Hale, Yoshimura, Gleißberg, Seuss-de-Vries, Dansgaard-Oeschger, and Hallstatt) with periodicities between 11 and more than 2.000 years are not included in future climate models. Argument is the small absolute variation of solar forcing through such cycles although these variations were definitely the only source for natural climate changes in our recent climate optimum before industrialisation. The finding of Svensmark, the nucleation of clouds from cosmic rays which are controlled by the magnetic field of the sun, is still ignored by mainstream climate sciences. This effect acts as a natural atmospheric amplifier for the variations of solar forcing through a reverse variance of the Earth’s albedo from the global cloud coverage, i.e. a weak sun causes more clouds and conclusively additional cooling. The CLOUD-Experiment at the Zurich CERN Institute has disproved the aerosol formation in present climate models by a factor of one‐tenth to one‐thousandth and found an enhanced nucleation from the Svensmark-effect up to a factor of 10. http://press.web.cern.ch.pdf Last access dated May 13th, 2012
The well documented historical Medieval Warm Period (MWP) which preceded the “Little Ice Age” has been suppressed by the “hockeystick-curve” from Mann et al. in the IPCC TAR (report 2001), apparently to promote the AGW-Paradigm of a constant natural pre-industrial climate at “Little Ice Age”-average global temperatures. Since then, the “hockeystick” has been disproved while it’s still used as an important argument for AGW and the MWP was downgraded to a regional European phenomenon to comply further with the AGW-Paradigm. But in contrary, the analysis of hundreds of scientific papers worldwide by Luning and Vahrenholt proves that the Medieval Warm Period has truly been a global occurrence caused by natural solar variations and consequently questions the AGW-Paradigm vitally. Online atlas by Luning/Vahrenholt: kaltesonne.de/mapping-warm-period/


Climate sciences deny the natural orbital cycles in their climate models and try to defend their simple linear relation between global temperature and atmospheric carbon dioxide. Recently, AGW protagonists reduce their view on the past climate succession even further to the second half of the 20th century and try to establish CO2 as the main paleoclimate driver. Already in the year 1924 Wladimir Köppen and Alfred Wegener, the discoverer of modern plate-tectonics, have published the scientific proof that the paleoclimate variability of the past hundred thousands of years is directly related to the orbital Milanković cycles. Reprint “Die Klimate der geologischen Vorzeit” (Bornträger 1924) with an English translation: https://www.schweizerbart.deDE
Growing acidification of the oceans caused by anthropogenic CO2-emissions is feared to reduce the richness of marine species in future. Firstly, a specific quantity of CO2 could either act as climate active gas on global warming or could cause acidification being resolved in the ocean, not both at the same time. But usually, both effects are calculated with the maximum amount of anthropogenic CO2-emissions. Secondly, the maximum possible amount of dissolved CO2 is reversely proportional to the water temperature. Consequently, the warmer the water becomes the less CO2 could be resolved in the oceans and cause acidification. The delayed rise of the atmospheric CO2 content from increasing paleoclimate temperatures supports this causal relationship and is proven by ice-core analyses.
A global sea-level rise from melting glaciers caused by AGW shall flood the Pacific islands and drown lowlands and harbour cities all over the world. A dramatic retreat of glaciers causing a sea-level rise of about hundred meters is a natural phenomenon at begin of interglacial warm times. It seems that marine ice masses are completely controlled by the sea-water temperature while terrestrial ice masses are bound to vertical variations of the global climatic zones. As temperatures are not constant within interglacial warm periods, the lower margin of terrestrial glaciers uses to fluctuate uphill when it becomes warmer and downhill when it becomes cold. Retreating glaciers often release ancient trees which are proving that their margins have been located far uphill in historic times. What we could recently observe at Greenland and the Antarctic Peninsula is a glacier retreat to higher altitudes and not a complete melting while at the same time the ice masses of East Antarctica are still growing further. Alarming satellite altimeter data for the sea-level rise of the open ocean are much more prone to errors from an exact correction of the local lunar tides, the local contribution of permanent water circulations, additional water masses driven by wind and local wave heights, and the actual local air pressure than the data from fixed costal gauges.     The usual coastal sea level gauge records show a global sea-level rise at a constant rate since Little Ice Age times without any AGW contribution and will probably continue to do so – if no purposeful corrections were applied in future…
The “hiatus” of the global mean temperature rise, lasting about twenty years now, has already caused multiple adjustments of the original historic temperature data. Updated climate models use then to transfer the “missing heat” into the deeper layers of the oceans. Obviously, digital climate models couldn’t foresee the actual “hiatus” of the global mean temperature rise. But instead of improving actual climate models by altering their false initial conditions to comply with the factual measured climate succession, these climate models are permanently adjusted in their results to meet the outmoded earlier published climate forecasts. Questions remains how that missing heat could escape to deeper ocean layers without been recognized by the ARGO buoy network which is globally distributed over the oceans.
Mainstream climate sciences restrict the effect of future global warming to the negative spectrum of their computer speculations and spread scientific horror scenarios about a manmade future global warming of about three degrees centigrade until the year 2100 into the public attention while every winter ten thousands of people die from cold. For the year 2014 about 40.000 winter deaths in Europe have been reported because people couldn’t pay their bills for electrical power.   http://www.focus.de/immobilien/energiesparen/energie-die-grosse-stromluege-warum-strom-zum-luxus-wird_id_5388458.html?fbc=fb-shares Last access dated April 9th, 2016
Climate sciences claim that global decarbonisation follows the precautionary principle for the future of all mankind in avoiding AGW. The last major climate prophecy was published just in time before the COP21 Paris summit by well pampered minions of the Apocalypse: Anthropogenic CO2-emissions will prevent the next ice-age to happen – in 50.000 years! Is it truly the precautionary principle to save an endangered ice-age in 50.000 years from now? No, it’s genuine science-fiction when mainstream climate sciences ignore solid geo-scientific knowledge from some hundred thousand years of paleoclimate succession and extrapolate a lost ice-age in 50.000 years from their reduced retrospective of a few past decades. With the provision to save the world from its natural climate succession we are devastating our present economies and the future of our children and grandchildren. But what’s about the real global hazards that may endanger mankind’s future within the next 50.000 years, what’s about super-volcano eruptions, asteroid strikes, and the decline of the geo-magnetic field, what is the precautionary principle against these realistic threads?
Renewable energies from sunlight and wind shall replace energy generated from oil, gas, and coal to avoid AGW through CO2 emissions. Recently, renewable energies could only be produced at uneconomic costs with huge subventions directly raised from the majority of consumers and hence indirectly generated from fossil-fed industrial production. To preserve our common standards of living and technology through a future global decarbonisation the required global energy amount must be fully replaced from renewable sources. There are numbers circulating in the media that global decarbonisation is affordable and executable until the year 2100. But the published investments to establish a complete renewable energy production do not even include the costs for the indispensable energy storages and new distribution networks to guaranty the energy supply through nights and windless times nor do they include the rising energy costs for almost every product to be supplied in future. From such rising costs at presumably decreasing production numbers national economies may suffer with less income for employees or even less employees at all. Question remains how the rising subventions for renewable energy shall be paid from decreasing industrial productivity.
The landscape consumption in natural environments for renewable energy production from sunlight and wind is thousand to ten thousand times greater than the areal demand of equal productive conventional power plants. Question must be raised then what will happen through a future decarbonisation to our global natural resources.
At the same time pressure is made on our industrial-scale agriculture to deteriorate to organic production without chemical fertilizers. Agricultural food production stands in competition with the land consumption for renewable energies. Through the ecological food-to-fuel program, i.e. the use of ethanol as a renewable fuel for cars, the effective agricultural acreage for global food production has already been decreased while millions of people worldwide still suffer from undernutrition and hunger. Consequently, the aimed global organic food production with a reduced per acreage productivity of farmland may not meet the demand of a further growing world population…

This synopsis provides evidence that the theory of Anthropogenic Global Warming has been built on failed scientific assumptions and economic speculations.
Nevertheless, the prophets of AGW are still spreading their speculations of doom further like an anthropogenic mass madness promoting a wide bunch of divergent objectives against our present economic system which is based on the availability of affordable energy from fossil fuels. The deep religious belief in AGW remains their ultimate tool to destroy our present technical civilisation and to misdirect mankind into a brave new carbon-free world.
We are living now in a next age of cultural evolution, the Anthropocene, where the fundamental differences between scientific facts, personal opinions and religious faiths have become successively blurred while sated people seem truly believe one can slaughter the cow and still drink the milk.
The true global problem of mankind remains the steady increase of the world’s population and its supply with sufficient food and energy as well as the preservation of the global natural resources which are a heritage of us all. 
Poverty in the Third World is basically caused by a lack of energy and democratic participation.
The only way out of this dilemma is a democratisation and economic development of the poor countries which would not be possible without fossil energies. Such development would prevent the world population to grow further as proven by the standstill of population growth in the industry nations since begin of industrialisation. Through a development process of the Third World the fossil energy consumption in the industry nations may be minimized at recent standards of living while the protection of the world’s natural resources could be successively improved.
But with their religious belief in AGW the elected and unelected political leaders all over the world, supported by fortune tellers from climate sciences, by biased mainstream media, by faithful heads of religions, and by misguided ecological NGOs and Malthusian foundations, have now decided that mankind shall take quite the opposite direction. Their roadmap into the urgently demanded global decarbonisation until the year 2100 may then cause a fall of democratic rights in the industry nations on the way into a sustainable global energy shortage with Malthusian perspectives for an agricultural Global Third World of organic smallholders. Or, to say it more clearly, in a carbon free world the majority of people worldwide, whatever their absolute number will be then, may work twelve hours a day in organic agriculture to produce one fourth of the present available energy per capita – just as it was in the good old pre-industrial times.
And now, on this eve of destruction, the majority of affected people stands silent aside while the apocalyptical riders of global decarbonisation are going to wreck the future of all mankind …

The Cato Institute today released a comprehensive report which details information missing from a 2009 report used by the Environmental Protection Agency in regulating carbon dioxide emissions.



""After thorough review, I found that the report from the U.S Global Change Research Program (USGCRP), which served as the source for the scientific opinions underlying the original endangerment finding in 2009, is unrepresentative of the larger body of scientific research on the topic of anthropogenic climate change and its potential impacts on the United States,"" said Cato Senior Fellow Patrick J. Michaels. ""Since the new EPA standards would essentially price anyone trying to build a new coal plant out of the market, I am not surprised that we won't see final regulations on carbon dioxide until after the election.""



Michaels, working with a team of experts and scientists, assembled an addendum to the USGCRP report, which they submitted as comments to the EPA on June 22.



""Calling this an 'addendum' is a tongue-in-cheek jab at the substantial relevant science the authors of the USCGRP report left on the cutting room floor while crafting their version,"" said Michaels. ""We came up with the idea when we noticed that literally every paragraph in their report is missing critical information. Our report adds much additional information on how climate change impacts the United States, using a more exhaustive survey of peer-reviewed science than the USGCRP relied upon.""





Michaels noted that no static report can provide long-term guidance as to the nature of climate change and its impacts, as this field is constantly evolving under the weight of new scientific findings. Consequently, he said, it is imperative that the EPA reassess the current scientific understanding on at least an annual basis.



In June, the DC Court of Appeals ruled in favor of the Obama Administration by rejecting challenges to the EPA's rules concerning carbon dioxide emissions from cars and light trucks. The EPA was expected to finalize regulations regarding carbon dioxide emissions from coal-fired plants by the end of this year, but has deferred that decision until March 2013.

"There isn’t any evidence to support President Trump’s assertion that three to five million illegal votes were cast in the 2016 presidential election. But there is one study that has been interpreted to suggest it is at least possible. It found that between 32, 000 and 2. 8 million noncitizen voters might have fraudulently cast ballots in the 2008 presidential election. The study, based on a survey of 38, 000 people after that election, has been under fire since it was published in 2014. Now even its authors concede that it probably overstated the amount of noncitizen voting. “The   estimates are likely incorrect,” Jesse Richman, one of the   of the study and a political science professor at Old Dominion University, said in an email exchange on Wednesday. In a post online, he also said that the findings do not support Mr. Trump’s contention that millions cast ballots illegally. Mr. Richman still maintains that some small percentage of noncitizens vote in American elections. But the debate over this study has moved on. It’s no longer about whether millions of illegal votes were cast, but whether there’s any evidence for noncitizen voting at all. The study’s bold claims fell apart because of something called response error: the possibility that people taking a survey don’t answer a question correctly  —   in this case, a question about being American citizens. There is always a tiny amount of response error in surveys. Respondents might not understand the question. Or they might understand it, but mark the wrong answer by mistake, if the survey is  . An interviewer, if there is one, could accidentally record the wrong answer. Such errors usually aren’t a problem large enough to change the results of a survey. But both the survey and the question posed by researchers were unusual. The survey  —   the Cooperative Congressional Election Study  —   was huge, with 38, 000 respondents in 2008. And the group in question  —   noncitizens  —   was very small, just 339 of those respondents. The problem is that even a tiny amount of response error among the 38, 000 respondents could have been enough to contaminate the results of the tiny group of noncitizens. Imagine, for instance, that 99. 9 percent of people respond to the survey’s citizenship question correctly. In such a big survey, even that high success rate would still imply that there were 38 respondents who answered incorrectly  —   enough to make up a big chunk of the tiny pool of 339 noncitizen respondents. If those 38 misreported noncitizens had indeed voted, then suddenly it would look as if 10 percent of noncitizens voted. This critique could explain all of the noncitizen voting observed in the study. Critics of the study  —   Stephen Ansolabehere, a Harvard political scientist, Samantha Luks, a statistician at YouGov, and Brian  Schaffner, a political scientist at the University of Massachusetts Amherst  —   were able to marshal evidence strongly consistent with that possibility, because of the survey’s unusual design: Thousands of voters are   in subsequent elections. That allowed the study’s critics to check whether people were consistent about their answer on the citizenship answer from year to year. If the people were consistent, they were probably noncitizens. If voters were inconsistent, it would be a sign that the category was contaminated by the tiny number of voters who misreported their citizenship. There was not much consistency. Between 2010 and 2012, 20 voters switched from being citizens to noncitizens (an extremely unlikely transition) and 36 others switched from noncitizens to citizens (a more common transition, but one reported at a far greater rate than typically occurs). These shifting answers strongly bolster the theory that many of the respondents logged as noncitizens had responded in error. But most important, among the 85 respondents who said they were noncitizens in both 2010 and 2012  —   those most likely to really be noncitizens  —   none had voted in the 2010 midterm elections. The critics concluded that “the likely percent of noncitizen voters in recent U. S. elections is 0. ” In a response published in October, Mr. Richman and his colleagues did not contest the finding that measurement error probably exaggerated the number of noncitizen voters. “The response error issues they focus on may have biased our numbers,” Mr. Richman said in an email to The New York Times on Wednesday. Mr. Richman and his colleagues have not estimated a new range of possible noncitizen voting. Instead, the October response sought only to rebut the notion that there was no noncitizen voting. They argued that measurement error couldn’t explain all of the people who said they were noncitizens and voted. When it came to hard evidence immune to the measurement error critique, Mr. Richman and his   found one validated 2012 voter who had indicated not being a citizen in both the 2010 and 2012 surveys. But the same noncitizen had indicated in the survey that he or she was not registered to vote. The determination that he or she was a voter was based on voter records: The respondents to the survey were matched to a voter registration file. It is possible that this noncitizen was erroneously matched to the voter file. The matching process is good but imperfect, and becomes harder with less information  —   like the absence of a specific address or date of birth. That the respondent said he or she wasn’t registered certainly raises the possibility that the match was wrong. “I haven’t seen any evidence that I would say shows that any noncitizens vote,” Mr. Schaffner said. “That doesn’t mean that the rate is exactly zero. But it does mean that it’s   frequency that we can’t even measure it with traditional methods. ”"

This story has legs now, as I predicted in this piece yesterday “The ‘RICO 20 letter’ to Obama asking for prosecution of climate skeptics disappears from Shukla’s IGES website amid financial concerns” the Streisand Effect has been unleashed. Now, instead of explaining why the RICO 20 letter was mysteriously withdrawn from the IGES website after questions began to be asked about the millions of dollars that George Mason’s Jagadish Shukla apparently has received, some of it while apparently “double dipping” against university policy, all the while claiming climate skeptics are the recipients of money that should be prosecuted under the RICO act, we find this curious missive posted in place of the RICO20 letter at the URL where it previously resided:

Source: http://www.iges.org/letter/LetterPresidentAG.pdf
“Inadvertently placed on this web site”? I think not, especially since that URL was the “go to” given in their press release about the letter and referenced in numerous news outlets, without so much as a peep of a correction for over a month while that story ran wild. All of the sudden it was posted in the wrong place?
I call that explanation “BS of the highest order”. He got caught with his pants down, tables have turned, and now its damage control, and badly done damage control at that, since the actions are making the situation with Shukla even more suspect.
Then there’s the apparent nepotism going on with all that public money used to fund Shukla’s climate dreams:
IGES Personnel:
President Shukla, Jagadish
Business Manager Shukla, Anastasia
Assistant Business Manager Shukla, Sonia
Director, COLA Kinter, James
Assistant to the President Shukla, Sonia
Source: http://www.iges.org/aboutiges.html
And, Steve McIntyre had called out one of the signatories, Barry Klinger, over untrue claims in Reckless Misinformation from Barry Klinger and the RICO 20
Klinger has now started a climbdown, screencap of http://mason.gmu.edu/~bklinger/ricoDebate.html below:

Popcorn futures are climbing, and this episode, along with all the many many “follow the money” tentacles it has, may very well become the takedown of organized climate science. The RICO20 has opened a Pandora’s box upon themselves.

Excerpt:
‘In recent years another Czech threat expert has been sounding the trumpet for freedom. Vaclav Klaus was born in Prague in 1941 and became an outstanding student in economics, graduating from the University of Economics in Prague in 1963. He was allowed to study abroad in Italy in 1966 and in the USA in 1969, where he came under the influence of Milton Friedman. In 1968 he was awarded his PhD from the Institute of Economics of the Czech Academy of Sciences. From 1970 until 1987 he was kept under wraps in the State Bank of Czechoslovakia, but after the successful uprising of November 1989 he was appointed Federal Minister of Finance, and he became Prime Minister in June 1992. In February 2003, and again in February 2008, he was elected President of the Czech Republic.
‘The presidency is a non-executive role and so Vaclav Klaus has been able to immerse himself in the global warming debate. He has written a book entitled Blue, Not Green Planet, published in Czech last year and due out in English translation (as Blue Planet in Green Shackles) in the USA this May. He has spoken regularly on the issue at home and abroad. In February 2007 he was interviewed by a Prague journalist who took him to task for his refusal to accept the global warming thesis now hegemonial throughout Europe. Klaus was very blunt: “Global warming is a false myth and every serious person and scientist says so.”’

"**A pro-Beijing lawmaker in Hong Kong has been stabbed in the street by a man pretending to be a supporter.**
In footage posted online, a man is seen approaching Junius Ho with flowers before reaching into a bag - saying he wants a picture - but instead lunging at Mr Ho with a knife.
Mr Ho, who was wounded, and others then wrestle him to the ground.
The stabbing is the latest in a series of attacks on people on either side of the Hong Kong protests.
In July, pro-democracy protesters accused Mr Ho of helping to organise attacks on civilians in Yuen Long station.
Dozens of masked men dressed in white shirts - suspected to be triad gangsters - assaulted pro-democracy protesters and passers-by.
Afterwards, Mr Ho reportedly said the attackers were ""defending their home and people"", but denied any involvement.
He was also seen shaking hands with the attackers and giving them the thumbs-up.
Mr Ho was campaigning for Hong Kong's elections, being held later this month, when a man in a blue t-shirt and wearing a back-to-front baseball cap approached him.
The man apparently said ""everyone has seen your efforts"", before Mr Ho took the flowers.
The ""supporter"" then said ""let me take my mobile out"" before reaching into his bag and stabbing Mr Ho. He was then wrestled to the ground by a group of people, including Mr Ho.
The lawmaker was then seen being taken into an ambulance. Two other people were also reportedly hurt.
Police said a suspect had been arrested, and that all three victims were conscious.
After the attack, Mr Ho released a statement in which he said ""black forces"" were targeting pro-establishment candidates.
""I will remain courageous and fearless,"" he said.
Hong Kong's protests - which started in June - now flare up every weekend, with clashes between protesters and police getting increasingly violent.
Shops and businesses seen as being pro-Beijing are also regularly attacked.
At the same time, attacks on groups and individuals, often away from the main protests, have also increased.
Last weekend, at least five people were injured in a knife attack at a pro-democracy protest in a shopping mall. A local councillor had his ear partially bitten off while trying to stop the attacker leaving.
Last month, activist Jimmy Sham was attacked by a group of five men with hammers.
The Hong Kong Free Press says at least three other candidates in November's elections have also been attacked in recent weeks.
Mr Ho is a 57-year-old lawyer who became a member of Hong Hong's Legislative Council in 2016.
He attended Anglia Ruskin University in the UK, which awarded him an honorary doctorate in 2011. However, the university removed the honour last month after pressure online and from politicians.
""Mr Ho's conduct since he was honoured has caused increasing concern,"" the university said.
In 2017 he was accused of saying protesters should be ""killed"" \- but later said his words had been mistranslated - and was also accused of linking homosexuality to bestiality.
After he was accused of supporting the Yuen Long attacks, his office was attacked and his parents' graves vandalised."

Share this...FacebookTwitterThe correlation between seismic activity (geothermal flux) as a natural mechanism in the 1979 to 2015 global warming is stronger than the correlation with carbon dioxide during the same period.
Hat-tip: Kenneth Richard
Viterito, 2016
The Correlation Of Seismic Activity And Recent Global Warming
The latest report from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change states with high confidence that the warming of global temperatures since 1901 has been driven by increased radiative forcing. The gases responsible for this enhanced forcing are ‘greenhouse gases’ of anthropogenic origin, and include carbon dioxide, methane, and halocarbons. The Nongovernmental International Panel on Climate Change has challenged these findings and concludes that the forcing from greenhouse gases is minimal and diminishing. They add that modelling attempts of past and future climate states are inaccurate and do not incorporate important solar inputs, such as magnetic strength and total irradiance. One geophysical variable that has been overlooked by both groups is geothermal flux.
This study will show that increasing seismic activity for the globe’s high geothermal flux areas (HGFA), an indicator of increasing geothermal forcing, is highly correlated with average global temperatures from 1979 to 2015 (r = 0.785). By comparison, the correlation between carbon dioxide loading and global temperatures for the same period is lower (r = 0.739). Multiple regression indicates that HGFA seismicity is a significant predictor of global temperatures (P < 0.05), but carbon dioxide concentrations do not significantly improve the explained variance (P > 0.1). A compelling case for geothermal forcing lies in the fact that 1) geothermal heat can trigger thermobaric convection and strengthen oceanic overturning, important mechanisms for transferring ocean heat to the overlying atmosphere, and 2) seismic activity is the leading indicator, while global temperature is the laggard.
The paper concludes that the world should wait until all of the climate system is understood before enacting laws to curb GHG emissions:

To ameliorate the problems of rising global temperatures, legislative and taxing initiatives are currently being proposed and evaluated by governing bodies around the world. Most of these initiatives are designed to curb GHG emissions. However, this study shows that we may want to delay such actions until all of the climate system’s inputs are fully accounted for.”

Here is an excerpt from a December article in the _Otago Daily Times_ from James Shaw, in which he basically confirms that the climate change rort is really just a cover for his socialist agenda



‘‘Global capitalism is a pain in the neck,’’ he told an audience at the Lakes District’s One Summit last month.



Come at it head on and you’re likely to lose.



‘‘I think that what we need to do is a wee bit of jiu-jitsu,’’ he said. ‘‘And if you know anything about jiu-jitsu, what it says is that a small weedy person, like me, can take an enormous amount of incoming energy and with the flick of the wrist twist it and sit it on its arse. And that’s what we need to do to global capitalism.’’



Hmm, **Green-jitsu** maybe where you block a fist with your face?

Guest opinion: Dr. Tim Ball
On WUWT, Bob Tisdale recently examined the disparity of results between IPCC models in “No Consensus: Earth’s Top of Atmosphere Energy Imbalance in CMIP5-Archived (IPCC AR5) Climate Models” and wrote that
“There are astonishing differences in the modeled estimates of the past, present and future imbalances and the three components that make up the top of the atmosphere (TOA) energy budget.”
There were several earlier studies, but the supposed accuracy improved after satellite data became available. Rossow and Zhang did a study similar to Tisdale in a 1995 article titled, “Calculation of surface and top of atmosphere radiative fluxes from physical quantities based on ISCCP Data sets 2. Validation and first results.” 
Our validation studies suggest that the specification of cloud effects is no longer the dominant uncertainty in reconstructing the radiative fluxes at the top of atmosphere and at the surface. Rather cloud property uncertainties are now roughly equal contributors to the flux uncertainty, along with surface and atmospheric properties.
Erhard Raschke did a similar study in 2005 titled, “How well do we compute the insolation at TOA in radiation climatologies and in GCMs.” He found that,
In the spatial and temporal variations of the insolation at TOA as computed by 20 models participating in the AMIP-2 project and for the ISCCP data-set we discover that none of the models reproduced accurately the prescribed TSI value of 1365 Wm−2. 
Some of the factors listed as problematic were
Some models ignore leap years. Moreover, leap years are included in different ways either leading to a small increase (0.34 Wm−2) or decrease (0.92 Wm−2) of the annual mean of insolation at TOA. 
Most models produce seasonal insolation fields at TOA that deviate from their zonal means. More importantly, the corresponding latitudinal profiles (of zonal averages) differ, as illustrated by deviations to a “reference profile” (here: ISCCP data set). These different latitudinal gradients of insolation are expected to affect the atmospheric circulation in integrations over multiple years. The largest deviations exceed ±5 Wm−2 (in conjunction with extended low sun-elevation times) at high latitudes and polar regions. 
Figure 1 is a graph of the latitudinal discrepancies.

Figure 1
These discrepancies compare unfavorably to an absolute accuracy requirement for all radiation quantities at the TOA of 1.5 Wm−2 [Ohring et al., 2004].
Tisdale’s material shows that nobody, including the IPCC, dealt with Raschke’s recommendations.
We recommend that in all climate models and in all “radiation climatologies” the incoming solar radiation at TOA must be identical for any given time period and area on the globe. Modelers should use the real length of the tropical year. Since a similar analysis of IPCC AR4 simulations shows qualitatively the same deficiencies as described here for the AMIP simulations, we think, that there is a need for sensitivity tests that investigate impacts of detected differences in the TOA insolation on circulation structures developing in the model’s climate system.
The Real Problem
Maybe the problem is the same one associated with climate models in general. They are built on inadequate data and inadequate understanding of the structure and mechanisms of the real world. These problems are then exacerbated and aggravated by creating mechanisms to hide, ignore or even falsify the situation. As Raschke notes in a paper titled, “How accurate did GCMs compute the insolation at TOA for AMIP2?”
All models should reproduce the known major state and related fluxes of energy, mass and momentum with high accuracy. But quite large disagreement was found in various quantities, in particular at higher latitudes over both hemispheres [Gates et al., 1999].
Recently other articles (here, here, here and here) discussed the TOA, but they don’t tell you what or where it is. Here is one description that provides an explanation, but as with most climate science measures, it only adds to the confusion.
Technically, there is no absolute dividing line between the Earth’s atmosphere and space, but for scientists studying the balance of incoming and outgoing energy on the Earth, it is conceptually useful to think of the altitude at about 100 kilometers above the Earth as the “top of the atmosphere.” The top of the atmosphere is the bottom line of Earth’s energy budget, the Grand Central Station of radiation. It is the place where solar energy (mostly visible light) enters the Earth system and where both reflected light and invisible, thermal radiation from the Sun-warmed Earth exit. The balance between incoming and outgoing energy at the top of the atmosphere determines the Earth’s average temperature. The ability of greenhouses (sic) gases to change the balance by reducing how much thermal energy exits is what global warming is all about.
Consider the implication that TOA is a line 100km above the surface and equidistant around the Earth. Now look at the known structures of the atmosphere and factors that affect weather and climate.
Most weather occurs in the Troposphere, and that is far from uniform or spherical. There is inadequate horizontal surface data to construct the General Climate Models (GCM) and even less in the vertical. More layers make no difference if you have no data. William Ferrell proposed a three-cell model of circulation within the Troposphere in the 1850s (Figure 2). It is still in many textbooks, with the middle cell named after Ferrell, Figure 2 is from 2012.

Figure 2:
Figure 3 is a more recent approximation of what is going on within the Troposphere. Notice the Ferrell cell is now an “Indirect Cell”. There is a debate about whether it exists because the diagram shows an average condition. The Polar Front shifts seasonally, from approximately 38°N in the winter to 65°N in the summer. The Southern Hemisphere range is from 40°S to 65°S because of the land/water ratio difference

Figure 3
The top of the Tropopause also changes seasonally. The height at the Equator ranges between 17 and 18 km while it is 7 to 10 km at the Poles because of the greater seasonal temperature range. As the diagram shows, the Tropopause is a distinctive but not continuous boundary with breaks associated with the Jet Streams. All these factors affect the energy flows between the surface and the TOA. It is like trying to cross a very turbulent, fast flowing, constantly changing river. I suggest it is impossible to model such a complex dynamic system with virtually no data. There are serious limitations with accurate measures at high latitudes from the surface up.
Then there is the problem of the different direction of incoming solar radiation and outgoing irradiation. The Earth is a rotating sphere and that complicates everything. Figure 4 shows that solar energy strikes only half the Earth and varies considerably in the angle of incidence. The outgoing long wave passes through considerably different depths of the atmosphere with constantly varying constituencies including clouds, aerosols and gas levels.

Figure 4.
The Ozone layer also lies within the 100 km TOA. Usually, it is dealt with as a homogenous zone but in reality the interaction between ultraviolet radiation and oxygen varies considerably at different levels. It is not unusual for ozone levels to increase at one level while decreasing at another. It also varies considerably spatially as the so-called ozone hole attests.
Another important factor essentially ignored is magnetism and its influence on numerous components of the energy balance. I wrote about one possible relationship in a previous WUWT article. A Danish study by Mads Faurschou Knudsen and Peter Riisager showed a relationship between precipitation patterns and geomagnetism. They attribute the relationship to the same mechanism identified by Svensmark.
Their work, which only looks at Earth’s magnetism, does not include the distortion of the entire atmospheric system from the magnetosphere on down by the pressure of the solar wind. Figure 5 shows the impact on the upwind side and the elongation on the downwind side, but again this is a static image. In reality, the area of maximum pressure is constantly moving as the earth rotates.

Figure 5
In their introduction Mads et al., underline the general problems
It remains difficult to capture the complexity of Earth’s climate system in numerical models. A meaningful discussion of past and future climate variability cannot, therefore, rely solely on mechanistic computer models, but must, at least to some extent, be based on actual climate observations. Because the instrumental records are too short to elucidate several aspects of the climate system, new insights often have to rely on crude comparisons between climate-proxy records and potential climate-forcing factors recorded in geological archives. The controversial role of the Sun as a driver of climate change represents a good example, as geological proxy records are important for our endeavor to understand climate variability.
Tisdale focuses on the modeled oceans as one source of discrepancy in the TOA numbers. As he notes,
We can simply add ocean heat accumulation and TOA energy imbalance to the list of things that climate models do not simulate properly. 
A very good indication of the complexity of the problem of creating accurate models for the energy balance at the TOA is the fact Raschke noted a variation in results of plus (0.34 Wm−2) or minus (0.92 Wm−2) or a range of 1.26 Wm−2. Also, he found that
The largest deviations exceed ±5 Wm−2 (in conjunction with extended low sun-elevation times) at high latitudes and polar regions.
To put this in perspective, Lenaert Bengtsson, previously the Director of Research at ECMWF and Director of the Max Planck Institute for Meteorology noted,
…the radiative forcing by greenhouse gases (including methane, nitrogen oxides and fluorocarbons) has increased by 2.5 watts per square meter since the mid-19th century.
As with most climate measures, the supposed impact of all greenhouse gases is less than the error factor in a multitude of the inadequate data sources.

Tracey Martin has decided to challenge the views of her leader, **Winston Peters** , and **[Shane Jones](https://thebfd.co.nz/2020/01/shane-jones-wallops-eco-bible-bashing-climate-change-wombles/)** over the newly announced child [brain-washing curriculum.](https://thebfd.co.nz/2020/01/the-child-molesters-of-the-mind-pervert-more-nz-children/)



New Zealand First MP **Tracey Martin** is defending the controversial climate change teaching resource despite her colleagues speaking out against it for telling students to eat less meat.



Martin, Associate Education Minister, posted a video to her Facebook page explaining how eating less meat was a reality for her growing up because her family couldn’t always afford it.



“I’m really not sure what the drama is… I’m really not sure when for many New Zealanders part of having days where you don’t eat meat is a reality because they can’t afford the meat.”



The teaching resource, almost [ _sic_ ] about two weeks ago by Education Minister Chris Hipkins and Climate Change Minister **James Shaw** , tells students how they can help to reduce emissions by eating “less meat and dairy”.



The advice sparked an angry response from Martin’s New Zealand First colleagues Winston Peters and Shane Jones – both Cabinet ministers – and Mark Patterson, the party’s spokesperson for agriculture.



“I don’t want the politically correct brigade colonising my dietary habits – it will never, ever happen […] Schools have absolutely no authority to stigmatise and demonise us meat-eaters,” [Jones told Newshub last week](https://www.newshub.co.nz/home/politics/2020/01/nz-first-s-shane-jones-mark-patterson-blast-eat-less-meat-advice-in-climate-teaching-resource.html). 



Peters, the Deputy Prime Minister, [supported Jones](https://www.newshub.co.nz/home/politics/2020/01/winston-peters-backs-shane-jones-pro-meat-stance-in-row-over-climate-teaching-resource.html) and suggested to Magic Talk that the prospect of eating less meat could damage the country’s agriculture industry and lead to job losses. 



“Exports give people jobs in this country and you’ve got this group of elitists challenging the very existence of these jobs by their extremist, absolutist statements.”



I can’t work out if Tracey Martin trolling Jonesy and Winston or just totally effin’ stupid. Perhaps readers can assist?



My money is on totally effin’ stupid. Then again, sources inside NZ First say that it is Tracey’s way of signalling that she is retiring.

Share this...FacebookTwitterWhat follows is a highly discomforting fact, and it’s not going to go away.
============================================
A small sensation goes unnoticed by the press: Solar activity indeed reached maximum value in late 20th century
By Dr. Sebastian Lüning and Fritz Vahrenholt
(German text translated/edited by P Gosselin)
Previously it was constantly claimed that solar activity couldn’t possibly have anything to do with the warming of the late 20th century because both curves fully diverged from each other. As proof, the following charts from Wikipedia were used:

Figure 1: Comparison of global temperature, CO2 and solar activity. From Wikipedia. Source: Leland McInnes at the English language Wikipedia [GFDL (http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/fdl.html) or CC-BY-SA-3.0 (http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/)], via Wikimedia Commons.
The problem
Solar activity is not made up merely by the shaky sunspots. The above figure is an update from 2014 and was provided by a user with a less than trustworthy name of “Kopiersperre”.
The updated curve for solar activity is available from the Austrian Zentralanstalt für Meteorologie und Geodynamik (ZAMG) and research group PAGES:

Figure 2: Fluctuations in solar climate drive on millennial, century and decadal scales. Top: The 20th century had the strongest solar activity in 11,000 years (here 7000 years are shown). Middle: The powerful drive of the Medieval Period and the scant amount of solar drive in the following centuries, followed by the extraordinary jump to the current level. Bottom chart: Only when using the short-term scale do we clearly see the 11-year cycle (Fröhlich 2000 aktual., Wagner and others 2007). Figure source: ZAMG.

Figure 3: Solar activity over the past 400 years. White curve; Total Solar Irradiance (TSI); Yellow curve shows sunspots. Figure source: PAGES.

The great changes in understanding solar activity were illustrated by Matthes & Funke at the end of 2015 at a conference contribution on page 9 (old curve SATIRE-TS in red):

Figure 4: The new and old curves for solar activity during the past 165 years. Source: page 9 in Matthes & Funke 2015.
But it gets even better
The sun not only reached its maximum at the end of the 20th century, but was apparently stronger than at any time over the past 10,000 years. Matthes et al. showed this in a very recent publication in the journal Geoscientific Model Development Discussions in 2016:

Figure 5: Source: Figure 20 in Matthes et al. 2016
Mysterious retreat
By the way, the unusually powerful solar activity in the second half of the 20th century had been already reported on by Sami Solanki in Nature here more than 10 years ago. Afterwards he mysteriously retreated from the climate discussion. Is this perhaps the reason why solar scientists operate almost unnoticed below the media radar?
Discomforting questions
The unexpectedly strong sun casts especially discomforting questions that some would just prefer to dodge. Couldn’t the high solar activity have something to do with the 1980-2000 warming after all?
In any case, now no one can insist that the solar activity and temperature curves diverge and thus refute the relationship. The attribution has to be re-examined altogether. There is no alternative.

"Australia’s economic response to Covid-19 has failed to address insecure work, privatised services such as aged care, low housing supply and climate change. That is the conclusion of Australian National University Menzies Centre for Health Governance report, released on Thursday, praising the federal government for temporary support scheme including jobkeeper and free childcare, but charging it with failing to make long-term change to improve equity and health. The report adds to a growing push to extend free childcare, with advocates including thinktank the Australia Institute, small and family business ombudsman, Kate Carnell, and the Australian Council of Trade Unions. The Menzies centre said that Australia’s economic response to the Covid-19 recession – with 156 separate measures at state and federal level – has been “impressive and to be commended”. But it warned Australia’s policies must “not return to conditions that will keep people in poverty”. “To prevent an accumulation of disadvantage and health inequities throughout the life course, the temporary supports for childcare should continue and enable access to free childcare for, at the very least, socially disadvantaged households,” it said. The Menzies centre was most critical of the housing stimulus, warning that “none of the housing-related measures that were introduced address the medium and long-term housing precariousness that is prevalent in Australia”. It noted that main beneficiaries of homebuilder – which provides grants of $25,000 for new builds or renovations of at least $150,000 in value – “are people who can already afford major renovations”. State and territory grants for tenants who have lost work are “insufficient” and investment in public housing “modest”. It proposed “investment in social (public and community) housing could help bridge the gap in housing investment, job creation and income growth and at the same time reduce homelessness” – echoing Labor’s proposals for social housing investment. The report praised jobkeeper wage subsidies for providing “immediate financial relief and security to businesses and workers” but noted they are accompanied by industrial relations changes that allow employers to cut workers’ hours. “Job insecurity and precariousness … is not good for health and is more common in low paid, and youth and female dominated sectors,” it said, calling on the government to address “longer-term systemic issues of poor employment arrangements and working conditions”. The Menzies centre said the government should keep “in place the positive changes to income support schemes that occurred due to Covid-19”, including doubling jobseeker with the $550 fortnightly coronavirus supplement, which is set to be cut to $250. The Menzies centre concluded that Australia’s economic supports did not “challenge the status quo” but rather maintained “business as usual”. It cited the aged care response – which provides “additional money to keep staff employed” rather than provide “long-term investment in publicly funded and run frontline services”. “The privatised model and its inadequate regulatory framework is harmful.” The profit-motive and inadequate government funding of aged care has been targeted by the Greens, Labor and even Liberal MP Russell Broadbent. The Menzies centre also cited “silence on climate change in Australian policy” as an example of a “missed opportunity” in the effort to “bounce back better” from Covid-19. “Unless something significant changes, climate change will continue to exacerbate existing health inequities,” it said. “Fundamentally, we need climate change mitigation.” In May, Guardian Australia revealed the then-National Covid-19 Coordination Commission’s plan for economic recovery centred on taxpayers funding a massive expansion of the domestic gas industry including helping open new fields and building hundreds of kilometres of pipelines. The head of the commission, Nev Power, has said although business leaders have called for the government to use the recovery to lock in low-emissions energy, his organisation is not recommending “a green recovery per se”."
"Transforming the way we travel is an essential part of tackling the climate crisis. The transport sector contributes about 20% of global carbon emissions. In the UK the figure is 33%, and the country has made virtually no progress in reducing emissions from transport. In many countries, they’re actually increasing. Electric vehicles are often hailed as the solution to this quandary, but some question their environmental credentials. With much of the world’s electricity still produced from fossil fuels, the criticism goes that EVs may actually be responsible for more carbon emissions over their lifetime than combustion engine vehicles. As German economics professor Hans-Werner Sinn put it in a recent controversial article, all we are doing is transferring carbon emissions “from the exhaust pipe to the power plant”. The assumptions underlying these claims are questionable. But even if true, this line of argument misses a key point. The car we choose to buy today directly influences the future of our energy system. Choose a combustion-powered vehicle and we lock in ongoing fossil fuel use. Choose an electric vehicle and we support the switch to a zero carbon society. Due in large part to the high carbon-cost of EV batteries, the manufacturing process for an electric vehicle causes more carbon emissions than for a combustion engine vehicle. This means that the source of electricity used during the life of an EV is critical in determining how eco-friendly they are. While two thirds of the world’s electricity is generated from fossil fuels, this proportion is decreasing rapidly. At least four countries are already at or close to being powered entirely by renewable electricity: Iceland, Paraguay, Costa Rica and Norway. Brazil is one of the ten largest economies in the world and they are at 75% renewable electricity. In the UK, the proportion of electricity provided by fossil fuels has halved over the last decade and is currently about 40%. As the transition towards renewable electricity progresses, so too will the carbon footprint of EVs keep decreasing in step. This means that the superiority in carbon cost that electric vehicles already have over combustion vehicles, even if narrow now, will widen in the years to come. The electricity transition is only half the story. The production and purchase of new combustion vehicles locks in dependence on fossil fuel use for the life of that vehicle – just short of 14 years on average in the UK.  Retrofitting combustion engines to use hydrogen or biofuel is an option in theory, but its an expensive one which is probably more applicable to heavy vehicles than cars. Mass use of hydrogen would also require an entirely new and complex distribution system for a gas that is hard to make and store efficiently. Biofuel could use existing infrastructure, but would require vast swathes of agricultural land to satisfy demand. If the number of fossil-fuel powered cars on the road stays high, it will be difficult to make serious headway in reducing transport emissions. In contrast, switching to EVs transfers energy demand from the transport sector to the electricity sector, allowing countries to more readily tackle the carbon cost of travel. Progress in doing so is of course dependent on the speed at which industry and government decarbonise their energy supply. But the technology already exists to shed the grid’s reliance on fossil fuels, and many countries have committed to do so by 2050 or sooner. The distribution grid also already exists – we just need to install charging stations. And in choosing where they source their electricity from, consumers are able to exert much greater influence on the energy transition than the present transport system that locks them into high-carbon lifestyles. Given that renewable electricity tariffs are already among the cheapest available, this could be a particularly potent force for decarbonisation. The scale of the transition from combustion to electricity-powered transport is huge. Average household electricity demand could double once EV charging is included, and this will place extra strain on both the grid and energy bills. But this burden can be cushioned by careful use of technology. For example, cars can be charged overnight when there is surplus capacity, and there are already special energy tariffs to encourage this. Spare electricity from car batteries could also be redirected to the grid when demand is at its peak, making EVs “virtual power plants” that can offset increases in household energy bills. Of course, producing any large industrial product results in some negative environmental impacts. The mining of lithium for EV batteries is polluting and depletes water supplies, in turn harming wildlife and compromising local livelihoods. Ultimately, the best way to reduce the carbon and pollution costs of transport is to make and use less cars, which means that expanding car sharing and improving public transport are essential. But for those cars that we do use, EVs are the least bad option. The switch to electric vehicles needs to be seen as part of a broader shift in the way society is organised to tackle the climate crisis. That requires consumers, industry, and government to all play their part in creating a carbon-free future. Click here to subscribe to our climate action newsletter. Climate change is inevitable.

Guest essay by Wim Rost

Sometimes you know that something “stinks” somewhere. But you don’t know what and you don’t know where. You can search everywhere and don’t find it. Till you finally find out.
Until recently I thought about the IPCC as an organisation “filled up with science”. That thought was both right and wrong. Sure, you can find a lot of scientists and scientific results there, but, IPCC does not (necessarily) work as science. No, it is not science, IPCC is government.
I discovered the importance of that difference by reading a title of an IPCC report twice: “Summary for Policymakers” and “Summary for Policymakers”. That title was giving me the suggestion that scientists had been writing a scientific paper for Policymakers. But, looking further I discovered it was different. That summary was not a scientific paper. It was an opinion and it does not need to be the opinion of all scientists involved*. Let me explain.
Scientists have to respect the scientific method. The scientific method has rules. The most important of all rules is to work in a way to obtain maximum objectivity. “Science or Fiction” wrote about objective science in a post with reference to Karl Popper: https://dhf66.wordpress.com/2015/06/02/ippc-does-exactly-what-should-be-avoided-in-objective-science/ . In the words of Karl Popper:
“We may now return to a point made in the previous section: to my thesis that a subjective experience, or a feeling of conviction, can never justify a scientific statement, and that within science it can play no part (…). No matter how intense a feeling of conviction it may be, it can never justify a statement. Thus I may be utterly convinced of the truth of a statement; certain of the evidence of my perceptions; overwhelmed by the intensity of my experience: every doubt may seem to me absurd. But does this afford the slightest reason for science to accept my statement? Can any statement be justified by the fact that Karl R. Popper is utterly convinced of its truth? The answer is, ‘No’; and any other answer would be incompatible with the idea of scientific objectivity.”
Is a conviction the slightest reason for science to accept a statement? Popper: “The answer is, ‘No’; and any other answer would be incompatible with the idea of scientific objectivity.”
In the IPCC Climate Discussion at this point all went wrong: conviction. But how? As said, it has been a struggle for me to discover. But now I know how we all are tricked. We are tricked in sentences like “Summary for Policymakers”. And also by way of “organising a result” in a manner which is perhaps formally correct – within the IPCC context – but as a result gives a wrong suggestion to the big public. Namely, the suggestion of “scientific evidence”, supported by nearly all scientists.
“The Summary for Policymakers 2014” of group II has a subtitle: “WORKING GROUP II CONTRIBUTION TO THE FIFTH ASSESSMENT REPORT OF THE INTERGOVERNMENTAL PANEL ON CLIMATE CHANGE”. From the scientific point of view “Working group II contribution” to the summary is not correct as far as I can see.
To be scientific, the statement that something – for example an opinion or a conclusion – is a“working group II contribution” has to be tested and verified. So there must have been an enquiry among the scientists that were working in the group involved, in any case of a statement with expressions as “likely” or “very likely” or in any other statement or conclusion which is not straight from scientific research itself. That enquiry must make clear which of the scientists involved did judge the presented statement to be “a certitude” from the scientific point of view. This enquiry and the results have to be publicly available in order to make it verifiable. It must be possible to make the enquiry again and then we must get the same results. By doing so [parts of] the enquiry can be verified by researchers and journalists.
I have never heard about such an enquiry by the IPCC in regard to summaries or conclusions.
When the hypothesis (e.g. “X = very unlikely”) is not tested in such a way, you can only refer to such a statement as to the opinion of the writers of that specific part. But, opinion is not the same as “science” and every suggestion that the summary or conclusion is representing the science or even the scientists of “working group II” has to be avoided. Unless it is proven.
The IPCC is stating elsewhere:
The assessment process
This Working Group III contribution to the AR5 represents the combined efforts of hundreds of leading experts in the field of climate change mitigation and has been prepared in accordance with the rules and procedures established by the IPCC.
(WR: italic is mine)
Source: http://www.ipcc.ch/pdf/assessment-report/ar5/wg3/ipcc_wg3_ar5_full.pdf
That was an eye opener. Does this statement mean that rules and procedures of science and of experts are used to produce summary’s and conclusions? No, not at all. It means, that what you are reading in the summaries and the conclusions is IPCC. And IPCC, although a lot of important work is done by scientists, IPCC is not equal with science. The IPCC is an intergovernmental panel on Climate Change. To be even more clear: IPCC is government and not science. And the workers of the IPCC prepare the work in accordance with the rules and procedures established by the IPCC.
In order to be scientific the scientific method has to be adhered. The use of many scientists to fill important parts of IPCC reports does not mean that everything is science. A report is just a report. In this case, a report from the IPCC. And the IPCC is (inter-) government. Scientists involved can produce their own scientific papers about their own specialised part of science, but a small group of writers writes the summaries and the conclusions – for the IPCC. And IPCC is government.
When you are reading well, formally the IPCC knows. But, the problem is that in public use the fact that a lot of scientists are working for the IPCC is mentioned so often, that it seems that everything produced by the IPCC is “scientific”. But, the summaries and conclusions are not scientific. They are just representing the intergovernmental opinion.
 
Of course, government may have an opinion. And government may also find support for that opinion in scientific research. But by making choices for certain lines and by drawing certain conclusions – even when made with the help of scientists – this doesn’t mean the government is representing “Science” and that her conclusions are “Science” or even “scientific”. It could very well be, that another choice for the IPCC‘s stated mission**, another choice of writers, another choice for “process organisers” and another selection of scientists would have delivered other summaries and other conclusions. As is usual when it is about an opinion.
The ‘big lie’ about the scientific nature of all of the IPCC statements and especially her conclusions has to end up by strictly avoiding the overwhelming suggestion that everything is science. Unless there are enquiries which prove the opposite. Therefore, to start with the next report the IPCC should give reports titles and subtitles like:
 
Summary by Policymakers
Approved by governments, not science
As a beginning. And to continue, they have to make everywhere a strict division between “science” and “opinion”. And tell with every statement who’s opinion it exactly is.
Wim Röst ***
* Of course there always remains the possibility that at a certain moment one specific researcher is more right than the other 99.9% of researchers which “are not that far”. Think about Albert Einstein’s E=mc2 or Alfred Wegener’s Continental Drift. So, majority doesn’t count in science. “Reigning by majority” is a democratic principle which is bound to government and not to science. The IPCC is government and so uses “majorities”. But, from the scientific point of view, “majority” is without any meaning and doesn’t belong to Science.
** “The IPCC’s stated mission is not to discover what accounts for climate change, but to assess “the risk of human-induced climate change.” Consequently, there is almost no discussion in its lengthy reports of other theories of climate change. Policymakers and journalists took this to mean the AGW theory was the only credible theory of climate change, and the IPCC’s sponsors and spokespersons had no incentive to correct the mistake.”

"BEIJING  —   Xu Zhengming was lugging a     television through the Beijing West Railway Station on his way home for China’s Lunar New Year. Another passenger was hauling a tub of meat. And many migrant workers returning to their home villages carried bundles of clothes and gifts for children they see maybe once a year. They all said that they could not go home   for China’s biggest holiday. Even if that meant carting a television for two days across 1, 000 miles. “I get to go back just once a year. It’s a long way,” Mr. Xu said as he heaved the television, bundled in protective clothing, through the railway station. He was headed to a village outside Chengdu, the capital of the southwestern province of Sichuan, a journey he estimated would take about 20 hours. “My father is in the countryside, and the family is hard up,” said Mr. Xu, a   construction laborer in Beijing, the Chinese capital. “He always wanted a   television, so I’m taking mine home to give him. ” He and most other passengers at this cavernous, thrumming station were among hundreds of millions of Chinese on the move for the Lunar New Year. Many wore red hats or scarves, the color of good luck. While the total number of holiday travelers is hard to pin down, this is the world’s largest annual migration. Zhang Kemin, a restaurant worker dragging a plastic tub holding about 18 pounds of beef and lamb, said he was taking the meat home to Hebei Province, adjacent to Beijing, to make boiled dumplings filled with a mix of meat and vegetables, an essential part of the holiday food in northern China. “There’s pork at home,” he explained. In the days before the holiday, big cities, like Beijing, and the coastal industrial regions exhale tens of millions of workers who head back to their hometowns and villages by train, plane, bus, car and motorbike for this family holiday of marathon eating, fireworks and paying respects to relatives. This year, the festivities start on Friday evening, when the country says goodbye to the Year of the Monkey and welcomes the Year of the Rooster. On Thursday, the Beijing West Railway Station hummed like a giant boot camp, with the police, paramilitary troops and station staff members hustling passengers into waiting rooms to be corralled onto trains. Workers at the station said the holiday rush was more orderly than a decade ago, when heaving crowds threatened to overwhelm stations. “It used to be crazy, but it’s a lot better now,” said Yang Guibao, a bald    cleaner at the station. “They add many more trains for the Spring Festival, and the passengers don’t have to be so packed,” he said, using another name for the Lunar New Year. With a wag of his finger, he warned, “There are still pickpockets around, but there are also plainclothes cops. ” China’s trains have become more numerous and faster than even a few years ago. More people go by car or plane, and they are not as bent on all going home at the same time. Some visit at quieter times of the year. China’s expanding   rail network now covers about 12, 500 miles of track. The railway administration has cracked down on ticket scalpers, and it has become common to order tickets online or from vending machines. So while the holiday migration is still daunting, it’s not as crazy as before. “Before it took a day on a train, but now it takes three and a half hours,” said Zhang Guiping, a    businesswoman waiting for a train to Fuping, a county in Hebei Province. She said she had been in Beijing petitioning the government over a land dispute. Despite her feud with officialdom, she said she was happy with the better trains. “There are more trains, the security checks take less time, and it’s easier to buy tickets,” she said. The Chinese transportation authorities have estimated that people will make close to three billion journeys over this Lunar New Year travel period, including 356 million trips by train. But those numbers can sound misleadingly large. Many people take multiple journeys  —   by train and bus  —   to get home and then return to work, so the actual number of bodies on the move is lower than those numbers may suggest. That does not mean that the holiday rush is a tranquil experience. The Beijing West Railway Station, in particular, is an unsightly monument to poor planning that opened in 1996, and its construction was blighted by corruption. Officials estimated that in the   holiday travel period that began in   the station would send off 11. 8 million passengers, 6 percent more than last year, Chinese state radio reported. People must steel themselves for big crowds, and then they scramble to jump on trains and find space for the gifts and treats that many take home. The official Lunar New Year break lasts a week, but the traditional festival ends after its 15th day. Many migrant workers from the countryside linger at home for precious time with children and parents, whom they rarely or never see the rest of the year. But Wang Tianchang, a    migrant laborer who had been sleeping on a sack of bedding in a train station waiting room, said he was not taking home any gifts for his children. His boss on a building site had not paid him $150 owed in wages. “Things are expensive here. I haven’t bought a thing,” he said. But he said, “It’s really important to go home for the Spring Festival. You can see your wife and kids. ”"

Share this...FacebookTwitterNew Paper: China temperatures warmer during the 1700s, linked to solar, volcanic, and AMO/PDO forcing
By Kenneth Richard
A new 368-year tree ring temperature reconstruction has established that regional (China) summer temperatures were warmer than they are now (2012) during the mid-1600s and early 1700s, and that the temperature variations can be linked to variations in solar activity, volcanic forcing (cooling), and natural oceanic-atmospheric oscillations (AMO/PDO).
The authors are intent on pointing out that it is “noteworthy that 20th century warming was not very obvious in our reconstruction.”  This “noteworthy” finding is mentioned four different times in the paper.
The lack of a conspicuous 20th century warming — and the warmer periods during the 1600s and 1700s — are clearly shown in the summer temperature graph below:

Annual and 11-year smoothed regional July–August mean maximum temperature reconstruction (blue and red lines, respectively); superimposed is the 11-year smoothed instrumental record (pink line).
Zhu and co-authors also do not mention CO2 as a “possible forcing mechanism” in their extensive discussion of the causes of temperature variations for the last 368 years, probably because there is little to no correlation between the decadal-scale temperature variations (warming and cooling periods) and the precipitous rise in atmospheric CO2 during the 20th and 21st centuries.
Below is a summary of the key points from the paper Zhu et al., 2016:

A 368-year maximum temperature reconstruction
During the period 1875–1955, late summer temperature fluctuated less strongly than before or thereafter. In general, the average length of cold periods was shorter than that of warm periods. The cold period of 1869–1877 was the longest and coldest cool period had a mean of 17.63°C. The longest warm period extended from 1655 to 1668, and the warmest period in AD 1719–1730 had a mean of 20.37°C. However, we should point out that the rapid warming during the 20th century was not especially obvious in our reconstructed RLST.
[S]even cold periods and three warm periods were identified during the past 368 years (Fig. 4d). All the cold periods were during the Maunder (1708–1711) or Dalton (1818– 1821, 1824–1828, 1832–1836, and 1839–1842) solar minima periods, except for the cold periods of 1765–1769 and 1869–1877 (Eddy, 1976; Shindell et al., 1999), which indicated that RLST [mean maximum temperature] variations in the NWSP [northwestern Sichuan Plateau, China ] might be driven by solar activity (Fig. 7b). On the other hand, volcanic eruptions in the corresponding periods might also be a cooling factor (Fig. 7b). A longer cold period (e.g., 1820s–1840s) was interrupted by transient warming, thus forming a plurality of discontinuous short cold periods. Warm periods of 1719–1730 and 1858–1859 both had more sunspots (Eddy, 1976; Shindell et al., 1999) and lower volcanic forcing (Fig. 7b). The cold (1765–1769 or 1869–1877) and warm (1655–1668) periods were highly consistent with other studies (Fig. 7).
Possible Forcing Mechanism
Accompanied by significant peaks at 60.2 and 73 years, the continuously periodicities around 49–114 years in our regional temperature reconstruction might tentatively be related to PDO, Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation (AMO; En- field et al., 2001) as well as solar activity (Eddy, 1976; Shindell et al., 1999; Peristykh and Damon, 2003; Raspopov et al., 2004; Braun et al., 2005). The AMO was an important driver of multidecadal variations in summer climate not only in North America and western Europe (Kerr, 2000; Sutton and Hodson, 2005) but also in the East Asia (Feng and Hu, 2008; Liang et al., 2008; Wang et al., 2011, 2015; Zhu et al., 2011). The 60.2-year peak associated with AMO demonstrated that multidecadal variations in late summer temperature in the NWSP NWSP [northwestern Sichuan Plateau, China ]  might be controlled by AMO.
[S]ignificant multidecadal- and centennial-scale cycles of our temperature reconstruction might include the signs of solar activity, such as the Gleissberg cycles (Peristykh and Damon, 2003), Suess cycles (Braun et al., 2005), Bruckner cycles (Raspopov et al., 2004), and Schwabe cycles (Braun et al., 2005). The Maunder (ca. AD 1645–1715) and Dalton (ca. AD 1790–1840) solar minima periods were generally associated with temperature depressions (Eddy, 1976), and the Damon (ca. AD 1890– 1920) solar maximum period occurred in a relatively warm period, which further confirmed that late summer temperature variation in the NWSP [northwestern Sichuan Plateau, China ]  might be driven by solar activity (Fig. 7b).
Conclusion
Overall, the RLST [mean maximum temperature] variability in the NWSP [northwestern Sichuan Plateau, China ]  might be associated with global land–sea atmospheric circulation (e.g., ENSO, PDO, or AMO) as well as solar and volcanic forcing.

We need to fix the climate of fraud, corruption, and policies that kill jobs, hope and people 
Guest essay by Paul Driessen
Reeling stock markets across the globe hammered savings, pension funds, innovation and growth. US stocks lost over $2 trillion in market value in eight days, before rallying somewhat, while the far smaller Shanghai Composite Index lost $1 trillion in four days of trading, the Wall Street Journal reports.
Battered economies continue to struggle. Investment banks are pulling out of developing countries. An already exploding and imploding Middle East now confronts a nuclear arms race and human exodus.
Complying just with federal regulations already costs American businesses and families $1.9 trillion per year, the Competitive Enterprise Institute calculates. That’s more than all 2014 personal and corporate income tax receipts combined – and Obama bureaucrats issued 3,554 new rules and regulations last year.
EPA’s 2,691-page Clean Power Plan is designed to eliminate coal mining and coal-fired power plants – and minimize natural gas substitutes. The CPP requires that gas use can increase by only 22% above 2012 levels by 2022, and just 5% per year thereafter. On top of that, new natural gas-fueled generating units that replace coal-fired power plants absurdly do not count toward state CO2 reduction mandates.
That means millions of acres of new wind and solar installations that generate expensive, unreliable electricity – and survive only because of subsidies, tariffs, anti-fossil fuel mandates, and exemptions from endangered species, environmental impact and other requirements that block fossil fuel projects.
Anti-energy, anti-growth policies imposed in name of preventing “dangerous manmade climate change” impact everything we do. For minority, elderly and working class families, they bring soaring electricity costs, rising unemployment, unproductive lives on government assistance, diminished health and welfare, and shorter life spans. They hogtie economies and kill jobs, prolong and worsen economic quagmires, crush aspirations and opportunities, perpetuate poverty, and foster anger, unrest and conflict.
None of these hard realities seems to bother President Obama, though. In fact, he is determined to use the December climate conference in Paris to lock the United States into binding treaty commitments to slash the common folks’ fossil fuel use, CO2 emissions, economic growth and job creation even further.
Anyone who cares about living standards, lifting billions of people out of abject poverty, and reining in the power of unaccountable US, EU and UN bureaucrats needs to pay attention and get involved.
Earth’s climate is doing pretty much what it always has: responding to powerful natural forces, changing, and driving atmospheric patterns and weather events that benefit some, harm others and sometimes wreak devastation. It is not doing what gloom-and-doom computer models and headlines predicted.
We do not need to “fix” or “control” the climate. We couldn’t if we tried. We do need to fix the climate of fraud, corruption and destructive policies that kill jobs, dreams and people. We need to realize that most countries will not commit economic suicide. They may sign a climate treaty – but for reasons that have nothing to do with environmental protection … and only if their obligations are distant and ephemeral.
Mr. Obama has said from the outset that he would use executive decrees to “fundamentally transform” the United States and ensure that electricity prices “necessarily skyrocket.” He has kept his word.
He and his friends in the UN, EU, Big Green and Climate Crisis Industry have also made it clear that they intend to use the Paris conference to negotiate the future distribution of the world’s wealth and resources, determine what economic growth and living standards are “ecologically feasible,” and transform the global economic development model: replacing sovereign nations and free enterprise capitalism with global governance and decision-making based on “sustainable development” and “dangerous manmade climate change” mantras. 1992 climate conference organizers even said saving the world requires that they cause “industrialized civilization to collapse.” They intend to keep their promises.
Impoverished people in developing countries reject this agenda. They want sustained development, not sustainable development. They want decent jobs and modern houses, hospitals and living standards.
Thus, under the proposed Paris treaty, only developed countries will be required to slash fossil fuel use. “Poor” nations (including China, India, Brazil, Indonesia and Russia) will not be obligated to reduce their carbon-based energy use or carbon dioxide/greenhouse gas emissions by any specific amounts or dates – though some say they “intend to try” to reduce emissions or may present non-binding targets some years from now. Most will dramatically increase their oil, gas and coal use, and CO2/GHG emissions.
The real bribe to induce poor nations to sign a new treaty is a binding commitment that increasingly less developed, less energy-powered, less rich countries will give “poor” nations (or at least their ruling elites) $100 billion per year in climate adaptation, mitigation and reparation payments. That’s to cover damages that developed nations have supposedly inflicted on Earth’s climate. FRCs (Formerly Rich Countries) will also be required to give “poor” nations advanced energy and other technologies, at no cost.
Even more insane, the entire basis for this agenda, this treaty, these commitments and non-commitments, is bald assertions – driven by garbage in/garbage out computer models and deceptive, fraudulent science – that humanity faces “unprecedented” global warming, rising ocean, weather and other calamities.
About the only unprecedented event in the past century is that no category 3-5 hurricane has hit the USA in nearly a decade. Climate alarmists refuse to discuss that. Their other assertions are pure fiction.
Claims that 2014 was the “hottest year on record,” and July 2015 was “the hottest July” since “at least 1880,” are based on city and airport temperatures that are always several degrees higher than those at nearby rural sites. (Satellite data show no warming for 18 years.) The “superheated planet” alarums involve hundredths of a degree: less than the margin of error. They are based mainly on only 1,200 measuring stations for Earth’s entire surface – with few in the coldest regions, and millions of acres of missing data simply extrapolated from urban numbers. The “hottest ever” charade also assumes reliable temperature data exist for the entire USA and planet all the way back to 1880! It defies belief.

Imagine your life without electricity, or only when it’s available, or costing so much you can’t afford it and your now-bankrupt former employer couldn’t afford either. Imagine the EPA and UN controlling the juice that powers everything in your life: transportation, manufacturing, communications, entertainment, life after dark, life in hot and cold weather, the enormous infrastructure and energy demands that feed your smart phone. No wonder Google scientists finally admitted renewable energy is a pipedream.
Too many environmental laws no longer focus on protecting the environment. They have become bureaucratic weapons to protect chosen industries and destroy those connected to carbon-based fuels.
Denying people access to abundant, reliable, affordable hydrocarbon energy is immoral – and often lethal. It is an unconscionable crime against humanity to implement policies that pretend to protect the world’s energy-deprived masses from hypothetical manmade climate dangers decades from now – by perpetuating energy deprivation, poverty, malnutrition and disease that kill millions of them tomorrow. 
Letting this climate fear mongering continue also means fewer jobs, more welfare, lower living standards, and deteriorating health and welfare – except for ruling elites. But so far too few politicians, candidates, clergy and business leaders have shown the courage to speak out – even as every Democratic would-be successor to Mr. Obama seems hell-bent on going even further than he has on all these policies.
Our next president and congress must focus on job and economic growth, and overall human welfare. They must review and roll back destructive regulations, root out the fraud and corruption, and restore honesty, transparency and real science to our political and regulatory system.

Share this...FacebookTwitterHere’s more proof that Germany’s scheme to shift over to renewable energy sources, the so-called Energiewende, is backfiring – this time socially.
German climate alarmist site “Klimaretter” (Climate Rescuer) writes here that Germany’s Energiewende has been unfair to consumers, but a real bonanza for some large power consumers.
Claiming competition disadvantages (and they are indeed real) big power consumers have cajoled policymakers to grant them exemptions from having to pay the renewable energy feed-in surcharges – now at more than 6 euro-cents a kilowatt-hour. The result is that these have ended up being passed on to the poor consumers, who are forced to pick up the huge tab in addition to paying their own surcharge fees.
Klimaretter writes:
Energy-intensive companies in Germany were exempted from paying 3.3 billion euros in 2014 and 3.4 billion euros in 2015 within the scope of the EEG Renewable Energy Feed-In Act.”
That’s about 7 billion – over the past two years, only.

It is estimated that some 2000 German companies were granted exemptions from paying these feed-in charges. One green politician, Julia Verlinden, commented that the way things are now, large power consuming companies are being rewarded for consuming more power. She told klimaretter that “companies even receive incentives to waste as much energy as possible in order to profit from extra discounts.”
In fact Co2 emissions by the German aluminium industry has risen from 733,000 tonnes in 2010 to 821,000 tonnes in 2014, klimaretter reports.
Verlinden adds:
Small businesses, private households or public services have to pay for the gifts to industry.”
This is yet another way the Energiewende has become the largest bottom-to-top wealth redistribution in the history of the planet. Currently German consumers are being burdened with over 25 billion euros annually to subsidize the Energiewende. The big profiteers are banks, Big Wind & Solar, and wealthy land and property owners.
For the extra billions of euros annually, the poor consumers have content themselves with a few theoretical hundredths of a degree less climate warming by 2050.

"**Hong Kong's leader Carrie Lam has been heckled by opposition lawmakers for a second day as she tried to answer questions in parliament.**
After shouting and holding up placards, 11 opposition members were removed from the session by security guards.
On Wednesday, Ms Lam was forced to suspend her annual policy address after she was interrupted by opponents.
Hong Kong has seen months of mass protests against the government, sparked by a proposed extradition law.
The opposition forms a small minority in the Legislative Council (Legco) but managed to repeatedly interrupt Ms Lam, forcing the session to be adjourned several times.
Some of the ejected lawmakers were holding white flowers to express solidarity with people injured during months of demonstrations.
As they were dragged out, they shouted: ""Carrie Lam you should not stay on as chief executive! You are not qualified.""
Her critics in the session accused her of not addressing the political crisis in her policy speech the previous day.
Ms Lam dismissed the allegations, insisting her policy proposals about Hong Kong's housing crisis were in fact addressing pressing social concerns.
On the protests which have engulfed the city for months, she reiterated that people should abstain from violence and solve disagreements within the spirit of the rule of law.
The chief executive also said the city was facing economic recession and that her government would offer subsidies to affected businesses.
Initially a protest against an extradition law - which would have meant Hong Kongers could have been sent to China to stand trial - the demonstrations have grown to include demands full democracy.
Hong Kong was once a British colony but was returned to Chinese rule in 1997 under a ""one country two systems"" principle. That means it has more freedoms and rights than the mainland.
Its leadership, however, is not directly democratically elected - and Carrie Lam is seen as part of the pro-Beijing political establishment.
Many in Hong Kong fear that Beijing's growing influence is gradually eroding the territory's freedoms.
In September, the government promised the extradition bill would be completely withdrawn once parliament resumed, but demonstrations continued.
Protesters now have five key demands:
Clashes between police and activists have become increasingly violent, with police firing live bullets and protesters attacking officers and throwing petrol bombs.
On Wednesday evening, the leader of one of Hong Kong's largest pro-democracy groups was taken to hospital after being attacked.
Photographs on social media showed Jimmy Sham of the Civil Human Rights Front lying in the street, covered in blood."
"As a landlocked country in the heart of Europe, Hungary has a typically continental climate, with little or no influence from the sea. As a result, the climate is far more extreme than another European country on the same latitude, France. The difference between typical temperatures in summer and winter can be as much as 30C, compared with a range of about 20 degrees in western France, and less than 10 degrees in the west of Ireland.  In July and August, temperatures regularly peak in the high 30s; while those in January and February often stay well below freezing. Rainfall is fairly evenly spread throughout the year, though with a slight peak in the late spring and summer months. Snow often lies on the ground in winter, and the Danube, in the capital Budapest, used to freeze over regularly. However, during the past few decades this has happened far less often, as regional temperatures have risen due to the effects of the global climate crisis. Scientists are now using the changes in the ice cover on the Danube to track rising temperatures; and warn that although the lack of ice may be good news for the operators of river cruises, it sounds a timely warning for the rest of us."
"Society’s defining issues are rarely presented as raw facts and stats, and climate change is no exception. From the performance of funerals for lost species and glaciers to the claim that the best we can do is adapt to impending catastrophe, climate change is often narrated like a classic Greek tragedy. Errors in human judgement set off a chain of events that once in motion inevitably bring extreme suffering, and a powerful sense of helplessness to change what we know is coming. In many ways, such gloomy perspectives are appropriate. Millions of people are already being displaced or killed by the human-caused destabilisation of our climate. And yet, as environmental scientists and communication specialists point out, such narratives are problematic because they tend to inspire inertia and anxiety rather than action. Narratives of hope might go some way to changing the script and galvanising a response. But there’s an even more suitable story we can supplement our tragic narratives with: comedy. This proposal might seem bizarre. There is nothing funny about the prospect of environmental collapse. But while comedies are meant to be funny, they don’t have to be lighthearted or trivial.  Many philosophical approaches to comedy hold that comic effects arise from incongruities: mismatches between what we expect and what we perceive. For French philosopher Henri Bergson, one of the central incongruities used in comedy is when organic life – normally chaotic, changeable, and adaptable – instead acts in a machine-like way. Bergson argues that laughing at this incongruity is a social tool by which we mildly scold each other for not being adaptive and flexible enough. Bergson extends this idea explicitly to the way humans relate to nature. He gives the anecdotal example of a lady who had been invited by the astronomer Cassini to observe an eclipse of the moon. Arriving late, she asks the astronomer to please begin the viewing anew. Bergson also describes a character who arrives in town and, learning that there is an extinct volcano in the neighbourhood, exclaims: “They had a volcano and they let it go out!”. Here, comedy arises from the common treatment of the complicated and evolving network of life as mechanical and controllable. This sort of attitude may seem ridiculous, but it encapsulates a dominant approach to tackling the climate crisis. Rather than trying to infringe less on our environment and allowing it to recover, many are doubling down on the technological harnessing of the natural world that got us into this mess in the first place – and will likely keep making things worse. Bergson’s comic protagonists behave mechanically in relation to nature, and we laugh about them. But in laughing about them, we laugh about ourselves, too. They can help us reflect on our actions and highlight the absurdity and inefficiency of many human responses to the climate crisis. But comedies offer more than just a mode of critique. In addition to the protagonists we laugh at, comedies also provide heroes we laugh with. Rather than having a mechanical grip on their environment, they are receptive to the challenges of a living and changing environment and adapt their actions and goals accordingly. The ancient philosopher Aristotle highlighted that comic characters are flawed but never wholly bad or evil. Likewise, their actions are often pathetic, but not vicious, and comedies overall are driven by errors and clumsiness. German philosopher Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel held that it is a peculiar strength of comic protagonists to be able to withstand failure and disaster. Their flawed characters, their struggles with what life throws at them, and their perseverance against the odds make them a good mirror of the human condition. Comic figures often have a keen ability to see dire situations for what they are, and themselves for what they are – in a position of weakness and vulnerability. With this in mind, they nonetheless set out to achieve seemingly impossible tasks. Think of Aristophanes‘ classic comedy, Peace: Trugaios, the main character, is a simple villager with no economic or political power. He is well aware that restoring peace in Greece is well beyond his powers. Yet he insists on trying.  There are two main reasons why he succeeds. First, the restoration of peace is a collective effort. Trugaios acts in concert with others – peasants, foreigners, workers. Comic heroes thus avoid the problematic representation of “proper” heroes as exceptional individuals who are uniquely able to deal with crisis. Second, Trugaios is willing to consider even the unlikeliest means to achieve his goals, such as a dung beetle who will fly him up to heaven, and he constantly adapts his approach in response to the challenges he encounters on the way. Rather than mechanically following a plan, his actions show precisely the elasticity Bergson thought was so essential to what it means to be alive. I do not recommend that we turn away from tragic and apocalyptic narratives entirely – there is much truth and value to them. But we would do well to supplement them with comic reflections on our relationship with nature and our ability to act in the face of hopelessness. Comedy is not merely a way to allow us to process news about climate change in a less anxiety-inducing way. It allows us to reflect on who we are and how we do things in the world. More specifically, comedy can point out where there are fundamental problems in our mechanical and technocratic behaviour toward the environment. And, finally, if we begin to think of our own agency more like that of comic heroes — not in control of their environment, yet often able to muddle through despite their own ineptitudes and repeated failures — this might help us persevere in view of the seemingly impossible tasks ahead of us. Tragedy highlights the vulnerability of those who think themselves in control. Comedy shows the strength of those who recognise their own vulnerability.

"WASHINGTON  —   Sensing a political opportunity they have not had in more than a decade, social conservatives are preparing for a lengthy fight over abortion rights that promises to widen the culture war fissures that Republicans have tried for years to bridge. Two fights now loom in Washington that are galvanizing the right as it solidifies control of two branches of government and moves to dominate the third: an effort in Congress to eliminate Planned Parenthood’s federal funding and President Trump’s forthcoming choice of a Supreme Court nominee. The choice for the court is likely to meet conservatives’ expectations. But fulfilling even a   goal of the   movement, like defunding Planned Parenthood, will be a longer and more complicated process than it appears, setting up an early and potentially defining test for the new president. Mr. Trump, an eager if improbable combatant in the cause, made bold promises about what he would do to restrict abortion if elected and, in turn, won overwhelming support from religious conservatives. Yet those promises are now tangled in intraparty politics and, in some cases at least, will be blocked by Senate Democrats. They include laws that would ban abortion after 20 weeks of pregnancy and permanently prohibit all federal funding, including Medicaid, from paying for abortions. Cutting off Planned Parenthood is part of the larger and messier debate over repealing and replacing the Affordable Care Act, which Republicans so far have been unable to do. Even if the law is scrapped, there is no guarantee a Planned Parenthood funding ban could easily move forward, given that   women’s groups will bring intense pressure upon moderate Republicans to vote against it. On the other side of the spectrum among women’s groups is the Susan B. Anthony List, which has been lobbying to gut Planned Parenthood’s funding and is planning to target senators who may be wavering, especially in states where Mr. Trump won. “The commitments in the House and the Senate and in the White House are so strong, and the desire to get it signed is so palpable,” said Marjorie Dannenfelser, the group’s president. “But like everything that’s worthwhile, it’s a crooked path. It gets more complicated as it gets more real. ” Mr. Trump has committed in writing to choosing a Supreme Court nominee who opposes abortion. But a Democratic filibuster of Mr. Trump’s choice  seems likely, which would force Republicans to confront the difficult question of jettisoning the Senate filibuster for all presidential nominees, once and for all. Not too far removed from the minority themselves, Senate Republicans have enjoyed the filibuster’s protections in the past. And many in the party are reluctant to move too hastily on it. While the ease and speed with which Republicans can act is in doubt, the new president’s commitment is not. Barely in office a week, Mr. Trump has already taken steps to reassure his   base. Earlier this week, he reinstituted a   policy prohibiting foreign aid to health providers abroad that discuss abortion as a family planning option. In a show of solidarity with the movement, Mr. Trump is sending Vice President Mike Pence to speak at an   rally in Washington on Friday that is expected to draw thousands. The president’s appointments so far, both in his cabinet and among other senior White House positions, include many committed and longtime opponents of abortion. The attorney general nominee, Senator Jeff Sessions of Alabama, has called Roe. v. Wade “one of the worst, colossally erroneous Supreme Court decisions of all time. ” Andrew Puzder, Mr. Trump’s pick to be labor secretary, was an early advocate of legal efforts to define life at conception as a way of outlawing abortion. Tom Price, who is in line to become secretary of health and human services, has been a leading proponent of defunding Planned Parenthood in Congress. White House counselor Kellyanne Conway spent her time as a pollster and messaging expert before 2016, advising   groups and politicians on how to soften their approach when talking about the issue. Among her suggestions: telling a personal story about why they came to believe abortion is wrong. Mr. Trump adopted this approach during his campaign and spoke of two unnamed friends who ended up deciding against aborting a child he described now as “a total superstar. ” Ms. Conway is also a featured speaker at Friday’s rally in Washington, the annual March for Life. How Mr. Trump  —   a former Democrat who once declared, “I’m very pro choice”  —   became an unbowed voice for the   movement is a story of savvy political transformation and bald expedience. Women in the movement, like Ms. Dannenfelser of the Susan B. Anthony List, once publicly declared themselves “disgusted” by him. But as it became clear he would be the Republican nominee, many social conservatives swallowed their pride to get behind him. To shore up their support, Mr. Trump pledged to name an   Supreme Court justice and largely turned the party platform over to social conservatives at last July’s Republican National Convention, which yielded numerous new provisions like the endorsement of a nationwide ban on abortion after 20 weeks of pregnancy. Mr. Trump went even further himself, disregarding Ms. Conway’s advice by talking about   abortion in the most graphic of terms, a move that endeared him to the movement’s supporters. Today, conservatives see his line “rip the baby out of the womb of the mother just prior to the birth” as a turning point in his campaign. In an interview, Ms. Conway marveled at how Mr. Trump had flipped the script. “I’ve been working on   messaging for two decades in this town,” she said. “And it took a billionaire man from Manhattan who had spent most of his life being   to deliver the most impassioned defense of life that many have ever heard. ” Ben Domenech, publisher of The Federalist, said that many conservatives felt Mr. Trump spoke to them with that line in a way that other Republican nominees, like Mitt Romney, had been too timid to pursue. Mr. Romney barely spoke about abortion at all in the 2012 general election and when he did, it was often in the context of how he did not support further restrictions. “If you feel like your side is being pushed around and then someone comes around and says, ‘I may not be one of you, but I’m going to defend your views,’ they see that as loyalty,” Mr. Domenech said. “It’s a declaration of cultural war alliance. ” One quandary that Mr. Trump will surely face is meeting the expectations of a group of supporters so hungry for a victory after setting the bar so high. “The Trump administration presents us with a new opportunity: For the first time, really, we are able to interface with the federal government to achieve our goals,” said Dean Nelson, national outreach director of the Human Coalition, an   group. “We are cautiously optimistic. ”"

Share this...FacebookTwitterToo frail? Has Hillary Clinton shunned a visit to Louisiana because getting out and visiting flood victims would require her to spend extended time outside her fossil-fuel, air-conditioned comfort zone?
Hillary Clinton’s suspected major health issues refuse to go away as a political issue in this year’s election. The latest here, here and here.
Though claims that she may be “at death’s door” are certainly a stretch, her low frequency of appearances resembles a light workload one sees for a person in poor health.
A no-show in Louisiana
Yet another sign of poor health likely is Clinton’s absence from flood-stricken Louisiana. Heavy criticism has been launched at President Obama, who opted to play golf instead, but also at Clinton, who has mysteriously never shown up to lend support and let the victims know they are not alone. Moral support in times of crisis is crucial to the victims as they struggle to get back on their own feet.
How could Hillary not have shown up?
Trump is the only one who stepped up.
Not a picture of health
So why wouldn’t Clinton show up? Face it, the summertime climate in the Deep South region is hardly a favorable one for persons in poor health having to spend more than just a few minutes time outdoors fully exposed to the scorching heat and high humidity – away from their air-conditioned comfort zone. Hillary is probably unable to cope with it, and so was instructed by her doctor to just stay away. Especially the elderly and sick are advised to stay indoors and to drink plenty of fluids in times of heat.
And from appearance Clinton hardly projects a picture of health. She is pale, moves about cautiously, and often looks unsteady. She is also clearly overweight, and not just at the legs and hips, but at places where health experts agree are not where fat ought to be stored (visceral fat) – another sign of poor health.

Tucked away in air-conditioned comfort zone
A visit to flood victims would require Clinton to actually be out in the harsh elements, in full heat and high humidity for at least half an hour, something for which she likely is too frail to do. Trump, in contrast, was shown unloading supplies from a truck out in the burning sun and humidity. Clinton doing the same would be something her doctor would advise anyone in poor health not to do. Clinton sweating profusely and struggling to endure the heat would hardly make a good photo-op, and certainly not a heat stroke with cameras rolling.
To sick for a boat ride?
Clinton, who also claims to be a tireless warrior against man-made climate change and a champion of environmental protection, is also reported to have recently used her private jet and gas-guzzling SUV to travel a mere 20 or so miles. Ironically her protective, constantly air-conditioned comfort zones are powered in large part by fossil fuels, something she insists the rest of us should start learning to forego.

Image cropped from Google Maps
So why would she take a private jet to Nantucket instead of a boat?
Sure some people get queasy flying in an airplane, yet it is still in most cases far less turbulent than racing across the waves of the Atlantic in boat. The risk of sea sickness is much higher – especially when one’s health isn’t what it ought to be.
If Hillary Clinton is not up to visiting Louisiana, then she should issue a statement saying so. We could all understand and respect this. But instead, in typical Clinton style, she seems to cover it all up and insist she’s healthy. No one is buying it.

"Emergency services have urged the public to be aware of the dangers posed by strong winds in the wake of Storm Ellen. Gusts of up to 70mph could hit coastal areas on Friday, which when combined with high spring tides may trigger large waves and flooding.  Britain dodged the worst of the storm’s impact on Wednesday, but the Met Office is warning of another low pressure system bringing powerful winds that could cause disruption to travel and power supplies. Nearly 194,000 homes and businesses were hit by power cuts, and roads were blocked with fallen trees in Ireland as it bore the brunt of Storm Ellen this week. A yellow weather warning is running from 8pm on Thursday to 4am on Friday. It predicts further strong winds will hit much of Northern Ireland and the western coast of Britain, bringing potential disruption to travel and power supplies. Another yellow warning for strong winds is in place for England, Wales, and parts of Scotland from 4am until 6pm on Friday. Met Office meteorologist Matthew Box said: “Thursday’s warning in the west is for some very strong winds in that area associated with the low pressure that’s moving north-eastwards. “There’s going to be some squally heavy rain, chance of some thunder, widely 40 to 50mph gusts inland in the warning area.” He added that 70mph gusts could possibly hit coastal areas, with the strongest winds expected in the south-west of England and west of Wales in the earlier hours of Friday. The Environment Agency has issued 42 flood alerts and 19 flood warnings – which urge people to take immediate action – largely along the south and south-west coastline of England. They warn that a combination of high spring tides, strong winds and large waves are expected to cause property flooding on Thursday night or Friday morning. The agency warned people in the south-west to not “wave watch” and “stay away from sea promenades and exposed coastal areas”, with tidal gates being closed on Cornwall’s south coast. Natural Resources Wales has also issued seven flood warnings for the south-west coast of the country. Devon and Cornwall police have warned the public to be wary of “storm conditions” across their region, particularly on the coast where waves could reach up to 9 feet high. The force said strong winds could bring “dangerous seas and strong rip currents” and urged beachgoers to check tide times, stick to life-guarded beaches, be aware water sports may be unsafe and avoid storm watching."
"Christmas has passed and New Year is just around the corner. And the sales continue. Things started six weeks before Christmas with Singles Day, which began in China and is now the world’s biggest shopping day. This was followed by Black Friday, Cyber Monday sale, the pre-Christmas sales and now the period of post-Christmas or New Year sales. Soon it will be time for Valentine’s Day sales, Easter sales and so on. The sale events don’t seem to pause but instead persevere throughout the year and in various forms. For retailers, these sales are a great opportunity to liquidate unsold or off-season stock into cash, make room for new stock and cross-sell existing stock via impulse or unplanned buying. For consumers, sales provide one or more “legit reasons” for spending and gifting, either to oneself, others or a bit of both. Indulgent spending is expected and even encouraged when discounts or bargains are widely available to be snatched up.  Putting their benefits aside, sales also come with numerous costs. Emotionally, they may drive consumers to spend money they do not have and then feel regret or guilt afterwards. Financially, they may entrap shoppers into (more) financial debt because of the faux sense of “entitled” indulgence or spending when there is a sale on. Psychologically, it may exacerbate compulsive buying disorder, also known as “oniomania”, by legitimising gifting and spending.  All this adds up to some serious environmental costs. Marketing academics like me often assess how people act through certain “behavioural lenses”, and I think there are two that are applicable here: The throwaway lens, particularly visible in fashion, suggests that the more we buy, the more we throw away. While the correlation is yet to established empirically, it is logical to think that sales promote more buying and in turn mean there is more to throw away.

      Why you should stop buying new clothes


 This proposition can be supported by the phenomenon of dwindling living space. In the UK, bedrooms are shrinking and on average living rooms in new build homes are a third smaller than in the 1970s. But despite this, people are still buying a lot more stuff than in the 1970s. To make room for acquired sales items, people are likely to get rid of “pre-loved” items and harm the environment. For example, a UK parliament report in early 2019 found that in the country “around 300,000 tonnes of textile waste ends up in household black bins every year”, which is about 5kg per person. This is then sent to landfill or incinerators. The report notes that “less than 1%” of the material used to produce clothing is recycled. Our throwaway behaviour costs the planet.  The product returns lens suggests a possible correlation between sales and the rate of product returns. Sales such as Black Friday have become digitally-oriented, with around three quarters of purchases being made online.

      How to make your online shopping more environmentally friendly


 Online returns can involve a number of environmentally damaging activities. Consumers sending items back, and couriers collecting and redistributing them, all means extra driving and thus traffic congestion and carbon emissions. Cleaning, repairing and/or repackaging returned items mean consuming more natural resources and potentially using more materials that contain fossil fuels or palm oils. Processing, transporting and landfill of single-use or non-recyclable packaging used in returns mean more land use and a greater carbon footprint.  All of these activities are usually “invisible” to us, the consumer, and yet can have dire consequences for the environment. For instance, Vogue Business reported that in the US returns alone produce around 2.27 million tonnes of landfill waste and 15 million tonnes of carbon emissions each year, “equivalent to the amount of trash generated by 5 million people in a year”.  I don’t want to undermine the commercial value of sales nor the consumption joy they can bring when done wisely. However I cannot help wondering whether these sales can strike a balance between commercial, consumption and green value.  As we increasingly witness and experience the impacts of climate change, we do need to be (more) wary of our consumerist behaviours and subsequent environmental costs. A little thought for the environment might be just the way to enrich the shopping joy, or mitigate the spending guilt, experienced in sales events? Let’s spend (more) positively to protect our planet."
"Climate change is already affecting the amount of food that farmers can produce. Several recent extreme weather events, which are only likely to become more frequent as the world continues heating up, provide stark illustrations of what this impact can look like. For example, crop sowing in the UK was delayed in autumn 2019 and some emerging crops were damaged because of wet weather. Meanwhile in Australia, considerable drought has been immensely damaging.  But climate change can also have a knock-on impact on farming by affecting the quality of seeds, making it harder to establish seedlings that then grow into mature, food-producing plants. My research group has recently published a study showing that even brief periods of high temperature or drought can reduce seed quality in rice, depending on exactly when they occur in the seed’s development. Nonetheless, it is possible to breed improved varieties to help crops adapt to the changing climate. And the resources needed to do this are being collected and conserved in “genebanks”, libraries of seeds conserving crop plant diversity for future use.  In much of the developing world in particular, the supply of affordable, good-quality seed limits farmers’ ability to establish crops. Seeds need to be stored between harvest and later sowing and poor-quality seeds don’t survive very long in storage. Once planted, low-quality seeds are less likely to emerge as seedlings and more likely to fail later on, producing a lower plant density in the field and a lower crop yield as a result. For this reason, investigating seed quality is an important way of assessing such effects of climate on cereal crop production. We already know that climate change can reduce the quality of cereal seeds used for food, food ingredients and for planting future crops.  The main factor that affects seed quality in this way tends to be temperature, but the amount and timing of rainfall is also important. This impact can come from changes in average weather patterns, but short periods of extreme temperature or rainfall are just as important when they coincide with sensitive stages in crop development. For example, research in the 1990s revealed that brief high temperature periods during and immediately before a crop flowers reduces the number of seeds produced and therefore the resulting grain yield in many cereal crops. Our research has now confirmed that seed quality in rice is damaged most when brief hot spells coincide with early seed development. It also revealed that drought during the early development of the seeds also reduces their quality at maturity. And, unsurprisingly, the damage is even greater when both these things happen together. In contrast, warmer temperatures later in the maturation process can benefit rice seed quality as the seeds dry out. But flooding that submerges the seed can also cause damage, which gets worse the later it occurs during maturation. This shows why we have to include the effects of changing rainfall as well as temperature and the precise timing of extreme weather when looking at how seed quality is affected. Our research has also shown that different seed varieties have different levels of resilience to these environmental stresses. This means that farming in the future will depend on selecting and breeding the right varieties to respond to the changing climate.

      How gardeners are reclaiming agriculture from industry, one seed at a time


 The world now has a global network of genebanks storing seeds from a wide variety of plants, which helps safeguard their genetic diversity. For example, the International Rice Genebank maintains more than 130,000 samples of cultivated species of rice, its wild relatives and closely-related species, while the AfricaRice genebank maintains 20,000 samples. Our finding mean that, when scientists breed new crop varieties using genebank samples as “parents”, they should include the ability to produce high-quality seed in stressful environments in the variety’s selected traits.

We hear the constant dripping tap of the doomsters telling us we must embrace renewable energy, like wind. Quite apart from the bird mincing, the rare earth metal mining, the concrete, the noise pollution, the visual pollution, and their inefficiency, it turns out that [they aren’t very green at all and can’t be recycled](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2020-02-05/wind-turbine-blades-can-t-be-recycled-so-they-re-piling-up-in-landfills). 



A wind turbine’s blades can be longer than a Boeing 747 wing, so at the end of their lifespan **they can’t just be hauled away**. First, you need to **saw through the lissome fiberglass using a diamond-encrusted industrial saw** to create three pieces small enough to be strapped to a tractor-trailer.



The municipal landfill in Casper, Wyoming, is the final resting place of 870 blades whose days making renewable energy have come to end. **The severed fragments look like bleached whale bones nestled against one another.**



“That’s the end of it for this winter,” said waste technician Michael Bratvold, watching a bulldozer bury them forever in sand. “We’ll get the rest when the weather breaks this spring.”



 **Tens of thousands of aging blades are coming down from steel towers around the world and most have nowhere to go but landfills.** In the U.S. alone, about 8,000 will be removed in each of the next four years. Europe, which has been dealing with the problem longer, has about 3,800 coming down annually through at least 2022, according to BloombergNEF. It’s going to get worse: Most were built more than a decade ago, when installations were less than a fifth of what they are now.



This is the type of thing the facepalm emoji was invented for. 



What do you do with non-recyclable renewable energy components?



Built to withstand hurricane-force winds, the blades can’t easily be crushed, recycled or repurposed. That’s created an urgent search for alternatives in places that lack wide-open prairies. In the U.S., they go to the handful of landfills that accept them, in Lake Mills, Iowa; Sioux Falls, South Dakota; and Casper, where they will be interred in stacks that reach 30 feet under.



“The wind turbine blade will be there, ultimately, forever,” said Bob Cappadona, chief operating officer for the North American unit of Paris-based [Veolia Environnement SA](https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/VIE:FP), which is searching for better ways to deal with the massive waste. “Most landfills are considered a dry tomb.”



“The last thing we want to do is create even more environmental challenges.”



But that is exactly what they have done.



To prevent catastrophic climate change caused by burning fossil fuels, many governments and corporations have **pledged to use only clean energy** by 2050. **Wind energy is one of the cheapest ways to reach that goal.**



Except it turns out that wind is far from clean. Now even the blades are cluttering up landfills. Basically the entire industry is built on a fraud that it is clean. And the news gets worse: even disposing of them isn’t anywhere near green.



Wind power is carbon-free and about 85% of turbine components, including steel, copper wire, electronics and gearing can be recycled or reused. But **the fiberglass blades remain difficult to dispose of.** With **some as long as a football field, big rigs can only carry one at a time, making transportation costs prohibitive for long-distance hauls.** Scientists are **trying to find better ways to separate resins from fibers** or to give small chunks new life as pellets or boards.



The inconvenient carbon footprint of large trucks to haul them away, and one can only imagine the chemicals being investigated to separate resins from fibres. 



Dirty, dirty wind turbines. Tell me again, **James Shaw** , why wind turbines are so clean.

"Iron and steel are components of an almost limitless number of infrastructure and consumer goods. From forks to tanks, syringes to satellites, cars to computers, from buildings to the power stations that electrify them, around 1.4 billion tonnes of steel is made each year.  But manufacturing iron and steel is an energy intensive process that demands huge amounts of power and heat to reach the high temperatures required for smelting and shaping the metal. This means burning considerable amounts of fossil fuels, which in turn generates huge amounts of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases. It is a dirty business, which makes the need for a means to clean it up all the more pressing.  Current methods used to remove CO2 from exhaust gases require expensive “scrubbers” using caustic chemical solvents such as monoethanolamine (MEA). Instead, a new method developed for the steel industry uses the iron ore itself. Producing steel from iron ore involves two stages. The first burns limestone and coke (burnt, entirely carbonised coal) as a reducing agent with iron ore in a blast furnace to form iron metal, which requires temperatures of more than 1,300°C. Natural gas can also be used to reduce iron ore. The second stage combines purifying the iron metal to form crude steel, adding small amounts of other alloying elements such as nickel, manganese or chromium to encourage certain properties. The crude steel is then shaped into a finished product such as rolled, tube or sheet steel. About 70% of the overall carbon cost is consumed just in making the iron alone. Worldwide, each ton of steel on average emits 2.2 tonnes of CO2. After electricity-generating power plants, iron making produces the highest quantity of greenhouse gases, with cement a close third. Considerable efforts have been made in the iron and steel industry to improve techniques in order to reduce emissions. Some require modifications to the blast furnace method, and others do not. The Ultra-Low Carbon dioxide Steel-making (ULCOS) consortium of 48 companies and organisations from 15 European countries assessed 80 different technologies. Two of these, Top Gas Recycling in Sweden, and the Hisarna process, in the Netherlands, have been tested on a pilot scale. Two others, COURSE-50 in Japan and POSCO in Korea, are also testing carbon capture and storage (CCS) programmes. But none of these technologies have been implemented on a large scale. Our proposed carbon dioxide capture technique is based on the widely accepted carbonation-calcination cycle, which scrubs CO2 from exhaust gases by reacting it with calcium (in the form of lime) to form calcium carbonates. Instead of lime, whose ability to absorb CO2 degrades over time, our technique uses magnetite (Fe3O4) or hematite (Fe2O3) iron ores mixed with iron as an input to the carbonation process. It is recommended but pure iron is not necessarily required. Any material which is easily available and has significant iron content can also be equally good. Exhaust gas from a blast furnace contains a mix of gases including carbon dioxide (CO2, 17-25%), carbon monoxide (CO, 20-28%), hydrogen, (H2, 1-5%), and nitrogen (N2, 50-55%). During carbonation, the iron oxides combine with CO2 to form siderite (FeCO3). The iron oxides can be magnetically separated from the product mixture and sent back as inputs to the carbonation process. The siderite is sent for calcination, where it is broken down into more iron oxides and pure CO2 gas. The pure CO2 gas stream can be compressed, liquefied, and put to industrial or commercial uses, or sequestered as part of a CCS strategy. All the regenerated iron oxides can be delivered back to the carbonation reactor for the next carbonation-calcination cycle. After a large number of such cycles, the CO2 absorption capacity of iron oxide degrades. But of course as this is a steel plant, the iron oxide can still serve its original purpose of making iron and steel by being dispatched to the blast furnace. In this way, there is little or no loss of raw materials, and no chemicals and solvents required. Additionally, the calcination reaction creates heat, and the carbonation reaction requires it – the system is well balanced and efficient. Proved in the laboratory, this technique undoubtedly has the potential to alleviate the huge costs of extra energy and raw materials needed in conventional methods, as well as reducing transportation and handling costs. Everything needed is already at the site."

Both of these factors are weather events, not climate events:

The new findings show that a pregnant woman’s exposure to reduced precipitation and an increased number of very hot days indeed results in lower birth weight.

One wonders if they might find correlations to more days days with high rainfall (seasonal monsoon) and cold days (winter) as well, if they looked. As I understand biology, any stress like this in early development can show up  later.

From melting glaciers to increasing wildfires, the consequences of climate change and strategies to mitigate such consequences are often a hotly debated topic. A new study led by the University of Utah adds to the ever-growing list of negative impacts climate change can have on humans–low birth weight.
The first of its kind, the two-year project led by U geography professor Kathryn Grace examined the relationship among precipitation, temperature and birth weight in 19 African countries. Grace and her team utilized high quality, detailed climate data in conjunction with extensive health data to focus on climate change and its effects on birth weight in the developing world.
The new findings show that a pregnant woman’s exposure to reduced precipitation and an increased number of very hot days indeed results in lower birth weight.
“Our findings demonstrate that in the very early stages of intra-uterine development, climate change has the potential to significantly impact birth outcomes. While the severity of that impact depends on where the pregnant woman lives, in this case the developing world, we can see the potential for similar outcomes everywhere,” said Grace.
The other authors are Frank Davenport, Heidi Hanson, Christopher Funk and Shraddhanand Shukla. The team reported the findings in Global Environmental Change. Christopher Funk (US Geological Survey) and UC Santa Barbara Climate Hazards Group provided the climate data used in the study, and have just detailed exceptional East African rainfall declines in a new paper in Nature Scientific Data.
Impacts of low birth weight are far-reaching
With the inaccuracy of determining exactly when a pregnancy began in rural countries which lack pregnancy tests and the inability to measure characteristics like a newborn’s cognitive development, low birth weight is the most reliable measure of whether a pregnancy has been negatively affected by an external factor. Low birth weight is defined by the World Health Organization as any baby born under 2,500 grams.
Low birth weight infants are more susceptible to illness, face a higher risk of mortality, are more likely to develop disabilities and are less likely to attain the same level of education and income as an infant born within a healthy weight range.
Consequently, the financial burden of a low birth weight infant can be significant. The costs of newborn intensive care unit stays and services, re-hospitalization and long-term morbidity can add up quickly, and in developing countries where such support services are less common and physical disability is considered a social stigma, low birth weight can be particularly impactful.
The first continent-wide analysis
In 2013, Grace and colleagues combined health data from Demographic and Health Surveys, which is funded by the United States Agency for International Development to collect and disseminate data on health and population in developing countries, and growing season data, with temperature and rainfall data from a variety of sources.
The team collected growing and livelihood zone information from the U.S. Agency for International Development’s Famine Early Warning System program and precipitation data from the Climate Hazards Group InfraRed Precipitation with Station data set.
In total, the team examined nearly 70,000 births in 19 African countries between 1986 and 2010 and matched these births with seasonal rainfall and air temperatures, as well as variables describing the mother and mother’s household, such as education level and whether the household had access to electricity.
This is the first time researchers utilized fine-resolution precipitation and temperature data alongside birth data to analyze how weather impacts birth weight.
To generate precipitation records for each birth, the team calculated the average precipitation for a given month within 10 km of the child’s birth location. This was done for each month up to one year prior to each child’s birth. The values were then summed over each trimester.
The same method was used to generate temperature records for each birth. The team first calculated the maximum daily temperature for a given calendar day within 10 km of a child’s birth location. From there, the number of days in each birth month where the temperature exceeded 105 F and 100 F as the maximum daily temperature were summed over trimesters.
Evidence and impact of climate change
The results show that an increase of hot days above 100 F during any trimester corresponds to a decrease in birth weight. In fact, just one extra day with a temperature above 100 F in the second trimester corresponded to a 0.9 g weight decrease; this result held with a larger effect when the temperature threshold was increased to 105 F.
Conversely, higher amounts of precipitation during any trimester resulted in larger birth weights. On average, a 10 mm increase in precipitation during a particular trimester corresponds to an approximate increase in birth weight of around 0.3-0.5 g.
“While the results are dependent on trimester and location, the data shows that climate change–a combination of increased hot days and decreased precipitation–correlate to lower birth weights,” said Grace.
“At the end of the day, the services we invest in to support these developing countries won’t reap the same level of benefits as long as climate change continues. Services such as education, clean water efforts and nutrition support won’t be as effective. We need to work faster and differently to combat the evident stresses caused by climate change.”

From the “methane is scarier when it comes from Jack-o-lanterns” department.
Guest essay by Eric Worrall
The US Department of Energy has issued a (serious) press release which suggests that Halloween pumpkins contribute significantly to global warming.
To commemorate National Energy Action Month, we’re featuring some scarily effective ways to save energy at home. As cooler weather lurks around the corner, tune in to Energy.gov all week long for ways to save energy and money—and avoid cold weather terrors like energy vampires. We also put together some energy-themed pumpkin patterns to help “energize” your neighborhood for Halloween. Send us photos of your energy-themed jack-o-lanterns via Twitter,Instagram, Facebook or email at newmedia@hq.doe.gov and we’ll share our favorites.
With the passing of Halloween, millions of pounds of pumpkins have turned from seasonal decorations to trash destined for landfills, adding to more than 254 million tons of municipal solid waste (MSW) produced in the United States every year. This Halloween, think of turning this seasonal waste into energy as a very important “trick” that can have a positive environmental and energy impact.
At landfills, MSW decomposes and eventually turns into methane—a harmful greenhouse gas that plays a part in climate change, with more than 20 times the warming effect of carbon dioxide (CO2). However, when MSW is used to harness bioenergy—rather than simply being thrown away—the end result benefits the environment and helps our nation become less dependent on carbon-based fuel. Harnessing the potential of bioenergy allows the United States to generate its own supply of clean energy that reduces greenhouse gas emissions. It also limits stress on landfills by reducing waste and could ultimately create jobs for manufacturing, installing, and maintaining energy systems.
The Energy Department’s Bioenergy Technologies Office is working together with industry to develop and test integrated biorefineries—facilities capable of efficiently converting plant and waste material into affordable biofuels, biopower and other products. These projects are located around the country and use a variety of materials as feedstocks.
One of them, Fulcrum Bioenergy’s biorefinery in McCarran, Nevada, will use MSW as a feedstock and use gasification and Fischer-Tröpsch conversion technology to produce “drop-in” biofuel for the military.
Fulcrum Bioenergy was one of three companies selected to receive federal investments for commercial-scale biorefinery projects to produce military-grade biofuel that can be directly substituted for petroleum-derived jet and diesel fuel. Another one of these projects, from Emerald Biofuels, will use a different type of waste—fats, oils, and greases—as a feedstock that will be hydro-treated and upgraded at its refinery on the Gulf Coast.
Once in full operation, these two biorefineries will have a combined capacity to produce 92 million gallons of advanced biofuel per year for the military. Fulcrum has since received a $30 million investment from United Airlines and has entered into a long-term jet fuel supply agreement with Hong Kong-based airline Cathay Pacific.
The Energy Department is working to expand waste-to-energy opportunities in the United States, and its partnership with these companies is helping to remove barriers to the commercialization of fuel and power production from waste, including yard and food wastes. It might not be long until the 1.3 billion pounds of pumpkins we produce annually are nearly as important to our energy security as they are to Halloween!

Isn’t it reassuring, that money you would have frittered away on healthcare, education for your kids, saving for your retirement, or just having a good time, has been taken away from you as taxes, so it can be invested wisely on your behalf into defeating the pumpkin climate menace.

"MEXICO CITY  —   President Donald J. Trump’s decision to build a wall along the southern border escalated into a diplomatic standoff on Thursday, with Mexico’s president publicly canceling a scheduled meeting at the White House and Mr. Trump firing back, accusing Mexico of burdening the United States with illegal immigrants, criminals and a trade deficit. Mr. Trump’s push to fulfill his campaign pledge and build a border wall brought to a head months of simmering tensions, culminating in a remarkable    between the two leaders. By afternoon, Mr. Trump’s spokesman said the president would pay for the border wall by imposing a 20 percent tax on imports to the United States, which he said would raise billions of dollars. The sparring began Thursday morning when the president of Mexico announced on Twitter that he was canceling his meeting with Mr. Trump next week, rejecting the visit after the new American leader ordered the border wall between the two nations. Having called for dialogue in the face of Mr. Trump’s vows to build a wall during the American presidential campaign, President Enrique Peña Nieto ultimately bowed to public pressure in Mexico to respond more forcefully to his northern neighbor. On Wednesday, Mr. Trump signed an executive order to beef up the nation’s deportation force and start construction on a new wall along the border. Adding to the perceived insult was the timing of the order: It came on the first day of talks between top Mexican officials and their counterparts in Washington, and just days before the meeting between the two presidents. Mr. Trump’s action was enough to prompt Mr. Peña Nieto to start discussing whether to scrap his plans to visit the White House, according to Mexican officials. In a video message delivered over Twitter on Wednesday night, Mr. Peña Nieto reiterated his commitment to protect the interests of Mexico and the Mexican people, and he chided the move in Washington to continue with the wall. “I regret and condemn the United States’ decision to continue with the construction of a wall that, for years now, far from uniting us, divides us,” he said. Then on Thursday morning, Mr. Trump fired back, warning that he might cancel the meeting himself if Mexico did not agree to pay for the wall. Just before Mr. Trump fired off his Twitter post, the Mexican foreign minister and Mr. Trump’s Homeland Security secretary, John F. Kelly, were preparing to see each other for a scheduled 11:30 a. m. meeting. According to a senior American official, the secretary had been briefed. The appropriate flags had been arranged by the protocol staff at the Department of Homeland Security. Then, just as American officials greeted the minister outside the department’s headquarters in Northwest Washington, the minister received word from Mexico that he was being pulled back, the official said. The meeting never happened. By early afternoon, Mr. Trump said it was the United States that was being treated unfairly. “We have agreed to cancel our planned meeting,” Mr. Trump said in a new conference Thursday afternoon. “Unless Mexico is going to treat the U. S. fairly, with respect, such a meeting would be fruitless, and I want to go a different route. We have no choice. ” In Mexico, Mr. Peña Nieto had little political room to maneuver. With Mr. Trump’s order to build the wall, the perceived insults Mexico had endured during the campaign had finally turned into action. Decades of friendly relations between the nations  —   on matters involving trade, security and migration  —   seemed to be unraveling. Calls began to come in from across the political spectrum for Mr. Peña Nieto to cancel his visit, and to respond with greater fortitude to the perceived menace from President Trump. On Twitter, Mr. Trump’s action was referred to by politicians and historians as a “an offense to Mexico,” a “slap in the face” and a “monument to lies. ” Historians said that not since President Calvin Coolidge threatened to invade a “Soviet Mexico” had the United States so deeply antagonized the Mexican populace. “It is an unprecedented moment for the bilateral relationship,” said Genaro Lozano, a professor at the Iberoamerican University in Mexico City. “In the 19th century, we fought a war with the U. S. now we find ourselves in a   war, a commercial one over Nafta and an immigration war due to the measures he just announced. ”"
"A slump in UK consumer spending during the coronavirus lockdown has erased almost the same carbon emissions as produced by the city of Nottingham in a year, according to a new report. Carbon emissions from the UK’s main consumer industries tumbled by more than a quarter during the national coronavirus lockdown as people travelled less and cut down on clothes shopping. A study by Carbon Trust, using spending data from over 3 million Lloyds Banking customers, found that the sudden drop in spending between the end of March and early July caused carbon emissions to fall by 4.3m tonnes, or 27%, compared with the same months last year. The study looked at the lockdown spending data from Lloyds customers to measure the change in spending habits, and used data from the Office for National Statistics to estimate the carbon impact. It found that carbon emissions over the year to date are likely to be 14% lower than they were at this time last year after spending remained weaker than usual even as lockdown restrictions eased through July and the first half of August. The biggest slump in emissions was triggered by the severe restrictions on travel which cut spending on plane tickets, road fuels and commuting to wipe a total of 4.76m tonnes of carbon dioxide emissions from the UK economy. Meanwhile, lower spending on clothing may have cut emissions from clothing stores by 620,000 tonnes of carbon dioxide. The collapse in transport emissions more than offset the rise in carbon caused by higher spending on deliveries of supermarket groceries and electronic goods as lockdown measures were put in place across the country, the report found. Experts have warned that the temporary dip in carbon emissions due to Covid-19 is unlikely to have a meaningful impact on averting a global climate crisis. But Myles McCarthy, a director at the Carbon Trust, said the pandemic lockdown may help to increase the public’s awareness of how their habits have an impact on the environment, which could lead to longer term changes in behaviour. “The changes in spending were driven by a global pandemic not by choice, but our analysis of Lloyds Banking Group customer spending does demonstrate the link between the actions we take in our everyday lives and the impact these have on the level of carbon emissions, a major cause of climate change,” he said. A separate survey from YouGov, commissioned by Lloyds Bank, found that a third of UK adults intend to keep their carbon footprints in check after the lockdown, by changing the way they travel and shop. “We have an opportunity to build on this increased awareness and create the low carbon businesses and infrastructure to help people reduce their impact on the environment,” McCarthy added."
"Greenland has lost 3.8 trillion tonnes of ice since 1992, according to our latest research. It can be hard to imagine a number that big: 3.8 trillion tonnes is 3,800 billion tonnes or even 3.8 million billion kilograms. If you put all that ice into a single cube it would be 16 kilometres along each side and twice the height of Mount Everest.  But what’s really important here is the impact this has globally. All that ice making its way into the ocean has already caused the sea level to rise by more than a centimetre, and future sea level rise will mean lots more coastal flooding.  For example, a rise of 60cm by the year 2100, as predicted by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), would put 200 million people at risk of permanent inundation and 360 million people at risk of annual flooding. And 60cm is only the IPCC’s “central estimate” – in that period the sea could rise by as little as 28cm or as much as 98cm. By far the largest uncertainty in sea-level projections concerns the ice stored in Antarctica and Greenland, both of which have complex interactions with the climate system and are difficult to model. Greenland alone holds enough frozen water to raise the sea by 7.4 metres were it to melt. Therefore, finding out how much ice it has lost so far is hugely important for us scientists who are trying to determine how much it will contribute to sea level rise in future. This is why we used satellites to measure Greenland’s ice loss between 1992 and 2018. Our assessment, now published in the journal Nature, is produced by an international team of scientists who combined the results of 26 different surveys as part of a programme known as the ice sheet mass balance inter-comparison exercise (IMBIE). In all, measurements from 11 different satellite missions launched by the European Space Agency and NASA were used to track changes in the ice sheet’s volume, speed and gravity. We found that the Greenland ice sheet lost around 3,800 billion tons of ice in that 26-year period. This is enough water to cause the sea level to rise by around 10.6mm.  Although Greenland has been losing ice since the early 1990s, the rate has increased dramatically over time and peaked at 335 billion tons per year in 2011 towards the end of a period of intense surface melting. In fact, almost half of the ice loss occurred between 2006 and 2012 and, although cooler atmospheric conditions – associated with a shift of the North Atlantic Oscillation – followed, the rate of ice loss has remained high since then. How does an ice sheet actually “lose ice”? In Antarctica, almost all the losses come from glaciers being warmed to the point where they slide slightly faster into the ocean and “calve” into icebergs. This happens in Greenland too. But Greenland also has much warmer summers than Antarctica, and this means around half of its ice is also lost through summer melting exceeding winter snowfall.  Periods of extreme melting have become more frequent in Greenland, with record air temperatures being repeatedly broken. In summer 2019, unusually warm air caused widespread melting across the entire ice sheet. Satellites revealed new ponds of surface meltwater and bridges collapsed after the intense runoff swelled proglacial rivers. If glacier speeds remain high, 2019 could be a record year for total ice loss from Greenland. In its fifth assessment report, the IPCC included a range of projections for Greenland ice sheet losses. Our study shows that the ice sheet has been tracking the upper range of these projections – the worst case scenarios – which predicts an additional 10cm of global sea level rise by 2100 over and above the central estimate. This would place a further 60 million people at risk of annual coastal flooding and suggests that a reassessment of the impacts of climate warming is urgently needed.

You Ought to Have a Look _is a feature from the Center for the Study of Science posted by Patrick J. Michaels and Paul C. (“Chip”) Knappenberger. While this section will feature all of the areas of interest that we are emphasizing, the prominence of the climate issue is driving a tremendous amount of web traffic. Here we post a few of the best in recent days, along with our color commentary._   
  
\--------   
  
A favorite global warming chesnut is that human-caused climate change will make the planet uninhabitable for _Homo sapiens_ (that’s us). The latest iteration of this cli-fi classic appears in this week's _New York Times'_ coverage of the U.N. climate talks taking place in Lima, Peru (talks that are destined to fail, as we point out here).   
  
Back in September, The World Health Organization (WHO) released a study claiming that global warming as a result of our pernicious economic activity will lead to a quarter million extra deaths each year during 2030 to 2050. Yup, starting a mere 15 years from today. Holy cats!   
  
That raised the antennae of Indur M. Goklany, a science and technical policy analyst who studies humanity’s well-being and the impact of environmental change upon it. Goklany detailed many of his findings in a 2007 book he wrote for Cato, _The Improving State of the World: Why We’re Living Longer, Healthier, More Comfortable Lives on a Cleaner Planet_.   
  
As you may imagine, Goklany, found much at fault with the WHO study and wrote his findings up for the Global Warming Policy Foundation (GWPF)—a U.K. think tank which produces a lot of good material on global warming.   
  
In “Unhealthy Exaggeration: The WHO report on climate change” Goklany doesn’t pull any punches. You ought to have a look at the full report, but in the meantime, here is the Summary:   




In the run-up to the UN climate summit in September 2014, the World Health Organization (WHO) released, with much fanfare, a study that purported to show that global warming will exacerbate under nutrition (hunger), malaria, dengue, excessive heat and coastal flooding and thereby cause 250,000 additional deaths annually between 2030 and 2050. This study, however, is fundamentally flawed.   
  
Firstly, it uses climate model results that have been shown to run at least three times hotter than empirical reality (0.15◦C vs 0.04◦C per decade, respectively), despite using 27% lower greenhouse gas forcing.   
  
Secondly, it ignores the fact that people and societies are not potted plants; that they will actually take steps to reduce, if not nullify, real or perceived threats to their life, limb and well-being. Thus, if the seas rise around them, heatwaves become more prevalent, or malaria, diarrhoeal disease and hunger spread, they will undertake adaptation measures to protect themselves and reduce, if not eliminate, the adverse consequences. This is not a novel concept. Societies have been doing just this for as long as such threats have been around, and over time and as technology has advanced they have gotten better at it. Moreover, as people have become wealthier, these technologies have become more affordable. Consequently, global mortality rates from malaria and extreme weather events, for instance, have been reduced at least five-fold in the past 60 years.   
  
Yet, the WHO study assumes, explicitly or implicitly, that in the future the most vulnerable populations – low income countries in Africa, Europe, southeast Asia and the western Pacific – will not similarly avail themselves of technology or take any commonsense steps to protect themselves. This is despite many suitable measures already existing – adapting to sea level rise for example – while others are already at the prototype stage and are being further researched and developed: early-warning systems for heatwaves or the spread of malaria or steps to improve sanitation, hygiene or the safety of drinking water.   
  
Finally, the WHO report assumes, erroneously, if the IPCC’s Fifth Assessment Report is to be believed, that carbon dioxide levels above 369 ppm – today we are at 400ppm and may hit 650ppm if the scenario used by the WHO is valid – will have no effect on crop yields. Therefore, even if one assumes that the relationships between climatic variables and mortality used by the WHO study are valid, the methodologies and assumptions used by WHO inevitably exaggerate future mortality increases attributable to global warming, perhaps several-fold.

“By the year 2000 the United Kingdom will be simply a small group of impoverished islands, inhabited by some 70 million hungry people … If I were a gambler, I would take even money that England will not exist in the year 2000.” -Paul Ehrlich, Speech at British Institute For Biology, September 1971   
  
Some predictions for the next decade (1990’s) are not difficult to make… Americans may see the ’80s migration to the Sun Belt reverse as a global warming trend rekindles interest in cooler climates. -Dallas Morning News December 5th 1989   
  
Giant sand dunes may turn Plains to desert – Huge sand dunes extending east from Colorado’s Front Range may be on the verge of breaking through the thin topsoil, transforming America’s rolling High Plains into a desert, new research suggests. The giant sand dunes discovered in NASA satellite photos are expected to re- emerge over the next 20 to 50 years, depending on how fast average temperatures rise from the suspected “greenhouse effect,” scientists believe. -Denver Post April 18, 1990



There are many more where these came from. To lighten your day, you ought to have a look!

This article presents a method for calculating the Earth’s rate of warming, using the existing global temperature series.
Guest essay by Sheldon Walker
It can be difficult to work out the Earth’s rate of warming. There are large variations in temperature from month to month, and different rates can be calculated depending upon the time interval and the end points chosen. A reasonable estimate can be made for long time intervals (100 years for example), but it would be useful if we could calculate the rate of warming for medium or short intervals. This would allow us to determine whether the rate of warming was increasing, decreasing, or staying the same.
The first step in calculating the Earth’s rate of warming is to reduce the large month to month variation in temperature, being careful not to lose any key information. The central moving average (CMA) is a mathematical method that will achieve this. It is important to choose an averaging interval that will meet the objectives. Calculating the average over 121 months (the month being calculated, plus 60 months on either side), gives a good reduction in the variation from month to month, without the loss of any important detail.
Graph 1 shows the GISTEMP temperature series. The blue line shows the raw temperature anomaly, and the green line shows the 121 month central moving average. The central moving average curve has little month to month variation, but clearly shows the medium and long term temperature trend.

The second step in calculating the Earth’s rate of warming is to determine the slope of the central moving average curve, for each month on the time axis. The central moving slope (CMS) is a mathematical method that will achieve this. This is similar to the central moving average, but instead of calculating an average for the points in the interval, a linear regression is done between the points in the interval and the time axis (the x-axis). This gives the slope of the central moving average curve, which is a temperature change per time interval, or rate of warming. In order to avoid dealing with small numbers, all rates of warming in this article will be given in °C per century.
It is important to choose the correct time interval to calculate the slope over. This should make the calculated slope responsive to real changes in the slope of the CMA curve, but not excessively responsive. Calculating the slope over 121 months (the month being calculated plus 60 months on either side), gives a slope with a good degree of sensitivity.
Graph 2 shows the rate of warming curve for the GISTEMP temperature series. The blue line is the 121 month central moving slope (CMS), calculated for the central moving average curve. The y-axis shows the rate of warming in °C per century, and the x-axis shows the year. When the rate of warming curve is in the lower part of the graph ( colored light blue), then it shows cooling (the rate of warming is below zero). When the rate of warming curve is in the upper part of the graph ( colored light orange), then it shows warming (the rate of warming is above zero).

The curve shows 2 major periods of cooling since 1880. Each lasted approximately a decade (1900 to 1910, and 1942 to 1952), and reached cooling rates of about -2.0 °C per century. There is a large interval of continuous warming from 1910 to 1942 (about 32 years). This reached a maximum rate of warming of about +2.8 °C per century around 1937. 1937 is the year with the highest rate of warming since the start of the GISTEMP series in 1880 (more on that later).
There is another large interval of continuous warming from about 1967 to the present day (about 48 years). This interval has 2 peaks at about 1980 and 1998, where the rates of warming were just under +2.4 °C per century. The rate of warming has been falling steadily since the last peak in 1998. In 2015, the rate of warming is between +0.5 and +0.8 °C per century, which is about 30% of the rate in 1998. (Note that all of these rates of warming were calculated AFTER the so‑called “Pause-busting” adjustments were made. More on that later.)
It is important to check that the GISTEMP rate of warming curve is consistent with the curves from the other temperature series (including the satellite series).
Graph 3 shows the rate of warming curves for GISTEMP, NOAA, UAH, and RSS. (Note that the satellite temperature series did not exist before 1979.)

All of the rate of warming curves show good agreement with each other. Peaks and troughs line up, and the numerical values for the rates of warming are similar. Both of the satellite series appear to have a larger change in the rate of warming when compared to the surface series, but both satellite series are in good agreement with each other.
Some points about this method:
1) There is no cherry-picking of start and end times with this method. The entire temperature series is used.
2) The rate of warming curves from different series can be directly compared with each other, no adjustment is needed for the different baseline periods. This is because the rate of warming is based on the change in temperature with time, which is the same regardless of the baseline period.
3) This method can be performed by anybody with a moderate level of skill using a spreadsheet. It only requires the ability to calculate averages, and perform linear regressions.
4) The first and last 5 years of each rate of warming curve has more uncertainty than the rest of the curve. This is due to the lack of data beyond the ends of the curve.  It is important to realise that the last 5 years of the curve may change when future temperatures are added.
There is a lot that could be said about these curves. One topic that is “hot” at the moment, is the “Pause” or “Hiatus”.
The rate of warming curves for all 4 major temperature series show that there has been a significant drop in the rate of warming over the last 17 years. In 1998 the rate of warming was between +2.0 and +2.5 °C per century. Now, in 2015, it is between +0.5 and +0.8 °C per century. The rate now is only about 30% of what it was in 1998.  Note that these rates of warming were calculated AFTER the so-called “Pause-busting” adjustments were made.
I was originally using the GISTEMP temperature series ending with May 2015, when I was developing the method described here. When I downloaded the series ending with June 2015 and graphed it, I thought that there must be something wrong with my computer program, because the rate of warming curve had changed so dramatically. I eventually traced the “problem” back to the data, and then I read that GISTEMP had adopted the “Pause-busting” adjustments that NOAA had devised.
Graph 4 shows the effect on the rate of warming curve, of the GISTEMP “Pause-busting” adjustments. The blue line shows the rates from the May 2015 data, and the red line shows the rates from the June 2015 data.

One of the strange things about the GISTEMP “Pause-busting” adjustments, is that the year with the highest rate of warming (since 1880) has changed. It used to be around 1998, with a warming rate of about +2.4 °C per century. After the adjustments, it moved to around 1937 (that’s right, 1937, back when the CO2 level was only about 300 ppm), with a warming rate of about +2.8 °C per century.
If you look at the NOAA series, they already had 1937 as the year with the highest rate of warming, so GISTEMP must have picked it up from NOAA when they switched to the new NCEI ERSST.v4 sea surface temperature reconstruction.
So, the next time that you hear somebody claiming that Global Warming is accelerating, show them a graph of the rate of warming. Some climate scientists seem to enjoy telling us that things are worse than predicted. Here is a chance to cheer them up with some good news. Somehow I don’t think that they will want to hear it.

"This is the first UK general election during which environmental issues are playing a prominent role in the campaign. Numerous scientific reports emphasising the urgent need for action on the climate crisis have helped Extinction Rebellion, David Attenborough, Greta Thunberg and the school climate strikes to grab media attention. Finally, this is reflected in most political parties’ manifestos. And for the first time, most party leaders will go head to head in a televised climate debate. Concerns about the climate may even shape the way many people cast their vote. Typically, well under 10% of the electorate identify the environment as one of the major issues facing the country. But this election, the figure has soared: today, around a quarter of voters do.  While all the established parties have made climate pledges, it is Labour that has seemingly undergone the most profound transformation through its embrace of a green industrial revolution. This has always been the Green Party’s raison d’etre. But with Labour, a mainstream party, colonising traditional green territory, what is the point of the Green Party now? Labour’s manifesto certainly reflects the huge shift in party policy since the launch of its new environmental programme a year ago.  A £250 billion “Green Transformation Fund”, partly funded by a windfall tax on the oil (but not gas) industry, will be used to create a million “climate jobs” that will provide renewable and low-carbon energy and transport, and environmental protection. Labour also sets some very ambitious targets: aiming to deliver nearly 90% of electricity and 50% of heat from renewable and low-carbon sources (notably wind, solar and nuclear) by 2030. The party also promises to upgrade “almost all” of the UK’s 27m homes to the highest energy efficiency standards, decreasing demand (and bills).  Significantly, the overarching target to achieve a “substantial majority of our emissions reductions by 2030” does represent a weakening of the controversial autumn party conference commitment to a 2030 net zero carbon emissions target - although it still adheres to the IPCC report stating that most emission cuts need to be made by 2030. This climb down reflects strong lobbying by trade union leaders, such as Len McCluskey, who argued that 2030 was a completely unrealistic target. This position reflects the view of many experts, not least the independent Climate Change Committee, which identifies 2050 as a more realistic target date.  But the union view does raise some doubts about the genuine commitment of union leaders to climate policies that will require their members to give up their petrol and diesel cars, replace their gas boilers and curb flying.  Union leaders also have wider concerns, expressed in the manifesto, about the need to ensure a just transition of the quarter of a million workers in the oil and gas industries into new green jobs. These are important concerns, which Labour addresses through a set of skills and retraining policies. Overall, the package as a whole and the prominence it is given in the manifesto represents a fundamental step change by Labour. Unsurprisingly, the Green manifesto still trumps Labour’s by committing explicitly to a 2030 net zero emissions target and through the sheer scale of its promise to spend £100 billion annually on achieving the zero carbon economy.  Key environmental measures include the introduction of a carbon tax on all fossil fuels; major investment in green industries, including a commitment to a just transition involving the retraining of workers moving from “brown” to “green” jobs; planting 700m trees (Labour commits only to an “ambitious programme of tree planting”) and transforming 50% of farms into agro-forestry funded by a tax on meat and dairy products; retrofitting 10m homes to meet the top A-rating for energy efficiency; and banning single-use plastic packaging. In contrast to Labour, the Greens remain committed to prohibiting the construction of new nuclear power stations – a longstanding Green shibboleth. Beyond environmental concerns, the two parties make a range of broadly similar commitments including a second referendum on a Brexit deal (with Remain an option), major investments in public services and scrapping university tuition fees. But the Greens also include a radical promise to introduce a universal basic income of £89 per person per week and they support a significant liberalisation of drugs policies. So where does this leave the Greens? Clearly, the party continues to have a more radical and comprehensive environmental programme, which – because it is in their DNA – it will always prioritise.  But the Greens are also a strong Remain party – and, as I have researched, Brexit is likely to destabilise the UK’s environmental policy.  While the pact with the Liberal Democrats gives the Greens a slim chance of winning an additional seat, Labour’s refusal to agree to a progressive alliance means that in many Labour/Conservative marginal seats, a strong showing for the Greens might have the effect of tipping the balance in favour of the Conservatives.  Ironically, voting Green in these constituencies may allow the Conservatives to secure a majority that will ensure Brexit – and the possibility of a significant dismantling of existing environmental regulations as part of future trade deals negotiated by a Johnson government. Labour’s new green credentials may help persuade wavering voters to support Corbyn. But as many Green voters are Remainers, they may do so reluctantly. Longer term though, Labour will need to demonstrate a serious and lasting commitment to the green industrial revolution, and the presence of an active and dynamic Green Party will be vital in helping to keep Labour on track.

"UNITED NATIONS  —   The American ambassador to the United Nations, Nikki R. Haley, issued a stark warning on Friday to allies and rivals abroad, saying in her first remarks at the headquarters of the world body that the Trump administration would hold to account those who do not back the United States. “You’re going to see a change in the way we do business,” Ms. Haley said. “Our goal with the administration is to show value at the U. N. and the way we’ll show value is to show our strength, show our voice, have the backs of our allies and make sure our allies have our back as well. ” “For those who don’t have our back,” she added, “we’re taking names we will make points to respond to that accordingly. ” Ms. Haley offered no further details in brief remarks to reporters, nor did she take questions, before presenting her diplomatic credentials to the secretary general, António Guterres. A former socialist politician from Portugal who took over the United Nations at the start of the year, Mr. Guterres is under pressure to persuade the Trump administration to not gouge the organization and to uphold America’s international obligations, including on climate change. President Trump has dismissed the United Nations as a social club and suggested the United States could cut its funding of the organization’s efforts. His “America first” pledges have raised concerns among diplomats at the United Nations about his commitment to international cooperation. The administration’s antipathy toward the United Nations has been sharpened since a Security Council resolution last month condemning Israeli settlements. Mr. Trump and Ms. Haley have criticized the Obama administration’s decision not to veto the resolution. And several Republican senators have supported legislation threatening to defund the United Nations unless the Security Council reverses the terms of the resolution, which Council diplomats say would be politically unworkable. The United States is the United Nations’ largest single donor, providing 22 percent of its regular budget, according to the terms of an international agreement that sets a country’s contribution based on its wealth. That assessed contribution pays for operating expenses like the electricity bills at its headquarters and human rights investigations in places like Syria and South Sudan. The United States also contributes voluntarily to other United Nations programs, including those that provide food and blankets to refugees fleeing war zones and that immunize children against preventable diseases. A draft executive order obtained by The New York Times proposes at least a 40 percent cut to those voluntary funds. Some of the provisions in the draft text are redundant, and it is unclear how serious these proposals are, or if they will ever be signed. Current and former officials said Friday that the Trump administration was delaying its plan to issue the order. The money that the United States voluntarily contributes to the United Nations is a little over 0. 1 percent of the total federal budget. Some Republican lawmakers have sought in the past to make some of the assessed dues also voluntary, but that idea has never passed muster with Congress. One area that is likely to draw scrutiny from the Trump administration, judging from what Ms. Haley said during her confirmation hearing, is peacekeeping. The United States pays the largest share of the peacekeeping budget  —   about 28 percent  —   but provides virtually no soldiers The threats to cut funding come as China has stepped up its role at the United Nations, increasing its support for peacekeeping and development aid. China also has a veto in the Security Council. “This is a time of strength, this is a time of action, this is a time of getting things done,” Ms. Haley said on Friday, adding that she was prepared to   the United Nations’ efforts. “Everything that’s working we’re going to make it better. Everything that’s not working we’re going to try and fix. And anything that seems to be obsolete and not necessary we’re going to do away with,” she said. Her tone was in contrast to a far more conciliatory approach just days ago, when she faced a Senate confirmation hearing. There, she said she did not favor a “slash and burn” approach to American contributions to the United Nations, but she questioned its value to American national interests. “Are we getting what we pay for?” she asked. Ms. Haley, 45, a former Republican governor of South Carolina and one of Mr. Trump’s most outspoken critics during the campaign, had tried to distance herself from some of what Mr. Trump has said about international diplomacy. She has said she favors continuing sanctions against Russia, for instance, but also cooperation with the Kremlin on counterterrorism. She has said she is concerned about security threats posed by refugees, and while she said climate change was “on the table,” she said she did not favor policies that imperiled business."
"In shouting “system change not climate change”, young people understand that the 3-4℃ warmer world we’re headed for would be far more painful, costly and disruptive than any short-term costs or inconvenience we face from taking rapid, bold action. But the who, what, when, where and how of systems change can seem overwhelming. How do we transform a society whose fossil fuel habits have been entrenched for decades? The next step is to get smarter in telling governments precisely what we want. System change doesn’t need to be daunting, or politically difficult. We just need to focus on the pinch points that will allow us to rapidly replace fossil fuel technologies. Here are six steps to decarbonising the system for good. We could power the planet two times over with the energy we waste burning fossil fuels each and every day. Even our most modern gas-fired power stations still waste around 40% of the gas they burn. The poor design of our transport systems, buildings, and appliances also waste vast amounts of energy. It is possible to dramatically reduce this wastage, and therefore our global energy consumption, within decades. Roughly 70% of global energy consumption is not subject to mandatory efficiency standards – there’s huge untapped potential in merely regulating energy efficiency more effectively. Shifting away from thermal power to renewables eliminates the vast quantities of gas that ends up as thermal waste heat. We can also design and retrofit buildings to capture and conserve energy, shift to public transport, and invest in energy efficient circular economies. These two elements are interlinked. The more we reduce our energy consumption, the faster our renewable energy systems will be able to replace fossil fuels. This will help the one billion people who still don’t have access to mains electricity, and the nearly three billion that still cook on open stoves with wood and cattle dung – as well as the additional two billion people who will be joining the human population by 2050. We waste energy because it’s far too cheap. Prices are key to changing behaviour and investment decisions. We need to raise the price of fossil fuels so that polluters pay. Governments could introduce a US$100 per ton CO₂ tax now, rising as necessary to limit global heating below dangerous levels. Such taxes, combined with the elimination of fossil fuel subsidies, could raise trillions of dollars for governments to put to great use. We could spend this money on accelerating climate action – improving energy efficiency, scaling renewable energy, and restoring natural habitats. Our private car culture has devastating impacts on society and the planet – even if they’re electric. We can change the travel patterns of every generation to come. As well as massive investment in safe walking and cycling routes, we should campaign to make local public transport free. We also need to reduce how much we fly. A business class round trip from London to New York can cause as much global heating as a year’s worth of a flexitarian diet. We should learn to fly only as last resort, and invest the money we save to connect with people and places in other ways. Of course, many people are already doing this. Roughly 1% of people in England take 20% of overseas flights – so we should pressure governments to introduce a frequent flyer levy that makes sure that those who pollute the most pay the most. Much of the stuff we buy isn’t fit for purpose. Many clothes are made with fabric so thin that they only last a few months, while electronics are often designed to fail after a few years. These poor quality products waste energy and carbon, and pollute our environment when we inevitably throw them away. We need strong new regulations based on life cycle analysis that prevent companies from selling substandard stuff in search of profit. We also don’t need half the things we’re encouraged to buy in the first place. While its governments that are responsible for implementing system change, and corporations that pollute the most, people still have power – even beyond voting or marching. As well as governments strongly regulating advertising, we can choose to stop contributing to a consumer culture. The livestock industry currently accounts for about 15% of global emissions. It’s also an inefficient use of land – meat, aquaculture, eggs, and dairy use 83% of the world’s farmland, despite providing only 37% of our protein and 18% of our calories. To redress this balance and cut emissions, we can shift to a diet rich in vegetables and grains, where sustainable meat is an occasional treat. Carbon taxes could also cover meat and dairy production, with funds used to help farmers transition as the global grazing stock falls. For example, we could subsidise farmers to rewild newly freed up grasslands. This would create new valuable carbon sinks, and help threatened wildlife recover. We need to give our political leaders the courage to make bold decisions. Above all we must ask for specific things of our political leaders – and direct our energies towards those that will make the biggest difference. We must be clear in our demands for a new low-carbon political economy that makes fossil fuels history and renewable energy the future. Click here to subscribe to our climate action newsletter.

"The Queen’s property managers have given the green light to the first floating offshore windfarm to be built off the coast of Wales, as the UK’s wind industry prepares to power into the Celtic Sea. The Crown Estate granted two new leases for windfarms in Welsh waters on Wednesday, including the seabed rights for a demonstration project that involves installing floating wind turbines 27 miles from the shore.  The 96MW Erebus project marks a big step for the development of offshore wind off the Welsh coast, and could emerge as one of Britain’s first floating windfarms beyond Scotland, where one is under construction and another planned. The Crown Estate, which holds the rights to seabeds around the British Isles, encompassing Wales, England and Northern Ireland, has also granted rights for a 10,600 hectare extension to the Gwynt y Môr offshore windfarm off the coast of north Wales, which could provide power of up to 576MW, helping Wales meet climate targets. Lesley Griffiths, the environment minister in the Welsh government, welcomed the “next step in harnessing the potential for energy” in home waters. “The climate emergency means we will need much more renewable energy to meet our needs, and the Welsh government has supported the development of marine energy for many years,” she said. The first floating windfarm in Wales will add to a multi-million pound windfall for the Queen’s coffers expected later this year as energy companies vie for the right to build projects in the world’s biggest auction of offshore leases in 10 years. The profits will go to the Treasury, which will then send 25% back to the royal household in the form of the sovereign grant. Floating windfarms are considered the next frontier for developers because the technology allows projects to move ahead even in very deep waters where fixed seabed foundations would be too costly to build. RenewableUK, the industry trade body, has estimated that the floating offshore wind industry could create 17,000 jobs and provide an opportunity to export new skills and technologies to other countries surrounded by deep coastal waters. The Erebus project off the coast of Wales will be developed by a joint venture called Blue Gem Wind, formed by the French oil company Total and the renewable energy developer Simply Blue Energy. Hugh Kelly, a director at Blue Gem Wind, said signing the lease was the first stepping stone on the path to a new chapter of offshore projects that would help “unlock the significant potential of floating wind in the Celtic Sea”. Luke Clark, from RenewableUK, said the trade group was confident that Britain could host 2,000MW of new floating windfarms along its coasts by 2030 provided the government helped support the growing sector. Clark said: “To reach net zero emissions we need to see a massive expansion of floating wind all around the UK, including Wales. Building a world-leading UK supply chain for floating wind will create new opportunities to export our expertise to emerging markets with deep-water coastlines, including China, Taiwan, Japan, South Korea and the US.”"
"MELBOURNE, Australia  —   The sibling rivalry, at least on the tennis tour, started right here at the Australian Open for the Williams sisters. It was 1998, and older sister Venus beat younger sister Serena,   (4)   in a   match that  —   as intrusive as it felt to watch  —   surely drew more attention than any   match in history between a pair of Australian Open debutantes. The fascination in their dynamic and their futures was there from the start in Melbourne Park, known then as Flinders Park when it had only one stadium with a retractable roof instead of three. A picture of Venus consoling Serena after the match was on the front page of The New York Times. Though it would be tempting to label their Australian Open final on Saturday as a   moment and to speculate that it might be their last meeting at this late a stage of a Grand Slam tournament, it seems best to resist the temptation. The Williams sisters have taught us a lot about the limits of conventional tennis wisdom through the years. And so, even if 19 years have passed and Serena is now 35 and Venus 36, it is wise to avoid fencing them in again after they have run roughshod over so many other preconceptions. “I watched Venus today celebrating after she won the semifinal like she was a    girl, and it made you want to cry for joy just watching her,” said Marion Bartoli, a former Wimbledon champion. “Such a powerful image, and it makes you think about all those questions she was getting: ‘When are you retiring? Have you thought about retiring? How much longer?’ “You must let the champions decide when the right moment comes. ” The Williamses are both great champions, even if Serena is clearly the greater player with her 22 Grand Slam singles titles and her long run at No. 1, a spot she can reclaim from Angelique Kerber with a win Saturday. Serena has been the most prolific Grand Slam winner after age 30 in tennis history, and she is back in rare form again after another extended break at the end of 2016. She disconnected completely from the game and physical training initially and had to push hard to get back in shape in November and December. It worked. She has not dropped a set here despite a challenging draw, nor has she even been pushed to a tiebreaker. Newly engaged to the American technology entrepreneur Alexis Ohanian, who has watched her matches from the players box, and seemingly refreshed, Serena deserves to be the favorite to win her 23rd major singles title and break her tie with Steffi Graf for the highest total in the Open era. In this tournament, Serena has beaten two former members of the top 10  —   Belinda Bencic and Lucie Safarova  —   and one current member, the   No. 9 seed Johanna Konta. Venus’s draw has been soft by comparison, devoid of top 10 players  —   past or present  —   and including only one seeded player: No. 24 Anastasia Pavlyuchenkova. On Thursday, she had to scrap and come back to win,   (3)     against the powerful unseeded American CoCo Vandeweghe, while Serena cruised past the unseeded Croat Mirjana      . Serena, who already holds a   edge over her sister, could be the fresher player, too, on Saturday. But the psychology remains complex and the fallout unpredictable, even after all these years. “When I’m playing on the court with her, I think I’m playing the best competitor in the game,” Venus said. “I don’t think I’m chump change either, you know. I can compete against any odds. No matter what, I can get out there, and I compete. ” They have not played since the 2015 United States Open, when Serena won,       in a quarterfinal in which Venus attacked, often successfully, from the start but had no answer in the end for Serena’s ultimate weapon: her first serve. It was an intense match in which the big crowd in Arthur Ashe Stadium seemed more reflective than fully engaged one in which Serena’s celebration was understandably subdued with her sister across the net, even if their matches are no longer the awkward, constricted affairs of their early years. Saturday’s final in Melbourne could be intriguing on multiple levels, in part because of the Australian public. Venus is viewed here, as elsewhere, as a sympathetic figure: the older sister who has handled the younger’s greater tennis success unselfishly and with dignity. And though both sisters have had to cope with major health problems and family tragedy, with the murder of their half sister Yetunde Price in 2003, Venus is the one whose tennis fortunes dipped more dramatically. A   Grand Slam singles champion and a former No. 1, she did not advance past the third round in any major event in singles from late 2011 to the end of the 2014 season. She was a major star reduced to a minor role, largely because of an autoimmune disorder  —   Sjogren’s syndrome, diagnosed in 2011  —   that sapped her strength and endurance. When Russian hackers breached the World   Agency’s databases last fall, it was revealed that Venus had needed 13   exemptions for drugs in recent years. The retirement questions to which Bartoli referred started during that period. But Venus’s ability to cope with her condition has improved, and after rejoining the top 10 in 2015, she reached the semifinals at Wimbledon last year and then the final here. “She never even thought of the word retire,” said David Witt, her coach and hitting partner of 10 years. “I just think when she got diagnosed, it was a step back, a shock. She’s learned a lot about how to deal with it and her body, how to eat, how to manage it. “There are days she can’t work as hard as she wants to work. Some days it’s maybe not smart to do it because it will then hurt you for two or three more days. Where she is now in her career, she has to listen to her body, and I don’t think she really needs to go out and hit balls for two hours. ” Witt said there were no more    sessions in the   or in time off tour: just one session in the morning and then gym work, primarily sprints, core strengthening and flexibility. “It took her years and years to realize that stretching is important and can keep you healthier,” he said. “The more flexible you are, you’re not going to strain or pull anything. I’ve been with her 10 years, and I think it took seven years to get her to stretch. She likes to do a lot of dancing, and that consists of a lot of stretching and being flexible, so I think that’s helped. ” Her dance skills were in evidence Thursday as she pirouetted after beating Vandeweghe, but what will linger longest in memory were her screams of delight at having conquered an inspired young opponent in a semifinal. It was a moment she described as “just joy. ” “You could really see the happiness on her face,” Serena said. “I’ve been there when she was down and out of it, and back and in it. I’ve been there for all those moments, so I just really was oh so happy. ” As visceral as her reaction on court was, she was nothing but considered in the interview room. “I think why people love sport so much is because you see everything in a line,” Venus said. “In that moment, there is no  . There’s no retake. There is no  . It’s triumph and disaster witnessed in real time. “This is why people live and die for sport, because you can’t fake it. You can’t. It’s either you do it or you don’t. People relate to the champion. They also relate to the person who didn’t win, because we all have those moments in our life. ” This will be Venus’s first major singles final since she lost to Serena in straight sets in the 2009 Wimbledon final, and her first match against Serena in Melbourne since the 2003 final when Serena won her fourth Grand Slam title in a row, having defeated Venus in all four finals. “It’s just amazing,” said Rennae Stubbs, the Australian star who first met the sisters before they joined the tour. “They came onto the scene at age 15 and 16 with the beads and the hair and the exuberance, and here they are: mature, remarkable young women at 35 and 36. No matter what anyone says to me, their story from start to finish is the greatest sports story ever. ” And if the Williamses have taught us anything along the way, it is that the story is not finished until they say it is."
"Britons on camping holidays have been warned of the possible danger of falling trees as parts of the UK brace for winds of more than 70mph to hit. The arrival of Storm Ellen in Ireland and western parts of the UK on Wednesday evening signalled conditions more akin to autumn and winter.  A Met Office yellow weather warning for wind stretches from the north of Scotland down to the Cornish coast and is in place until the early hours of Friday. Warnings of potential travel delays and the possibility of power cuts will extend eastwards on Friday to also include central and northern England, as well as all of Wales. Luke Miall, a weather forecaster, said Ellen will be felt “for the next couple of days” and is “not going to move through really quickly so we will continue to see a really big area of low pressure through the rest of this week.” Northern Ireland is expected to face the worst of the winds, with inland gusts up to 65mph, and top speeds of 75mph on the coast. People in western Scotland down to the south-west of England will also see winds of up to 65mph, which the Met Office forecaster described as “fairly strong for the time of year”. “This is fairly unusual for August, we’d usually see this through the autumn and winter months”, Miall said. “Given that the trees are still in leaf and a lot of people are on the holidays in the UK there could be some impacts of trees coming down more easily than what they would in the winter. With people camping, impacts are likely to be a bit greater.” The stormy conditions come just a week after scorching temperatures across the UK with the mercury hitting 34C for six consecutive days. Miall said: “We have gone from one extreme to the other, the first thing that springs to my mind with these sorts of events is climate change. “We are likely to see these swings in extreme events more frequently. Although I couldn’t necessarily say these two events were directly caused by climate change, it’s likely that these sorts of swings in our weather will become more frequent.”"
