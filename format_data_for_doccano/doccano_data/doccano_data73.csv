Share this...FacebookTwitterUPDATE: Happy marriages, too. Almost half of all marriages in Europe end in divorce. And it’s the happy Europeans who fret endlessly about the world-ending climate catastrophe.
==========================
CNN reports here on the latest UN World Happiness Report, issued from the comfy confines of their New York or Geneva offices. I’m a little confused here. Is the report from the UN or Columbia University? Is there really a difference?
The study assessed people’s happiness in 156 countries, based on western metrics having to do with economics, social support, generosity, mental illness, etc..
Europe ranks highest in happiness
Their findings: Denmark, Norway, Switzerland, the Netherlands and Sweden are the world’s happiest countries, and Rwanda, Burundi, the Central African Republic, Benin and Togo are the unhappiest.
Let’s all rush to be like hip Europeans, the report wants to tell us. But can we really trust the elitist authors of the report? One could easily interpret the report as racist. Look at the study’s message: Northern European, socialist secular societies (the whitest of the whites) are the happiest. Sub-Saharan African countries, on the other hand, are just all so miserable. Of course the authors surely are not at all racist, but they are indeed very ARROGANT.
I don’t trust the yardstick used by the authors here, and I ask: Are the European countries really the happiest?
Europe is a basket case in terms of suicide rates
Let’s look at suicide rates. Surely it must be very very low among all those happy European countries. But according to Wikipedia statistics here, it appears happy Europeans aren’t coping very well at all with all their “happiness”. They seem to be jumping off bridges with uncontrollable glee. According to suicide statistics, many of the “happiest countries in the world” are also among the top 50 when it comes to suicide rate!

Worldwide, No.1 happy Denmark ranks No. 41 in suicides, No. 2 happy country Norway ranks No. 35 in suicides, No. 3 Switzerland ranks 45th in suicides, No. 4 happy country Holland ranks a relatively non-suicidal no. 53 and no. 5 Sweden in terms of happiness comes in at no. 44 in not wanting to live. Quite happy Finland, ranked no. 7, is also quite happy about ending it all, coming in at a whopping no. 19 in suicides.
Europe on suicide watch
Europe likes to insist that it’s happy, but the statistics show that the continent is a basket case when it comes to suicides. Thirteen of the top 20 countries in terms of suicide rate are in Europe.
Lo and behold, not a single African country is in the top 30 for suicides. I guess they’re just too unhappy to jump off bridges.
In summary what we have is a group of elitists trying to convince the whole world that we should all live like secular, socialist Europeans. This study is certainly blinded and biased by western arrogance. You can throw it in the dustbin. It’s just more quack science in service of an agenda.
Climate change ending Happy Days for northerners!
There’s a new study out claiming that climate change leads to depression. Ironically the study comes from Canada, also a nation ranked high on the happiness list. Seems like they are having unhappiness problems, and are content to blame it on climate change. The study’s abstract writes (my emphasis):
Recently, research is beginning to indicate that changes in climate, and the subsequent disruption to the social, economic, and environmental determinants of health, may cause increased incidences and prevalence of mental health issues, emotional responses, and large-scale sociopsychological changes. Through a multi-year, community-led, exploratory case study conducted in Rigolet, Nunatsiavut, Labrador, Canada, this research […] reported that changes in weather, snow and ice stability and extent, and wildlife and vegetation patterns attributed to climate change were negatively impacting mental health and well-being due to disruptions in land-based activities and a loss of place-based solace and cultural identity. Participants reported that changes in climate and environment increased family stress, enhanced the possibility of increased drug and alcohol usage, amplified previous traumas and mental health stressors, and were implicated in increased potential for suicide ideation. While a preliminary case study, these exploratory findings indicate that climate change is becoming an additional mental health stressor for resource-dependent communities and provide a baseline for further research.
So there you have it today. Two studies that are complete nonsense.

Share this...FacebookTwitterGermans generally are very critical people, and when things aren’t exactly as they should be, they tend to get awfully bent out of shape over it.
Anything outside specifications quickly gets labeled by Germans as a “disaster”. And if it meanders beyond that, it gets labeled a catastrophe. Example: if Germany loses a World Cup football game, say 2 to 1, the game is immediately called a disaster. And should the German squad get trounced, say 3 to 0, then it is: a catastrophe.
“Katastrophe” is one of the favorite words of the German media. It gets used all the time.
Anything that finds itself not in a normal state is automatically described as “catastrophic”. That’s just the way Germans are. And since global temperature has been 0.8°C above “normal”, it’s no surprise that Germans have called it the Klimakatastrophe (climate catastrophe).
And since then, every severe storm and weather anomaly has routinely been called a “catastrophe” by the media. All departures from normal weather are called “catastrophes”. But because there have been so many “catastrophes” lately, the word itself has lost all its psychological and emotional impact. The word catastrophe in Germany is literally worn out. That has become a real problem for the German media. Today using the word “Katastrophe” produces yawns from Germans. It has no effect at all.
So what are the German media to do now that the word catastrophe no longer delivers the desired punch?
No problem- since Haiyan struck the Philippines the German media have found a new replacement word with which to wow the audience: apocalyptic, or apocalypse. Over the last few days the German public have been bombarded by these two words everywhere in the German media. The apocalypse has arrived!
For example Spiegel here, never one to refrain from sensationalism, writes of “apocalyptic conditions” in the Philippines. So does the Sueddeutsche Zeitung here.

Naturally, when the big ones like Spiegel start employing hyperdramatics, the other media outlets are forced to follow. In today’s world of diminishing media credibility and audiences, it’s a question of bare survival. The race to out-hype is on.
The Austrian website FORMAT.at here describes the Philippines as an “apocalyptic situation“. For the German media it seems the world is really coming to an end. Fanning the fans of fear and panic has become their top priority. FORMAT writes: “The dimension of Haiyan’s destruction is enormous.”
The Ruhr Nachrichten here writes of the “storm’s apocalyptic dimensions“.
The online Berlin daily Berliner Zeitung here calls Haiyan the “apocalyptic horseman“.
That the media is no longer content with sticking to the usual words for describing disasters and feels it has to upgrade to the “Sensationalize Deluxe” media package likely has a lot to do with headline grabbing.
The disaster left behind by the Haiyan is a truly serious and newsworthy. Yet when one considers that its death toll is likely to remain well below 10,000 and that history has seen far deadlier storms, the language is way over the top. The media are behaving like desperate merchants on the last day of a disaster clearance sale.
People have lost their fear of climate overall, and when the data lack and fail to stir the desired emotions of fear, panic and general hysteria, then hyperbole and extreme drama have to be resorted to. This is the sorry state to which the German media have devolved.

"Ireland has unveiled an ambitious plan to tackle the climate emergency by weaning the state, businesses, farms and households off fossil fuels. The government published a long-awaited report on Monday outlining more than 180 measures to curb the country’s greenhouse gas emissions and set a path for net-zero carbon emissions by 2050.  It envisages a rise in carbon taxes, a multibillion-euro scheme to retro-fit houses, almost a million electric vehicles and a number of other measures to change behaviour by institutions, companies and individuals. The taoiseach, Leo Varadkar, said: “We are going to change how electricity is produced and consumed, how our homes and workplaces are heated; the way we travel; the types of vehicles we purchase, and how food is produced. Above all, we are going to decouple emissions growth from economic growth … This plan represents the sum of our hopes for the future.” Ireland is one of the European Union’s worst carbon emission offenders and is facing fines of more than €250m for missing 2020 targets on reducing emissions and adopting renewable energy. Trends in agriculture and transport mean that emissions are set to continue rising in the next few years, risking even steeper fines for missing 2030 goals and raising questions over if and how Ireland will make its bold plan a reality. The Fine Gael-led centre-right government is entering a general election cycle and is wary of alienating poorer and rural voters with higher carbon taxes – the trigger for France’s yellow-vest protests. However, support for Ireland’s Green party surged in local and European elections last month, reflecting growing concern over the climate crisis. The Climate Action Plan to Tackle Climate Breakdown drew on a report published earlier this year by an all-party committee. Richard Bruton, the minister for climate action, said it put Ireland on a “trajectory” to net-zero carbon emissions by 2050, a significantly bolder ambition than the previous commitment to reduce emissions by 80% – but it is an aspiration, not a binding target. The report also commits Ireland to 2030 EU goals – to avert fines estimated at €6bn, it must slash emissions from 60m to 33m tonnes – by planting more trees and buying carbon credits from other countries. Other goals include: Boost the use of renewable sources for power generation from 30% to 70% of electricity. New onshore and offshore wind turbines are expected to replace peat- and coal-powered power stations. Pave the way for 950,000 electric vehicles by expanding charging networks and banning the sale of petrol and diesel cars from 2030. Retrofit 500,000 homes and 400,000 heat pumps to make buildings more energy-efficient, offering householders “easy payback methods”. Oil and gas boilers will be prohibited in new homes by 2025. Eliminate non-recyclable plastic and ban single-use plastic plates, cutlery, straws, balloon sticks and cotton buds. The central strategy involves increasing carbon taxes from €20 to €80 per tonne by 2030 – a politically fraught exercise that will require cushioning poor people and rural dwellers from higher fuel and heating prices. Another measure targets financial services: pension providers will have to disclose whether they hold fossil fuel assets, giving pension-holders the option to switch providers.  Leftwing parties, including Sinn Fèin, have opposed a carbon tax increase, while farmers have assailed Varadkar for saying he is trying to eat less meat to reduce his carbon footprint. Protesters greeted him last month with the chant: “Where’s the beef, you vegan?”"

Share this...FacebookTwitterIt’s now halftime for the 2013 hurricane season (June 1 – November 30) and German meteorological site wetternet.de writes that “Hurricanes are less than expected“.

Hurricane Irene, 2011. Photo by NASA
Using the mean of the 1981 – 2010 period, normally three or four tropical storms form in the Atlantic in August, with one or two growing into hurricanes.
But this year there have been only 2 tropical storms, and none of them made it to hurricane level. Meteorologist Christa Stipp at wetternet.de (meteorologist Dominik Jung’s site) sums it up: “Indeed there has not been a single hurricane so far this season and only six tropical storms.”
Stipp adds that the Accumulated Cyclone Energy (ACE) for the Atlantic this August was “70 percent below the mean“.
The recent low cyclone activity contradicts climate models that had projected global warming would increase cyclone activity. This year this is not only the case in the Atlantic, but is also happening globally. In August there have been only 4 tropical storms in the Eastern Pacific, and only one managed to become a hurricane (Category 2). Overall ACE in The Eastern Pacific is 40% below the mean.
But wetternet.de warns that there is no guarantee that a weak first half of a hurricane season means the whole season will stay that way. “There’s no indication that fewer hurricanes will occur during the 2nd half of the season, and thus less damage.”

Share this...FacebookTwitterIt’s obvious: The alarmists have run out of arguments and lost the debate. North America shivers in a nasty cold snap, global sea ice is approaching the highest levels in decades, and global temperatures haven’t risen in over 15 years. Nothing is going right for them.
Ironically, maybe the debate is over. It just ended up with the alarmists as the losers.
Recall how the debate used to be about whether or not the warming was caused by man-made CO2. Today it’s not even that anymore. Now it’s about whether or not the Earth is warming at all!
Yesterday in a CNN debate with Marc Morano, Sierra Club executive director Michael Brune reaffirmed that the alarmists have lost. Brune doesn’t even bother citing data any more…and is left with nothing but to repeat the bogus “the science is settled” claim and thinks that weather anecdotes are proof of man-made climate change. If a cold winter or a couple of cold winters cannot be a trend, then how can a single one-day storm be evidence of global warming?
LA Times becomes the sister of The Inquisition

Things are so pathetic for the alarmists that the only strategy left is declaring the debate over and refusing to let other views be made known. Such is also the case at the LA Times.
At their Die kalte Sonne website, German scientists Sebastian Lüning and Fritz Vahrenholt have reacted to the LA Times’s move to keep dissenting views on climate change out of their newspaper, and even compare the daily’s draconian tactics to something from Medieval times…you know, the Dark Ages. They write:
The Los Angeles Times has now resorted to unusual measures in order to avoid inconvenient discussions: In the future no more reader letters to the editor coming from climate skeptics shall be printed. Thus this finally clears the way for the followers of the climate alarmist side. It’s the end of inconvenient discussions where in the recent times things just got too uncomfortable for the friends of the climate catastrophe.”
To summarize, Lüning and Vahrenholt quote Johann Nepomuk Nestroy (1801 – 1862), an Austrian dramatist, actor and playwright:
Censorship is the younger of two disgraceful sisters. The other is called Inquisition.”

Share this...FacebookTwitterAnother major European media outlet is asking: Where’s the global warming?
Image right: The August 7 edition of Denmark’s Jyllands-Posten featured a major 2-page article on the globe’s 15-years of missing warming and the potential solar causes and implications.
Moreover, they are featuring prominent skeptic scientists who are warning of a potential little ice age and dismissing CO2 as a major climate driver. And all of this just before the release of the IPCC’s 5AR, no less!
Hat-tip: NTZ reader Arne Garbøl
The August 7 print edition of the Danish Jyllands-Posten, the famous daily that published the “Muhammad caricatures“, features a full 2-page article bearing the headline: “The behavior of the sun may trigger a new little ice age” followed by the sub-headline: “Defying all predictions, the globe may be on the road towards a new little ice age with much colder winters.”
So now even the once very green Danish media is now spreading the seeds of doubt. So quickly can “settled science” become controversial and hotly disputed. The climate debate is far from over. And when it does end, it looks increasingly as if it’ll end in favor of the skeptics.
The JP writes that “many will be startled” by the news that a little ice age is a real possibility. Indeed, western citizens have been conditioned to think that nothing except warming is possible. Few have prepared for any other possibility.
In its latest 2-page report, the JP now appears to tell its readers that our views on climate science have to be much more open minded and unshackled from the chains of dogmatism.
JP starts by reminding readers that it was just over 100 years ago that the world had clawed itself out of the little ice age, which extended from 1400 – 1900, a time when the Thames river often froze over. All paths in determining the cause of the little ice age all seem to converge to a single factor: solar activity.
The Jyllands-Posten quotes David Hathaway:
‘We now have the lowest solar activity in 100 years,’ David Hathaway from American space research institute NASA newly concluded in connection to the release of new figures for the sun’s activity. He said the activity for the ongoing cycle is half of the previous cycle, and he predicted an even lower activity for the next cycle, which will hit us in few years.”
Suddenly even the greenest of media outlets among us are contemplating what the consequences of a quiet sun may be. The JP then quotes Irish solar specialist Ian Elliott, who says these consequences could be dramatic:
It indicates that we may be on the path to a new little ice age. It seems likely we are on the path to a period with very low solar activity, which could mean that we may have some very cold winters.”

google_ad_height = 200;
//-->




Elliott then cites the ice-cold winters of 2009 and 2010 as early signs.
JP then cites at length Danish astrophysicist Henrik Svensmark, who needs no introduction:
Since the 1940s and up to 10 years ago we have had the highest solar activity in 1000 years. The last time we had solar activity that high was when we had the Medieval Warm Period from year 1000 to around 1300. … Historically there has been a close connection between solar activity and temperature for the last 1000 years. Therefore the sun’s activity will also have influence the coming many years. … The unusual thing right now is that sun’s activity is decreasing while there’s a great increase in atmospheric CO2. For that reason the question is how much the earth will cool in a time of decreasing solar activity. … The development is beautifully consistent with a cooling effect of the solar activity in the same period. This could mean that the temperature will not rise for the next 30 years or maybe begin to decrease.”
JP also quotes Svensmark on the subject of the IPCC: “…many of the climate models used by IPCC and others overestimate the influence of CO2 and underestimate the influence of the sun. … The IPCC is very one-sided, so I don’t think there will be anything reasonable in the next report.”
Where did all the heat go?
In the second part (see right) of the JP’s feature story on climate science, the daily asks whatever happened to all the missing warming?
Despite predictions that the temperature on the globe should rise with a huge speed, nothing has really happened the last 10-15 years. However climate scientists are insisting we are in the middle of the heaviest global warming maybe ever, and that the temperature will rise with at least 2-4 degrees towards the year 2100.”
JP asks scientist Sebastian Mernild of the Glaciology and Climate Change Laboratory Center for Scientific Studies in Chile, who insists that ocean currents have taken the heat “down to the deep sea”.
Once unthinkable just a few years ago, the European media and JP are now starting to admit the oceans are a poorly understood wild card in the climate equation after all. JP openly states, “The oceans are generally regarded as the big wildcard in the climate discussion.” Jylland Posten ends its 2-page feature story with questions and comments by Svensmark:
How should ocean water under 700 meters be warmed up without a warming in the upper part? … In the period 1990-2000 you could see a rise in the ocean temperatures, which fit with the greenhouse effect. But it hasn’t been seen for the last 10 years. Temperatures don’t rise without the heat content in the sea increasing. Several thousand buoys put into the sea to measure temperature haven’t registered any rise in sea temperatures.”

Share this...FacebookTwitterThe ultra-warmist online Austrian daily Der Standard here writes about the misery being caused as the Middle East gets walloped by “unusual cold and snow amounts“, especially the refugees of the Syrian conflict.
For many days unusually cold temperatures have gripped North Africa and the Middle East and have at times brought huge amounts of snow. While the snow-blanketed buildings of Jerusalem’s old city provide an almost idyllic picture, the snow and cold are exacerbating an already precarious situation of Syrian refugees in Lebanon near the border.”
See photos of the refugee camps at the above link. Looks like David Viner’s thing of Europe’s past has now become a thing of warm deserts.
Meanwhile the online Neuer Züricher Zeitung (NZZ) of Zurich, Switzerland, also reports on the unusual “winter drama” in the Middle East.
The NZZ writes of pyramids covered by snow for the first time in a 100 years, misery in Syria brought on by extreme cold, and a city of Jerusalem that is covered by “a thick blanket of snow“.
Misery’s common factor: Lack of energy!
The NZZ adds that energy is scarce for many: “Heating oil and cooking gas have become a luxury for many.”
Both dailies describe the misery that people there have to endure. The NZZ writes: “In Israel and in West Jordanland tens of thousands were hit by ongoing power outages.”
The commonality of the winter misery boils down to one thing: insufficient energy. Solar panels and windmills are not what’s going to help these people. They need electricity and fuel to stay warm and to cook with.

"A $10tn (£7.9tn) investor alliance has accused more than 700 companies, including Amazon, Tesco and ExxonMobil, of failing to reveal the full extent of their impact on the climate crisis, water shortages and deforestation. The major global companies, with a combined worth ofmore than $15tn, lack transparency over their effect on the environment, according to the intervention by some of the world’s biggest financial names.  Campaign platform CDP has brought together a record number of investors, including banking giants HSBC and Investec, to demand companies reveal data on the environmental cost of how they do business. The group said it was targeting 707 companies because of their “high environmental impact and lack of transparency” to date. The list includes the world’s largest fossil fuel companies such as BP and ExxonMobil as well as palm oil giant Genting Plantations and UK high street brands including Tesco, Ocado, WH Smith, Marks & Spencer and JD Wetherspoon. The CDP said 546 companies were being targeted to disclose information on the climate crisis, 166 on water security and 115 on deforestation. More than 7,000 companies already disclose their environmental impact through the CDP platform. The US is home to the highest number of companies named in the campaign, accounting for a fifth of the list, followed by Australia at 16%. UK companies make up 3.5% of the companies named and include constituents of the FTSE 100. Many of the companies on the list report on their environmental impact in their own sustainability reports but the CDP claims this is insufficient because their reports do not use standardised data. This makes it difficult to compare company performances on the environment, according to CDP. Emily Kreps, a global director at CDP, formerly known as the Climate Disclosure Project, said a growing number of investors were calling on companies to disclose in full their role in addressing the climate crisis. The number of investors lending their voices to CPD’s campaign has grown to 88, from 57 two years ago. “We know that climate change, water security and deforestation present material risks to investments, but these risks cannot be managed without proper information,” she said. Kreps hopes that by using shareholder influence the companies will agree to reveal their data through the CPD disclosure platform. Thomas O’Malley, head of corporate governance at HSBC said CDP’s “model disclosure framework” enables investors to assess how well companies manage “one of the broadest risks facing companies”. The investors involved in the campaign include pan-European asset managers Candriam and Amundi, and the NN Group as well as Taiwan’s Cathay Financial Holdings and the Washington State Investment Board. Sophia Cheng, the chief investment officer at Cathay Financial, said: “Climate change, deforestation and water security are critical challenges that require immediate action.” “Cathay believes that investors can play an important role in encouraging their investee companies to disclose environmental information – this campaign should improve corporate transparency and help investors better manage these environmental risks and opportunities.” The latest investor call to hold companies to account comes less than a week after Norwegian MPs voted in favour of ordering the country’s $1tn sovereign wealth fund, the largest in the world, to divest from hundreds of oil and coal companies to limit their exposure to climate risk. In the same week an open letter to the European Investment Bank, signed by 80 civil society organisations and academics, called on the central bank to end its fossil fuel financing, which topped €2.4bn (£2.1bn) in 2018. It follows a warning earlier this year from Mark Carney, the Bank of England’s governor, and François Villeroy de Galhau, the governor of the Banque de France, that the climate breakdown poses an existential threat to the global financial system unless there urgent reform. • This article was amended on 17 June 2019 to update some figures to reflect late changes to CDP’s report."

In the last part of the article Jung writes:
What’s climate change got to do with it?
As always: immediately after an event is observed on the planet that supposedly ‘had never happened before’, a discussion about the cause breaks out. And once again the discussion turns to the term: ‘climate change’.

‘Haiyan was one of the most powerful typhoons ever observed’ – at first that sounds very suspenseful, but an important small piece of information gets left out, namely: ‘Since weather records started being kept’.  And when it comes to tropical storms, regular weather records have been kept only for a few decades! When we speak of the strongest storm of ‘all time’, this ‘all-time’ is not even 100 years long.
The earth is really already more than 100 years old, and we don’t know at all what natural catastrophes occurred 500 or 1000 years ago – and we also don’t know which tropical storms took place. 
For many ‘climate expert’ this recent event is a feeding frenzy that allows them to pound the drums of ‘evil climate change’. And here not a single one of these ladies and gentlemen are able to show that such storms never existed over the past hundreds of years, let alone that this storm is connected to a man-made climate change.
What came out of the mouths of climate experts after the last cold winters had gripped Central Europe?:
‘A few colder-than-normal winters are in no way any indication of a trend change when it comes to climate change.’ Well, using that logic, how is a single large typhoon then supposed to confirm climate change? A truly fascinating thought process!

Share this...FacebookTwitterCarbon Dioxide and the Ocean
By Ed Caryl
In my last post, Figure 1 illustrated how much the annual carbon dioxide flux, the red trace, varied from year to year. Studies (here, here, and here, among others) have been done on the annual carbon flux, but they ignore this variation by using running averages, or by simply ignoring the data during El Niño periods. This seems like an effort to avoid actually learning something.

Figure 1 is a plot of the annual carbon flux into and out of the biosphere.
The shape of the annual carbon increase resembles the shape of the global sea surface temperature (HADSST3), especially after reliable CO2 measurements began by Keeling after March 1958. Several known events are visible. Counting backwards: the 1998 El Niño, the 1994-5 El Niño, Mt Pinatubo in 1991, the 1986-7 El Niño, Mt Ruiz in 1985, El Chichon eruption in 1982, the 1972-3 El Niño, etc. Every positive peak is an El Niño and  every negative peak is associated with a major volcanic eruption.
As can be seen in Figure 1, there is no relationship between the fossil carbon emissions curve and the annual carbon increase curve. That is because all the fossil emissions carbon is taken up by the biosphere or by the oceans according to Henry’s Law, and then sequestered there. The carbon in the atmosphere is controlled by temperature. This has been described by Dr. Murry Salby in this presentations at Sydney and Hamburg. He compares the CO2 curve to the integral of temperature. Here, I am going the other way mathematically, taking the differential of the CO2 curve as temperature and comparing it to known temperature data, the HADSST3 data.

Figure 2 is a plot of the annual carbon increase in the atmosphere (the differential of the Mauna Loa data) and the HADSST3 sea surface temperature anomaly.
The spikes in the SST correspond to the spikes in CO2 increase, and they go in the same direction. As the ocean surface warms, it emits more CO2 (or takes in less). The balance changes with temperature. Why should this be?

Figure 3 is CO2 solubility in water: 0.08g/kg/degree C below 20C. Above 20C the solubility drops by half to about 0.04g/kg/°C. 
The ocean surface area is 360 million sq. kilometers, or 360 trillion sq. meters. The top meter is 360 trillion tons of water. A change of temperature of one degree for cold water changes the solubility by:
360 X 1012 tons = 360 X 1015 kg X 0.08 g/kg = 28.8 X 1015 g CO2 or 28.8 Petagrams CO2. A tenth of a degree temperature change changes solubility by 2.88 Petagrams CO2. This is about 780 Gigatons carbon equivalent. (3.7 grams CO2 = 1 gram carbon.)
The tropical oceans are well above 20°C so the solubility there will be roughly half the above figure. The plots in figure 3 indicate about 1 Gigaton carbon change from a tenth of a degree temperature change. A scatter plot trend line will give us a more exact figure.

Figure 4a is a scatter plot of SST versus annual CO2 change. Figure 4b uses the linear trend formula from 4a to convert SST to the carbon equivalent.
Studies of the CO2 emission and absorption have shown that the tropical seas emit CO2 and the cold, sinking, north Pacific and Atlantic absorb CO2. This has even been mapped. This is all due to the variation in CO2 solubility with temperature.

Figure 5: Source link for the above figure and caption.
The sea surface CO2 partial pressure is always very close to the CO2 partial pressure in the atmosphere above it. The sea surface is always in equilibrium with the atmosphere. This means that as we add CO2 in burning fossil fuels, some is taken up by the land biosphere. The remainder CO2 is dissolved and added to the CO2 reservoir in the surface waters. The mixed layer in the ocean is the top 20 to 200 meters, depending on the amount of wave and current mixing. That mixed layer is about 1/50th of the ocean volume. It contains roughly the same amount of CO2 as the atmosphere, as dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC). The difference, whether the ocean is emitting CO2 or absorbing it, is driven by temperature. As can be seen in the above figures, an El Niño can drive 2 or 3 Gigatons of carbon into the atmosphere and a La Niña can take it right out again. The rise in CO2 is due to rising SST, not fossil fuel burning.

Figure 6 is a plot of figure 4b and the biosphere increase from the previous biosphere article here, subtracted from the annual carbon increase.
The above is a residual. But the curve looks familiar.

Figure 7 is Figure 6 with the average annual AMO index inverted.
Note on the map, figure 5, that the warm tropical seas emit CO2, and the cool northern seas absorb CO2. The AMO index is a temperature index for the North Atlantic. It is derived by subtracting the global SST from 60°N to 60°S from the total SST, or alternatively, the Atlantic temperate and tropical SST from the whole north Atlantic. This means that as the tropical ocean warms more than the average global ocean, this drives the AMO index negative. This shifts the CO2 solubility (figure 2) downward and to the right. That peak in the 1970’s occurs because the tropical oceans were warmer than the average during that period, emitting more CO2. Since that time, the difference has gone the other way, the biosphere is taking up increasing amounts of CO2, lowering the amount of CO2 left in the atmosphere. You can also see a one year lag between AMO and the carbon flux. This is because the AMO lags the tropical Pacific by about a year.
The point of all this is that temperature is driving CO2, not the other way around.
We have good measurements of atmospheric CO2 only since 1958. Before that time our measurements were at the mercy of whatever ice does to captured CO2. We have good global measurements of temperature only from 1979, the beginning of the satellite era. This means that all of our measurement periods are shorter than the natural cycles. We have hints only from surface and ship measurements that go back 120 years, that some of the natural cycles are ~60 years long. We are presently at a convergence and peak of several of those natural cycles. There are suggestions that we are past the peak of some longer solar cycles. I use the words “hints” and “suggestions” because of the large errors, lack of global coverage, and wishful thinking adjustments to these measurements. There are two possibilities. If CO2 drives temperature, then temperatures should continue to climb. If it doesn’t, then temperatures will fall, then, shortly, CO2 will fall also. Nature is in the process of demonstrating which is which. We can just watch.

Share this...FacebookTwitterGermany’s top leftist, “Red Oskar” Lafontaine has a commentary in the Thursday’s print edition of the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung, where he comes out against wind power. The title: “How wind turbines are destroying the environment.”
He realizes that the whole scam is only benefitting capitalists, is causing more CO2 and is ruining the beauty of Germany’s once charming landscape.
In his opinion piece Lafontaine writes that the “well intentioned renewable energy source is destroying the natural landscape heritage and is involuntarily boosting coal power plants“. It’s time to end wind power, Lafontaine writes.
Wind turbines are growing in size, and are approaching a height of 200 meters. Lafontaine also says that despite the huge investment in wind energy, it only provided Germany with 1.3% of its power in 2012. Is it worth the price of ruining the landscape, he asks?
Moreover, Lafontaine points out that wind energy has not reduced CO2 emissions in Germany, but likely has increased it because gas-fired power plants operating part-time to compensate for windless and sunless days are not profitable. Thus power companies are putting more and more coal power plants back online.
But it’s the industrialization of Germany’s natural landscape that really has Lafontaine against it. He quotes writer Botho Strauß:

A more brutal destruction of the landscape as we see with wind turbines was never ever caused by any phase of industrialization.
“The landscape,” Lafontaine, says, “is being robbed of its poety“. It’s not about protecting nature; it’s about money.
Lafontaine writes that the wind turbines also represent a threat to wildlife and biodiversity.
He summarizes his opinion piece.

It is economically and technically senseless to stay on a path that increases the emission of carbon dioxide, increases the price of electricity. The targets can be reached more easily and cheaply by using more intelligent technology.”

Share this...FacebookTwitterThe European Institute for Climate and Energy (EIKE) here presents a blistering report by retired climate scientist Prof. Horst-Joachim Lüdecke and meteorologist Klaus-Eckart Puls on how a German and Swiss network of IPCC scientists who, using pernicious methods, thwart legitimate scientists and media reporters who they view as a threat to the AGW hypothesis.
German climate scientist Horst Lüdecke and meteorologist Klaus-Eckart Puls say German climate science has been ruthless with dictatorial traits. Photo Lüdecke private, Puls EIKE.
Warnings of ruthless scientists
The piece is too long and my time too short to allow a full translation, and so I will present the main points.
Lüdecke and Puls write that these IPCC scientists should serve as “warning signals that should never be forgotten. This is especially so when an eco-dictatorial planned “Great Transformation” of avoiding CO2 is being propagated.”
Lüdecke and Puls of EIKE then remind readers that such threat was seen already once early in the 20th century.
Smearing of Jan Veizer and Nir Shaviv
In 2003 the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research (PIK) led a smear campaign against Slovakian geoscientist Jan Veizer and Israeli astrophysicist Nir Shaviv. Both are renowned scientists and have won many awards. In July 2003 Veizer and Shaviv published a ground-breaking paper on the climate impacts from the Earth’s orbit through the galaxy titled: ”Celestial Driver of Phanerozoic Climate?”.
However, the paper only inflamed the wrath of AGW colleagues, who saw themselves obligated to rescue the planet from natural gas CO2 using any possible means. Engulfed in fervor, the angry scientists, however, missed that the Veizer/Shaviv publication had nothing to do with the anthropogenic impacts of Co2. Rather the paper dealt with climate changes of the last 500 millions years, and did not even look at the 20th century climate.
The PIK immediately sent out a press release to the media, denouncing the findings of the two scientists.
Lüdecke and Puls write that disagreement in science is nothing new. But when scientists disagree, there’s an academically accepted approach to contest theories from other colleagues, which is usually done through the publisher and not carried out in the mass media.
Scientists stoop to smearing through the media
But the traditional approach was brushed aside by a group of German and Swiss IPCC scientists, who viewed Veizer’s and Shaviv’s publication as a potentially lethal threat to AGW hypothesis. But instead of properly contesting the publication, they embarked on a campaign to discredit the Veizer and Shaviv. EIKE writes:
The climb-down to near yellow journalism by the PIK’s press action had absolutely nothing to do with scientific etiquette and debate. Of the PIK press release signatories, many are known to readers as Germans and Swiss AGW activists and are still preaching ‘end-of-the-world’ by CO2.

Prof. T. Stocker, Klima- und Umweltphysik, Bern [6]
Today EIKE calls that particular action “scandalous” and that it will be “infamous in German and Swiss science history.” Today many of these scientists act like nothing ever happened. The media, EIKE writes, were all too willing and aided and abetted the smear action, thus prompting Lüdecke and Puls to wonder if anything has ever been learned from Germany’s dictatorial past.
Veizer leaves Germany
Eventually, Veizer ended up leaving science-hostile Germany and the University of Bochum to join the University of Ottawa. EIKE writes that it is not sure how much the move to Canada was due to the smear campaign, but adds:
Nevertheless, the scientific exodus because of public pressure in the dictatorial past of Germany is well known.”
Here Albert Einstein serves as a classic example from the past. Climate science dissent in Germany is openly hounded and smeared.
The leaked Climategate e-mails put Stefan Rahmstorf at the center of the campaign. The press release smearing Veizer and Shaviv was authored by PIK and Climategate e-mails show Rahmstorf bringing up the matter more than once. In one e-mail Rahmstorf writes:
I feel another recent paper may require a similar scientific response, the one by Shaviv & Veizer (attached). …This paper got big media coverage here in Germany and I guess it is set to become a climate skeptics classic:

I think it would be a good idea to get a group of people together to respond to this paper (in GSA today). My expertise is good for part of this and I’d be willing to contribute. My questions to you are:
1. Does anyone know of any other plans to respond to this paper? 2. Would anyone like to be part of writing a response? 3. Do you know people who may have the right expertise? Then please forward them this mail.
Best regards, Stefan”
Not about science. It’s about silencing dissenters 
Lüdecke and Puls remind us that honest disagreement is fine but here we are dealing with another issue. What they see here is a clear strategy of “mafia-like methods by a network of AGW alarmists“. Lüdecke and Puls use another Climategate  e-mail presented by a US blogger to illustrate that it’s not about finding out what the truth is, but about attacking anything that disagrees with the AGW hypothesis:
The paper will be thoroughly refuted. I do not know as yet by who, or on what grounds, or where the definitive refutation paper will appear. But it will be refuted and dismissed in no time, never to be talked about again (except by ”deniers” and ‘flat-earthers”). That is thankfully the way we operate in climate science, trust us, we’re scientists. Everything is under control. Nothing to see here, move on.”
That is completely remote of science and very characteristic of dictatorships. EIKE characterizes the attack methods used by the German and Swiss IPCC scientists as “ruthless“. This was also the view of Spiegel, who in 2007 wrote:
The ruthless methods of climate scientist Rahmstorf:  Stefan Rahmstorf is the most famous of the top climate scientists in Germany – and at the same time the most tenacious. Journalists have complained of intimidastion attempts. Scientists are distancing themselves from the Potsdam Professor. In the meantime the conflict is being waged in newspapers.”
Rahmstorf demands control of the press
EIKE adds that “climate scientists like Rahmstorf firmly believe they are the keepers of the absolute truth”, and at the same time they are so sure of their politically supported power that they are demanding absolute control over the press.”
The methods used by the AGW scientists resemble earlier historical attempts to purify thought, culture and science, EIKE suggests. Spiegel wrote of Rahmstorf:
Rahmstorf threatens with a ‘Black List’: How Rahmstorf goes about upbringing journalists is explained in a notable commentary he wrote in “Zeit” in February 2005. At his private internet site he has a list of ‘classic media blunders’ where ‘I require every journalist to attend an obligatory lecture before an interview’. If the journalist reports something sensational, then he will feel the consequences: ‘Such journalists get put on my black list,’ Rahmstorf wrote in ZEIT.”
Dissenters see jihadist undercurrents
Lüdecke and Puls write that intimidating media outlets is part of the Rahmstorf’s strategy. Germany’s flagship Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung once published an op-ed piece by climate skeptics, who wrote:
It’s a holy war, a jihad that Rahmstorf is leading. And no prisoners are taken: He takes quotes out of context, deletes, and thus does not permit his end-of-world announcement to ever be threatened.”
Lüdecke and Puls write that Rahmstorf does not directly confront the journalist who writes something disagreeable, rather he goes directly to the editor-in-chief.
Court fines Rahmstorf for smearing an uncooperative journalist
Once Rahmstorf took his hounding and bullying of a non-conforming journalists too far when he wrote an unflattering piece about a journalist in attempt to discredit her. Eventually a court in Cologne found in favor of the journalist, ruling that Rahmstorf had maliciously spread falsehoods about the journalist, even suggesting that she had once plagarized. The court ruled in favor of the journalist and Rahmstorf was fined.
Spiegel commented on the affair:
Rahmstorf seems to have learned little from the court’s ruling – rather he complains that there is no control over the end-product of the classic media.”
Thank God for that. Let’s hope it stays that way.

Share this...FacebookTwitterOnline Spiegel as of right now has an unflattering report on the UN IPCC AR5 climate report as its top headline.
This hardly helps the credibility of climate scientists.
The headline article is dubbed: Contradictory Prognoses: Scientists Discover Discrepancies In UN Climate Report, written by Spiegel science journalist Axel Bojanowski.
The bold print introduction:
The UN warns in 2200 pages in its new climate report of a dramatic change in the environment. Renowned scientists now criticize the inconsistencies in the report. They aim 5 accusations at the IPCC.”
Among the discrepancies and contradictions Bojanowski mentions, a big one is the IPCC’s unscientific approach used to arrive at it’s infamous “95% certainty” that man is causing the climate change. Spiegel writes, citing Judith Curry:
How can science be certain about man’s impact when over the last 15 years the natural impacts surprisingly have stopped the warming of the air, asked climate scientist Judith Curry of Georgia Institute of Technology, Chairperson of the Climate Forecast Applications Network.”
Spiegel also writes that other scientists accuse the IPCC of not mentioning the uncertainties surrounding its scenarios: “In the summary of the IPCC’s report, the word pause, scientifically ‘hiatus’, is not mentioned at all.”
And the fact that only 3 of 114 models were able to correctly reproduce the 15-year hiatus, Spiegel notes, gets ignored altogether in the summary. Spiegel quotes Eduardo Zorita of the Helmholtz Center GKSS:



<!--

This point should have been more clearly addressed because it underscores that the important deficits of the climate models are still not understood.”
Spiegel is also highly skeptical of the claims made that the oceans have absorbed the heat. Bojanowski writes: “The proof of an additional buffer however appears difficult to find: Precisely at the lower depths of the oceans, which they say have especially warmed up – there, very few measurements have been made.”
Bojanowski also notes that in the previous reports, the IPCC always showed an increasing temperature curve. This time however, the usual line curve was replaced with a decadal “trapeze” chart. “Good PR“, says Reiner Grundmann of the University of Nottingham, “but is that sustainable?”
Bojanowski mentions the IPCC’s failure not to inform the public that there is no connection found between extreme weather and climate change. That should have been pointed out in the summary.
Bojanowski writes that signs of trouble for the IPCC’s AR5 report were already evident at the press conference for its presentation in Stockholm. A “reporter from a British tabloid” asked why the computer simulations failed to predict the 15-year stop in temperature rise. That, Spiegel writes, was a question that the chief of the World Meteorological Organisation WMO, Michel Jarraud, was not pleased to hear.
Bojanowski concludes from that:
Apparently the meteorologist was not used to this; critical questions do not particularly belong to the tradition of press conferences on climate science.”
Another shortcoming of the IPCC report for some scientists, Bojanowski writes:  A “faction” of scientists claims the report underestimates the seriousness of the climate.

Share this...FacebookTwitterLots of reports on bitter cold gripping various parts of ther globe.
German site wetter.net here reports on cold gripping Turkey and the Turkish Riviera, which is typically a place tourists like to go to for warmth and sunshine.
These locations are far away from the Arctic, and are certainly a result of weather driven by patterns taking place at the middle latitudes, and have nothing to do with Arctic sea ice in September. The claim that September Arctic sea ice is controlling December weather in Turkey and the Middle East is absurdity of grotesque dimensions.
That aside, wetter.net writes:
Right now it’s cracking cold especially in the middle of Turkey. Permanent frost has taken hold even down at the lower elevations. Already on Tuesday and Wednesday the residents of Istanbul had to deal with lots of snow. Now foremost it has gotten cold just north of the Turkish Riviera. Also in the generally warm holiday area of Antalya local residents and tourists have had to settle with top temperatures of 8°C  and lows near the freezing point. At the capital of Ankara, which is situated almost 1000 meters above sea level, permanent frost is the forecast. Minus 3°C during the day on Thursday and minus 14 at night.”
Website Ice Age Now also reports on the cold in Turkey. 900 roads had to be closed, thus paralyzing large regions.

Heavy snowfall in Black Sea region, central Anatolia and Eastern provinces. In the eastern provinces of Van, Bitlis, Mus and Hakkari, 951 village roads were closed on Friday due to heavy snow and blizzards.”
Sicilian Nicosia sees “first snow in years”
Ice Age Now here also reports that Mediterranean Sicily has been hard hit by unusual winter conditions.
As of Dec 13, many areas remain cut off due to the heavy snowfall. The bad weather has also caused power cuts and forced schools to close. […] Last night, Nicosia got its first glimpse of snow in years. Snowfall on Thursday night was reported in the villages of Pera Chorio, Alambra, Larnaca district, Latsia and Dali. […] Tonight, temperatures at the mountains will drop to -5 degrees Celcius.”
This is all because there was some missing sea ice 6000 and more kilometers away 3 months ago, some quacks claim. Snake-oil science in its purest form.

"Donald Trump’s administration is finalizing plans to roll back the US government’s only direct efforts to curb coal-fired power plant pollution that is heating the planet.  Trump’s Environmental Protection Agency will replace an Obama-era climate change rule with a regulation that experts warn could help some of America’s oldest and dirtiest coal plants to keep running. Obama’s Clean Power Plan would have pushed power companies to shift away from coal and toward natural gas and renewable power. Trump’s rule instead sets out ways for states to direct coal plants to increase their efficiency, with hardware fixes or operational changes. Trump’s rule will not significantly tackle the heat-trapping gases entering the atmosphere that cause extreme heatwaves, floods and other disasters. And it will lead to higher levels of air pollution, compared with the Clean Power Plan. “I believe this is the first rule in EPA’s history that acknowledges the existential threat of climate change but by the agency’s own admission does absolutely nothing to stop it,” said Obama’s EPA chief Gina McCarthy. “The Trump administration has made painfully clear that they are incapable of rising to the challenge and tackling this crisis. They have shown a callous disregard for EPA’s mission, a pattern of climate science denial, and an inexcusable indifference to the consequences of climate change.” But the Trump administration is defending the change, arguing it is limited by law in how it can regulate the emissions that cause rising temperatures. The EPA administrator, Andrew Wheeler, a former coal lobbyist, on Wednesday said the Obama rule would have raised electricity costs for poorer Americans. But even without that rule taking effect, power companies have been shutting down coal plants, which are more expensive than their cleaner competitors natural gas and renewable energy. Wheeler argued EPA is “leveling the playing field” for coal, although the rule is not expected to significantly boost the US coal industry, which has been in decline for years. The National Mining Association, which represents coal companies, praised the rule, saying it preserves “the rightful authority of the states to manage their own unique energy infrastructure and electric grids”. Wheeler positioned the policy as Republicans’ alternative to the Green New Deal proposed by progressives. Wheeler said: “Rather than Washington telling Americans what type of energy they can use or how they can travel or even what they can eat, we are working cooperatively with the states to provide an affordable, dependable and diverse supply of energy that continues to get cleaner and more efficient.” Joe Goffman, a Harvard professor and former EPA general counsel, called EPA’s legal arguments “tortured” and “deceptive”. Goffman said the rule “demonstrates the Trump administration’s determination not only to avoid taking action to address climate change but also to obstruct current and future efforts by states and successors to cut greenhouse gas pollution”. Democratic-led states and environment advocates are expected to challenge the rule in lawsuits. Attorneys general in New York and Connecticut on Wednesday quickly announced their intent to sue, and many more states are expected to join them. Trump’s agency argues it does not have legal authority to regulate climate change. If the courts agree, future US climate efforts could be in jeopardy. Coal plant air pollution – from tiny particles that enter the lungs – cause breathing problems and early deaths. According to an earlier estimate from EPA, the new rule could lead to 1,400 more deaths each year. One academic analysis estimates that over a decade the repeal could lead to 36,000 deaths, and that other Trump environment rollbacks could lead to a total to 80,000 deaths. Paul Billings, executive director of the American Lung Association, said: “If certain changes are made, we could see the oldest, dirtiest plants run more and that will increase the overall burden caused by the pollution.” Trump and many of his officials have questioned the science that shows rapid global action is needed to limit heat-trapping gases and protect people against a mounting crisis. His agencies have slashed programs designed to limit carbon dioxide from power plants, cars and trucks, and encouraged oil drilling and coal mining. The US has sent more carbon dioxide into the atmosphere than any other country. It is currently the world’s second largest emitter. America’s electricity sector has been rapidly decreasing its climate pollution, even though the Clean Power Plan was stalled by the supreme court and never took effect. Natural gas and renewable power have proved to be cheaper than coal. Power plants are responsible for less than a third of US emissions. And data shows the US saw a rise in overall carbon levels last year. Trump’s rule includes help for states to improve coal plant efficiency. That list does not include technologies to capture the carbon dioxide produced by a coal plant. Although Trump has said he will withdraw from the Paris pact to fight the climate crisis, other countries have stayed in. Still, their efforts are far behind what scientists say is necessary to avoid the worst of the climate emergency."
"Zero-carbon energy sources are poised to overtake fossil fuels as the UK’s largest electricity source over a full calendar year. This year will be the first that fossil fuels make up less than half of the electricity generated, according to National Grid, following a dramatic decline in coal-fired power and rising renewable and low-carbon energy. Instead, UK homes and businesses will rely more on “cleaner” electricity generated by wind farms, solar panels, hydro power and nuclear power reactors. A decade ago, coal plants generated almost a third of the UK’s electricity, but in the first half of this year they have provided only 3%. In the same period renewable energy has climbed from supplying just 2% of the UK’s power to a fifth of all electricity produced. The “landmark tipping point” is an “historic achievement” in the UK’s journey towards becoming a net-zero carbon economy by 2050, said National Grid. John Pettigrew, the UK power system operator’s chief executive, said: “The incredible progress that Britain has made in the past 10 years means we can now say 2019 will be the year zero-carbon power beats fossil fuel-fired generation for the first time.” “We wouldn’t have said it if we weren’t confident that this will be the year.” National Grid is able to confidently predict the 2019 record only six months into the year following the UK’s greenest ever winter, and the huge number of coal-free days recorded since then. The UK reached a record stretch of consecutive 18 coal-free days earlier this year, which ended on 4 June. The electricity system reached a second record this week after racking up 1,838 coal-free hours for this year, breaking a record set across the whole of 2018 in a little over six months. The coal-free days have effectively prevented 5m tonnes of carbon dioxide from entering the atmosphere, or the equivalent of over 12bn miles driven in a car. Chris Skidmore MP, the interim energy minister, said coal is “fast becoming the fossil of our energy system and it will soon be consigned to the history books”. He added: “We’ve set in stone our commitment to end our contribution to climate change entirely by 2050 and this is yet another step on the path to becoming a net zero emissions economy.” By the end of the winter the UK will be left with only five remaining coal fired power plants, after SSE said last week it plans to shut its Fiddler’s Ferry plant near Warrington, Cheshire, next March. SSE revealed the closure after EDF Energy said it would shut its Cottam coal plant in September. The government plans to phase out all coal-fired power generation by 2025. National Grid is spending around £1.3bn a year to adapt the grid to run on renewable energy, and believes that it will be ready to manage a completely zero-carbon electricity grid within six years. “Do I expect that this will be a reality? No,” Pettigrew said. “But we won’t be a constraint in a low carbon world. We will be prepared to play our role.” Doug Parr, Greenpeace UK’s chief scientist, said the “watershed moment” is a sign that the UK is “broadly heading in the right direction”. “The question is, are we moving fast enough?” he said. Research undertaken by National Grid alongside its record forecast has found that “climate anxiety” is rising because people believe there is a lack of urgency in tackling the climate crisis. Nearly seven out of 10 people surveyed by National Grid are concerned about climate change and believe it is not being addressed urgently enough. More than a third of young people said their concerns about climate change would drive them to join a protest. Almost a fifth of 18- to 24-year-olds said they are prepared to skip school or work to do this, possibly inspired by student activist Greta Thurnberg who visited the UK earlier this summer. “As the climate emergency hits home right across the globe from Greenland’s melting ice to India’s scorching heatwave, the clock is ticking on our chances to avoid climate breakdown and public anxiety rightly remains high about the speed of change,” Parr said. “This is no time for ministers to pat themselves on the back and uncork the bubbly,” he said. • This article was amended on 24 June 2019 to clarify in the text that nuclear is not a renewable energy source, and to change the description of the non-fossil fuels that are growing in use to “cleaner”, as they are referred to by National Grid."

By Frank Bosse and Fritz Vahrenholt
(Translated/edited by P Gosselin)
Currently solar activity is especially low. Solar sunspot number (SSN) in September was at 36.9, and thus was just 36% of the usual mean value 58 months into the cycle. The sun continues to remain in an unusually weak cycle 24, which was characterized by a 1-2 year delayed start in November 2008. The following graphic shows the mean value (blue) and the current cycle (red) and the very similar sunspot cycle SC5 (light gray) which occurred during the Dalton Minimum of the early 19th century:

 Dark blue shows average sunspot cycle; red shows current cycle 24 and light gray shows SC5. Horizontal axis is the number of months after the start of cycle.
Several publications suspect that the current cycle could have a double hump. Yet there are lots of indications that a second peak already occurred in April/May 2013. It’s possible that the maximum of SC24 is already behind us and that solar activity is now trending downward. It also appears that the magnetic field of the sun has also reversed. The comparisons between the documented cycles 1-24 is as follows:

 
Since SC 1 (1755-1766) until today the difference between the mean value and the observed monthly sunspot number is summed up. The diagram above shows up to SC24, and it shows that no cycle has been weaker since SC7 (1828). Here the Waldmeier discontinuity correction of 1945 was accounted for.
Since the end of the Dalton-Minimum 190 years ago, never has the sun in its last 7 years been so inactive 
Many people have been doing a lot of thinking about what the implications for the Earth may be. After all, the sun is practically the sole source of energy for our planet. At the top of our atmosphere it provides a gigantic 1365W/sqm. Here the solar radiation is distributed over a wide spectrum from infrared to gamma rays and we receive most of it within the visible light spectrum. And it is precisely this part that is hardly impacted by the solar activity fluctuations. The variation between a quiet sun and one of maximum activity is a mere 0.1%. That’s one reason we are still around. With more variation life on the planet very likely would not have been able develop over the 3 billion years our planet has existed.
All the frequencies within the solar radiation spectrum is what we call Total Solar Irradiance (TSI). In the past in climatology often only this magnitude was taken into consideration and the following conclusion was drawn: The sun cannot account for more than 0.1°K of temperature variation, whether it is active or inactive. This is the argument presented yet again by the latest 2013 IPCC Report. The radiative forcing is given as 0.05 watts per sqm. That is less than 2% of the anthropogenic radiative forcing (2.24 W/ m²).
But there is one massive argument against the IPCC’s view. During preindustrial times, the climate fluctuations in relationship between solar activity were observed to be much larger. Countless studies show this. Yet the IPCC obstinately sticks to its verdict that the impact of greenhouse gases has been the dominant force on climate since mankind has been adding greenhouse gases such as water vapor and CO2 into the atmosphere.  In 2007 in the previous IPCC report a warming rate of 0.2°C per decade was assumed should CO2 rise at a modest rate which indeed has been the case. Using the climatically relevant period of 30 years, global temperature thus should rise 0.6°C by 2030 compared to 2000. In the latest AR5 2013 report, an increase of 0.3 to 0.7°C is forecast for the period 2016 to 2035.
So where do we stand today 13 years after the start? The observed reality has deviated markedly from the prophecies since 2006. The following diagram depicts the monthly observations as to GISS, and its departure from the postulated 0.2°C warming per decade as well as a 60-month low pass.

Where did the heat go? In the deep ocean as some are trying to tell us? In the blog of Hans von Storch (Klimazwiebel) one finds a very telling chart produced by Eduardo Zorita. It shows foremost that winter temperatures of the northern Eurasian continent contributes the most to the observed deviation:

Source: Klimazwiebel
The winter temperatures in the northern hemisphere really don’t give much back to the oceans, rather it’s the land mass between 30 and 60° latitude north! Also the thermal energy amount in the sea down to 700m in the region of the extra-tropical northern hemisphere everywhere refuses to cooperate with the climate models, and shows having reached a peak value in 2007 and since then it has gone downwards:

 
Chart source: Climate explorer
The extra-tropical southern hemisphere shows very little change. There the thermal energy in the oceans increased slightly. How does this fit with the theory of greenhouse gas forcing or the escape of heat to the depths of the ocean below 700 meters? Could the sun be playing a major role?
A new study very well worth reading by Ermolli et al. (2013) looks at the influence of the spectral variation of solar radiation (SSI), especially the ultraviolet spectrum: It is fluctuating much more strongly, by up to 10% between a quiet and an active sun. And at low solar activity, it generates precisely the pattern in the wintertime that we’ve been seeing since 2006: The North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO), which impacts the temperature in the Eurasian region especially in the wintertime, is controlled and effected by the UV radiation of the sun. When there is less solar activity, it gets colder in the region. This is precisely what we are observing, and the large part of the deviation observed in the pure GHG models stems precisely from that. Shouldn’t this be a wake-up call for the climate scientists to look more closely at SSI? This should have been done long ago. However, that would have meant conceding that CO2 is not everything.
The new IPCC report squandered the opportunity to produce scenarios that include the large impact of the sun, which we know always played a major role in the past. The IPCC limits the sun’s impact to the TSI only and they estimate it to be close to zero: -0.1 to +0.1°C.
However, the longer the chasm grows between climate models and reality, and the longer the projected warming fails to materialize, the more the world of science will have to acknowledge the questions of natural variability, especially UV radiation.

Share this...FacebookTwitterGeorg Ehring of German Public Radio conducted an interview with climate scientist Professor Hans von Storch, Director of the German Coastal Research Center.
The introductory text before the interview reads as follows:
The Earth has warmed considerably less than expected over the past 15 years days, says Hans von Storch. That may be due to an unforeseeable climate variability, or that CO2’s effect as a greenhouse gas was over-estimated, so says the meteorologist of the Coastal Research Institute. 

If anything, this interview shows that German climate science is beginning a slow shift and that warmist scientists starting to come to terms with the real possibility that they have been wrong all these years – possibly very wrong. It also shows that they are admitting that climate is poorly understood. The science in nowhere near understood, let alone settled.
On whether global warming has stopped, Hans von Storch says: “No. We don’t expect that. But it is indeed true that we have seen a considerably reduced warming trend compared to what our climate model scenarios showed over the last 15 years. […] We definitely have seen less warming than we expected.”
On what the cause could be, von Storch says many candidates are possible, and it points to climate variability, which would be natural fluctuations, which is what skeptics have been saying from Day 1. He also says that perhaps the climate sensitivity of CO2 was perhaps “a bit over-estimated“. Hans von Storch even mentions the S-word, claiming that it could have something to do with the sun.
On whether or not it could be the oceans eating up the heat, von Storch says that it’s possible, and that “what is obvious here is that our climate models didn’t anticipate this“.

On if models can still be trusted? von Storch obstinately insists:
Yes, completely. […]. It could be that the climate models are completely okay and that nothing bad can be said about them. But we haven’t put all the ingredients which we believe are important for the future into them.”
A most peculiar statement. Bread without flour is not bread. A climate model that does not take a number of factors into account, or that does not weight them correctly, is not a model you can trust – period. Hans von Storch elaborates further, saying that aerosols and solar activity must be better taken into account (along with the ocean cycles he mentions above). What von Storch is trying to say here is that he and the climate scientists are completely stumped as to what’s wrong with the models.
Ehring then asks von Storch what is the most likely explanation for the warming stop? Hans von Storch answers that he can only rely on his instincts, and nothing more. He adds:
There are several hypotheses that have to be looked at in detail. Personally I wouldn’t be surprised if it indeed turns out to be natural climate variations being under-estimated. That is the climate fluctuates more than we assumed.”
He then adds that this would have “serious consequences” for the understanding of climate and that as a scientist, “one must always keep possibilities open and be ready, in the case of doubt, to accept that the data in the end do not exactly fit the earlier explanation. … Us climate scientists do have some reasons to summon the courage to critically have another look to see if we really did everything okay.”

Share this...FacebookTwitterLast Thursday evening and yesterday winter made its debut in Southern Germany and Austria  – and how! Read more here.
German RTL television last night here (starting at 4:30) called it the “most severe start of winter in 200 years!“, saying many meteorologists were caught by surprise. Up to half a meter of snow fell at some locations.
Gone are the mild winters of the sort Europe seen in the 1990s and early 2000s. Indeed for central Europe the last 5 consecutive winters have all been colder than normal – a record!
Municipalities ignoring forecasts of warm winters
These days are blockbuster times for German road salt manufacturers. In Europe municipalities have learned their lesson: ignore foolish predictions of warm winters, order huge quantities of salt, and do it early!
Municipalities and road commissioners were once led astray by climatologists’ predictions of increasingly warmer winters and led to thinking that these had become a thing of the past due to global warming (recall famous words of David Viner and Mojib Latif). One major daily even proclaimed that spring would arrive in January!
As a consequence of these false global warming predictions, municipalities unwisely kept much smaller stocks of road salt for expected shorter and milder winters. Road commissioners saw little reason to keep thousands of tons of road salt in stock.
Then beginning in 2009 came one harsh winter after another. Road maintenance crews and commissioners were caught red-faced. Suddenly municipalities were running out of salt by January and were even no longer able to keep the most vital traffic arteries cleared. Traffic chaos ensued and motorists were left to fend for themselves. Municipalities were stunned and left scratching their heads. Weather-wise the exact opposite of what climatologists had predicted had taken place. They learned the hard way. Now they are no longer heeding the foolish forecasts of warm winters.

Not surprisingly, many of the very same climatologists have since changed their tune and are now suddenly predicting cold, bitter winters for Europe….because of global warming!
German public radio SWR here reports that this year municipalities and road commissioners are stocking up on road salt:
The Salzwerke AG in Heilbronn said that municipalities had ordered large quantities of road salt. […] Over the past years road salt had often been in short supply in some municipalities because the cold periods lasted longer and longer than expected.”
The online daily Märkische Allgemeine Zeitung here reports that the city is now building up its stock of road salt, writing:
In the last season 2012/2013 about 90,000 tonnes of road salt were used. Because of the long and harsh winter considerably more than normal was used, said Mitschka. road salt had to be continuously re-ordered.
In 2010/2011 there were delivery bottlenecks. Even the autobahns in Brandenburg could not be adequately salted at the time.”

Share this...FacebookTwitterUlli Kulke, veteran journalist at Germany’s flagship daily Die Welt, writes at his Die Welt blog that “scientists from Potsdam not long ago were talking about a global temperature increase of four, five or even more degrees Celsius.” But with the recent news leaking out about the upcoming IPCC AR5, that scenario is looking more like fantasy than ever.
If the reports leaking out are accurate, then it appears that, Kulke writes, “the alarmists are backpedaling and one could roughly sum it all up as follows: Nothing is even half as bad.” Reports of exaggerated CO2 climate sensitivity are now filtering through even in Germany and it’s becoming increasingly obvious even to Europeans that the whole issue had been grossly exaggerated.
Kulke writes that he already mentioned recently that the IPCC had significantly scaled back CO2 climate sensitivity in its first draft of the upcoming report. “The way it appears now the IPCC has in the last few days once again scaled back its estimates in the updated drafts and has conceded stark errors in the past report.” Here Kulke cites the Wall Street Journal, the Daily Telegraph, the Mail on Sunday and The Australian.
Kulke continues:
Moreover, they expressly bring up the pause in global warming – and also admit that they cannot explain it and that the computer models, which the IPCC relies on, failed to predict it.”
Nobody knows what the final draft is going to look like. But the IPCC will have to ultimately decide whether to bring up these inconvenient, even embarrassing, facts. Failure to do so would cost the IPCC as a scientific body a lot of respect, of which it is already very low on. On the other hand bringing the glaring shortfalls will make the IPCC appear as prone to error and cost it credibility.

Mann’s flawed hockey stick discarded for good
Kulke also writes that the Medieval Warm Period has reappeared in the latest draft, thus disposing once and for all of Michael Mann’s infamous hockey stick chart.
Not long ago it was inconceivable, but apparently the IPCC is now admitting that during the years between 950 and 1250, i.e. the Middles Ages, most parts of the world were just as warm as they are today. That is during a time when CO2 values in the atmosphere where only a fraction of what they are today.”
Kulke believes that the IPCC’s claims of high certainty on the question of man’s impact on the climate through greenhouse gases will have no impact because “very few scientists have doubts on this“. The real question remains: How big is that impact?
The answer appears to be growing smaller with each passing day.

"Thirteen journalists who were investigating damage to the environment have been killed in recent years and many more are suffering violence, harassment, intimidation and lawsuits, according to a study. The Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ), which produced the tally, is investigating a further 16 deaths over the last decade. It says the number of murders may be as high as 29, making this field of journalism one of the most dangerous after war reporting. On every continent reporters have been attacked for investigating concerns about abuses related to the impact of corporate and political interests scrambling to extract wealth from the earth’s remaining natural resources. These resources end up in all manner of products – from mobile phones to pots and pans – with consumers largely unaware of the stories behind them. The study was produced for Green Blood, a reporting project whose aim is to continue the reporting of local environmental journalists who have been forced to abandon their work. Led by Forbidden Stories, a group of 15 media partners, including the Guardian, El País and Le Monde, have come together to shine an international light on the way these activities affect local environments and communities. Last year, the consortium published an investigation into the murder of Daphne Caruana Galizia. The latest project comes amid repeated warnings of an environmental emergency caused by climate change, which further increases the pressure on already scarce resources. “Environmental issues involve some of the greatest abuses of power in the world and some of the greatest of concentrations of power in the world,” said Bruce Shapiro, the director of the Dart Center for Journalism and Trauma. “I’m hard put to think of a category of investigative reporters who are routinely dealing with more dangerous actors. Investigative reporting on the environment can be as dangerous a beat as reporting on narco smuggling.” The CPJ executive director, Joel Simon, added: “Reporting such stories for national and international media often involves travelling to remote communities and confronting powerful interests. This makes it inherently dangerous. “This is not a new issue, but it has become more acute as climate change has accelerated and environmental change more directly impacts people’s lives. I don’t see that changing any time soon, which is why it is so important to report on environmental issues despite the risk.” Green Blood has focused on the mining industry, with reports from different countries starting on Tuesday. While the journalists identified by CPJ have not been killed in the chosen areas, the behaviour of the police and state security forces has deterred reporters from raising the concerns of local people, meaning there can be an effective news blackout. Over eight months, the Green Blood partners worked with local reporters to gather documents and witness accounts and conduct scientific tests to identify pollution. The first investigation concerns a Tanzanian mine where journalists trying to investigate its activities and relationships found themselves harassed and their stories spiked following pressure from police and state authorities. Reporters have lost their jobs and two newspapers were shut down. The allegations concern villagers being displaced and shot dead by police and security guards. A number of women have spoken of being raped by guards. The second report features a nickel mine. Global demand for this mineral is high because it is used in stainless steel cookware and surgical instruments. Its value is expected to rise exponentially because of its use in eco-friendly electric cars, helping push up prices for all nickel producers. However, hundreds of indigenous Mayan families are paying a high price for its production in Guatemala. They have complained of evictions, criminal prosecutions and water shortages. Reporters raising the alarm have been held under house arrest and forced into hiding to avoid prison. The consortium has also been to south India, where sand mining is a multibillion-dollar industry. Minerals removed from beaches are used in everything from cosmetics to robotics. India is one of the most dangerous places to be a journalist – three of the 13 identified as having been killed in the course of their work since 2009 were from the country. Three more were based in the Philippines. The others died in Panama, Colombia, Russia, Cambodia, Myanmar, Thailand and Indonesia. Ramesh Bhushal, project manager with the organisation Earth Journalism, said menaces kept vital information hidden from the public. “What happens is that the journalists are discouraged from writing about those serious issues, and they end up writing about other issues that are easier to cover and they don’t get threats for.” Tanzania has slipped 25 places on the World Press Freedom Index produced by Reporters Without Borders (RSF), where it ranks 118th out of 179 countries. “Journalists [in Tanzania] are attacked without reason,” Ryan Powell, a media development specialist working in east and west Africa, told Forbidden Stories. “Police will harass journalists, and people do not interfere.” In south and central America, indigenous reporters are particularly at risk. Guatemala is 116th in the RSF index. Its president, Jimmy Morales, elected in 2016, made a commitment to introduce a national mechanism for the protection of the media soon after winning power, but the initiative has yet to be endorsed by the ministry of the interior."

Share this...FacebookTwitterRetired German meteorologist Klaus-Eckart Puls has written an analysis at the European Institute for Climate and Energy (EIKE) website here. He concludes:
Old and new measurement data show that sea level rise has decelerated.”
The article is a bit long and so I’ll focus on the main results only.
North Sea rise stagnates
First he discusses a 2013 study by T. Wahl, et al.: “Observed mean sea level changes around the North Sea coastline from 1800 to present”; Earth-Science Reviews; Volume 124, September 2013, Pages 51, which examined 30 North Sea tide gauges, of which some of them go back up to 200 years and most of them 100 years. The results:

Source: T. Wahl, et al.
The Wahl paper writes:
In summary the long term trends in the North Sea are not significantly different from global sea level trends, while the inter-annual and decadal variability are much bigger in the North Sea and hardly comparable to those derived from the global sea level reconstruction considered here.
The recent rates of sea level rise (i.e. over the last two to three decades) are high compared to the long-term average, but are comparable to those which have been observed at other times in the late 19th and 20th century.”
Puls concludes: “There are variations, but no acceleration on a 100-year scale!!!”
Sea level rise at the German bight
Puls then examines data from the German bight. The results are depicted by the following graphic:

Evaluation of coastal tide gauges at the German bight: “No acceleration!” Data: Albrecht, F., T. Wahl, J. Jensen and R.Weisse (2011).
Puls’s conclusion: “The data going back in part over the last 160 years show no acceleration in sea level rise. Rather there is a slight weakening as the polynomial indicates.”
Global sea level rise slowing down
Although variations at the North Sea are greater than those of global sea level, Puls writes that the overall trend is practically the same. He provides a graphic of the data taken by satellite:

Evaluation of satellite altimetry – data source: http://sealevel.colorado.edu/
Puls writes: “Even over the two most recent decades no acceleration can be detected, rather there is a weakening.”
Meteorolgist Puls then summarizes the results of the GRACE data for the last 9 nine years: “Only 1,7 mm per year.”
The EIKE article then looks at the “grotesque” discrepancy between satellite data and tide gauge data, and that to this day there is still no reasonable explanation for it. One thing is sure: the collection of tide gauges doesn’t lie.
Puls concludes
The constant stream of alarm reports of supposedly dramatic sea level rise at present and in the future cannot be confirmed by observations. Rather, the data as a whole contradict it. Worldwide neither tide gauges nor satellite data indicate an acceleration in sea level rise. Rather they show a weakening. There is a glaring contradiction between earlier and current statements from a number of institutes, climate models and the IPCC. Moreover there are strong indications that the satellite data showing higher values were “over-corrected”.

Share this...FacebookTwitterProven by thousands of temperature datasets, the earth’s climate fluctuated cyclically in the past, and there’s an overwhelming body of evidence showing a close correlation with solar activity and other powerful natural factors. If the IPCC had truly examined past temperature developments and compared them to solar data, they’d have seen there is something remarkable there.
Yet in the IPCC AR5, Working Group 1 takes only a cursory look at solar activity and its possible impacts on climate in IPCC AR5 before simply dismissing the sun altogether. The Earth’s sole supplier of energy, the sun, and all its dynamism, in fact gets only a couple of pages in a 2200-page report, about 0.1%. That alone is a monumental scandal. It’s incompetence and negligence on the grandest of scales.
This will certainly go down in the books as one of the greatest scientific debacles of human history.
If the IPCC had directed the same energy and resources to make the sun and natural factors the culprit for climate change as it has with CO2, they’d certainly have a far more convincing case today,and many of the questions it claims are still open would be closed. But obviously the IPCC’s sole intent is to frame mankind and its CO2 emissions as the culprit for something that stopped happening 16 years ago. This is fraud, not science.
The IPCC took the same negligent approach with sea levels: dismissing non-alarmist science in favor of nutty, doomsday scenarios.
I spent half a day searching for papers that provide evidence of a significant impact on climate by the sun and natural factors, and another full day sorting through them. I limited the scope of the search to 2008 – 2012, i.e. papers since the last IPCC report. There are many more papers of course prior to 2008.
What follows is a list of papers I found in just a few hours that the IPCC should have taken a much closer look at instead of just dismissing. The list of course is not complete.
An excellent resource that really speeded things up was the site:
Popular Technology.net
Popular technology is actually a list of 1100 papers that the IPCC wishes did not exist.
For some of the papers I’ve included links to additional information and some important quotes. Unfortunately I was not able to do this for every paper as time is limited.
Because of this gross negligence/incompetence on the IPCC’s part, the AR5 fifth is at best a woefully incomplete work and thus has reached a faulty conclusion.

"By the early 1990s, the man now dubbed the “chief climate change skeptic” in Donald Trump’s White House had already decided he was uneasy with the science that showed humans were heating the planet.  William Happer, the former Princeton physicist now on Trump’s National Security Council, was then in charge of energy research under George HW Bush. He asked experts at the Department of Energy to discuss their work with him and was displeased with the attitude he sensed from a climate researcher, according to a story recalled by two of his colleagues. “They were not just defensive; they just weren’t going to entertain questions,” said Richard Lindzen, an atmospheric physicist from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and a critic of the scientific consensus on the climate crisis. Two years later, when Bill Clinton entered office, Happer got into a public disagreement with Al Gore, then the vice-president, over evidence that refrigerant chemicals were eating a hole in the ozone layer. Happer was soon relieved of his government job. Happer, now 79, remembers standing from his seat in the back of a meeting and telling Gore, ‘What you’ve said is absolutely incorrect,’ according to Caleb Rossiter, who Happer helped recruit to run an organization he founded that questions climate science. So began Happer’s reputation as a renegade and dissident within a small subculture of academics who think the huge body of research proving a man-made climate crisis is wrong. Happer’s position veers far to the right of the typical conservative who questions the severity of the climate crisis. Trump’s former EPA chief Scott Pruitt – previously the administration’s most vocal climate denier – questioned whether humans and their carbon dioxide pollution were the main cause of global warming. But Happer’s ideology goes a step further. He thinks the extra carbon is beneficial to the planet. And he is in a position to embolden the president’s climate denial as the administration slashes environmental protections and encourages fossil fuel use. Since he was appointed last autumn as the director of emerging technologies on the White House’s National Security Council, Happer has pushed to challenge the government’s findings that climate change is a national security threat, according to documents first leaked to the Washington Post in February. No further news has come of that effort, and the National Security Council declined to comment on any possible plans. But the New York Times has reported Happer censored written testimony from the state department, noting in one draft document that it was “not objective testimony at all” and included “a lot of climate-alarm propaganda.” “There’s nothing exceptional about the current climate,” a commenter, identified to the Times by two sources as Happer, said. He’s also sent emails to Nasa administrator Jim Bridenstine criticizing his views that humans are the major cause of warming. The federal government’s own climate science assessment concludes, “the global warming of the past 50 years is primarily due to human activities, predominantly the burning of fossil fuels.” Happer was born in India when it was a British colony. His mother was a medical missionary and then worked at Oak Ridge National Laboratory on the Manhattan Project, which Happer credits with his interest in physics. He received his PhD in physics from Princeton in 1964, teaching at Columbia University before returning to Princeton in 1980. He is credited with innovations to acquire better images of peoples’ lungs and clearer views of the stars. In 1976, he became a member of Jason, an elite group of scientists who advise the government. After Happer left the energy department feeling unfairly treated, he eventually became more involved with a movement convinced that world leaders were being duped by climate scientists. People he has worked with believe humans and their carbon dioxide pollution couldn’t possibly be causing worse droughts, fires and floods. “He became very aware of the fact that these decisions were very political rather than scientific that were being made and still are,” said Patrick Moore, the chairman of the climate-crisis denying CO2 Coalition, which Happer helped start. Moore compared Happer’s quest to scientists persecuted throughout history: Galileo, Darwin, Mendel and Einstein, who each “had to fight against a so-called consensus”. In 2015, Happer co-founded the CO2 Coalition, a nonprofit that advocates for carbon dioxide, calling it “vital” to life on earth and important to crop growth. The CO2 Coalition receives funding from the Mercer family, a top Trump donor that also gave more than $2m to organisations denying climate science in 2016. The group receives money from the billionaire conservative industrialists, Charles and David Koch too. CO2 Coalition representatives can often be found at conservative conferences, touting CO2 from small booths with pamphlets. In 2017, when Happer was reportedly under consideration to be Trump’s science advisor, he sent a letter to a Jezebel reader arguing that the “demonization of CO2” “really differs little from the Nazi persecution of the Jews, the Soviet extermination of class enemies or ISIL slaughter of infidels”. In a CNN-hosted debate with Bill Nye, Happer said: “There’s this myth that’s developed around carbon dioxide that it’s a pollutant, but you and I both exhale carbon dioxide with every breath.” He believes the gas is beneficial overall, because it helps plants grow. Michael Bender, a Princeton geosciences professor, spoke with Happer several times and said he was cordial in interactions that did not concern man’s influence on climate. “I think his reputation as a physicist has been very high for a long time … this is something I’ve heard from a number of physicists,” Bender said. But he added: “To me it seems like the important things are whether his views about climate science are rational and how he wants to exert influence.”"

Share this...FacebookTwitterNot long ago, all of Germany’s political parties and media, whether socialist, green, liberal or conservative, embraced and voted into law the green energy feed-in act (EEG). The few remaining outspoken opponents were marginalized as political Neanderthals and climate deniers.
Now fast-forward 5 years to today. My oh my how perceptions have changed. As the costs and the technical folly become more apparent, major back-pedaling is beginning. Once the darling of the media, Germany’s renewable energy feed-in act (EEG) is now coming under heavy fire. Energy prices have been skyrocketing, and CO2 emissions aren’t going down by any measure.
The latest to fire harsh criticism is leading political daily, the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung (FAZ) in an online piece titled: Too much is too much. The introduction:
The transition to renewable energy is becoming a giant re-distribution machine. The subsidy is careening out of control. There’s far more green energy than planned. The price for emission certificates are plunging. Coal is experiencing a Renaissance. And the world is emitting more CO2 than ever.”
Granted the FAZ still is in favor or green energies, but not like this. The FAZ calls the current implementation of Germany’s green energy feed-in act a “giant redistribution machine” that is “dividing the nation“, where a “majority now fear further rising energy costs“. The surcharge for green energy will soon rise to 7 cents per kilowatt-hour, almost “double what power is traded for on the power commodity exchanges“. Consumers are now paying 30 euro-cents ($0.38) per kilowatt-hour.

The FAZ adds that the green energy subsidy “has completely gone out of control“.  Worse, the lobby of those who have benefitted massively from these subsidies has turned into a behemoth that no politician dares to challenge. The German green energy feed-in act does not only impact the German power market, but “grotesquely distorts” the European power market, writes the FAZ.
And because green energies have been massively subsidized to the detriment of other power sources, other subsidies have to enacted to counter the market distortions. The result: more subsidies for power companies to keep reserve plants on stand-by, or to pay wind park operators to shut down when there’s too much power being fed in. The green energy revolution has turned into a subsidy bonanza where investors have no risks.
Another massive error described by the FAZ article was the belief that fossil fuels would get more expensive. That hasn’t happened The opposite is true. New oil and gas reserves, thanks to fracking, for example, have caused these fuels to plummet in price. The FAZ writes:
The gas price there has already fallen 75%. Because coal there is being replaced gas, the emissions of carbon dioxide in the USA has fallen to the lowest level in 20 years. That’s perverse. Through fracking, America reaches its climate targets which it never signed on to while self anointed model climate student Germany is emitting more CO2 than last year.”
Now that the opposition greens and socialists are plummeting in German opinion polls, look for Angela Merkel and her government to take steps to shut down the ruinous renewable energy subsidy orgy soon after next weekend’s national elections.

"Whether it’s wars or elections, winners throughout history get to frame the story of what happened. Australia’s federal election one month ago is no different. If the Coalition is to be believed, they won convincingly and now have a mandate to continue their do-nothing approach on climate and to wind back Australia’s progressive tax system. If the Murdoch press is to believed, Australians voted overwhelmingly in favour of coal.  However, in this analysis you would miss that the Coalition has a one-seat majority. You would miss that their primary vote dropped. And you would also miss that in the election, Scott Morrison repeatedly chose to champion his government’s renewable energy credentials - “what we have is $25 billion invested in renewable energy in this country between 2018 and 2020, which is an all-time record.” In an election period, the fact that this renewable energy boom is occurring because Tony Abbott unsuccessfully tried to kill the Renewable Energy Target, the main driver for the current boom, is by the by. However, post-election, this fact is instructive of how challenging the Coalition will continue to find governing. While Abbott may be gone, so too are many Coalition moderates, either voted out like Sarah Henderson, retired pre-election or in the case of Arthur Sinodinos, are headed for the US. This means the Coalition Party room is filled with more people who are ideologically opposed to acting on climate and renewable energy. However, these issues aren’t going away. Indeed, the impacts of climate change are becoming more obvious and more severe. In just the last year, we have seen an almost year-round fire-season, stretching emergency services. There have been record-breaking heatwaves and floods which killed people and livestock and, of course, severe and ongoing drought. These are set to continue and likely get worse. This in turn further heightens public awareness of the climate crisis, which is saying something given that public concern about climate is at a record high. And while this public concern didn’t translate to electoral victory for parties with comprehensive climate policies, it is not going away. The climate movement activated record numbers of people in the federal election. However, it seems that given the consistent polling showing an ALP victory, many did not get involved. Since the election, sign-ups to climate organisations have peaked. The Stop Adani campaign has had 3,658 new supporters sign up since the election, while new organisation Parents for Climate doubled its membership in the two weeks after the election. And it is not just everyday citizens; everyone from the Reserve Bank and investment funds to doctors to Australia’s major trading partners to ASX100 companies are calling for greater action on climate. This groundswell of people and organisations demanding more action are backed in by global economic trends in technology that the Australian government cannot ignore. Around the world, solar PV installations are doubling every 2-3 years, and with every doubling, there is a 28.5% reduction in module costs. These exponential growth and cost reduction trends are similar for wind generation, battery storage and electric vehicles. As such, it is now significantly cheaper to build a wind or solar farm firmed by battery storage or pumped hydro than a new coal-fired power station or gas plant. As key architects of the marketisation and privatisation of the electricity system, the Liberal Party cannot now escape these market forces. All of this means that the federal government is swimming against the tide of both public opinion and economics, and that is a hard and tiring thing to do. While it will be hard going, they are going to give it a red-hot go. In March, the energy minister, Angus Taylor, announced a feasibility study for a new coal-fired power station in central Queensland. They are pushing ahead with the Big Stick legislation motivated by the desire to force AGL to sell Liddell coal power station before they plan to close it in 2022. Then there are the myriad coalmines and gas-fracking projects that the federal government will approve and support, including the Adani coal mine and the Beetaloo gas basin in the Northern Territory. All the while Australia’s carbon emissions continue to rise at a time when we must urgently reduce them. In both climate and energy terms, timing matters. In the energy system, our ageing coal-fired power stations are increasingly breaking down during heatwaves when we most need electricity. On the climate front, the situation could not be more dire. So what now must we do? 1. Learn the significant lessons from this election While thousands of people took action in the climate election and there were wins  in Indi and Warringah, we cannot afford to elect another federal government that does not take acting on climate seriously. So we must learn what worked and what didn’t and trial different ways of working on climate in the next three years. Even a month on, it is still too early to say definitively what these lessons are, as organisations and campaigns are still reflecting and parsing what happened. 2. Go back to basics We need to tell the stories of climate change, its causes and the solutions in ways that connect to people’s everyday lives. This means fewer graphs and statistics and more stories. Stories of people such as Dino Cerrachi, a stone-fruit grower who had his crop cooked on the trees in the heatwave last summer, or Janet Reynolds, who lost her home in a fire in the middle of winter last year. Or Liuanga Palu, a member of the Western Sydney Pacific community and Uniting Church who help found Voices for Power, a campaign to ensure migrant communities can access affordable and renewable power. 3. Hold the federal government to account We cannot let the federal government’s lies such as “we will meet our Paris targets at a canter” and the crown of thorns starfish not climate is the most “imminent threat” to the Great Barrier Reef flourish; they must be resisted and rejected. This is why campaigns to prevent more carbon bombs such as the Adani mine, the Betaloo Basin and other gas and coal projects will continue and ramp up. 4. Get on with it The federal government does not have a monopoly on climate action. While they can make it quicker or slower, easier or harder, there are others actors who can play significant roles in lowering carbon pollution.

And it’s not even a La Nina year.

Another sign is Central Europe refusing to warm further. Meteorologist Dominik Jung at Wetter.net here reports that Germany’s 2013 year was the 2nd coldest in a decade. The mean temperature was only 0.4°C over the 1961 – 1990 mean. Only 2010 was “a bit colder”.
Hey! That means the coldest 2 years of the decade happened just recently. Clearly the recent flurry of cold events shows that the globe is cooling, thus contradicting the global warming hypothesis. Alarmists are desperate to explain why.

By Frank Bosse and Fritz Vahrenholt
(Translated by P Gosselin)
In October 2013 there was a considerable rise in solar activity as the sunspot number (SSN) climbed to 85.6. That’s 77% of the mean value reached at this time into a solar cycle since 1750. The following diagram shows the current situation:

SSN versus months since the start of the cycle
October 2013 deviates significantly from solar cycle number 5. However we continue to believe that SC 24 will be similar to SC 5. Just how large the uncertainties of the correct description of the 5th cycle is shown by a recently published paper by Rainer Arlt of the Leibniz Institute Potsdam and Ilya Usoskin of the Finnish University of Oulo, who after examining the solar cycles between 1750 und 1850 reached the conclusion that the sunspot count should be lowered by 20%. SC 24 shown by the red curve is, however, still very much below average of SC 1-23, let alone well below the large cycles of the solar maximums from 1940 – 1990.
Also in October 2013 mainly the southern hemisphere (SH) of our sun was active. In a comparison of the cycles with each other (here the SSN anomaly thus far up to the current cycle month) we see that the accumulated sunspot number is between SC5 and SC 14:

Current cycle indicate we are entering a Dalton-like minimum

In a recent publication in Space Science Reviews (2013), renowned solar scientists Ken McCracken, Juerg Beer, Friedhelm Steinhilber and Jose Abreu studied the solar minimums over the last 9300 years. Based on measurements of beryllium and carbon isotopes as indicators for the intensity of cosmic rays, which are modulated by solar activity, the scientists arrived at the result that the minimum of 2007 to 2009 had similar characteristics as the minimums occurring during the time of the Dalton Minimums of 1780 to 1820. They discovered a 208-year periodicity (Suess-de Vries) of a grand solar minimum in the past. Therefore they anticipate in the near future the events of a Dalton Minimum, but not a Maunder Minimum.
Lockwood sees elevated chance of a Maunder-like minimum
Another established solar scientist, Prof. Michael Lockwood of the University of Reading, has pointed out that solar activity since the end of the last century has diminished more strongly than it ever has in all the earlier times of the last 9000 years. Lockwood found 24 solar minimum in the last 9000 years, and nowhere did solar activity drop so strongly as it has in the current period. He now sees the probability of another Maunder Minimums at 25- 30%. Just a few years ago he said the probability of a Maunder Minimum re-occurring was 8%. Consequently Lockwood: “We found a significant relationship between the occurrence of cold winters in Europe and solar activity.“ The probable mechanism is the change in the solar UV radiation, which has an influence of the temperature gradient, ozone formation, and the winds in the stratosphere. This in turn disrupts the Jetstream in the northern hemisphere, leads to blocking weather patterns, and to easterly winds that lead to cold spells.
Already in our September report 2013 concerning the publication by Ermolli et al we pointed to a much more strongly variable UV radiation within a solar cycle then what is observed in the overall total radiation (factor 2-6). Weaker solar cycles have a considerably weaker UV radiation and lead to cold periods in the northern hemisphere. Unfortunately the measurements can no longer be continued because the SORCE satellite, which measures the radiation of the sun above the atmosphere, has stopped functioning because of battery damage, and so the cold winters that lie ahead will have to be endured without satellite UV measurements.
And we introduce a third publication. In it Friedrich Steinhilber and Jürg Beer are venturing a look at the next 500 years using two different methods. Here, phi is a measure of solar activity. M marks the Maunder Minimum, D the Dalton Minimum and G the weaker Gleisberg Minimum of 1900:

"Theresa May’s initiative to decarbonise the UK economy by 2050 has been estimated to cost £50bn per year (theguardian.com, 6 June). It is hoped that by taking leadership in this way, others will follow. However, the world’s emissions are already changing the Earth’s climate, and such changes will only get larger as emissions of greenhouse gases continue. As an example, Namibia is being forced by one of its most intense droughts on record to raise $1m by auctioning off some of its wildlife. This shouldn’t be necessary. If the UK were to give just 1% of this £50bn per year to help climate adaptation efforts in the developing world – for example, supporting investment in solar-powered desalination infrastructure in drought-prone countries – this would send a powerful signal that it is taking seriously not only its future emissions but also its responsibilities for past and ongoing emissions.Tim PalmerRoyal Society research professor in climate physics, University of Oxford  • Did the story “Extreme weather triggers fastest carbon emissions rise in a decade” (12 June) make you wonder why? The UK emissions 2018 progress report to the Committee on Climate Change showed that after nearly a decade of falling emissions from buildings, they shot up in 2018. Proffered solutions focus on more technology. Nowhere is it mentioned that modern building design itself is deeply flawed and that regulations are resulting in ever more over-serviced, climate-vulnerable building types. These are lightweight, unshaded, with overglazed walls, completely reliant on mechanical heating, cooling and ventilation life-support systems, with no internal thermal mass to absorb or release excess heat for night-time heating or cooling. Few have natural ventilation either. Two simple regulations would mean engineers, architects and planners would have to create climate-ready buildings. They could also ensure the lights stay for summer demand peaks, people do not roast in their new homes and workplaces and buildings don’t need to be evacuated when the power fails during extreme peaks. Make it mandatory on new buildings to have solar hot water and photovoltaic panels, and at least 25% of windows to be opening.

"As a teenager, disenchanted with religion, I turned to Shakespeare for ethical guidance. I was inspired by the work of the Royal Shakespeare Company. It represented the ultimate company of conscious artists, speaking and playing Shakespeare with humour and insight. In my 20s I was fortunate to join the company, play Hamlet and Romeo, and become an associate artist. I have been delighted ever since to be connected with thousands of artists and audiences who have made the RSC what it is. And yet today I feel I must dissociate myself from the RSC, not because it is any less of a theatre company, but because of the company it keeps.  In 2012, when the RSC first partnered with BP, I joined a number of others in expressing concern that the RSC was “allowing itself to be used by BP to obscure the destructive reality of its activities”. We felt BP was buying the impression that it, too, had the consciousness of Shakespeare and the RSC artists. At the same time, the activist theatre group BP or not BP? began a series of Shakespearean stage invasions in protest at the sponsor. In the wake of that criticism, the RSC desisted in putting BP logos on more plays. However, the following year, BP instead started sponsoring the £5 ticket scheme for 16- to 25-year-olds, and in 2016 the RSC signed a contract for the partnership to continue until 2022. The arts sponsorship business is tricky. I would love nothing more than increased support for the imaginative arts, athletics and sciences of Britain. So I met with the environmentalist Jonathon Porritt, to find out if my suspicions about BP were wrong. “I worked closely with senior leaders in BP for more than a decade, intent on helping them radically change course,” he told me. “That work came to an end when I came to the incontrovertible conclusion that BP is neither sincere nor serious in addressing the climate crisis.” He continued: “Together with other oil majors, BP has been accused of fully understanding the science of climate change as far back as the early 1980s, and downplaying and obscuring that science ever since, always in the short-term interests of its shareholders. Regrettably, its current leadership is stuck in the same pattern – all the time using philanthropy to hide its past and present culpability.” The early 1980s! This is 2019. Half the greenhouse gases in the atmosphere currently warming our planet have been emitted in the last 30 years. BP has made the third-biggest contribution to climate change of any private company in history. It apparently knew three decades ago we were about to cook our planet, and then lit the fire. And this is not just about the past; this is about the future. The climate crisis could now not be more urgent, and to tackle it climate scientists advise that the majority of known fossil-fuel reserves be left in the ground. But BP has committed to invest £41bn in new oil extraction over the next 10 years. Its current advertising campaign suggests the company is investing heavily in renewables, yet in reality 97% of its capital investments will remain in oil and gas. BP is also a powerful lobbyist. It recently topped the list of firms obstructing climate action around the world and has been successfully lobbying President Trump for access to Arctic oil. I also wonder how much BP is actually giving the RSC? Oil companies operating in the North Sea, of which BP is one of the biggest, benefit from billions in tax breaks and subsidies, so in reality they are taking much more from the public purse than they are “giving back” in sponsorship. Back in 2017 I submitted a question to the RSC’s AGM, as I thought my role as an associate artist was to press these matters reasonably within the organisation. Many months later, I was told that BP’s support was discussed and that “we assess potential donations against three principles – they must support the charitable objectives of the RSC, reflect the integrity of the RSC and not influence the RSC’s artistic decisions”. It went on: “Possible ways to further involve the RSC’s valued associate artists are already under way, welcoming their support through private consultation.” I have waited two years for that consultation. Hearing nothing, I recently let the RSC know that I feel I must resign as I do not wish to be associated with BP any more than I would with an arms dealer, a tobacco salesman or anyone who wilfully destroys the lives of others alive or unborn. Nor, I believe, would William Shakespeare. The RSC’s response? We must be “phased and pragmatic”. In reality, this means the RSC will continue pushing BP’s brand on to a generation of young people who have – in huge numbers through the ongoing school strikes – told adults they need to step up their response to the climate crisis now. Surely the RSC wants to be on the side of the world-changing kids, not the world-killing companies? I do not write this in anger or righteousness. We are all together in this crisis and we all must change. I am resigning to lend strength to the voices within the RSC who want to be progressive, and to encourage my fellow associates to express themselves, too.  The RSC is well placed to make a positive statement about the responsibility of cultural organisations to act on the climate crisis. It could turn this situation on its head and give young people much more value than a cheap £5 ticket. It could give them the support of Shakespeare in their stand against our addiction to energy dealers who would willingly destroy us for a quick quid. The children know the truth: tough love. In the face of addiction, tough love is the only path. It’s time for an artistic intervention.

"New York state would launch the most progressive policy in the US to combat the climate crisis and one of the most ambitious in the world under a new plan devised by state legislators. The program projects that the state would produce 100% of its electricity from renewable sources by 2040 and reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 85% by 2050.  The proposed legislation, agreed by the state’s Democrat-run senate, faces a vote by the other house of the state legislature, the assembly, in New York’s capital, Albany, on Wednesday. New York’s Democratic governor, Andrew Cuomo who negotiated the proposal with top lawmakers and would have final word over any approved legislation, said it would give New York the nation’s best plan to address the causes of the climate crisis. “Climate change is the issue of our lifetime, frankly,” Cuomo said on public radio on Tuesday morning. The bill’s adoption comes amid the Trump administration’s ongoing dismantling of environmental protections. Trump has especially hampered efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, such as announcing that the US will be leaving the Paris climate agreement. The administration announced on Wednesday that it was finalizing plans to roll back the US government’s only direct efforts, initiated by the Obama administration, to curb coal-fired power plant pollution that is heating the planet. New York – which alleged in a 2018 a lawsuit that the oil giant ExxonMobil misled shareholders about climate change-related legal risks – joins a handful of states who have decided to reduce greenhouse gas emissions on their own, regardless of the federal government’s opposing actions or inaction. Hawaii and California have pledged to generate 100% of their energy from renewable sources by 2045. New York City, Miami, San Francisco and Houston are among the US cities working to fight climate change. “Today marks a historic day for New York state in the fight against climate change,” said Andrea Stewart-Cousins, state senate majority leader, in a statement. “As our leaders in Washington fail to take action, New York needs to lead in this time of great crises for our planet.” If New York state reduced greenhouse gas emissions by 85% by 2050, the remaining 15% would be offset through efforts to remove carbon from the atmosphere, such as planting more trees. In order to reach the emissions reductions goals, New York will have to ramp up production of renewable energy sources, such as solar and wind power, while promoting increased energy efficiency. Environmental advocates supporting the bill said it was a good first step, but that more had to be done; one advocate criticized Cuomo for “watering down” earlier versions of the proposal. “This legislation would move New York in the right direction, but much too slowly,” said Eric Weltman, senior organizer at Food & Water Watch. “The climate crisis demands that New York do more and faster to move off fossil fuels.” Opponents of the bill have claimed that it could prompt job loss and increased energy prices."
"Greenpeace has ended its protest against BP drilling for oil in the North Sea by handing in “people’s climate injunctions” at the company’s headquarters. Greenpeace protesters spent nearly seven days occupying an oil rig rented by BP in the Cromarty Firth in northern Scotland last week, leading to the arrests of 14 activists, including three photographers hired by the pressure group.  After the rig Paul B Loyd Jr set sail on Saturday night, Greenpeace tried to prevent it reaching the Vorlich oilfield 150 miles east of Aberdeen by blocking its route with its ship the Arctic Sunrise. The oil rig evaded the Arctic Sunrise by changing course several times before arriving at its drill site on Wednesday morning. Greenpeace said the rig cost BP £140,000 a day to hire from its operator Transocean, which had nearly 100 oil workers on board during the protests. In a final attempt to obstruct the rig, Greenpeace said one of its swimmers swam into its path. It took her out of the water when the rig came within a nautical mile of her without altering course. Claiming its protest had been a success because it had delayed drilling for 12 days, Greenpeace said it had handed in two “injunctions”, documents mimicking a court order, at BP’s headquarters in Aberdeen and London urging the firm to immediately stop drilling new wells and switch to renewables. Its activists also protested outside BP’s European headquarters in Germany, accusing it of ignoring the climate emergency and breaching its pledges to honour the Paris climate agreement, which requires climate heating to be limited to 1.5C. John Sauven, Greenpeace UK’s executive director, said: “For the past 12 days we’ve seen what one Greenpeace ship and a handful of dedicated activists can achieve in the face of a giant climate-wrecking company. But they weren’t alone. There’s a movement of millions calling on companies like BP to clean up their act and truly address the climate emergency.” Eleven activists have appeared in court charged with disorderly conduct. The three photographers have not been charged. Police Scotland confirmed it had reported Greenpeace to Scottish prosecutors for further direct action on Sunday while the rig was at sea. It is understood Greenpeace inflatable boats are suspected of illegally breaching a 500-metre safety exclusion zone around the rig on Sunday morning. BP said it was glad the protests were over. “Greenpeace’s irresponsible actions have put people and property unnecessarily at risk, and diverted valuable time and resources away from public services,” a spokesman said. “Progress to a lower carbon future will depend on coming together, understanding each other’s perspectives and working to find solutions.”"

Share this...FacebookTwitterThe IPCC corrects projected temperature range for 2100 downwards by 1°C
By Michael Krueger, Science Skeptical
(Translated and edited by P Gosselin)
The IPCC AR5 Summary for Policymakers was released at the end of September, followed some days later by the Working Group 1 Report. The press directed much of its attention to sea level rise, as this magnitude was corrected upwards compared to the last 2007 report.
But the media gave  little attention to the expected temperature increase until 2100 for the various scenarios. Let’s take look at the temperature scenarios of the 2013 report and compare them to those of 2007. Taking a closer look we see a less alarmist picture than what we are told about sea with sea level.
Compared to the IPCC report of 2007, the range for projected temperature for the various scenarios until 2100 were corrected downwards by almost a full degree Celsius in the 2013 report. This is clearly depicted by the side-by-side comparison of the two charts from the respective 4th and 5th climate reports:

Range of projections of 2007 (left), 2013 (right)
In the 4th report (left) the range of the temperature scenarios up to the year 2100 was between 1.1°C (scenario B1, lowest value) and up to 6.4°C (scenario A1Fl, upper value).


<!--

google_ad_slot = ""6412247007"";
google_ad_width = 200;
google_ad_height = 200;
//-->




But now in the 5th report (right), the values have been corrected downwards and now range from only 0.2 to 0.3°C (scenario RCP2.6, lowest value) to 5.5°C (scenario RCP8.5, highest value). Thus the range of the temperature scenarios have been corrected downwards by approximately 0.9°C.
Because this is now a less alarming scenario and contradicts the notion of a more rapidly warming world, the media likely shifted their focus over to sea level rise.
In the following comparator the red arrow shows how the range for the temperature scenarios for 2100 was corrected downwards approx. 0.9°C. The latest range starts with a temperature that barely rises over the next 87 years, thus assuring in the future that climate scientists will always be able to say their models were right.

This downward correction was never presented as good news, and the media continue spreading fear and horror.
And with the temperature scenarios being corrected downward, one would logically think that sea level rise would also be less than projected in 2007. But the IPCC sees that in the opposite way. Instead of correcting sea level rise downwards, it jacked them up. Obviously there’s a lot of confusion about the climate system.
Also the absence of global warming over the last 15 years has been insufficiently communicated by the IPCC and the press. Here it is best keep quiet about it rather than uncovering and informing the public.
The press so far has failed to notice that the temperature scenarios and climate sensitivity have been corrected downwards by the IPCC. Yet the fact that both these parameters were corrected downwards is presumably owing to the fact that global temperatures have not risen in 15 years. This is how models and observations can be made to agree.

I’m very pleased to say NoTricksZone played an important role in contributing to the FORBES’ piece.
This is an important issue because many countries in the world are, or are considering, following Germany’s green energy blueprint. Unfortunately, Germany’s approach is tragically a blueprint on how not to overhaul an energy infrastructure.

Will Cooling Temperature And Economic Climates Finally Take The Wind Out Of Failed Energy Policies?
Larry Bell, Contributor
There can be no disputing the fact that despite rising atmospheric carbon dioxide levels, global climate temperatures have been flat for at least the past 16 years, and perhaps a good deal longer. And upon issuing its latest Summary for Policymakers Report (AR5), the UN’s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) has finally been forced to admit that its climate models that predicted an impending global warming crisis have grossly overestimated climate sensitivity to carbon dioxide, a trace “greenhouse gas”.
Such unwarranted alarmism has influenced colossally costly and economically destructive anti-fossil energy policies in the United States, Western Europe, Australia and other regions of world. The question now remains how long it will take before broad segments of these populations realize that they have been duped by unaffordable and unreliable climate benefit-premised “green energy” promotions. …

"Last night I asked the five candidates vying to be our next prime minister whether they would commit to taking the radical and drastic action necessary to tackle climate change. You may have realised from my reaction to the answers they gave that I was not impressed. As I listened to them fail to answer my question, I kept thinking, “one of these men is going to be our prime minister, the leader of this country in just a few weeks”. And I reflected on what I have been taught about leadership.  Aren’t real leaders meant to make decisions to protect the most vulnerable people in our communities? Aren’t real leaders supposed to be brave and courageous? Aren’t real leaders ultimately supposed tell us the truth? But instead we hear them say time and time again that climate change is “important” to them, that they will make it “central to their programme” if they are in government. At the same time they continue talking about their intentions to expand airports, cut support for renewable technology and set targets that are way too far away to make a meaningful difference. What they fail to realise, as I pointed out on the debate programme, is that climate change is not an issue for tomorrow, it’s an issue of today. Today, there are people all over the world who are already suffering from the devastating consequences of our inaction: droughts, heatwaves, cyclones and wildfires. Today, we’re seeing how countries are treating immigrants and those seeking asylum with intolerance and hatred. Today, we’re seeing the loss of thousands of species of plants and animals, yet those in positions of power continue to absolve their responsibilities. Over the past few months, the YouthStrike4Climate movement has drastically shifted the narrative around the climate crisis, and we’re not going to stop striking until they all commit to taking the necessary action. The UK Student Climate Network has been very clear; declaring a climate emergency is just the first step. We want to totally decarbonise the economy of the UK through a government-led, 10-year mobilisation for a just and prosperous transition which must include the infrastructure needed to benefit all communities and workers. We want to see millions of new well-paid, meaningful and secure jobs created across the UK, in communities like mine, in Glasgow, where we vitally need them. We want a Green New Deal that can protect vital natural habitats. My message is clear, this isn’t a problem for the future, it’s one for today. We need commitments now, otherwise we will continue to hurt countries across the world that are already suffering the worst consequences of climate breakdown. Last night demonstrated that none of the candidates on offer have a clear plan for how to address the climate crisis. Away from the headlines and jibes on social media, this is the opportunity for any one of them to step up and distinguish themselves as a climate leader. I would suggest they listen to the youngest in our society who are not only leading the way but channelling the energy many have for climate action into something tangible. We have the technology and we have the resources, we now need the right leader and some political will. With the UK looking likely to be the host of the next UN climate change conference (COP26) in 2020, it’s the perfect platform. Which of the five candidates to be our next prime minister will lead the UK into those climate negotiations? And which of them has the courage to do the right thing? It’s no understatement to suggest this could literally be our last chance. So, to whoever our next prime minister is, I won’t be impressed until I see more than just words. • Erin Curtis is a youth striker from Glasgow and part of the UK Student Climate Network • Comments on this piece are premoderated to ensure discussion remains on topics raised by the writer.

"An ethical investment operation by the UK’s largest asset manager has dumped shares in a string of US companies it has deemed climate crisis laggards, including oil giant ExxonMobil and insurer Metlife. Legal and General Investment Management (LGIM) said it had cut five companies – ExxonMobil, Metlife, Spam maker Hormel Foods, US retailer Kroger and Korean Electric Power Corporation – from its umbrella of ethical investment funds worth a total of £5bn. LGIM added the climate laggards to a list which already includes China Construction Bank, carmaker Subaru, Japan Post Holdings, Canadian retailer Loblaw, US food and service conglomerate Sysco Corporation and Russian oil giant Rosneft, which is part-owned by BP. The asset manager monitors companies across six major sectors: oil and gas; mining; electric utilities; carmakers; food retailers; and finance. Meryam Omi, head of responsible investment at LGIM, said investor engagement with companies can be “a powerful tool” if there are “consequences”. L&G retains shareholdings in the blacklisted companies at other funds in its £1tn investment empire and will now use those shares to vote against board appointments at the named and shamed businesses. “Talks without action are no longer fit for purpose given the urgency to address climate change,” she said. “This is no fad. The world is truly in the midst of a climate emergency, which could have drastic consequences for markets, companies and, therefore, our clients’ assets.” LGIM expects all companies to disclose their exposure to the climate crisis and set targets for reducing the carbon-intensity of their operations as part of its 2016 climate impact pledge. The investment firm warned earlier this year that the world is facing “a climate catastrophe” unless companies act, and last year said it voted against a record number of boards which are not doing enough. Omi said the investor is doing “a huge amount” to urge clients to follow the example of its ethical funds by divesting from carbon-intensive companies to protect against the financial risk of climate breakdown. She said there is also a “powerful opportunity” for investors which remain shareholders of polluting companies to use their voting power to help change the organisation. The money manager said US companies have proved the most challenging to engage with on climate concerns. LGIM said the nation is divided between companies firmly committed to tackling climate issues, and a disproportionate number of companies among the lowest-scoring of its report. Donald Trump has vowed to pull out of the Paris climate agreement, in contrast to many US states and cities which are making strides in holding fossil fuel companies to account for the climate crisis. Overall, LGIM believes there is less willingness among US companies to make even incremental changes because they are not under the same pressure to take climate action because it is not expected by US investors. ExxonMobil, the world’s largest listed oil company, emerged as the leading climate laggard in this year’s tally after refusing to report its own carbon emissions or set targets to reduce them. Omi said these measures are the minimum LGIM would like to see from a company “with a huge footprint”. Meanwhile, LGIM praised US oil company Occidental Petroleum which was reinstated as an investment candidate after landing on the laggard list last year. The report said Occidental has shown “a step change” in its climate engagement by measuring and disclosing its total carbon emissions and announcing plans to set emissions targets by the end of the year. Occidental also plans to spend $36bn (£32bn) to buy a shale oil company, Anadarko, in one of the largest US shale deals of recent years. LGIM said it plans to escalate its climate criteria in the years ahead. "

"Prof David King, the former chief scientist, has expressed alarm at the prospect of Boris Johnson becoming prime minister because the Tory MP oversaw “devastating” cuts in efforts to tackle the climate crisis when he was foreign secretary and then wanted to hush them up. King was serving as the UK special representative for climate change when Johnson was appointed foreign secretary. He told the Guardian that Johnson’s term in office coincided with a 60% cut in his team of climate attaches across the world from 165 to just 65. “The cuts began with the new incoming permanent secretary, which was just before Boris Johnson in early 2016,” King said. But Johnson did not stop or reverse the cuts. “The cuts were devastating because it was just at the point that we had to deliver the Paris agreement.” They meant the UK lost its global leadership role in climate negotiations, King added. In a one-to-one meeting in 2017, when King was about leave his post, Johnson claimed he knew nothing about the reduction in posts and urged King not to go public with his concerns. Recalling the conversation after raising the 60% cut, King said: “He said something like: ‘Good God, I didn’t know that.’ He then said: ‘You’re not going to spill this all out to the media?’” King, who had to sign a two-year non-disclosure agreement when he left the government in March 2017, agreed not to talk to the media about the issue if no more cuts were made. In return he said Johnson gave him a “wonderful farewell speech at the Foreign Office praising me for doing more on climate change than any other individual”. King said there was a mismatch between Johnson’s commitments in private and his lack of public commitment on the climate crisis, which have continued in the current leadership campaign. He said: “During his time in the Foreign Office, Boris Johnson never made a speech on climate change … There was a contrast between Johnson’s farewell speech to me and his action. I really tried to encourage him to make speeches on climate change and it never transpired.” Asked if he was worried by Johnson’s friendship with the climate denier Donald Trump, King said: “Aren’t we all? It’s extremely concerning.” He added: “The issue of Boris Johnson and climate change has not been clarified so far in the discussion around the leadership of the Conservative party. “It would give me tremendous comfort to know that we do have a prime minister coming in who is prepared to stick to a commitment on climate change. That’s been an all-party commitment since 2008. It could come undone by simply not saving anything or by reducing our ability to deliver which is really what happened in the Foreign Office. And in that process explicitly ignoring this enormous challenge to civilisation.” He also claimed that Johnson misled the public during his time as London mayor about King’s agreement to chair an inquiry into building a London airport in the Thames estuary. King said he backed using islands in the Thames to protect London from flooding, adding: “I said I’m happy to look at the future use of the Thames estuary, but I said we’ve got to take care of rising sea levels, you can’t start constructing large cities’ terminuses if you are then going to be faced with future flooding. “He stepped out to the media and said: ‘Sir David has agreed to chair the commission into the future of an airport in the Thames estuary,’ literally minutes after we had reached that agreement. My report saying we shouldn’t do it was never published.” Asked if Johnson had been dishonest he said: “There is no other word for it. When I challenged him he hit the top of his head and said: ‘Oh God, sorry. I didn’t mean to do that.’ Of course he meant it.” King, who was chief scientific adviser under Tony Blair and Gordon Brown, also revealed he was repeatedly blocked from talking to the media during his second stint in government as climate envoy under David Cameron and Theresa May. He said: “When I was brought back, William Hague – then foreign secretary – said we need you back as a talking head, because we need to get the information out to the public on climate change. The week after I had requests from the media to appear. And virtually every single request was turned out. The turning down was not from the communications office in the Foreign Office or from Hague, but from No 10. So, I am assuming that whoever was advising No 10 on their political campaigning must have been saying that climate change is not a vote-winner.” King added: “It was absurd. Here was Britain doing more than almost the rest of the world put together on this issue and I’m kept off the public airwaves.” A spokesman for Johnson pointed to comments he had made to the ConservativeHome website. When asked if the UK should set a zero carbon target by 2050, Johnson said: “Yes we should set ourselves a challenging target. Even if it looks tough to deliver today, the technology is changing and improving the whole time. I believe in the Promethean power of the human race to solve its problems – and Britain can be in the lead in coming up with the answers. When I was mayor of London we saw huge growth in population and GDP, and yet cut CO2 by 14%.”"
"In the salt marshes and estuaries of New England, the most dominant and fearsome predator is a voracious invader that grows to just inches and lays waste to everything in its path. The European green crab first arrived in the new world more than 200 years go, smuggling itself to American shores in the ballast holds of transatlantic ships.  But as the climate emergency warms the bountiful Gulf of Maine faster than 99% of the world’s ocean, the tiny crustacean is now seemingly unstoppable as its population grows unchecked. Along Maine’s long, wrinkled coastline, the climate crisis gives and the climate crisis takes. The warming waters have provided the ideal environment for lobsters, leading to large and profitable hauls. But green crabs have taken hold, devastating soft-shell clam populations depended on for food and income, cutting their harvest to the lowest levels in nearly 90 years while simultaneously destroying eelgrass habitats that serve as nurseries for young fish. For communities that depend on the Gulf of Maine, conversations are shifting from how to stop the warming to how to cope with it. “We’re not going to stop the warming now,” says Marissa McMahan, a fisheries scientist with Manomet, a New England not-for-profit that focuses on sustainability and climate crisis. “We have to accept this is the reality, that the Gulf of Maine is going to be different in 10 or 20 years … and we have to figure out ways to adapt and live with that.” McMahan is now part of an effort to promote green crabs as a source of food and researching other potential uses for them. As the ecosystem gets upended, she and others hope to turn the green crab into dollars and calories – and perhaps slow the damage they are doing. “ Nothing has evolved yet or appeared yet to act as a predator in terms of keeping their population in check,” said Roger Warner, a writer based in Ipswich, Massachusetts, who founded the Green Crab R&D Project. “So humans will have to be the predators.” The crabs have been most disruptive to soft-shell clams, a valuable food source dug up by clammers from the mud at low tide in marshes and estuaries in New England.  In Maine, soft-shell clam harvests have fallen off significantly over the past three decades. Brian Beal, a professor of marine ecology at the University of Maine at Machias, said that his research has found that as much as 99% of clams in many parts of Maine are dying before they reach adulthood. Many of those are eaten by green crabs. Further south in Ipswich, Massachusetts, the town pays a bounty of $0.40 per pound on green crabs, hoping to save the clams which – for those who eat them in the US – put the town on the map. Ipswich shellfish constable Scott LaPreste says the town is currently hauling up about 75,000 pounds of green crabs a year under the program. “In the past, what we depended on was really cold winters” to control the crab population, he said. “With the warming of the winters now, we’re not getting that die-off you would expect every winter.” McMahan, the Manomet scientist, first started thinking about green crabs when an art conservator from her native Maine island of Georgetown contacted her after feasting on similar green crabs in Venice, Italy. He wanted to know if people back home were eating them. Americans tend to eat large crabs with lots of meat that offer a big reward for the work of breaking through their shells. At first glance, the green crab looks like too much work for too little meat. But in Venice, green crab is a delicacy, fried up when the crab briefly sheds its hard exoskeleton to grow and eaten whole. In 2017, McMahan and her partner, lobsterman Chris Jamison, traveled to Venice to see how the crab industry worked there. And last summer, Jamison began trapping green crabs and selling molting ones to coastal Maine restaurants at $3 a piece while using other ones as lobster bait. Last fall, Manomet was awarded a quarter-million-dollar grant from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration to work towards creating a green crab market. Warner, the Green Crab R&D founder, envisions a green crab market. Molting crabs would be sold to restaurants and consumers, pulling in the highest price per crab. Meanwhile, non-molting crabs could be boiled into stock or used as flavoring. Then their shells could be used as compost; Warner is hoping to explore their potential as a fertilizer for cannabis, which is now legal in both Massachusetts and Maine. Crab roe is another potential moneymaker while some of the crabs being collected by Manomet were destined to be dog food. “People will and can trap for green crabs alongside clamming, but they need the payoff,” said Warner. “That’s why we’re working on inventing these products.” Maine fishermen once went after different species every season which meant a poor catch of one would not mean ruin. But over the years, those fisheries have mostly disappeared. Today, lobster is the dominant catch, but it is anticipated that if waters continue to warm, it too may become less productive. Fishermen such as Jamison say they see the Gulf of Maine changing in real time: he sees more typically tropical fish, lobsters are abundant and a few years ago, he saw a great white shark – rare in Maine’s waters. But while some promoting green crabs as a food source hope their efforts can restore clam populations, Beal, the University of Maine at Machias professor, believes that is unlikely. “The most damage that’s occurring by green crabs on soft-shell clams is by crabs that are smaller than your thumbnail,” he said. “There’s no way you can trap crabs that are the size of your thumbnail.” Beal calls the green crab the “consummate invader” due to its ability to “out-reproduce anything else” as well as its breadth of habitat and diet. Meanwhile, Manomet is currently exploring clam aquaculture – clam farming – that could give the shellfish better chances of surviving to adulthood and making it to the dinner plate. But on a recent Thursday morning, McMahan remained focused on the crabs as she and two graduate students measured and catalogued the angry crustaceans on a dock in Georgetown. They looked at the underside of the crabs for signs that they were about to molt – and separated those ready to shed their exoskeleton so they wouldn’t be eaten by the others once they lost their armor. McMahan says introducing a new sea food is an uphill battle in a part of the country where fish that have long disappeared from the Gulf of Maine – such as cod and haddock – are still favorites at the supermarket. But as the water warms, she says seafood consumers will have to adjust to reality.  “We need to just fundamentally think differently about seafood and what we eat – and what is seafood and what’s good – because it’s changing. We’re going to have different things on our plate going forward,” she said."
"The world’s largest sovereign wealth fund is preparing to leave fossil fuels behind. Last week, Norway’s parliament confirmed by unanimous vote that its $1tn sovereign wealth fund would dump $13bn of fossil fuel investments – and start investing billions in renewables. The move is designed to protect Norway’s state-owned investment fund from the decline in fossil fuels that will be vital if full-blown climate catastrophe is to be averted.  But fossil fuels are by no means in terminal decline, according to a recent review of the global energy industry. BP’s annual energy review revealed only days before the Norwegian vote that carbon emissions rose at the fastest rate in almost a decade last year. The figures revealed that the unexpected spike was caused by a growing appetite for energy, that was being met by fossil fuels. And the biggest offender in climate terms is coal. Spencer Dale, BP’s chief economist, says the world’s surging demand for energy – it rose by 2.9% last year – has cemented the defiant growth of coal. Consumption had climbed for a second consecutive year following three years of decline. “The peak in global coal consumption, which many thought had occurred in 2013, now looks less certain,” Dale says. “Another couple of years of increases close to last year’s would take global consumption comfortably above 2013 levels.” The creeping growth of coal worldwide has come via the electricity generation sector, but in the UK, coal-fired power is to be entirely snuffed out by 2025 under government plans. The process is already under way. Coal-fired electricity was just 5% of all power generation in the UK last year, which allowed the National Grid to trumpet its greenest-ever winter. Since then, the closure of two coal plants has been announced, which will cut number of UK coal plants to five from next year.  Britain’s battle to wean itself off coal is helped by a rise in renewables but also – crucially – by the fact that in a country of sluggish growth and rising energy efficiency, demand for power has flatlined. The same cannot be said for fast-developing countries in Asia, for example, where the appetite for electricity is growing rapidly, and renewable energy is not increasing anything like fast enough to keep coal at bay. Asia’s appetite for coal-fired electricity is keeping coal production alive too. Indian mining group Adani last week announced plans to start work on a A$2bn (£1bn) coal mine in Australia after a decade of opposition from climate campaigners. The Queensland mine is expected to produce coal that, once burned in power plants, will emit 700 million tonnes of carbon dioxide every year for more than 50 years.  Wind and solar renewable power is the world’s fastest-growing energy source: it grew by 14.5% last year, led by a surge of investment in China. But the strides do not go far enough, fast enough. “You have to run very fast just to stand still,” Dale says. The global power generation picture is “depressingly” unchanged from 20 years ago, he says. Three flat lines show an unwavering breakdown of the global electricity mix: last year coal made up 38%, non-fossil fuels reached 36% and the rest of the world’s power was generated by gas and oil. This is the same as in 1998. “If rising demand was to be met by renewable energy, renewable generation would need to have grown more than twice as quickly over the past three years than it actually did,” Dale says. “Alternatively, the same reduction in carbon emissions could have been achieved by replacing around 10% of coal in the power sector with natural gas.” BP’s backing for gas is unsurprising and self-serving: the company owns a vast portfolio of gas fields, and it plans to expand this within the business as oil falls from favour. It also makes sense: gas generation emits around half the carbon of coal, and avoids much of the air pollution which has become a major concern in Asia’s growing cities. However, gas is still a hydrocarbon and its use cannot grow unchecked within the energy system without driving carbon emissions higher. The demand for gas increased by 5.3% in 2018, one of its strongest growth rates for over 30 years. Its use accounted for 45% of the increase in global energy consumption last year. The gas “bonanza” was led by the US shale boom, says Dale. The US shale heartlands in the Marcellus, Haynesville and Permian basins produced an extra 78 billion cubic metres of gas last year. This is the same growth in one year as the previous 12 combined.  The surge in US gas production was used mainly to meet its own booming domestic demand. The US recorded the third-highest growth for energy consumption last year: it is the only G7 nation at the top of the energy growth league table; the rest of the top 10 are developing economies. Dale points to a worrying vicious climate cycle to explain part of the US boom. Research suggests that wider swings in temperature are nudging homes and businesses to turn up either heating systems or air conditioners more often. Last year, the number of particularly hot or cold days in the US was the highest for 50 years. And temperature swings in the first months of 2019 are proving to be just as wide of seasonal norms. This may reflect “random variation” in weather patterns, says Dale. Or it may signal a worrying climate feedback loop which will make it harder to tackle the climate crisis. “If there is a link between the growing levels of carbon in the atmosphere and the weather patterns observed in 2018,” he says, “this would raise the possibility of a vicious cycle: increasing levels of carbon leading to more extreme weather patterns, which in turn trigger stronger growth in energy usage – and emissions.”"

Share this...FacebookTwitterThe online Ria Novosti news service has a report on the 30 activists who Russian officials have locked up for allegedly trespassing and attempting to storm onto a platform facility in the Arctic last month.
According to the latest report from Ria Novosti, the Russians are now “hinting at drug charges against the Greenpeace activists” and that they are considering pressing charges that could lead to life sentences for some of them. The Russians aren’t fooling around and they are playing major league hardball. Obviously some people out in the ‘open and tolerant’ west are having a hard time understanding the situation.
Hat tip: John from Quebec.
Perhaps the threats of life in prison are in response to the combative tones coming from Greenpeace bosses lately. For example Greenpeace’s international executive director, Kumi Naidoo, declared that the world needs people who are “prepared to go to prison, put their lives on the line if necessary, in the struggle for climate justice and addressing the reality of runaway catastrophic climate change.”
Well, if activists are willing to put their lives on the line for Greenpeace causes and are incapable of reasonable dialogue, then perhaps it is indeed best to keep them locked up.
Strangely, Greenpeace seems to be convinced that it can use protests to “out-bully” Russia. Good luck with that.
According to Ria Novosti, investigators on Wednesday said that substances presumed to be poppy straw and morphine “have been found on board a Greenpeace ship seized last month“. This, Ria Novosti writes, raises “the threat of new charges against a group of activists and journalists awaiting trial on suspicion of piracy.”
Moreover, “investigators were trying to determine which of the detainees had ‘intentionally rammed’ border guards’ boats – an act that could constitute an assault on the ‘life and health’ of officials. Under Russian law, the punishment for this crime could range from 12 years to life in prison.”

Ramming into ships? Gee, like this is something Greenpeace would never ever do. Actually, the Russians caught Greenpeace red-handed doing just that. Reader Observer found the following video of a Greenpeace boat ramming the smaller of the Russian coast guard boats:

Moreover all the shows of moral indignation by European officials, haughtily implying that Russia is a sort of a despotic state, likely made things worse.
My advice to Greenpeace and Greenpeace-huggers is that they should tone down their belligerent and condescending rhetoric quite a few levels, and begin to consider that perhaps the activists were acting illegally after all. Humility sometimes is not a bad thing. It can be learned – the easy way, or the hard way.
Yes, we know that admitting you’ve erred is something that is totally foreign to the infallible Greenpeace – but now it’s something they need to learn how to do very quickly.
Life in prison – that sure would send a clear message to those with comprehension disabilities.
==============================
UPDATE: Here’s a letter Naidoo has sent to Putin, asking if he could be meet face-to-face on the world stage with Putin. Talk about being publicity-hungry. From the letter, he definitely has toned it down. But it doesn’t look like he’s aware of the boat ramming escapade his “peaceful” activists have indulged in – see video below.

"The bosses at Heathrow must have been visiting another planet last week, or else they missed the government memo about legislating for net zero emissions by 2050. The plans unveiled today for a 50% expansion in the airport by 2050, including a third runway, all to be done in “a sustainable way”, take dissembling to new levels. Heathrow is already the largest single source of carbon emissions in the UK.  The outline plans reveal the scale of what’s proposed: building a tunnel for the M25, rerouting rivers, building enormous carparks outside the perimeter of the current airport, destroying local villages. The government itself says nearly a million households will be affected by the third runway, which will allow another 700 flights a day. Heathrow’s owners maintain that the airport’s expansion will not significantly alter the UK’s emissions, but only reach this conclusion by excluding international aviation emissions. That suggests they missed another memo, this time from the committee on climate change which has said emissions from international aviation should be formally included in the UK’s climate targets. Carbon pollution from flying in Europe has risen 26% in the past five years – far outpacing any other transport mode. And, while the UK economy has reduced its carbon emissions by 37% since 1990, CO2 from international aviation has increased by around 130%. The government’s own draft aviation strategy is a perfect example of its have-your-cake-and-eat-it approach. The condition attached to this strategy – “provided that growth takes place in a sustainable way, with actions to mitigate the environmental impacts” – is simply unachievable. The IPCC has already warned us that we have only 11 years left to slash global emissions in half, if we are to achieve the Paris agreement goal of limiting global warming to 1.5C. There is no technological magic wand which is going to transform aviation’s dependence on fossil fuels in this time. We are unlikely to see a single electric aircraft big enough to carry passengers any further than the distances easily reached by train until after 2050. And while new aircraft engines are certainly more efficient than the old ones they replace, the environmental benefit is more than wiped out by the expansion in the number of flights. An official strategy which not only wants to build a third runway at Heathrow but also expand regional airports is not going to rein in airline emissions – which raises the question of whether the government is serious about reducing the UK’s carbon emissions, let alone reaching net zero. And the plan to rely on international carbon offsets to balance the carbon books (as the legislation allows) is simply deceitful. Carbon offsetting will not deliver the net zero future that the science tells us we need to achieve, since all sectors in all countries will need to get as close as possible to zero emissions, and there’s a limit to how much remaining CO2 we can hope to soak up with new forests. The truth is that aviation growth and our expectation of cheap flights cannot continue. The draft aviation strategy is an opportunity to address this, starting with a commitment to ensuring aviation makes a fair contribution to actual reductions in UK carbon emissions. That means capping aviation emissions at current levels as a first step, cancelling plans for airport expansion, and investing in alternatives so that short- to medium-distance travel by train become attractive and affordable for all. This is not only a carbon emissions issue. The unsustainable growth in demand for flights is being driven to a significant extent by a minority of wealthy individuals, raising the issue of inequality and fairness too. About 70% of flights are taken by just 15% of the population, and most people don’t fly at all in any given year. It’s not families taking an occasional holiday or business travellers who are fuelling the growth in demand for flying – it’s a small minority of wealthy individuals taking multiple flights a year. Yet the harms caused by aviation growth, from noise and air pollution to habitat destruction as airports expand, is felt disproportionately by the less well-off. That’s why policies like the frequent flyer levy must be front and centre of the new aviation strategy, so that social justice and environmental protection go hand in hand. The EU’s transport commissioner Violeta Bulc told airline CEOs this month that the aviation industry’s licence for growth would in future be linked directly to perceptions of sustainability. Heathrow’s owners – and the government – need to read that memo too. • Caroline Lucas is the Green party MP for Brighton Pavilion"

So says German Prof. Fritz Vahrenholt, who is one of the founders of Germany’s modern environmental movement, and agreed to an interview with NoTricksZone. He is one of the co-authors of the German skeptic book “Die kalte Sonne”, which took Germany by storm last year and is now available at bookstores worldwide in English under the title: The Neglected Sun.
In Germany Prof. Vahrenholt has had to endure a lot heat from the media, activists, and climate scientists for having expressed a different view. But as global temperatures remain stagnant and CO2 climate sensitivity is being scaled back, he feels vindicated. Here’s the interview:
=======================
IPCC Science Finds Itself In A Serious Jam, There Is Not Going To be A Climate Catastrophe
NTZ: You were once a believer in the man-made CO2 climate disaster. What changed your mind? 
FV: I was Environmental Senator of Hamburg until 1998 and had had absolutely no doubts about the AGW hypothesis because global temperatures indeed had been running parallel with CO2 emissions. My first doubts over the IPCC’s science arose after the dramatic errors of the 2007 4th Assessment Report came to light. On German public television PIK Director Hans-Joachim Schellnhuber said the Himalayan glaciers would melt away by the year 2035. Then as a CEO of Shell Repower Systems, and later RWE Innogy, where I was responsible for the development of renewable energies and discovered that natural factors were impacting our climate. We saw that the wind strength in Northwest Europe had been in decline year after year. Yet, climate scientists had told us just the opposite was supposed to occur, i.e. that wind strength would increase. So I looked at the literature in detail and was able to find there was a relationship with the North Atlantic Oscillation, whose 60-year cycle had entered a weak phase. I wrote articles about this in leading German dailies, and I was immediately branded as a “climate denier” by Stefan Rahmstorf. His reaction led me to look even deeper into the literature. In the end it was Schellnhuber and Rahmstorf who turned me into a skeptic.
NTZ: Your climate science critical book Die kalte Sonne (The Cold Sun) was released early last year in Germany. It remained on the Spiegel bestseller list for 3 weeks. Has it changed the discussion in Germany? Were you surprised by the public’s reaction?
FV: The leftist, liberal media labeled me an “eco-reactionary” who represented obsolete positions. That was to be expected. What truly surprised me the most was the harsh reaction from German climate scientists who were not even willing to discuss the topics addressed in the book. And the longer our book remained on the bestseller list, and the longer the warming stop became, the more our adversaries’ tactics ran aground. First they ignored us and then they tried to isolate us through personal defamation. Die kalte Sonne became the symbol of resistance against a politically indoctrinated science which denied natural processes and spread fear in order to promote a particular energy policy – one that threatened the prosperity and growth of the German industrial base. So to me it was a sort of an accolade when former Chancellor Helmut Schmidt invited me to a personal audience to find out more about Die kalte Sonne. Now I’m permitted to quote him: “Lüning’s and Vahrenholt’s assertions are plausible“. The UK Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson invited me to London and encouraged me to publish the book in English. Now it is appearing this week as “The Neglected Sun“. It’s the Die kalte Sonne in English, and it’s been updated. 

NTZ: CO2 is supposed to be trapping heat in the atmosphere, yet global atmospheric temperatures haven’t risen in 200 months (over 16 years). Where has all the “trapped heat” gone? Some leading scientists are frustrated that they cannot find it. What do you think is happening?
FV: It’s now obvious that the IPCC models are not correctly reflecting the development of atmospheric temperatures. What‘s false? Reality or the models? The hackneyed explanation of a deep sea warming below 700 meters hasn’t been substantiated up to now. How does atmospheric warming from a climate gas jump 700 meters deep into the ocean? If you consider the uncertainties in the Earth’s radiation budget measurements at the top of the atmosphere, and those of the temperature changes at water depths below 700 meters, where we are talking about changes of a few hundredths of a degree Celsius over many years, such a “missing heat” cannot be ascertained today. The likelihood is that there is no “missing heat”. Slight changes in cloud cover could easily account for a similar effect. That would mean the end of the alarmist CO2 theory. Perhaps this is why we’ve been hearing speculation about the deep ocean.  On the other hand, perhaps this discussion tells us that the alarmist faction needs to deal more with oceanic cycles. It is possible that this is a step in recognizing the central impacts of the PDO and AMO on our climate.
NTZ: Hans von Storch confirms that 98% of the climate models have been wrong so far. Do you think the directors of world’s leading climate research institutes risk damaging the once sterling reputations of their institutes if they do not soon admit there’s a problem with climate science?
FV: They certainly find themselves in a serious jam. That‘s why they are now trying to gain time by claiming that the models first become falsified if there has been no warming over a period of 30 years – never mind that the warming of 1977 to 1998 was only 22 years and deemed to be long enough to “prove“ the CO2 theory. A few years ago climate scientist Ben Santer said only 17 years were necessary before we could talk about a real climate trend. Now that reality is pulling the rug from under models, some scientists are having misgivings. Some are praying for an El Nino year, which would allow them to beat the drums of fear again. They’ll hype up every single weather effect to get attention.
NTZ: Some prominent climate experts have been expressing second thoughts about the seriousness of man-made climate change, e.g. Hans von Storch, Lennart Bengtsson. Do you expect more scientists to follow as more data come in?

FV: Certainly. That’s what’s so fascinating about science. It proposes theories. And when they don’t fit reality, they get changed. The chaff gets separated from the wheat.
NTZ: Spiegel for example has been publishing some articles critical of alarmist climate science. Do you expect the rest of Germany’s media to soon follow and to start taking a more critical look?
FV: This process is fully under way. But it’s going to take a long time because an entire generation has been convinced that CO2 is a climate killer. But the shrill tones have been quieting down.
NTZ: What danger does Germany face should it continue down its current path of climate alarmism and rush into renewable energies? 
FV: Twenty billion euros are being paid out by consumers for renewable energies in Germany each and every year. Currently that amounts to 250 euros per household each year and it will increase to 300 euros next year.
Worse, it’s a gigantic redistribution from the bottom to top, from the poor who cannot afford a solar system to rich property owners who own buildings with large roof areas. The German Minister of Environment fears a burden of 1000 billion euros by 2040.
It is truly outrageous that 1) 40% of the world’s photovoltaic capacity is installed in Germany, a country that sees as much sunshine as Alaska, 2) we are converting wheat into biofuel instead of feeding it to the hungry, and 3) we are covering 20% of our agricultural land with corn for biogas plants and thus adversely impacting wildlife. We are even destroying forests and nature in order to make way for industrial wind parks.
On windy days we have so much power that wind parks are asked to shut down, yet they get paid for the power they don’t even deliver. And when the wind really blows, we “sell” surplus power to neighboring countries at negative prices. And when the wind stops blowing and when there is no sun, we have to get our power from foreign countries. In the end we pay with the loss of high-paying industrial jobs because the high price of power is making us uncompetitive.
The agitators in climate science here in Germany have done us no favors. Renewable energies do have a big future, but not like this. It’s been a run-away train and it’s too expensive. We are putting Germany’s industry in jeopardy. In reality there really isn’t any urgency because the solar cycles and nature are giving us time to make the transition over to renewable energies in a sensible way.
NTZ: Has the weather become more extreme? Why are we getting bombarded by scary reports from the media – even after a normal thunderstorm with hail?
FV: Extreme weather is the only card they have left to play. We see that Arctic sea ice extent is the highest since 2007. At the South Pole sea ice is at the highest extent in a very long time, hurricanes have not become more frequent, the same is true with tornadoes, sea level is rising at 2-3 mm per year and there’s been no change in the rate, and global temperature has been stagnant for 15 years. Indeed we are exposed to bad weather. And when one is presented with a simplistic explanation, i.e. it’s man’s fault, it gladly gets accepted. CO2 does have a warming effect on the planet. However, this effect has been greatly exaggerated. The climate impact of CO2 is less than the half of what the climate alarmists claim. That’s why in our book, The Neglected Sun, we are saying there is not going to be any climate catastrophe.
NTZ: What do you expect from the soon-to-be-released IPCC 5th Assessment Report?
FV: It is truly remarkable that some countries are urging IPCC 5AR authors to address the reasons for the temperature hiatus in the summary for policymakers. Dissatisfaction with the IPCC’s tunnel vision is growing. But let’s not kid ourselves: In the coming days and weeks the media are not going to be able to refrain from the IPCC catastrophe-hype. However, what will be different from the previous four reports is that the hype will die off much more quickly. Those who ignore nature and its fluctuations will end up on the sidelines soon enough. I think this is going to be the last report of this kind.

Share this...FacebookTwitterI had to shake my head when I came across Peter Gleick’s Twitter comment about a Toys R Us spot. Incredibly he writes: “My wife and I saw this ad and looked at each other speechless. And angry. Perhaps the most offensive we’ve ever seen.”

Warning: If you hate happy kids, then you aren’t going to like the above clip!
At first I thought Gleick was joking, but then I was horrified to discover he and his wife really mean it. Gleick and his ilk are freaking out because a teacher has 8-year olds playing with toys instead of collectively learning the names of tree leaves.
Damn it! Those little brats have got to learn and love tree leaves!
To me this confirms that Gleick is a…well, never mind – I’m not going to accomplish anything with insults, as deserved as they may be.
Gleick’s remark reminds me when I was in science class the in 5th grade. Three or four weeks long the teacher tried to pound the names of ferns into us – I’m not kidding. And she even expected us to love the subject as much as she did. And if you didn’t, she punished you with a failing grade. And that’s what I got.  And to this day I have no regrets about it. Those 4 weeks were a period in my life when I completely tuned out science, and I remember thinking how utterly boring it was. I recall demonstratively refusing to participate in the nonsense.
On the other hand, my oldest brother had a telescope and I remember using it often, even buying a book about astronomy and learning all the names of the planets and knowing their distance from the sun. That was fun. But ferns?
The Toy R Us teacher deserves a medal for outstanding education
If anything the teacher on the Toys R Us bus deserves a medal because he refuses to destroy the scientific curiosity of his school kids with the senseless, trivial and excruciatingly boring activity of collective and regimented memorization of tree leaves.

Believe me, with a toy they love, kids can learn magnitudes more about physics, science, mathematics, sociology and engineering than they ever will with communist-style, repeat-after-me collective programming and thought control.
Nothing stimulates a child’s mind more than a toy
Just look at the kids’ faces in that Toys R Us store. Imagine what’s going through their minds and what they will do with the toys of their choice.
How many hours will they spend playing in the dirt or sand with that truck? What is that child going to discover under that microscope, and about optics in general? What dreams and fantasies is that little girl going to experience with the doll house? What physics is the little girl going to learn from the spinning doll? How much is that bicycle going to expand the child’s world and improve his motor-coordination? Can’t the Gleicks see this?
The Toys R Us spot is wonderful just watching all joy in the kids’ faces. But I guess all that happiness is a bit too much to take for the Gleicks and the wackos at Grist and Sierra Club. Horrors! Kids experiencing their own dreams and not being collectively tortured and turned off by instituted boredom. In the narrow mind of the zealot environmentalist, small children have to be terrified of climate and nature, they have to learn to love trees – and to not be happy discovering through toys.
Gleick and his ilk display an astonishing level of blind-mindedness in that they are unable to see the obvious benefits of children freely selecting their own toys and pursing their own interests. One little girl in the spot says something that even Professor Gleick could learn from:
A princess is always loyal and never gives up, and always follows her dreams.”
Right you are, and never forget it. Never give up, and always follow your dreams.
Kids don’t need green thought control.
PS: Write to Toys R Us and tell them that the spot is the best they’ve ever had.

Share this...FacebookTwitterIf Russia doesn’t behave responsibly soon, then there’s going to be a price to pay, Greenpeace is warning. Greenpeace thinks it can put the political pressure on Russia. We suspect that Russia as a result is getting really nervous by now and that she will soon cave in to Greenpeace’s mighty demands…maybe even within a few days. (Some sarcasm here).
In its recent blog piece Greenpeace is sending a message that it lining up a formidable political army against Russia, writing:
Let me take you on a small world tour, which illustrates the depth and breadth of the support we have received. Especially when you remember, that this is just a small selection, a snapshot.”
Greenpeace writes that even Iran and 13 Nobel prize winners have joined. Gee, Russia better back down real soon.
Hope at COP 19 already fading
Ingemar Nordin’s Swedish climate blog Stockholms Initiativet here today is already warning COP 19 is already looking like a failure, citing Reuters, which writes:
World governments are likely to recoil from plans for an ambitious 2015 climate change deal at talks next week, concern over economic growth at least partially eclipsing scientists’ warnings of rising temperatures and water levels. […]
Since 2009, scientists’ warnings have become more strident and new factors have emerged, sometimes dampening the impact of their message that human activity is driving warming. […]. Emerging economies such as China and India, heavily reliant on cheap, high-polluting coal to end poverty, are reluctant to take the lead despite rising emissions and pollution that are choking cities. […]

…many governments, especially in Europe, are concerned that climate policies, such as generous support schemes for solar energy, push up consumer energy bills.”
Nordin concludes: “The old hope that these mega-summits will lead to a binding international agreement is small.”
Renewables Cheerleader Germany Spews More CO2
Lastly, Germany’s flagship daily the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung here writes that despite the hundreds of billions of euros Germany has spent or committed on curbing its CO2 emissions, its emissions of the “climate gas” increased in 2013. Not only are Germany’s efforts very costly, but they are also proving to be completely ineffective. And even if they were effective, Germany’s CO2 reduction would result only in less than a tenth of a degree of reduced warming by 2100. Either way it all represents economic imbecility.
The FAZ writes that Germany’s emissions are expected to be 20 million tonnes more in 2013, a sharp rise of 2%.
The reason for Germany’s failure to combat the supposed climate-warming gas? The FAZ writes: “Foremost the cold winter has driven the consumption of gas upwards. Emissions from greater coal and petroleum consumption have also increased considerably.”
In a nutshell: Cold weather is foiling Germany’s attempts to fight warming! The tremendous nonsense never ends.

Share this...FacebookTwitterOff the subject today: a short report on Obama’s popularity in Germany, which likely won’t get much attention from the US mainstream media.
The NSA spying scandal and Edward Snowden have taken a massive toll on Barack Obama’s and the USA’s approval rating among Germans, new surveys reveal.
According to Germany’s online Die Zeit weekly, “Only 43 percent are satisfied with his political work, 52 percent are dissatisfied. That’s a profound popularity loss: In April 2010 Obama’s approval reached 88 percent.”
The spying affair not only has had a catastrophic impact on Obama’s popularity in Germany and the rest of Europe, but it has also badly tarnished the USA’s image overall. Only 35 percent of Germans rank the USA as a trustworthy partner and 61 percent say that the USA is not a partner that can be trusted.
The survey results were released by ARD-Deutschlandtrend. The numbers are shocking as Germany has long been considered as one of the USA’s most steadfast and trusted allies.

When it comes to whistleblower Edward Snowden, 60% of Germans view him as a hero and only 14% regard him as criminal.
These are devastating numbers and overall represent an almost unprecedented foreign policy debacle, to say the least.
72% think Obama is lying
Germany’s no. 1 daily by circulation, BILD here, also conducted a survey of Germans on whether or not they believed Obama was telling the truth about eavesdropping on Chancellor Merkel’s mobile phone calls. BILD writes:
According to a survey by BILD, 72% of the Germans DON’T believe the US president when he claims he was not aware the NSA was eavesdropping on the mobile phone of Angela Merkel (59, CDU).”

"Theresa May is deceiving us, either deliberately or through ignorance, with regard to the goal of reducing carbon emissions to zero by 2050 (May puts 2050 zero emission target into law, 12 June). This is impossible for any economy based on mass consumption. Over decades, most British manufacturing has shifted abroad, in particular to Asia where labour is cheap. These items are usually produced with high carbon outputs, with electricity supplied through coal. For an accurate figure of Britain’s emissions, our consumption of goods produced overseas must be included. As Britain’s consumption has increased enormously over the past 30 years, this carbon addition will be substantial.  It is a nonsense for rich countries, with increasing consumption that is excluded from carbon calculations, to pretend they are cutting carbon emissions. A British child during their lifetime may produce at least 200 times more carbon than a poor African child. And it is the poor child who will suffer first from climate change. For a successful response to climate change, reality must take precedence over public relations. Nature cannot be cheated.Michael StoneMoretonhampstead, Devon • Now that the government is claiming bragging rights on carbon emissions, would this be a good time to reprint in a prominent position the report, hidden in last Monday’s business section, which reveals that the UK gives £2.5bn per year to developing countries in support of fossil fuel projects (Government criticised for funding fossil fuel-burning plants abroad, 10 June)?Celia ForsythKendal, Cumbria • We welcome plans announced to cut the UK’s emissions. To achieve the target, the Committee on Climate Change estimates we will need a 10% shift away from travel in cars towards walking, cycling and public transport. That means thinking radically about how we design our towns and cities, the requirements on developers and how we target infrastructure investment towards schemes that prioritise active travel. But we can’t afford to wait. Our charter for walking neighbourhoods sets out steps to encourage walking, such as making cities greener, implementing default 20mph speed limits and involving communities in the design and maintenance of public spaces. The benefits reach beyond mitigating climate change: neighbourhoods that are green and walkable inspire people to be more active, promoting physical and mental health, improving air quality and creating places where people want to live and work.Gemma CanteloHead of policy and advocacy, The Ramblers • On consecutive days last week we heard political commitments about the crisis caused by climate change and the impact of the UK’s progress on the sustainable development goals (SDGs). But neither announcement was linked to the other. Theresa May’s introduction of a legally binding agreement for the UK to cut greenhouse gas emissions to zero by 2050 was preceded in parliament by Rory Stewart introducing a debate on the government’s approach to reporting on progress on the SDGs to the UN in July. The 17 SDGs represent an opportunity to tackle the root causes of climate change and biodiversity loss, eliminate extreme poverty and put the world on a more sustainable path. Yet four years after the goals were agreed, the government has not provided a coherent plan on how it is going to achieve them. It is due to report to the UN in July, but the international development secretary and a coterie of ministers were unable to tell parliament last week when this report would be published. We can only hope the new prime minister will put as much energy into achieving the UK’s obligations on the SDGs as they do in promoting their Brexit solutions during the Tory leadership race.Stephen MartinVisiting professor in learning for sustainability, University of the West of England; president, Change Agents UK • Join the debate – email guardian.letters@theguardian.com • Read more Guardian letters – click here to visit gu.com/letters • Do you have a photo you’d like to share with Guardian readers?

Share this...FacebookTwitterThe European Institute for Climate and Energy (EIKE) based in Germany held a conference on climate and energy in Hamburg on June 14. The following is a good video recap in German.

Most of the attendees are retired German scientists and experts who are free to speak their minds without fear of occupational retaliation or loss of privileges.
EIKE is a privately funded institute that critically and objectively looks at climate science and the data behind it. Having taken a comprehensive look at the science, they’ve reached a conclusion that is best summed up by veteran meteorologist and EIKE spokesman Klaus-Eckhart Puls at the 0:28 mark:
Politicians have empowered an absurd science called ‘climate protection’. In it they strive to attain a certain climate by turning CO2 knobs and meeting a 2°C target within a climate system that we know is highly complex. It’s simply absurd.”
Puls says the same about politicians calling plant-food CO2 a pollutant or a “climate killer“.
At the 1:58 mark expert meteorologist Prof. Dr. Walter Fett comments on climate models and water vapor feedbacks:

This [assumed] positive feedback is not some natural physical law. It’s a demand that has to be made so that it works. You can also see it the other way around, … that there’s a negative feedback that has a stabilizing effect for the atmosphere.”
Vice President Michael Limburg adds at the 3-minute mark that the transition to renewable energy only “makes the best energy available expensive” and is leading “to an exodus of jobs and businesses2 out of Germany.” The film adds that renewable energies in Germany thus far have been a failure and has only driven up costs.
At the 4:10 mark Dr. Bernd Benser tells the audience that renewable energies have made the German power grid unstable. Power companies had to intervene on 267 days and warns that should projected amounts of volatile renewable energy be fed in into the power grid over the coming years, then the possibility of blackouts becomes very real. “Blackouts for Germany all because of dubious climate models.”
Later in the video Klaus Angerer calls for more openness for shale gas, calling it a “game-changer” in the energy markets. Here he reminds the audience that shale gas has led to a boom in the USA and has reduced CO2 emissions at the same time.
EIKE urges politicians to base there decisions on the facts, and not dubious models. Klaus-Eckhard Puls summarizes:
We have to be able to finally ask ourselves after 25 years of of the catastrophe research why we have to pay billions, which could be used to fight hunger worldwide, to keep hearing over and over the same future scenarios using certain boundary conditions over which we know too little about and from which we cannot get any kind of reliable results. It shows the failure of the climate models across the entire board at the moment.”

"Scotland should consider new nuclear power stations, investing in hydrogen and installing many more windfarms to meet its climate goals, an expert inquiry has concluded. The inquiry by the Royal Society of Edinburgh, Scotland’s national academy, said a massive increase in low-carbon electricity production would be needed in order to reach the country’s new goal of net zero emissions by 2045.  Prof Becky Lunn, a civil engineer who is deputy chair of the inquiry, said electricity production may need to increase fourfold to decarbonise the transport system and heating, with major implications for ministers and the public. “We have got difficult decisions to make and if we delay we will end up importing by default, which is not a place where in future I think we would wish to be,” she said. “We need to change. At the moment we have a totally unsustainable system.” Alongside a substantial increase in electricity production, Scotland would need: • A statutory commission to provide independent expert direction on energy policy and governance. • Much tougher energy efficiency regulations for homes and buildings. • Substantial investment in carbon capture and storage, so CO2 created during the production of hydrogen could be buried offshore. • Subsidies to ensure higher energy prices and upgrading costs did not increase fuel poverty. Lunn said this was increasingly urgent. Scotland’s two nuclear power stations at Hunterston and Torness, which provided 37% of the country’s electricity in 2017, are due to close by 2030, just as electricity demand is forecast to soar. The RSE report, Scotland’s Energy Future, was published as climate activists with the Extinction Rebellion protest group marched on the Scottish parliament to set up a week-long camp to put pressure on Holyrood to agree more ambitious CO2 reduction targets. Meanwhile Greenpeace continued its campaign against BP’s increased oil drilling by pursuing an oil rig its activists had occupied in the Cromarty Firth last week into the North Sea, using its protest ship, Arctic Sunrise. Greenpeace said its continued pursuit of the rig, the Paul B Loyd Jr, had prevented it from arriving in the Vorlich oilfield, where BP hopes to extract 30m barrels of oil. Extinction Rebellion is planning to block roads in Edinburgh this week, mirroring similar protests in London and other cities. The Scottish government has accepted a challenging target of achieving net zero emissions by 2045, five years earlier than the 2050 UK target agreed last week by Theresa May, the prime minister. In 2017, Scotland emitted 40.5 megatonnes of CO2 equivalent. Greenpeace and Extinction Rebellion argue that continued drilling undermine those goals – a stance rejected by the UK and Scottish governments and the RSE. The net zero concept means continued use of oil, gas and potentially coal. But extra forests, carbon storage and other measures would be needed to soak up the CO2 that those released. The RSE inquiry was funded by four major energy firms, the oil company BP, the French nuclear and renewables firm EDF, the gas company Centrica and the renewables firm SSE. The RSE said they had no bearing or influence over the report’s conclusions but the report mirrored those companies’ arguments that nuclear energy, oil and gas would still be needed – conclusions many climate and environment activists reject. Lunn said ministers should eventually consider small modular nuclear reactors, an experimental technology which, its supporters argue, is safer and much easier to build than large-scale nuclear power stations. Methane would still be needed in large amounts to produce hydrogen: large-scale hydrogen plants would be connected to carbon storage sites in the bedrock offshore. Oil would still be needed to provide fuel for aviation and shipping, for medicines and materials such as plastics. It would be impossible, the RSE said, to equally meet the four key tests of tackling climate change, guaranteeing energy security, making it affordable and at the same time maximising the social acceptability and economic wellbeing of those energy choices. Lunn said the RSE’s conclusions were that meeting the country’s low-carbon energy challenges would require compromises."

Share this...FacebookTwitterHigh profile, Swiss meteorologist Jörg Kachelmann has released his latest weather video:

In the video (German) at the 1:10 mark he says Central Europe will be cooling down considerably at the end of the coming week and that winter weather with snow may be making its way down below 1500 m in the Alps.
Of course in the past such weather was nothing that unusual for the Alps this time of year. But in our age of global warming, snow was supposed to become rare even in the wintertime, let alone early the fall or spring.
Winters are here to stay
One thing can be said with high certainty: snow in September pretty much tells us that winters are going to be around for a very long time, and they aren’t going to disappear like some fortune-telling climate scientists told us. Here are some of their notorious failed winter climate predictions:
“Winters with strong frost and lots of snow like we had 20 years ago will cease to exist at our latitudes.” Mojib Latif, Max Planck Institute for Meteorology, Hamburg, 1 April 2000.
and
“Good bye winter. Never again snow?” Spiegel, 1 April 2000.

“Spring will begin in January starting in 2030.” Die Welt, 30 Sept 2010.
and
“Ice, snow, and frost will disappear, i.e. milder winters.” Die Welt, 30 Sept 2010
(See many more here)
Having been thoroughly embarrassed by all these false predictions, many of the hysterical global warming scientists are now claiming that the recent spate of cold European winters are actually a sign of global warming.
Over the last couple weeks, there has been a flurry of forecasts of a bitter cold 2013/2014 winter to hit Central, Eastern and South Eastern Europe. But Kachelmann dismisses these forecasts, pretty much calling them wild-ass guesses and claiming no one can make useful seasonal forecasts.
Other meteorologists, however, like Joe Bastardi and Dominik Jung, believe that tendencies one way or the other can be determined, based on historical data and repeating climate cycles that have emerged from the 130 years of data.
I think it’s high time to talk to a few old farmers and see what they think.
Overall, this all reminds me of the story of NASA predicting a cold winter because they had observed Indians stocking up more firewood than usual.

Share this...FacebookTwitterScottish Skeptic here has tabulated a ranking of climate science blog sites. To no one’s surprise Anthony Watts’s Watts Up With That? took the no. 1 spot, followed by Marc Morano’s Climate Depot. The ranking was done using internet site rating service Alexa.
First I’m really thrilled to see that NoTricksZone made it all the way to the number 13 14 spot, even bumping out RealClimate. I’m really surprised by this result. Not bad for something I’m doing on the side with the help of reader contributions such as those from Ed Caryl. Thanks to both loyal and occasional readers!
65% are skeptic or luke-warmer
Having done a quick count of the warmist sites, I came up with 48 from a total of 137. That’s crunches to be only 35%. That’s a far cry from the 97% the warmists like to try to have the rest of the world believe.
That means that almost two thirds of all climate science blogs are very skeptical or somewhat skeptical of the IPCC science (skeptic or luke-warmer). That’s hardly a consensus! Many of the skeptic sites are run by scientists and meteorologists…also showing that that “consensus among experts” is a complete myth.
Moreover, the top 20 sites are clearly dominated by skeptics.

Share this...FacebookTwitterBelow Rainer Hoffmann presents Part 3 of his “10 Inconvenient Truths About Professor Hans-Joachim Schellnhuber“. I wrote about Part 1 here, and Part 2 focused on Schellnhuber’s claiming that climate models provide projections, forecasts, scenarios, prognoses, depending on the situation being served at hand.
Part 3 below shows a whopper: Schellnhuber claiming that the complex, chaotic climate system can all be reduced down to a “simple linear relationship” with CO2 emissions.

The video starts by explaining how climate is a highly complex, chaotic non-linear system that cannot be defined by any single variable. At the 2:14 mark IPCC scientist Mojib Latif explains that calculating the future outcome of a system as complex as the climate is an impossible task. This is confirmed by Prof Andreas Bott at the 6:33 mark, “The systems of equations are non-linear, and thus not predictable.” The first 14 minutes of the film explain this in detail.
Even the 2001 IPCC reports tells us:
In climate research and modeling, we should recognize that we are dealing with a coupled non-linear chaotic system, and therefore that the long-term prediction of future climate states is not possible.”
But not everyone agrees with this.

For one, in 2009 Prof. Hans Joachim Schellnhuber of the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research told us that climate is actually a simple system where global temperature behaves linearly with CO2 concentration. At the 15:00 mark Schellnhuber said on Phoenix public television on November 23, 2009:
We have been able to show at our institute, also our friends at Oxford, and at the University of Victoria in Vancouver Island, that there is an extremely simple, quasi linear relationship between the global mean temperature, that is the increase and the total amount of CO2 that will be blown into the atmosphere over the next four or five decades. The entire complexity of our climate system can be reduced to this simple linear relationship. Nature has done this favor as an exception.”
What a con-job. Schellnhuber then goes on to claim that scientists know exactly how much CO2 is allowed to be blown into the atmosphere before the climate systems tips: “750 billion tonnes of CO2 over the next 4 decades“.
So when it appeared the planet was warming, Schellnhuber told us that climate was a simple linear equation involving 2 variables. So what does Schellnhuber say today now that the data show there hasn’t been any warming in 15 years despite rising CO2?
Look at what Schellnhuber says on April 17, 2013. At the 17:34 mark Schellnhuber is shown blaming non-linearity for the absence of warming over 15 years.
So quickly can a con-artist turn on a dime.

Share this...FacebookTwitterPolar scientist Dr. Peter Lemke of Germany’s renowned Alfred Wegener Institute was interviewed here about climate change, its affect on the Earth’s polar regions and about his recent winter expedition to Antarctica.
In the Arctic part of the interview, Lemke repeats the usual man-is-melting-the-Arctic narrative that you often hear from many state-funded alarmist climate scientists. No surprise here.
But as always, when it comes to sea ice, eventually warmist polar scientists get tripped up by Antarctica. And sure enough, Lemke trips and stumbles when Antarctic sea ice gets brought up. Before too long he is forced to concede he is stumped and has to admit that sea ice at the South Pole has grown and that he has no real explanation.
Peter Lemke has been on several expeditions to Antarctica: in 1989, 1992, 2006, and now 2013. And each time they collected data. Today, after comparing the preliminary results of the 2013 to those of 1992, here’s what Lemke says:
“…from our early results, it looks like that the sea ice mass around Antarctica has increased slightly. Our measurements showed that the sea ice was more extensive, thicker and more densely packed as compared to our 1992 expedition, which was on the same track during the same season.”
Increased slightly? In the following chart I’ve highlighted the winter of the years 1992 and 2013 to show what Lemke means by “increased slightly“:

It’s obvious that Lemke is attempting to seriously downplay the Antarctic sea ice growth that has occurred since 1992. Indeed the above chart shows that sea ice has grown by more than 1.5 million square kilometers. That’s not increasing “slightly”.  We suppose that if the trend had been the other way around, we’d be hearing terms like considerable reduction or even possibly dramatic reduction.
What’s more, Lemke also confirms that this extra 1.5 million square kilometers is “thicker” and “more compact”, meaning there’s much more ice mass.
So why is the ice growing? This goes against all the claims of global warming. Here, typical of warmist scientists who are confronted with inconvenient data, Lemke acts like he has the answer…before admitting he really has no clue (my emphasis):
One explanation is that in the Southern Hemisphere the westerly winds are increasing, and through friction this drives the ice towards lower latitudes and the extent is getting a bit bigger.  When the ice expands there is open water between ice floes, and it’s still cold enough in winter that ice freezes in the open patches.
There are other physical processes that may be involved, such as the heavy snow cover that blankets the Antarctic sea ice. Sometimes the heavy snow load submerges the ice floe underwater so that the interface of ice and snow is actually below sea level, and seawater drains into the snow and freezes. That may be one process, but there are others that are not really resolved yet.
We don’t yet have the answers to these questions, because there are very few measurements and you cannot deduce snow from satellite remote sensing data, yet. To find out, you have to go there and make measurements yourself. But winter expeditions are very rare. There are very few icebreakers that can actually go into the Antarctic winter into the sea ice.”
The science is settled, except for the majority that isn’t.
Never trust a climate scientist who acts like he’s sure. It’s a dead give away that he hasn’t got a clue about what’s really going on.

"Drought-hit Namibia has authorised the sale of at least 1,000 wild animals – including elephants and giraffes – to limit loss of life and generate US$1.1 million for conservation, the authorities confirmed Saturday. “Given that this year is a drought year, the [environment] ministry would like to sell various type of game species from various protected areas to protect grazing and at the same time to also generate much needed funding for parks and wildlife management,” the environment ministry spokesman Romeo Muyunda said. The authorities declared a national disaster last month, and the meteorological services in the southern African nation estimate that some parts of the country faced the deadliest drought in as many as 90 years. “The grazing condition in most of our parks is extremely poor and if we do not reduce the number of animals, this will lead to loss of an animals due to starvation,” Muyunda said. In April, an agriculture ministry report said 63,700 animals died in 2018 because of deteriorating grazing conditions brought on by dry weather. Namibia’s cabinet announced this week that the government would sell about 1,000 wild animals. They include 600 disease-free buffalos, 150 springbok, 65 oryx, 60 giraffes, 35 eland, 28 elephants, 20 impala and 16 kudus – all from national parks. The aim is to raise $1.1 m that will go towards a state-owned Game Products Trust Fund for wildlife conservation and parks management. The government said there were currently about 960 buffalos in its national parks, 2,000 springbok, 780 oryx and 6,400 elephants. The auction was advertised in local newspapers from Friday. Namibia, a country of 2.4 million people, has previously made calls for aid to assist in the drought emergency that has already affected over 500,000 people. In April the government announced that it would spend about $39,400 on drought relief this year to buy food, provide water tankers and provide subsidies to farmers."
"Oregon is poised to become the second US state after California to impose a cap and trade program aimed at reducing industrial carbon emissions. But ahead of a vote on the legislation Thursday, all 11 Republican state senators fled the capitol in a bid to delay the process. Several claimed to have left the state, beyond the reach of state troopers dispatched by the governor in order to get the legislative session back on track. Senate Republican leader Herman Baertschiger Jr wrote in a statement that the walk-out was “exactly how we should be doing our job”. In a speech on the Senate floor, a visibly frustrated Senate president Peter Courtney begged his colleagues to return. “This is the saddest day of my legislative life,” he said. If passed into law, the clean energy jobs bill would place a cap on emissions from power, transportation and other industries in the state, and establish a system to auction and trade them. The program would begin in 2021, with the goal of reducing greenhouse gas emissions to 45% of 1990 carbon levels by 2035, and 20% of 1990 levels by 2050. Not unlike the principles of the Green New Deal, Oregon’s “cap and invest” program would earmark funds generated by the program for clean energy, climate-related upgrades to infrastructure in order to better retrofit the state for increasing extreme weather events and green jobs training. Supporters say Oregon’s program would be the most progressive of its kind in the country, as funds would be guaranteed for low-income people and communities of color, Native tribes and places hit “first and worst” by the impacts of climate change. “We’ve been fighting like crazy to make sure this is the strongest and most equitable environmental bill,” said Brad Reed of the environmental advocacy coalition Renew Oregon. “The provisions in the bill for equity are some of the strongest in the country.” “Oregon can be the log that breaks the jam nationally” on progressive carbon emissions regulation and green investment, said Governor Kate Brown in a statement. California in 2013 became the first US state to establish its cap and trade program. The biggest share of those revenues so far has gone to high speed rail construction. Oregon’s carbon market would join California’s in the Western Climate Initiative, which also includes Quebec – carbon credits could be auctioned across borders. Carbon pricing essentially redirects the costs of climate change back to industry, by putting a price on carbon emissions and placing climate costs on company balance sheets. The logic behind creating a carbon market assumes that if it costs companies to pollute, companies will not pollute as much. A cap and trade policy is one approach to the scheme, as opposed to creating an actual tax on emissions by the ton. The Union of Concerned Scientists says robust carbon pricing schemes are an integral economic policy tool in reducing emissions in order “to limit some of the worst impacts of climate change”. While cap and trade schemes enjoy broad and in many cases passionate support among Democrats, carbon pricing has critics on the left and the right. Oregon Republicans claim the program is still essentially a tax, and thus would need to pass by a three-fifths majority in both the state house and senate, according to law. Some environmental activists say carbon pricing isn’t just an inadequate tool for addressing climate change, but a potentially destructive one. Cap and trade critics argue a market-based strategy to influence corporate behavior shirks regulatory responsibility and disproportionately impacts low-income communities, by creating pollution hot spots exacerbated by companies buying the right to emit, raising fuel prices that poor rural drivers will struggle to pay. “It’s our position that cap and trade systems don’t work and that they actually harm frontline communities,” said Shawn Fleek of Opal Environmental Justice Oregon. “We’re really witnessing a stark divide in the environmental and environmental justice communities with this process.” If the bill is passed, the entire west coast could soon be capping and trading carbon emissions together. While three attempts at implementing carbon pricing in Washington state have so far failed since 2016, legislators introduced another bill this March to implement a cap and trade program in that state. That bill is currently in committee. • This article was amended on 21 June 2019 to correct the number of Republican senators who fled the building. An earlier version said 12; this has been corrected to 11. "
"“Democracy is the theory that the common people know what they want, and deserve to get it good and hard,” said the American journalist HL Mencken, who died 60 years before the EU referendum but nonetheless seems to have known how things might play out. The British people have spoken and said … what, exactly? Last week’s BritainThinks survey of today’s attitudes found rampant pessimism, anxiety and gloom. “I cannot recall a time when the national mood was more despairing,” said the research firm’s boss Deborah Mattinson. Now we learn that the government is going to give this participatory democracy idea another go, launching a citizens’ assembly on the climate emergency later in the year.  The catch is that, while a group of informed and motivated people will meet several times this autumn, its recommendations will be merely advisory and not binding. A spokeswoman for Greenpeace worried that the assembly might simply be a “glorified public consultation”. We have lived through a succession of outsourcing scandals and disasters in recent times. Carillion, Interserve, G4S, Capita, Kier Group and Serco have all made headlines for the wrong reasons. But what we are experiencing today may the biggest scandal of the lot – the outsourcing of the destiny of the nation to a confused, disgruntled and disillusioned population. Asking citizens to settle the complicated matter of our continued membership of the EU with a simple yes/no question was not one of David Cameron’s better ideas. It bought him an extra year in office after the 2015 election, but has left his political reputation in tatters. He outsourced the government’s responsibility for governing to the rest of us. Most sensible people probably aren’t all that interested in politics much of the time. In the past Jim Messina, the US elections strategist, has argued that the average person may spend only four minutes a week really engaging with political issues. That was then. Since the referendum it has been impossible to hide from endless, noisy talk about hard and soft Brexits, the customs union, the single market, Norway plus, super-Canada, and all the rest of the joyous vocabulary of despair. And normal people’s reaction to all this? I refer you to the findings of the BritainThinks survey. We’ve had enough of it. We’ve been forced to try to engage with obscure technocratic chat and the result is the gloom, anxiety and confusion which has shocked seasoned researchers. I was out buying a copy of Private Eye recently – the one with a blank cover underneath the headline “Theresa May memorial issue: the prime minister’s legacy in full”. The shop assistant saw it, laughed, and then corrected herself. “Well, they [Private Eye] have a go at everyone, don’t they?” she said rather hastily. This was how we used to discuss politics (if we did at all): tentatively, and with some care. Not knowing my personal views the shop assistant had rowed back a bit from her initial response. For all she knew I could have been a Theresa May supporter. It wouldn’t do to get into a row about it. This great Brexit outsourcing calamity has turned us all into semi-informed pundits, required to have a clear view on issues that are complicated, mysterious and unknowable. It’s like being trapped at a three-year-long dinner party with guests you don’t know or particularly like. We’re all thoroughly fed up with it and want to go home. Except that our former home seems impossibly out of reach. When I read in this paper that “governments are going to have to embrace such innovations as citizens’ assemblies and participatory budgeting”, a voice inside my head asks: really? A citizens’ jury sounds like a fine thing. But when called for actual jury service how do a lot of people react? They look for any reason to postpone it or get out of it altogether. There is, sadly, a lot more unpleasantness to get through before the Brexit disaster will be in any sense behind us. Paradoxically, we may need one more democratic moment – an election or a further referendum – to move on. But then perhaps, one day, we could go back to having politicians who do not shirk the duty of leadership, and a political system that has the confidence to operate more normally, without outsourcing its work to the rest of us. Of course, we still want “government of the people, by the people, for the people”. We just need to find some better people to do it. Don’t hold your breath. • Stefan Stern is co-author of Myths of Management"

Share this...FacebookTwitterIt’s long been known that Greenpeace environmentalists are condescending, know-it-all activists, who believe to hold the moral high ground, to be the keepers of the truth.
That sort of mindset has led Greenpeace activists to a false belief they are above the law, that their perceived law is supreme to everyone else’s. Time and again Greenpeace activists have been arrested for illegal activity only to be let go the next day. Unfortunately that ritual of always being set free almost immediately and knowing you have the full power of Greenpeace’s formidable legal team working tirelessly on your behalf have only emboldened Greenpeace activists. Now comes Russia.
Slowly realizing that the situation this time is different, that his activists aren’t going to be walking out of their jail cells like heroes anytime soon, Greenpeace International director Kumi Naidoo is softening the tone. Compare earlier comments to those of today:
Earlier comments from Naidoo before he realized the seriousness:
– “…we believe that intensifying peaceful civil disobedience is not only ethically justifiable but morally necessary.”
– …the world needs people who are “prepared to go to prison, put their lives on the line if necessary, in the struggle for climate justice and addressing the reality of runaway catastrophic climate change“.

– “I make no apologies, by the way, the fact that we are morally and ethically having to break the law, because history teaches us,...”
– Russian authorities are making “absurd accusations“.
Now today, realizing that the situation has become very serious…
– “They, we, Greenpeace, do not believe ourselves to be above the law. We are willing to face the consequences of what we did, as long as those consequences are within a nation’s criminal code as any reasonable person understands that code to be.”
“- My own personal history as a young activist in the anti-apartheid movement has taught me that dialogue is paramount, that in the interests of finding a common understanding we must be willing to talk.”
Suddenly he has stopped viewing Greenpeace as being above the law. Now he wants to engage in dialogue. Imagine that!

Share this...FacebookTwitterMy  last post on sea level rise here led to Swedish blog site Stockholms Initiativet to post on the subject as well.
That post in turn sparked a reader comment from top Swedish climate scientist Lennart Bengtsson, translated in English (my emphasis):
Hi
We now have satellite measurements for 20 years which indicate a steady rise of about 3 mm per year, and during that time no acceleration, See: http://sealevel.colorado.edu/.
However, it is important to be clear that this is an average and that there were considerable local variations related to tectonic changes, among others, after the last ice age. The isostatic adjustment that needs to be done in order to obtain useful data are being evaluated by the experts now. As you can see from the graph, it is clear that we need a relatively long time to obtain a realistic trend, but 20 years is certainly enough. On Monday I was involved in a public panel discussion with Pachauri who insisted that this is an acceleration. I found that I think I know more about this than Mr. Pachauri. The reference above appears to me quite compelling.“
You just gotta love it. So even though the observations show there is no real detectable acceleration in sea level rise, Pachauri “insists that this is an acceleration“. It’s all in their fantasies and crystal ball models. None of it is real. This is what the panic is based on.
Also note that Bengtsson calls the comprehensive compilation of by K.E. Puls “quite compelling”. No surprise here as real observations tend to be so.

"The melting of Himalayan glaciers has doubled since the turn of the century, with more than a quarter of all ice lost over the last four decades, scientists have revealed. The accelerating losses indicate a “devastating” future for the region, upon which a billion people depend for regular water. The scientists combined declassified US spy satellite images from the mid-1970s with modern satellite data to create the first detailed, four-decade record of ice along the 2,000km (1,200-mile) mountain chain. The analysis shows that 8bn tonnes of ice are being lost every year and not replaced by snow, with the lower level glaciers shrinking in height by 5 meters annually. The study shows that only global heating caused by human activities can explain the heavy melting. In previous work, local weather and the impact of air pollution had complicated the picture. Joshua Maurer, from Columbia University’s Lamont-Doherty Earth observatory, who led the new research, said: “This is the clearest picture yet of how fast Himalayan glaciers are melting since 1975, and why.” The research is published in the journal Science Advances. Prof Joerg Schaefer, also at Columbia and part of the team, said: “It is really the doubling of the speed of glacier melt that is most concerning.” The new understanding of past melting means forecasts can now be made with far more confidence but the outlook is dire, he said. “It looks devastating and there is no doubt in my mind, not a single grain of doubt, that [the impact of the climate crisis] is what we are seeing.” A landmark report published in February found that at least a third of the ice in the Hindu Kush-Himalaya ranges was already doomed to melt by the end of the century, even if drastic action to cut emissions was taken immediately. Without action, two-thirds would go. Either way, serious consequences will be felt by those who rely on the great rivers that flow from the peaks into India, Pakistan, China and other nations. “It’s the climate crisis you haven’t heard of,” said Philippus Wester, at the International Centre for Integrated Mountain Development, who led the February study and said the new work was very convincing. “Increasingly uncertain and irregular water supplies will impact the 1 billion people living downstream from the Himalaya mountains in south Asia.” The spy satellite photographs used in the research had lain unused in archives for some years. But a computer tool developed by Maurer and colleagues enabled these 1970s photos to be turned into 3D maps. The scientists used this data to track the changes in 650 Himalayan glaciers. On average, the glacier surfaces sank by 22cm (8.6 inches) a year from 1975 to 2000. But the melting has accelerated, with an average loss of 43cm a year from 2000 to 2016.  The evidence points to human-caused climate change being the dominant cause of the melting. The glaciers are shrinking at similar rates all along the mountain chain, indicating a common cause. Weather changes and the settling of black air pollution, which absorbs heat from the sun and speeds up melting, have only local effects. Temperature data from the region also shows an average rise of 1C from 2000-16 compared with 1975-2000. Calculations show this rise is consistent with the amount of ice being lost. “Even glaciers in the highest mountains of the world are responding to global air temperature increases driven by the combustion of fossil fuels,” said Joseph Shea, at the University of Northern British Columbia in Canada, who was not involved in the study. Schaefer said: “For the wellbeing of the people there, our results are of course the worst possible. But it is what it is, and now we have to prepare for that scenario. We have to worry a lot, because so many people are affected. “To stop the temperature rises, we have to cool the planet,” he said. “We have to not only slow down greenhouse gas emissions, we have to reverse them. That is the challenge for the next 20 years.”"

Share this...FacebookTwitterIt started with the Farmer’s Almanac. We’ve been hearing lots of talk about another brutal winter being in store.
Photo right: weatherbell.com/
Although seasonal forecasts are speculative at best, meteorology indeed has advanced to a point where it is possible to get an idea of what direction the upcoming season is tending towards. Farmers have been doing this successfully for centuries.
Meteorologist Joe Bastardi in his Saturday Summary at the 7-minute mark looks at the latest NCEP NCAR global winter forecast for 2013/14. The charts point to another “brutal winter for Europe“. The forecast sees blocking and a negative NAO. Joe also tweeted that “SST analog package combined with low solar, and climate cycle (similar to early 50s)  argue for nasty Euro Winter“.
Joe is not alone in pointing out that weather services are looking at a brutal European winter. German meteorologist Dominik Jung tweeted the following chart from the French CFS meteorological services which shows really nasty cold in store for January.

German meteorologist Dominik Jung tweets that a bitter cold one could be in store for Europe. Chart: CFS
Moreover, the online web.de/magazine here carries the title: “Winter 2013/2014 is going to be really cold”, citing “one of the most well-known long-term models of the American Weather Service“.
Web.de writes:

It looks like the 2013/2014 winter is going to be extremely frosty. Jung has evaluated the data: ‘Looking at these charts, it’s going to be really cold.'”
Web.de adds that signs show the winter could be a long, protracted affair:
The cold air flow from Eastern Europe to Central Europe could strengthen considerably. […] Also the cold winter weather should continue through February and the Southwest could be hit by the Russian beast from the east. This scenario could extend into deep into March. ‘After the last five much-too-cold winters, this development would be no real surprise and well within the realms of the possible,’ says meteorologist Jung.”
If this forecast (fraught with uncertainty) should pan out out to be true, then it would be a record six colder-than-normal winters in a row for Europe. You just couldn’t drift further away from global warming. Six in a row would be nothing short of spectacular. Such a long, protracted winter as described above would make it one of the worst in 100 years.
But not every meteorologist is convinced that long-term seasonal forecasts are of any value. Swiss meteorologist Jörg Kachelmann at Twitter, for example, scoffs at such prognoses, writing that it’s mainly stuff “from the charlatan department“.
Again we have reiterate that these forecasts are truly speculative, and all the meteorologist point this out. So there really is no need to get pissy about it.
I’m a bit skeptical of the long-term winter forecasts as well, though not as much as Mr. Kachelmann. Large global scale weather patterns can change quickly. For example there’s still lots of uncertainty as to what will happen with the ENSO in the months ahead, and if you can’t predict the ENSO for the next few months, then how can you predict the other global seasonal patterns? Another example is the hurricane season. How often have hurricane season predictions been wrong?
On the other hand, we now have more than 100 years of detailed weather data that now allow us to recognize certain repeating patterns, and so seasonal tendency forecasts are becoming a reality. You can’t just dismiss them offhand.

Share this...FacebookTwitterIf the oceans have eaten the heat, then it certainly isn’t to be found in the Arctic Ocean – that’s for sure!
The Beeb has surprised today in reporting that Arctic sea ice VOLUME grew a stunning 50%, from 6000 cubic kilometers to approx. 9000 cubic kilometers, from 2012 to 2013, this according to measurements made by the Cryosat probe of the European Space Agency.
Yet another argument of the warmists is melting away.
Data from Europe’s Cryosat spacecraft suggests there were almost 9,000 cu km of ice at the end of this year’s melt season. This is close to 50% more than in the corresponding period in 2012.
Are sea ice models next in line to be embarrassed?
Whenever sea ice area did not cooperate, the warmists always insisted that we needed to look at volume – that, they told us, was the real barometer. But now we are seeing that Arctic sea ice volume is also no longer cooperating. According to Rachel Tilling from the UK’s Nerc Centre for Polar Observation and Modelling (CPOM).
One of the things we’d noticed in our data was that the volume of ice year-to-year was not varying anything like as much as the ice extent – at least for the years 2010, 2011 and 2012.

This is why we’re really quite surprised by what we’ve seen in 2013. We didn’t expect the greater ice extent left at the end of the summer melt to be reflected in the volume. But it has been. And the reason is related to the amount of multi-year ice in the Arctic.”
Of course scientists and the BBC are scrambling to play down the new development, saying that the Arctic ice volume is still very low.
They blame “wind patterns” for not spreading the ice out more, and thus preventing it from melting more during the 2013 summer. Yet, we recall that in 2007 and 2012 the same scientists immediately blamed global warming for the rapid melt, and not winds, which had been clearly at play. Little wonder the public is losing confidence.
More old ice
The Beeb adds: “Part of this stronger performance can be put down to the greater retention of older ice.”
Interestingly scientists say thickness/volume is the best metric with which to judge the health of the ice pack. Perhaps then we should see more plots of this metric in the future instead of the at-times meaningless sea ice area extents.

"A growing number of teachers want their pupils to learn more about the climate crisis and are calling for environmental training so they can prepare children for a rapidly changing world, according to a poll. The findings from YouGov research commissioned by Oxfam come before the latest round of school climate strikes on Friday, in which it is expected that hundreds of thousands of young people will walk out of classrooms around the world. Noga Levy-Rapoport, from the UK Student Climate Network, said the results showed teachers and students agreed there needed to be a radical overhaul of the education system in response to the climate crisis. “It’s clear that our education system isn’t fit for purpose to equip us for the future we’re inheriting,” she said. “As things stand our generation is being led down a dark tunnel toward increasingly severe climate breakdown and uncertainty. That’s why we’re calling for radical change to centre the climate crisis as an educational priority.” More than two-thirds of teachers polled said there should be more teaching in UK schools about climate change, while three-quarters did not feel they had received adequate training to educate students on the subject. Around 70% agreed radical change was needed to make the education system “fit for the times we live in”. School strikes are due to take place in 80 towns and cities in the UK, with tens of thousands of students expected to take part. Meanwhile, up to 10,000 climate strike leaders from across Europe will gather in Aachen, Germany, for a pan-European rally. The school strike movement started in August 2018 when Greta Thunberg, then 15, held a solo protest outside the Swedish parliament. Now hundreds of thousands of schoolchildren walk out of class each week to voice their concern about the ecological crisis. In the UK, one of the campaign’s key demands has been to transform education to inform young people of the facts of the climate emergency. Last month Labour pledged to make the climate emergency a core element of the school curriculum from primary school onwards. The shadow education secretary, Angela Rayner, said a future Labour government would ensure the climate crisis was an educational priority, with all young people taught about its ecological and social impact. Issues around the climate crisis are currently covered in both science and geography at key stage 3 (KS3) for ages 11 to 14 and at key stage 4 (KS4) for ages 14 to 16. Both subjects are compulsory at KS3, while only science is compulsory at KS4. But many activists, teachers and experts say this is not enough. The Department for Education said pupils were already taught about climate change as part of the national curriculum in science and geography in both primary and secondary school. "

Share this...FacebookTwitterToday we know that this claim should have been a very easy-to-detect gross blunder.
The skeptic website klimamanifest-von-heiligenroth.de/ last week posted a freshly produced video (in German) that puts the spotlight on the director of the ultra-alarmist Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research (PIK), Hans-Joachim Schellnhuber.

Klimamanifest video, Part 1 of 10. In 2009 Schellnhuber claimed that the Himalayan melt by 2035 was “very easy to calculate”.
Schellnhuber is also the Chairman of the WBGU advisory council to the German government, which is pushing for a “Great Transformation” of global society to one that is “sustainable” and not based on fossil fuels.
The creator of the above video, Rainer Hoffmann, had spent three months researching past statements made by Schellnhuber. The result is a 10-part series called: The 10 Inconvenient Truths of Climate Pope Hans Schellnhuber. It exposes a number of troubling, contradictory statements made by the Potsdam Institute director over the past years.
According to the klimamanifest site, the above video was inspired by comments Schellnhuber had made on German public television on May 27, 2013, where he once again warned of a planet warming by 4°C by the end of the century.
Part 1, above, was released last Monday and the remaining 9 parts will follow each Monday for the next 9 weeks. NoTricksZone will report on each episode as they are released.
Part I: Schellnhuber claimed the Himalayas melt of 2035 was “very easy to calculate”
At the 0:50 mark Schellnhuber is shown in an exclusive interview on ZDF German public television on October 30, 2009, explaining the risks of the globe’s “third ice cap“: the Tibetan Plateau, whose summertime melt water feeds a number major Asian rivers that help support 2.5 billion people in the region. Schellnhuber at the 2:06 mark:
If now, and one can calculate this very easily, in the next 30, 40 years, with 2°C of warming this will with certainty happen, um, when these large glaciers disappear for the most part, these rivers will dry up in the summertime. And in winter, this is the other side of the story, the precipitation will fall as rain in the valley; that means the floods will be far more dramatic, no?”
Clearly we see that in 2009, two years after the 4AR had been issued in 2007, Schellnhuber was preaching the Himalayan 2035 glacier meltdown, even claiming he could “calculate the melt very easily” and that major rivers like the Yangtze, Ganges, Mekong´, etc. would dry up. But just over 2 months later, the media found out that what had been “very easy to calculate” was a huge whopping error. The above video shows two clips: one on 19 January 2010 and one on 11 February 2010 that say the 2035 Himalayan ice melt was a huge blunder. Moreover, the 3SAT report at the 4:20 mark of the above video points out yet another whopping error made by the 2007 IPCC report:
It should have been clear to experts that the scenario was pure nonsense, and not because so much ice in this region could ever melt in just 25 years, but also because the Himalayan glacier area given in the IPCC report was completely false. It is only 33,000 square kilometers and not a grotesque 500,000.”
Suddenly 93% of “the Earth’s the third pole” disappears.

At the 4.47 mark Ottmar Edenhofer, deputy director of the PIK, forgets about what his boss had said was “very easy to calculate“, and shifts the blame for the Himalayan blunder on the IPCC overall peer-review process:
This is in now way excusable, and naturally we have to make sure that we make the peer-review of the text much more efficient.”
A remarkable piece of advice when one considers that Edenhofer’s boss, Schellnhuber, had claimed earlier that the Himalayan glacier melt by 2035 was “certainty”.
At the 5:40 mark, BR television on 3 June 2012 asks how the gross Himalaya error found its way into the IPCC report. The answer is delivered by Professor Hans von Storch at the 6:05 mark:
I think one of the reasons why it was there is because of they worked sloppily. Perhaps it had something to do with, so to say, the desire for the right result.”
Yet, no journalists ever bothered to follow up and ask Schellnhuber why he had peddled such an absurd prognosis back in 2009. In an interview with Spiegel on October 6, 2010, Schellnhuber acts like he had never made the ridiculous Himalayan 2035 melting prediction. In the Spiegel interview (7:10 mark) he is quoted (highlighted in yellow):
There were just a few bad mistakes, but they were very troublesome. The IPCC is in the public spotlight and there is so much at play and errors of this magnitude mustn’t happen. The IPCC has to do its homework in order to overcome the current credibility crisis.”
Clearly Schellnhuber wants us to believe that he had never peddled the “easy to calculate” 2035 Himalayan ice melt scenario. Journalist Karsten Schwanke, who had done the interview with Schellnhuber on ZDF television back in 2009, wrote in an e-mail on February 1, 2010 (see 8:00 min mark):
It is of course huge crap that such errors go through the entire IPCC. I thought they all worked to check everything a thousand times. Personally I was always skeptical about this melt warning. Ice at 7000 or 8000 meters elevation, why would it melt? It’s way too cold. At most it could sublimate if it stopped snowing. But the India monsoons bring new snow every summer. I just don’t understand it.”
In summary what turned out to be one of climate science’s most embarrassing blunders, was also one Schellnhuber’s most “certain” and “very easy to calculate” scenarios.
Finally at the 8:40 mark of the video, Schellnhuber is taped in an interview saying:
I believe that there has never been a socially relevant area examined by science that has been more meticulously checked for errors than climate science.”
I don’t see how any expert could have been more misleading.

"Fast fashion – the rapid system of trend-driven, low-cost clothing manufacture beloved by UK consumers – is on the rampage. We crossed a worrying line in 2014, scaling up garment production to 100bn pieces of new clothing a year. These are clothes, made from virgin resources, increasingly plastic, pushed out into the world with little thought as to where they will end up. Without rapid reform, the fashion industry – of which fast fashion is the dominant player – could be responsible for a quarter of the Earth’s carbon budget by 2050. This threat to the planet has, not surprisingly, attracted the attention of climate protesters. Extinction Rebellion picketed London fashion week for the first time in February. The UK’s contribution is enormous. Not only did we invent fast fashion, but our fashion consumers are among the most voracious in the world. One in three young women, the biggest segment of consumers, consider garments worn once or twice to be old. UK consumers sent 300,000 tonnes of textiles to be burned or dumped in landfill in 2018. The drive to fast fashion began from the moment Hargreaves of Oswaldtwistle built the first spinning jenny to spin cotton faster. By the 1770s the mill owner Richard Arkwright’s version could spin 20 to 30 warp threads at once. With faster material production came more ready to wear clothes. By the early 1800s the well-heeled were writing to newspapers complaining that their housemaids were asking for higher wages to fund dress purchases. The poor maids were likely to have been trying to fill the same void in their lives that we do today, but we have fallen hook, line and sinker. To take the heat out of dressing we’re often told to think of our grandparents and the make-do-and-mend spirit of the 1940s. In reality though this period, when the purchase of civilian clothing was restricted to free up materials and shipping space for the war effort, is an anomaly. These forebears were perhaps the only ones who had a truly sustainable approach to fashion. Ultimately fashion sped up not just the fibre production but also garment making. By the 1990s the UK’s industry had been almost entirely exported to some of the lowest wage economies on earth.  If there is one point where we should have stopped the madness it was the aftermath of the morning of 23 April 2013, when the Rana Plaza complex in Bangladesh collapsed. More than 1,300 people, mostly young female garment workers making for western brands, died in the disaster, which exposed the true cost of our fast fashion habit. The industry, however, was allowed to mark its own homework, taking control of a limited programme of reform that would retrofit factories to bring them up to minimum safety requirements. Not one brand moved to change the system. Instead, fast fashion pushed onwards and upwards. Brands sought cheaper more compliant manufacturers in new territories, exporting the same system for production that had led to Rana Plaza to Ethiopia, the lowest-wage economy on Earth. A recent study by NYU Stern into fast fashion production at the Hawassa industrial park found workers barely covering the cost of food and transport. This week the Manchester-based Missguided.com launched a £1 plastic polymer bikini. It serves as a reminder that the new crop of online retailers make high street fast fashion look as slow as a diplodocus. These brands are social media and Snapchat tacticians with a direct line to very young people. Digital natives “swipe up” and instantly purchase an outfit worn by someone they follow. Consuming at this speed removes any possible moment for pause and reflection. The online fashion retailers have stripped out every barrier to purchase, even the one of not actually having the money. At Missguided.com even your £1 bikini can be purchased in instalments over four weeks using Klarna, a Swedish version of an increasing number of buy-now-pay-later platforms that do not require credit checks. This business model might seem one that cares little for the planet, but Boohoo.com launched a sustainable collection this week. They might want to be careful overselling their commitment. H&M, one of the biggest producers of fast fashion and generator of an extraordinary number of sustainability initiatives, has run slap bang into the Norwegian Consumer Authority. Set up to police Norway’s Marketing Control Act, the NCA has concluded that H&M’s conscious collection gives consumers the impression that their clothes are more sustainable than they actually are.  This is a welcome intervention but it does not compensate for the government’s failure to help fix fashion here. The point is that we are in a fashion industry emergency, at risk of having to explain to future generations that we missed the climate change targets because we couldn’t resist a £1 bikini advertised during Love Island.

"The Morrison government has been challenged by the European Union and by China about whether it can meet its Paris commitments given rising emissions, and about growing pollution from vehicles, ahead of a progress meeting about climate commitments in Bonn next week. Nineteen countries, including Australia, will gather in Bonn on 24 and 25 June for a multilateral assessment of progress made under international climate commitments, and ahead of that session countries have submitted a range of questions about the performance of signatories in meeting their climate targets. As well as questions about rising emissions, the EU and Canada have also queried the Morrison government’s decision to use carry-over credits from the Kyoto protocol in its latest carbon budget. The Coalition is counting a 367 megatonne abatement from carry-over credits (an accounting system that allows countries to count carbon credits from exceeding their targets under the soon-to-be-obsolete Kyoto protocol periods against their Paris commitment for 2030) to help meet Australia’s 2030 target. The EU in its questions to Australia points out that net emissions will grow during the period 2013 to 2020 and notes “Australia is also increasing coalmining, in particular for export”. It has asked whether Australia considers its emissions profile, which has seen pollution rise since the repeal of the carbon price, to be “on a structural path of decrease in line with its commitments”. It has also flagged fossil fuel exports and asked whether they are sustainable “in the context of Paris agreement”. Sign up to receive the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Morrison government officials have addressed the implicit criticism by arguing in a submitted answer that “Australia’s national emissions peaked in 2007” and pointing to a fall in emissions per capita. It says even without its climate policies, unveiled just before the recent federal election, including the reboot of the Abbott-era emissions reduction fund (ERF), “the decoupling of economic growth from greenhouse gas emissions has been progressing steadily since 1990”. The government says the mix in electricity generation has changed between 2013 and 2020, and the Renewable Energy Target (RET) will see renewable energy grow to about 23.5% of Australia’s energy mix by 2020. Australian officials do not, in the answer to the EU, mention the RET winds down from 2020, or that a sectoral target to drive emissions reduction in the electricity sector, proposed by Malcolm Turnbull in the national energy guarantee, was scrapped after he was replaced as prime minister by Scott Morrison. The EU has also challenged Australia on its 2030 Paris target, pointing out “on the basis of reported projections with existing policies and measures it is not on track to meet this commitment”. The EU asked Australia whether it would need further policies to meet the Paris commitment, given the current trends. Australian government officials point to the policies outlined before the recent election, including the funding boost for the ERF. But in defending the status quo, the government has also restated a commitment to “review and refine” domestic policies aligned with the five-yearly review process under the Paris agreement. “This approach will provide for integrated consideration of domestic policy and international targets, and provide guidance for industry about future policy review processes,” officials said. China, in a question to Australia, notes there will be a significant increase in transportation greenhouse gas emissions, and asks what measures Australia plans to take to reduce transport pollution in the future. While the Morrison government pilloried Labor in the recent election campaign for proposing a vehicle emissions standard and targets for the uptake of electric vehicles, characterising Labor’s plans as a “war on the weekend”, government officials have told China the Coalition “is supporting low and zero emissions transport options in a number of ways”. It says it is “developing” a national electric vehicle strategy – a strategy the government has not yet unveiled – which it says will build on support being rolled out through the Australian Renewable Energy Agency and the Clean Energy Finance Corporation. It also points to the government’s Green Vehicle Guide website, and mandatory fuel consumption and carbon dioxide emission labels, that “help consumers identify and choose more fuel efficient vehicles” as well as “action to bring our fuel quality in line with international standards”. The government says the safeguard mechanism “puts regulated limits on the emissions of large transport facilities that emit more than 100,000 tonnes C02-equivalent each year (mostly rail freight, domestic aviation and shipping)” and says the ERF “incentivises businesses, households and landowners to proactively reduce their emissions [and] provides incentives to reduce the emissions intensity of land and sea transport activity”. It also points to the national hydrogen strategy, which is being led by Australia’s chief scientist, Alan Finkel, which is due to be delivered by the end of 2019."

Share this...FacebookTwitterMeteorologists warned us that snow was on the way and would fall below the 500 m elevation in southern Germany and elsewhere. Moreover, they warned us that this winter could be one of the worst in 100 years for Central Europe.
No one knows if it’s really going to be such a winter, but one thing is sure: it sure is starting out like one! At least in parts of Central Europe.
Wetteronline.de has put up a video (Schneefall auch in München) of snow falling in Munich this morning, October 11, 2013. Normally the first snow arrives in the Bavarian capital weeks later.
20 cm of snow

‘It began to snow in the Bavarian capital of Munich yesterday evening at about 6 p.m. Many of my meteorologist colleagues had believed this to be improbable,’ said meteorologist Dominik Jung: ‘This year winter has struck early and unusually severely. South of Munich up to 20 centimeters of snow was able to pile up.'”
Die Welt adds that schools have been closed in some localities, 22,000 households in Austria have lost power, trains have come to a standstill, and traffic has been in chaos.
Frost is expected to spread across southern and middle Germany this weekend, reports www.wetter.net, “Temperatures down to -4°C are expected under clear skies in some local areas.
Global warming alarmists claim that such incidences have nothing to do with a climate trend. Yet, climate warmists are now scrambling to explain the increasing frequency of cold weather events now taking hold globally. Whether it’s a killer winter in South America, increased snow cover globally, record Arctic sea ice recovery, recovering glaciers in the Alps, record high sea ice extent in Antarctica, extreme cold in southeast Europe, or 5 consecutive colder than normal European winters, just to name a few, the ominous signs of global cooling are compounding rapidly.

Austrian flagship daily Der Standard here has an interview with Prof. Hans-Joachim Schellhnhuber, Director of the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research in Germany – the Vatican of climate alarmism.
Photo right: Schellnhuber (see credit below)!
In the interview Schellnhuber says that he thinks (not surprisingly) the latest IPCC report is too conservative. He also explains that global temperatures have not risen very much over the last 15 years because “93% of the global warming goes into the ocean, only 2% goes into the atmosphere“.
And in yet another classic example of PIK dramatization and alarmism at its best, he tells readers what this means:
In 2012 a paper by Levitus et al. was published. In it the warming of the ocean from 0 to 2000 meters deep from 1955 to 2010 was estimated. From the increased greenhouse gas effect a warming of 0.09 degrees Celsius was given – evenly distributed over the ocean. Now we only need to calculate the energy contained by this 0.09°C. Just imagine if the ocean released this heat into the atmosphere with a belch. That would shock-heat the first 10 kilometers of our atmosphere – the layer that we live in and where weather occurs – by 36 degrees C …36 degrees Celsius!”
To be fair, Schellnhuber then states that this of course would never happen at once and that this is just a heat conversion calculation. But he adds, “When just a fraction of that is released, such as during the next El Niño, then the air temperature will again jump significantly. Then people will say : ‘Aha, now they are there, the new temperature records.'”

"UK companies must brace for the government to deliberately disrupt or phase out business areas that are unfit for a net zero-carbon economy, according to a report. The UK Energy Research Centre (UKERC) has said many companies will face fundamental change, including the phasing out of the UK’s most polluting business activities.  The government is to begin “purposefully disrupting” industries to spur the move to a zero-carbon economy, after voting through the 2050 target  this month. Jim Watson, a director at the UKERC, said many companies were not ready for deliberate government-led disruption. “Some sectors are more ready than others,” he said. “The electricity sector has already gone through a major change, for example, but other sectors are at the starting point and the government is going to have to be the disruptor here.” He said companies involved in running the UK’s gas networks, or working in the North Sea, may need to consider “an exit, or managed decline”. The sectors facing the biggest shake-up include heating, transport and construction, according to the report. It says they face “starkly divergent futures – including futures where their core assets will need to be phased out”. Prof Jillian Anable, a co-director at the UKERC, said it would prove “politically challenging” for ministers to deliberately disrupt companies, global trade networks, governance and lifestyles. The report identified gaping policy gaps in the government’s plan to move to a zero-carbon economy. Researchers said ministers’ own models provided only limited insights about the potential impact of a major shake-up to the economy. Anable said whole-scale changes were needed in the transport system, the largest carbon emitter in the UK economy. “The UK transport sector is nearly 100% fuelled by fossil fuels, with only tiny niches of electrified and bio-fuelled vehicles,” she said. The government has already set a deadline for the sale of new traditional combustion engine cars to end by 2040. But hybrid vehicles, which are exempt from the ban, will need to be included in it for transport to be “effectively zero carbon” by 2040. The transport sector made up 33% of the UK’s greenhouse gas emissions last year. The UK’s energy supply contributed 28%, while homes and business added 18% each. The report said the construction industry would also need to “undergo disruptive change” to deliver energy efficient building stock compatible with climate targets. But there was “little sign at present” that the policies or skills were in place to retrofit the UK’s draughty homes and businesses, the report said. “Related to this, it remains unclear what changes incumbent firms in heating will need to implement to deliver decarbonisation, and whether they will have the capacity to do so,” the report added."
"A trio of central European countries have blocked the EU from inching closer to a net-zero carbon emissions target for 2050. European leaders meeting in Brussels sparred over the EU’s role in tackling the unfolding climate emergency, which threatens to significantly worsen the risks of drought, floods, extreme heat, poverty and destruction of wildlife around the world.  Dashing earlier hopes of a compromise, Poland and the Czech Republic refused to sign up to a text that referred to a climate-neutral EU by 2050 – a target that was already seen as too vague by green activists. In a further blow, the Hungarian prime minister, Viktor Orbán, joined his neighbours in opposing the EU text, despite earlier signs the country was ready to compromise. Supporters of the 2050 plan hoped the EU could show it was moving in that direction ahead of a major UN climate summit in September. Instead the 2050 date was dropped into a footnote that stated: “For a large majority of member states, climate neutrality must be achieved by 2050.” The German chancellor, Angela Merkel, told her fellow leaders that the EU needed to signal ambition ahead of that meeting. The French president, Emmanuel Macron, called for the EU to agree an unambiguous target for net-zero carbon emissions by 2050. But the Central European trio stood their ground against any mention of 2050 in the main EU summit communiqué. The Czech prime minister, Andrej Babiš, had quipped on his arrival at the summit: “Why should we decide 31 years ahead of time what will happen in 2050?” Inside the meeting, Babiš questioned why Europe should act when emissions in China were rising, prompting a retort from the German chancellor. She countered that the Chinese were taking action that would mean a reduction in Chinese emissions after 2030. While supporters of the 2050 plan were disappointed, they are not giving up. “It’s not a matter of if the EU commits to climate neutrality, it’s when,” one diplomat said. A large majority of EU member states support the aim of net zero carbon emissions by 2050. Hopes had grown in recent days, after Slovakia, Bulgaria and some Baltic states announced their support for the 2050 target, seeing economic gains from the transition to a green economy. “We have come to the conclusion that this is a hell of an opportunity,” the Latvian prime minister, Krišjānis Kariņš, told his fellow leaders. Earlier a senior EU diplomat said the debate among member states had moved on significantly since earlier discussions in March, when countries were “very divided”. They said: “We still do not have unanimity, but an overwhelming majority of member states, including member states you would never expect of being ready to accept such an objective are going in that direction.” The UN secretary general, António Guterres, wants the climate summit in September to put the world on a path to limiting global warming to 1.5C – a non-binding aspiration of the 2015 Paris accord. Guterres wrote to European council president, Donald Tusk, last month and called on him to demonstrate the leadership of the EU. “I write to you today both as a G20 member and as a leader who I believe can bring the ingenuity needed to transform our economic systems and avert the negative impacts of a world with high levels of carbon emissions – from rising levels of pollution to costly natural disasters,” he stated. The letter calls for a change of course to “achieve net zero carbon emissions by 2050” and specifies that leaders should curtail current coal-burning power stations and discontinue new ones beyond 2020. Responding to the EU’s failure to agree a 2050 target, green campaigners called on the EU to hold an emergency climate summit ahead of the UN meeting in September. “Hollow words can’t rebuild a house flattened in a mudslide or repay a farmer who’s lost their harvest to drought, said Greenpeace EU climate policy advisor Sebastian Mang. “Merkel and Macron failed to convince Poland and bring others on board. With people on the streets demanding action and warnings from scientists that the window to respond is closing fast, our governments had a chance to lead from the front and put Europe on a rapid path to full decarbonisation. They blew it.”"

Share this...FacebookTwitterUpdate:  Reader Kåre Kristiansen comments below that electric vehicle owners also get “free electricity for electric cars at some public charging places and no payment for an electric car on ferries.”
=====================================
Germany’s online daily TAZ has an article on how an electric car has reached the No. 1 position when it comes to new car registrations in Norway. This will certainly cause tree-huggers globally to run out and praise the Scandinavian country as a model of green, responsible living and demand that the rest of the world adopt its way.

The TAZ writes that the Nissan Leaf took the number one spot in new-car registration in the Nordic country in both September and in October, reaching a market share of 5.1% and 5.6% respectively. And because almost 100% of Norway’s electricity comes from hydro-electric power plants, transportation with an electric car is practically carbon-neutral (so long you do not look at the car’s manufacture).
Norway is the first country in the world to be able to boast having an electric car as the no.1 seller. The TAZ reports that the electric car market in Norway has doubled in one year alone and that 50,000 electric vehicles will be registered in the sparsely populated country by 2016. That would be about 2% of the country’s entire fleet.
Made attractive with $90,000 in subsidies
So why all the success in Norway? Has there been some kind of technological breakthrough that has made electric cars attractive to consumers? The answer is no.
All the good news ends as soon as you take a look at the price tag that’s been attached to entice consumers to buy the electric vehicles. It’s a whopper.

The TAZ writes that each vehicle gets subsidized to the tune of up to €70,000 per car (more than $90,000). So do not expect to see too many environmentalists running around preaching the virtues of the Norwegian electric car model. Very few countries, even among the rich ones, are able to afford that kind of money.
So what do all the subsidies include? First the TAZ writes that buyers are exempt from paying Norway’s notoriously formidable 25% value added tax on the purchase of the vehicle. Moreover they are also exempt from paying the registration fees, import duties (Norway doesn’t have a domestic auto manufacturer), and buyers are allowed to deduct more expenses with e-cars when filing their income taxes. Furthermore, electric vehicle owners are exempted from paying tolls on highways and bridges.
Another perk is that electric car drivers also are free to use bus lanes in bigger cities. Everything together tallies up to big money. The TAZ writes:
Calculations showing that state coffers subsidize buyers of luxury electric cars like the Tesla S to the tune of 60,000 to 70,000 have sparked a debate on whether or not the state subsidies are exaggerated.”
Norway’s prosperity stems largely from oil and gas
Ironically Norway’s high standard of living is in large part due to its huge North Sea reserves of fossil fuels, mainly gas and oil, which have been exploited over the last decades. What made Norway rich is today being villianized. Gas and oil are what has helped to make the country prosperous and made it possible for the country to afford its current foray in costly electric cars.
How much would it cost the USA to adopt and implement Norway’s model, ignoring the cost of expanding the electric power generation needed to charge the cars?  According to Wikipedia there are approx. 250 million cars on the road in the USA. Subsidizing every electric car with say $50,000 per car in order to replace the fossil fuel cars would produce a price tag of $12.5 trillion – an astronomical sum of money. Never mind the monumental technical problems involved.
The sheer size of the subsidy needed to get people to buy the electric vehicles alone tells you that they have a very long way to go before they make any economic sense. In fact, technological progress in the improved design and efficiency of internal combustion engines have resulted in far greater fuel savings than any green energy subsidy program has ever yielded thus far.

Share this...FacebookTwitterHere’s one of the best speeches I’ve heard in a long time.
On October 31 in the Lower Saxony capital of Hanover there was a parliamentary plenum. Dr. Gero Hocker, speaker for Energy, Environment and Climate Protection of the Free Democrat Party, made a speech calling on his parliamentary colleagues to acknowledge the facts on climate.

Hat-tip European Institute for Climate and Energy here.
Slowly, but surely, leading politicians are mustering the courage to express their doubts on climate science and to speak up. What follows are substantial excerpts of Hocker’s speech in English.
He starts by telling his colleagues that the environment is swamped in political correctness, that there’s intolerance to other views, and that spending 9 million euros on “climate protection” is a waste:
I have doubts in that we are not allowed to ask certain questions in this House. And I also have doubts about that it is perceived as correct that certain views should not be expressed. And I have doubts if what you are doing is correct, that is that climate policy is absolutely being placed above all else. I believe you are drawing the wrong conclusions from the flood of 2013. We have to improve our dikes, and not spend 9 million euros on “climate protection”.
At the 1:23 Hocker says that “the IPCC is really not a good source for advice“.
The people out there are really uncertain about the topic of climate protection, and here the IPCC has made a fundamental contribution to that. Six years ago the ‘experts’ from the IPCC projected that every year the global temperature would rise 0.2°C . And in 2013, that’s only 6 years later, ladies and gentlemen, they are forced to backpedal and recognize that over the last 10 years the temperature has risen only zero point zero-five degrees Celsius. They erred by a huge 75%! And those who want to advise us what do for decades and prophesize what’s ahead and that we’re supposed to act based on that, such an uncertain factual basis is surely not the fundamental basis on which to act politically, ladies and gentlemen!”
Of course with the temperature rise, Hocker slipped and should have said “every decade the global temperature would rise 0.2°C“. But the underlying message remains unchanged: The IPCC is nothing on which decisions can be based on.
At the 2:40 mark, Hocker says that it’s not only the experts who question the science, but also prominent publications such as Spiegel and the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung (FAZ). In front of his politically correct greenie Parliamentarians, Hocker quotes some of the most provocative headlines made on climate change:
In March 2007, the FAZ carried the headline: ‘Climate Change is Nothing But a Swindle’. In May 2013, Spiegel added: ‘There’s enough fodder for continuing an ideological climate discussion, forget the sworn consensus’, and just six weeks ago: ‘Scientists take away the foundation from climate regulators and request a retreat from global alarmism’. […] This shows one thing: The discussion is taking place everywhere all over society: in the press, among the people, with the experts – and you want to keep this discussion out of the Parliament and prevent the right questions from being asked. You are not the thought police of Lower Saxony! You are not the Inquisition to hunt down others who think differently. You have to come to terms with the fact that there are others who have a different opinion in Parliament and you have to accept this discussion, ladies and gentlemen!”

Loud applause at 3:42, and shouts protest from green parliamentarians.
At the 4:20 mark Hocker brings up Antarctica, where “there’s more ice than ever measured.”
In 2013 China emitted more CO2 than ever before, yet over the last 15 years there’s been no significant rise in global temperature. You have to get used to these facts in this discussion, ladies and gentlemen!”
At this point nervousness erupts among parliamentarians and many are clearly agitated by Hocker’s open act of rebellion. Hocker continues, reminding that science thrives on skepticism and that it needs to be welcome and not scorned. Hocker adds that the 9 million euros proposed for climate protection in Lower Saxony would be far more wisely spent on a slew of other needs, which are lacking in money.
But if you truly believe in a climate change, …then the money would be better invested in flood protection, invest the 9 million in our dikes – then you would provide a far greater service to the people of Lower Saxony than if you invested it in a climate protection agencies.”
Citizens should not be bullied into guilt by green thought
Moreover, the restrictions in personal freedom you have with your climate protection measures will not, in my opinion, achieve the success you think they will. You want to prescribe to the people how they are to take their holidays, not with their cars and not with a plane. You want to tell the people what they are to eat, you want to tell people how they are to dress, you want to tell them how they are to live. I’d like to tell you that I’d like people to go on holidays using a plane without having a guilty conscience. I’d like a future where people don’t have to feel guilty whenever they eat schnitzel. And for those who can’t afford, or those who don’t wish to afford it, they should be able to build a home the way they want to build without having to be pressured into a moral corner of some sort.
When you make one political field absolute and subordinate all other political fields, that to me is an expression of a modern absolutism which in Germany we have been wanting to cast off for centuries. And I, ladies and gentlemen, will not accept that such times transform into green and becomes socially acceptable.”
Hocker has let the cat out of the bag in Lower Saxony politics. He really gets to the heart of what this is all about – fundamental human rights, and people getting tired of being regulated to death and deceived.
Now he has to expect immediate retaliation of the most vicious sort. Expect an orchestrated campaign labeling him a denier, a dangerous populist, or heretic. I hope he’s prepared for it.
I really do hope he keeps it up and that others find the courage to follow. Three cheers for Gero.
There’s never anything wrong with demanding an open discussion – especially science.

Share this...FacebookTwitterIt’s not a secret that scientists and politicians have been deeply disappointed by the spectacular failure of climate models. 98% of the long-term climate models failed to project the 16-year warming stop, all having overstated the warming.
So maybe it should not come as surprise that recently the German government quietly put out a bulletin describing a midterm climate forecasting system that is raising some eyebrows.

(Caption translation at end of post).
The first 4 pages of the bulletin discuss and extol the then-upcoming IPCC AR5. Pages 5 – 7 then describe three projects that aim to answer some open climate questions.
Project MiKlip first result shows cooling North Atlantic 
The most interesting project among them is the Midterm Climate Prognoses project (MiKlip) described on Page 6 of the Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF) bulletin. Page 6 shows the above chart and poses the question: “How warm is it going to be in 10 years? Business and policy need reliable climate forecasts.”
The bulletin adds that “in business and politics there is an increasing need for reliable forecasts for climate developments in the range of years up to a decade.”
And to fulfill that midterm need the German government is funding the MiKlip 10-year forecasting system, which comprises 60 individual research projects. Excerpts from page 6:

It is mainly about computer simulations that use recorded measurement data. … The MiKlip projects have been taking place since spring 2012. The first tangible results are expected to be available in September 2014. … Compared to the long-term scenarios, the results should be more exact. … The model will not deliver a forecast such as the weather at a specific location in a few years. Instead it looks more at the probable mean temperature in Europe in a certain month.”

The above chart on page 6 is a plot of North Atlantic temperature anomaly with respect to the 1971-2000. The chart comes from the Max Planck Institute for Meteorology. The caption reads:

Test forecast with the first MiKlip forecast system. The figure shows the anomaly of the sea surface temperature from the mean in the North Atlantic with the observed data shown in black from 1990 to 2011. White and orange show the test forecast beginning in 2012. Multiple decadal simulations are conducted for forecast in order to take the uncertainty of the initial conditions into account. The mean of the simulations is depicted by the white curve. The confidence intervals of the forecast (%) are shown in orange.”

Again we have to stress that this is only a “test forecast” with the first MiKlip system. But even so, the preliminary result is interesting in that it points to a serious drop in North Atlantic sea surface temperatures, which of course would have major global climate repercussions, especially in combination with a negative PDO and low solar activity.
So why are we being told that warming is continuing unabated when clearly it is not, and is not expected to for another 10 years at least?
And why is the German government funding the MiKlip models to start with? Is it because the 100-year climate models have been such a huge failure? Obviously they have been. And if the 100-year climate models failed spectacularly for even the first 10 or 20 years, then how can they be regarded as reliable for longer terms?
MiKlip is an important step back towards responsible and serious climate modeling and a sign that governments are finally abandoning the failed long-term models, having recognized that over the mid-term they are grotesquely flawed and have been terribly misleading, e.g. see here.
MiKlip is a nice step away from the dubious 100-year climate fortune-telling (which is naively, simplistically and solely based on the concentration of a single trace gas) and a real step back towards sound science. We are very much looking ahead to the first results.

"Bruised and still shaken, Janet Barker is incredulous at the violent reaction of the Foreign Office minister Mark Field to her peaceful protest with fellow Greenpeace activists at the chancellor’s Mansion House speech. However, she has no plans to press criminal charges over the physical assault. “I think it is something best dealt with in the court of opinion,” she said, while welcoming his suspension as a minister. Barker said she had been trying to deliver leaflets to guests on Thursday evening when she was grabbed by the neck and arm and forcibly ejected by Field, despite her pleas for him to release his grip and allow her to walk from the dining hall. It makes me wonder what else might trigger him off, and who else might be at the receiving end “I remember a chair being pushed out. Then being shoved. I was saying, over and over: ‘This is a peaceful protest, a peaceful protest.’ I was saying it quite audibly, certainly loud enough.” She could not see the man’s face, and had no idea who he was: “I just knew it was a guy. And that he was very, very angry. You could hear that in the tone of his voice. “I knew he wanted me out,” said Barker, 40, who was carrying a phone and a small handbag. “ I thought if I just keep saying ‘peaceful protest, peaceful protest’ you hope to defuse the situation. But there was no defusing in his anger. “He continued to grip me by the neck and the arm all the way to the door of the building. Then, when we got to the door, he shoved me outside on to the street, and said: ‘This is what happens when people like you disturb our dinner.’” Here is Janet Barker saying Mark Field MP needs to to an anger management course pic.twitter.com/Bjm7L0SAh6 Barker, from Builth Wells, Powys, has been a Greenpeace volunteer for many years and had entered the dinner with 20-30 activists who were hoping to deliver a speech about the climate crisis. Predominantly women, they wore red dresses with sashes stating: “Climate emergency”. “We wanted to enter in a very dignified way,” Barker said. “We were respectful. We even ensured that our dresses were the correct length, because women who attend the Mansion House have to have a specific length.”  They entered as “a block of red”, said Barker, who works in environmental education and homelessness prevention, and runs a small holding and ethical angora business. “The doors were open as we were going in, and when security staff clocked what was happening they did start to close the doors.” Each had their roles, and hers was to deliver copies of the climate emergency speech to guests in the form of sealed letters. The only thing I was armed with was peer-reviewed science Barker, whose Greenpeace activism has included joining a protest against dams on the Tapajós River in the Brazilian Amazon in support of the Munduruku people, said she believed she was one of the last to get in. She was to walk to the right of the room with several others, but they had been locked out. Other protesters, walking to the left of the room, were being detained by security staff, so she found herself alone. She thought if she walked around the back of the diners, she could hand a copy of the speech to Philip Hammond. “Nobody bothered me. It was fine.” She estimates she was about 10 metres from Hammond, just approaching the right-hand corner of the top table. “Then a gentleman in front pushed his seat out and just grabbed me.” Asked if she was carrying or doing anything that could possibly have indicated she might be armed and threatening, she said: “I had a phone, and a tiny handbag, which was open and full of leaflets. The only thing I was armed with was peer-reviewed science.” She made no sudden movements, she said. “I was walking past him just like a waitress or waiter would.” Field refused to relinquish his grip, she said. “I kept saying: “Look, just let go. I will walk on my own. I am not about to start a wrestling match with you. I will walk.’ He said: ‘I’m not letting go until you are out of this building.’” She said no one came to her defence. “I think people were taken aback, like ‘What?’” Protest is a legitimate part of our democracy. It helps us evolve She said Field’s anger shocked her; it was palpable in his voice and grip. “The pressure on my neck never eased all the way down the stairs and until we were outside.” The inside of the top of her right arm was still red on Friday morning. Once at the door, he shoved her with such force, she said, she struggled not to fall over. A woman, also at the door, told her: “You’re not welcome here.” Once outside, Barker realised she was trembling. “I think he needs to seriously look at why he reacted like that, why his anger went from 0-60 in 0.2 seconds. He needs anger management. Because I worry maybe he’s on a bit of a simmer all the time, that just one or two things might tip him over, especially for him to be like that towards a woman. It makes me wonder what else might trigger him off, and who else might be at the receiving end,” she said. “I want him to think about what he did, and why he did it. And address his behaviour.” Barker said she had anticipated verbal resistance. “We thought we might be ushered out, politely.” Looking back on the incident, she said it was the authoritarianism that angered her. “That’s what I felt. He was very domineering. He seemed to think he was in the right. “Those in power are very privileged. They are very disconnected with the everyday struggles of everybody else. And I really felt that was apparent in his behaviour. They are in power. They believe they are right, and I was a silly little girl. “I still find is unbelievable. We are in a climate emergency. Fossil fuels, the Greenland ice sheet is melting, the Himalayan ice caps are melting, there’s going to be massive water shortages in the future and they are worried about their dinner being disturbed. “I think we should remember that protest is a legitimate part of our democracy. It helps us evolve. Good things come from it. Look at the suffragettes, India democracy and Gandhi, the Black Power movement. “And behaviour like this is trying to crush it, and we will keep rising up, because we have got to.”"

Share this...FacebookTwitterWhat would George Clooney have against brutally throttling the plentiful supply of affordable fossil fuel energy that billions of people living on the planet rely on? Nothing, he recently said.

George Clooney puts on an Oscar-winning green act. And an act is all it is. Hollywood actor has a mammoth carbon foot print. Photo: Nicolas Genin, licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 2.0 Generic license.
“All you’d be doing is cleaning up the planet a bit,” the actor said in a recent interview. Who cares if the poor have to go without it – so long he has more than enough to taxi between his two multi-million dollar mansions in California and Italy.
How green is Clooney really?
Expensive mansions in Italy and California
According to celebritynetworth.com, Clooney owns an 18th century mansion in Laglio, northern Italy. The “house” overlooks Italy’s famed Lake Como and “boasts 25 grand rooms” and has “magnificent decorated ceilings”. The house contains an outdoor theater, a large swimming pool and a garage for Clooney’s assortment of motorcycles and scooters.
According to Bornrich, Clooney’s net worth is estimated at $160 million
The Hollywood actor also owns a 7354 square-foot home in Los Angeles which he bought in 1995 from “Stevie Nicks” for $2.2 million. Today the home is surely valued much higher. The LA home features “comfy and well cleaned spacious rooms with brilliant light systems” and includes “a well equipped bar and a modern kitchen fully equipped with up to date appliances including custom cabinetry, oven and stainless steel fridge with George’s favorite salads and juices”. Outside the home has a basketball court and tennis court.
“Almost always flies via private jet…despite his claimed environmentalism”

Do you think Clooney commutes between his LA and Italian villas on a regular commercial jet, maybe even in economy class from time to time? No way, not for him. And what is not good enough for Clooney in air travel is much too much for the regular folks. Regular folks are supposed to forgo flying in order to save the planet. According to this site here: “George almost always flies via private jet…most of the time nowadays Clooney flies by private jet despite his claimed environmentalism as anyone who follows him knows.”
Clooney has the “ultimate solution to the world’s energy problems”
Clooney owns a variety of vehicles, such as a 1958 Chevrolet Corvette V8 C1 convertible. He even lined the seats with high end leather. And in addition to expensive Italian scooters and classic motorcycles, Clooney also sports around in a Tango 600, which features “a unique battery-powered car design with dimensions measuring 39 inches wide and 102 inches long and offers an ultimate solution to the world’s environmental and energy problems”. Gee, now why hasn’t the “ultimate solution” been mass-produced in the hundreds of millions for the rest of the world’s regular drivers? Clearly neither the clueless Clooney nor the Clooney-ass-kissing Bornrich writer have an idea what’s involved in manufacturing the”ultimate solution” for the world’s energy problem. They likely don’t even know where the power to charge the batteries comes from.
Clooney also owns a 2008 limited edition Signature 100 model Tesla Roadster – er, well, he used to. Apparently it was auctioned to support a Sudan Charity. What the heck, the car only had 1,700 miles on the odometer anyway. Driving green wasn’t much fun after all.
Jet-pit-stop in LA on the way to Europe – to dine with friends
So where does Clooney spend his vacations? Do you think he vacations locally, you know, to help save the planet? Well, that’s the little people, and not for Hollywood sex-gods like Clooney. Bornrich reports how he jets to places like the French Riviera with his green pals, like U2’s Bono or super model Cindy Crawford. There they spend much time “jet skiing and chilling out in sun on a yacht.”
While in Europe, Clooney and his girlfriend Stacy Keibler might be “spotted boarding a boat with some other close friends in Lake Como” or visiting George’s Italian mansion – before jetting off across the Atlantic to “relax in the Mexican sun”. And before jetting back to Europe together, “they stopped in LA and dined out with his best pals. Reportedly, Jennifer Aniston also managed to link up with pal George Clooney recently while off on her European vacation”.
Burning all that jet fuel.
Acting all concerned about the climate and saving the planet, you’d think Green George would cut back a bit. Not chance. Clooney’s green act truly deserves an Oscar. In reality he is just a jumbo-sized eco-hypocrite.

"It may prove to be incredibly difficult, but we must rethink our short-termist priorities if we intend to make good on our promises to those striking for the future (Our lives must be transformed to defeat this climate crisis, 15 June). Like your columnist, Susanna Rustin, I want us to break out of the short-term, four-year election inertia and reimagine our approach to policymaking via the prism of acting for tomorrow, today. This week, I led a parliamentary debate about how to protect and represent the interests of future generations, where I called on the government to look at how the Well-being of Future Generations (Wales) Act 2015 has shaken up “business as usual” by requiring public bodies in Wales to think about the long-term impact of their decisions and how best they can prevent persistent problems, including climate change, from happening.  Ideas on how to repair our democracy, and with it the climate, are out there. Why couldn’t we replicate the role of a future generations commissioner for Wales in England, or in other UK regions? Why couldn’t parliament establish its own Committee for the Future, like Finland, to scrutinise policy and challenge ministerial short-termism? Why couldn’t every policy have to pass a future generations benchmark? Why couldn’t public bodies be required to scan the horizon to pre-empt problems coming down the track? And isn’t it time to get serious about preventive spending and require HM Treasury to define, measure and increase it? What we do over the next decade will determine the future of humanity for the next 10,000 years. And if we don’t want to be remembered as the generation that fiddled while Rome burned, we need to be brave, bold and ambitious in future-proofing our decision-making processes. After all, the best way to predict the future is to create it.John BirdCrossbencher, House of Lords  • Join the debate – email guardian.letters@theguardian.com • Read more Guardian letters – click here to visit gu.com/letters • Do you have a photo you’d like to share with Guardian readers?

"Permafrost at outposts in the Canadian Arctic is thawing 70 years earlier than predicted, an expedition has discovered, in the latest sign that the global climate crisis is accelerating even faster than scientists had feared. A team from the University of Alaska Fairbanks said they were astounded by how quickly a succession of unusually hot summers had destabilised the upper layers of giant subterranean ice blocks that had been frozen solid for millennia. “What we saw was amazing,” Vladimir Romanovsky, a professor of geophysics at the university, told Reuters. “It’s an indication that the climate is now warmer than at any time in the last 5,000 or more years.“ With governments meeting in Bonn this week to try to ratchet up ambitions in United Nations climate negotiations, the team’s findings, published on 10 June in Geophysical Research Letters, offered a further sign of a growing climate emergency. The paper was based on data Romanovsky and his colleagues had been analysing since their last expedition to the area in 2016. The team used a modified propeller plane to visit exceptionally remote sites, including an abandoned cold war-era radar base more than 300km from the nearest human settlement. Diving through a lucky break in the clouds, Romanovsky and his colleagues said they were confronted with a landscape that was unrecognisable from the pristine Arctic terrain they had encountered during initial visits a decade or so earlier. The vista had dissolved into an undulating sea of hummocks – waist-high depressions and ponds known as thermokarst. Vegetation, once sparse, had begun to flourish in the shelter provided from the constant wind. Torn between professional excitement and foreboding, Romanovsky said the scene had reminded him of the aftermath of a bombardment. “It’s a canary in the coalmine,” said Louise Farquharson, a postdoctoral researcher and co-author of the study. “It’s very likely that this phenomenon is affecting a much more extensive region and that’s what we’re going to look at next.“ Scientists are concerned about the stability of permafrost because of the risk that rapid thawing could release vast quantities of heat-trapping gases, unleashing a feedback loop that would in turn fuel even faster temperature rises. Even if current commitments to cut emissions under the 2015 Paris agreement are implemented, the world is still far from averting the risk that these kinds of feedback loops will trigger runaway warming, according to models used by the UN-backed Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. With scientists warning that sharply higher temperatures would devastate the global south and threaten the viability of industrial civilisation in the northern hemisphere, campaigners said the new paper reinforced the imperative to cut emissions. “Thawing permafrost is one of the tipping points for climate breakdown and it’s happening before our very eyes,” said Jennifer Morgan, executive director of Greenpeace International. “This premature thawing is another clear signal that we must decarbonise our economies, and immediately.”"

"Australia is at a crossroads. Drift towards a future of slow decline economically and socially or, if action is taken now to address our most important challenges, create a future of greater prosperity for all, globally competitive industries and a sustainable environment. That is the conclusion of a major report bringing together the thinking of more than 50 leaders in business, academia, NGOs and the community sector, working with the CSIRO to model alternative futures for Australia. The report is described as a “clarion call” for the nation. The Australian National Outlook 2019, two years in the making, aims to “help kickstart a national conversation about where Australia is heading”, says its co-chair, Dr Ken Henry, the chairman of the National Australia Bank and former secretary of the Treasury department. Participants met as a group with the nation’s leading science agency, the CSIRO, to identify the most critical long-term challenges facing Australia and what needed to change. They included senior leaders from Shell Australia, the Red Cross, McKinsey & Company, Australia Post, PwC, the Cochlear company, the Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics and Sciences, the Grattan Institute, major universities, the Wentworth Group of Concerned Scientists and UnitingCare Australia. Individuals included the former New South Wales premier Nick Greiner, former chairman of the Australian competition and consumer commission Allan Fels and co-chair of the report, the CSIRO’s chairman, David Thodey. The report concludes that while Australia has enjoyed almost three decades of economic growth, with enviable social cohesion and strong institutions, it risks “drifting into the future” if it fails to respond to challenges in a fast-changing world. Those identified are the rise of Asia, rapid technological change, climate change and the environment, changing demographics, declining trust in institutions and business and strains on social cohesion. To deal with them and reach its potential by 2060, Australia must make “key shifts” in five areas: an industrial shift, an urban shift, an energy shift, a land shift and a culture shift. The director of CSIRO Futures, James Deverell, led the project and said the sense of urgency came from the participants, who gathered for eight workshops, beginning with around 100 priorities for Australia before identifying the most crucial. “There was this strong sense that we need to take action now,” Deverell said. “The group sees this as a clarion call, a call to arms for action. “When you look at the shifts, there’s a couple of things in common. One is the need to focus on the long term, that these shifts are going to play out over a generation or more, but that doesn’t mean we can kick the can down the road and ignore them. The other one is the need for strong leadership, for bold action.” The report references the 1980s, when strong productivity growth was driven by a consensus on economic reform supported by both major parties, big business and unions. The report does not give specific policy recommendations but suggests the “levers” the country needs to pull to get the best outcomes. One of its strongest conclusions is that there is no tradeoff between strong economic growth and transitioning to zero-emission renewable energy, an argument that has crippled political debate in Australia for more than a decade. In both scenarios modelled by the CSIRO – slow decline or what the report calls outlook vision – almost all electricity is generated by renewables by 2060 due to drops in the cost of renewables and the decline in the demand for fossil fuels. The global disruption in the energy market is underway, so whether the Australian government encourages new coal-fired power stations or not, renewables will be cheaper and replace them. In Australia, most of the transition will happen between 2020 and 2040 as ageing coal-fired power plants are retired and replaced with renewables. “We’ve seen costs come down so much in solar and wind they are now the low-cost solution,” Deverell said. “Once you hit a certain level of renewables on the grid you need to add storage to the cost, but that’s factored into our modelling and we see the cost of storage coming down over time.” Deverell said even if Australia continued its policy uncertainty around energy and environment policy, we would still get to almost 100% renewable energy by 2060 purely because of the market. But the warning to politicians and policy makers is that “the transition happens more slowly and ultimately it makes electricity prices higher”. Thodey argues in the report that if Australia pulls the right levers, “it is possible to achieve higher GDP per capita (as much as 36%) while ensuring growth is inclusive and environmentally sustainable”. “In a global context, strong cooperation on climate change and trade can deliver a better outcome for Australia without significantly impacting our economic growth, where before it may have been thought impossible.” Domestically, the report says that whatever happens in the rest of the world, Australia can make big strides to reduce our emissions through improving energy productivity, which means using less energy for the same outcome. Australia was weak compared with best practice internationally because it was not using the best technology available. It had the potential to become one of the most productive users of energy in the world through energy efficiency and electrification. Electric vehicles, for instance, are expected to be the cheapest form of transport after 2025 and would dominate sales by 2040. Australia needs to prepare to adapt to global conditions whatever they are, but the biggest benefits will come if the world takes concerted action on climate change to limit global warming to a maximum 2C by 2100 rather than the catastrophic 4C rise if little action is taken. If there is cooperative global action on climate change, Australia stands to be a big winner, the report finds. The CSIRO modelling indicates that “lower emissions from energy and greater sequestration on the land could enable Australia to achieve ‘net zero’ emissions by 2050 under the outlook vision”. Australia could capitalise on low-carbon exports such as hydrogen produced by renewable energy, countering the decline in global demand for our fossil fuels exports. “Although other countries are also pursuing energy productivity and renewables, modelling suggests that Australia’s vast natural resources for renewable generation should lead to lower cost electricity in 2060,” the report says. With reliable, low-carbon electricity and investor confidence in long-term policy, along with rising wages and improved energy efficiency, “by 2060 Australians are spending between 58% and 64% less on electricity as a proportion of income than they are today”. Even if the world balks at strong action on climate change, Australia does better economically if it if embraces energy efficiency to reduce emissions. The report’s proposed land shift would see a “stretch goal” of increasing agricultural productivity to 3% per year, meaning intensifying agriculture on the best land, using emerging technologies and boosting research and development. For instance, increasing productivity could result in revenue for crops such as winter cereals doubling by 2060. Agriculture in Australia had not yet fully embraced the “digital revolution” and doing so would be a boon. Strong global action on global warming would present opportunities for land owners to sequester carbon through carbon and environmental planting, a “significant land use shift” that would protect prime agricultural land for food. As much as half of the least productive agricultural land could be profitably switched to carbon plantings, which would offset Australia’s own greenhouse gas emissions. Additional emissions abatement could be sold as carbon credits to other countries. “Australia has one of world’s best and largest solar resources and we can capture that and export low emissions energy to countries that don’t have that resource, to places like Japan, Korea and potentially even China,” Deverell said. Overall, the report says that “Australia is not well prepared and that action is required to avoid the slow decline scenario”. That scenario is not a disaster, but is far less positive than it could be. CSIRO modelling found GDP growth would be 2.1% annually, real wage growth would be 40% higher in 2060 than it is now and there would be only a modest increase in energy productivity. Major cities would continue to sprawl, adding to stressful commutes and long distances to education and services. It is possible to achieve higher GDP per capita (as much as 36%) while ensuring growth is inclusive and environmentally sustainable. With bold action, the modelling found a far more prosperous and dynamic Australia, with GDP growth of 2.76% to 2.8% annually, real wages 90% higher, average density of major cities increasing 60% to 88%, only a 6% to 28% increase in total energy use, a more than doubling of energy productivity, and net zero emissions by 2050 with global cooperation. “This decoupling of emissions from GDP demonstrate that stronger action on environmental measures need not come at the expense of economic outcomes.” Deverell said the report wasn’t intended as a list of policy recommendations or predictions for the future, but a chance to “get together a group of senior leaders, public sector, private sector, NGOs, (to) have an informed consensus on where we need to go”. While trust and social cohesion were difficult to model, they were crucial for Australia’s future, he said. Trust in governments and CEOs was low, which meant Australians had little faith that decisions were made in the long-term interest of all. Without that trust, bold decisions were more difficult. There was no “silver bullet” to restore trust, but efforts were needed to address policy over-promising, the perceived unrepresentative nature of politicians who came from narrow backgrounds and the perception that politicians favour vested interests over the public interest. The report also emphasised equity. “We didn’t just want this to come through as a ‘here’s what we need to do to grow our economy’, but ‘here’s what we need to do to grow our economy and increase living standards for all Australians’.” In the industry shift, the report says productivity can be boosted with increased adoption of technology, greater investment in education and skills to ensure a globally competitive workforce, and reversing the decline in education in key areas such as maths and science. In both the slow decline and outlook vision scenarios, the report accepts official estimates that Australia’s population will reach 41 million by 2060, with Sydney and Melbourne home to between 8 million and 9 million people, and Brisbane and Perth between 4 million and 5 million. The slow decline model shows millions more living in the outer suburbs, making it harder to travel to jobs, education and services. Housing affordability remains a major problem, and social cohesion is strained. The urban shift requires a big change in the way planning and policy supports our cities, with a growth in medium and high density living, and a focus on multiple “centres” of growth apart from the CBD, a policy that Sydney and Melbourne are already embracing. Well-designed apartments, semi-detached homes and townhouses make up just over half of the housing stock, with a mix of reasonably priced accommodation so that essential workers can afford homes. People live closer to jobs, to education and to services and recreation. Car use is down, mass transit is up and electric vehicles make up over 80% of new vehicle sales in 2060. An alternative model outlined is one in which satellites cities such as Geelong and Newcastle grow quickly, and 5 million more people choose to live outside the capital cities, easing the density in the capitals. It is the second Outlook report, following a 2015 release that focused more narrowly on water, energy and food. The 2019 report is more ambitious and brings in outside leaders to identify Australia’s key challenges and opportunities. Deverell said it was aimed first at senior decision makers in the public and private sector, as well as NGOs and community groups. But it was “a message to all Australians that we can take control of the kind of future we want for the country”. “By using those two scenarios we were trying to illustrate just how different the future is depending on the path that we take. We’re saying that Australians need to get together and these are the things we need to be focusing on. This is what’s really important.”"
"A citizens’ assembly on the climate emergency will take place this autumn to explore the fastest and fairest ways to end the UK’s carbon emissions. Six House of Commons select committees announced the assembly on Thursday. It is the second of the three demands made by the Extinction Rebellion protest group to be addressed.  However, the group have criticised the initiative as it wants the assembly’s decisions to be binding, not advisory. Parliament declared a climate emergency in May, but the third Extinction Rebellion demand – action to cut emissions to net zero by 2025 – has not been met. Theresa May followed official advice and set 2050 as the date for the end of greenhouse gas emissions earlier in June, making the UK the first major economy to do so. A citizens’ assembly is a representative group of members of the public who come together to learn about and debate issues, and come to conclusions on the best solutions. Parliament has had such assemblies before, for example to assess social care. The climate assembly will take place over a series of weekends in the autumn but the people and locations are yet to be determined. “This isn’t a challenge for just one parliament, one political party, or one generation; to achieve net zero by 2050 we need to build cross-party and cross-generational support for the actions needed to deliver it,” said Rachel Reeves MP, chair of the business, energy and industrial strategy (BEIS) committee. She said there needed to be both strong government action and buy-in from the public for the environmental, health and employment benefits that achieving zero emissions could bring to be realised. “I hope the citizens’ assembly will demonstrate that, when all is considered, there is strong public support – even demand – for the government to take the action necessary,” she said. Greg Clark MP, the secretary of state responsible for climate action, welcomed the citizens’ assembly. “Initiatives to engage the public will be vitally important to appreciating the challenges of getting to net zero and giving people a say in shaping the future policies to achieve the target,” he said. But Roger Hallam, from Extinction Rebellion, said: “We have a citizens’ assembly that will give recommendations. Everyone knows what that means, which is it will come out with some ideas and get ignored, like people have been ignored for the last 30 years.” “If you are going to do a citizens’ assembly it has to have teeth and be legally binding,” he said. “We are facing a dire existential emergency. It’s what the UN is saying, what scientists are saying – the only people who haven’t taken it on board are politicians around the world.” Cutting emissions to zero will require the further introduction of renewable energy and electric cars, the end of gas heating and cooking in homes, restrained flying and meat-eating and the planting of 1.5bn trees to absorb any remaining carbon dioxide. But measures such as a diesel tax in France have been seen as unfair. Extinction Rebellion mounted large-scale protests in April and young people inspired by the teenage Swedish activist Greta Thunberg have put further pressure on politicians to act rapidly. The government has already announced that young people will advise ministers on how the UK should meet the net zero target. Extinction Rebellion is also protesting in the Scottish parliament on Thursday to demand a citizens’ assembly. Areeba Hamid, at Greenpeace UK, said: “The citizens’ assembly shows our politicians are starting to take this major existential threat a bit more seriously, but for it to work, it needs to be more than just a glorified public consultation. Will ministers be forced to take its conclusions into account or will they be able to brush them aside as they have done with countless consultations before? The solutions to tackle the climate emergency have been around for decades – what’s been lacking is the political will to make it happen.” The House of Commons select committees organising the citizens assembly are BEIS, environmental audit, housing, communities and local government, science and technology, transport and treasury.

His piece is predictably titled, “Tropical Storms Are Getting Worse“. What is remarkable in the piece is that he singles out the non-alarmist skeptics who resist climate protection measures and asks them how they are still able to sleep quietly at night.
It’s an emotional outburst.
First his introduction reads as follows:
Tropical storm Haiyan was probably the most powerful recorded that ever struck land since records began. For this reason there have again been many inquiries about the impact of climate change on tropical storms. Here I summarize briefly the following: (1) The most powerful storms have become more frequent in the last deacdes, (2) Models show a further strengthening is expected for the future, and (3) warmer water and sea level rise will worsen the consequences like downpours and storm surges.”
And in typical Rahmstorfian fashion, he proceeds to build his case by selecting only the studies that support his doomsday narrative, and ignores a huge body of science that contradict his claims…SOP.
What I found remarkable was his concluding paragraph at the very end, which is much harsher and provocative than normal, and I think it deserves to be translated in English:
Regrettably those who diminish and downplay climate change are already on the prowl. At the popular ‘climate-skeptic’ website Watts Up With That Haiyan is kind of dismissed as just ‘another over-hyped storm’. Even if the chances that our greenhouse gas emissions worsen such catastrophes are only 50:50, how quietly can those who with all their might resist climate protection measures, and in view of the pictures coming out of the Philippines, still sleep at night?”
Here Rahmstorf blames skeptics in part for the storm disaster in the Philippines. This guy is a scientist?

"A starving polar bear has strayed hundreds of kilometres from its natural Arctic habitat and wandered, exhausted, into the major Russian industrial city of Norilsk in northern Siberia. The female bear, visibly weak and seemingly ill, lay despondently on the ground for hours on Tuesday in Norilsk’s suburbs, its feet caked in mud, occasionally rising to sniff around for food. It is the first polar bear seen in the city in more than 40 years, according to local environmentalists. “She is still moving around a factory, under observation by police and the emergency services, who are ensuring her safety and those of residents,” environmental services official Alexander Korobkin told AFP. The bear was first spotted on Sunday evening in an industrial area north-east of central Norilsk, Korobkin said. A team of specialists are set to arrive Wednesday to inspect the animal and decide its fate. Oleg Krashevsky, a local wildlife expert who filmed the polar bear close up, said it was unclear what had brought the animal to the city, although it was possible it had simply got lost. He said it had watery eyes and could clearly not see well. The climate crisis has been damaging polar bears’ sea-ice habitats and forced them to scavenge more for food on land, bringing them into contact with people and inhabited areas. A state of emergency was declared in a remote inhabited area of northern Russian earlier this year when dozens of hungry polar bears were seen scavenging for food and entering public buildings and homes. State wildlife experts are expected to arrive in Norilsk on Wednesday to assess the bear’s condition. Local residents in the city known for nickel production came out to photograph the bear and look at it as police prevented them from getting too close.

"Defending against rising seas could cost US communities $416bn in the next 20 years, according to a new report. Spending on seawalls alone could total almost as much as the initial investment in the interstate highway system, the authors said. And the billions involved will represent just a fraction of adaptation efforts governments in coastal states will have to fund if they do not want to simply retreat. “I don’t think anybody’s thought about the magnitude of this one small portion of overall adaptation costs and it’s a huge number,” said Richard Wiles, executive director of the Center for Climate Integrity (CCI), which published the report. Estimates of how much sea-level rise will cost often focus on impacts by 2100, Wiles said, adding that people will be paying for the climate crisis much earlier. “You’re looking at close to half a trillion spent over the next 20 years and no one has thought about that. So the question is, who’s going to pay for that? Is it really going to be taxpayers? The current position of climate polluters is that they should pay nothing, and that’s just not tenable.” According to the report, Florida faces the highest costs, $76bn by 2040. Louisiana comes in second at $38bn and North Carolina third at $35bn. For cities, Jacksonville, Florida, New York and Virginia Beach could spend the most: $3.5bn, $2bn and $1.7bn, respectively. Many places are starting to pay such bills. Staten Island in New York, for example, is planning a $615m, five-mile seawall to withstand a 300-year storm. The federal government will pay $400m. As the planet heats up and land-based ice melts, the average global sea level has risen seven or eight inches since 1900, with about 3in of that rise occurring since 1993, according to a US government report. Seas could be up to 3ft higher by 2100 under the scenario examined by the CCI. The CCI published the report with analysis by lead scientist Paul Chinowksy, director of the environmental design program at the University of Colorado Boulder and chief executive of the firm Resilient Analytics. The cost figures in the CCI report are based on localized projections for sea-level rise under the UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) scenario for moderate levels of pollution. In that scenario, called RCP 4.5, emissions would peak around 2040 and then begin to decline. The projections in the report were calculated by the climate science and news organization Climate Central. The CCI report considered how much communities in the contiguous US would pay locally to build sea walls to protect against the storm surge expected in a given year, Wiles said, although many would spend more to build even stronger defenses. Other communities might vanish rather than pay for new infrastructure. If so their governments could then be vulnerable to lawsuits from residents, Wiles argued. Some communities examined would have to spend $1m a person on needed defenses, the assessment found. For example, Fire Island, a barrier island off the mainland of Long Island in New York, would face $1.5bn in investment to protect a few hundred ocean-front homes. The group studied thousands of miles of coastline to determine where roads might be submerged. Researchers estimated the cost of defending vulnerable infrastructure within portions of shoreline that could be at least 15% underwater by 2040."

In this week’s Saturday Summary, meteorologist Joe Bastardi takes a look at the Arctic situation, among other interesting stuff.

WeatherBELL’s Saturday Summary calls 2013 North Pole “the coldest ever recorded”.
Unlike last year, this year we’ll be hearing next to nothing about Arctic sea ice in the media. In fact the most recent NOAA report about the Arctic was about 2012! That’s how desperate they are.
In the Saturday Summary, Joe says at the 3:05 mark (my emphasis):
Speaking of cool, North Pole temperatures have fallen below freezing way in advance of where they normally do this year. This is the coldest summer ever recorded by the Danish Meteorological Institute; they started looking back at this in the 1950s. At the North Pole there’s only one or two days that actually reached normal and some of this propaganda that’s going on now – look I’m going to have to show you and debunk that whole situation.”

"Global heating could bring many more bouts of severe drought as well as increased flooding to Africa than previously forecast, scientists have warned. New research says the continent will experience many extreme outbreaks of intense rainfall over the next 80 years. These could trigger devastating floods, storms and disruption of farming. In addition, these events are likely to be interspersed with more crippling droughts during the growing season and these could also damage crop and food production.  “Essentially we have found that both ends of Africa’s weather extremes will get more severe,” said Elizabeth Kendon of the Met Office’s Hadley Centre in Exeter. “The wet extreme will get worse, but also the appearance of dry spells during the growing season will also get more severe.” This meteorological double whammy is blamed on the burning of fossil fuels, which is increasing levels of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere and causing it to heat up. Last month levels of carbon dioxide reached 415 parts per million, their highest level since Homo sapiens first appeared on Earth – and scientists warn that they are likely to continue on this upward curve for several decades. Global temperatures will be raised dangerously as a result. The new meteorology study – carried out by scientists at the Met Office in collaboration with researchers at the Institute of Climate and Atmospheric Science at Leeds University – reports on the likely impact on Africa of these temperature rises and indicates that western and central areas will suffer the worst impacts of weather disruptions. Many countries in these regions – including Niger, Nigeria and the Democratic Republic of Congo – are expected to experience substantial growth in population over that time and will be particularly vulnerable to severe floods. At the other end of the precipitation spectrum, the study revealed there would be an increase in occasions when severe drought would occur for up to 10 days in the midst of the most critical part of a region’s growing season. The result could cause severe disruption to crop production. “We have been able to model – in much finer detail than was previously possible – the manner in which rainfall patterns will change over Africa,” said Kendon. In the past it was thought intense rainfalls would occur in a region every 30 years. The new study, funded by UK foreign aid, indicates this is more likely to happen every three or four years. An example of such flooding occurred two weeks ago when it was reported that eight people had died south of Kampala in Uganda after torrential rain hit the region. Similarly, at least 15 people were reported to have died during floods in Kenya last year. Thousands lost their homes. “Our research suggests that extreme bouts of rainfall are likely to be seven or eight times more frequent than they are today,” said Kendon. The new research, which is published in the scientific journal Nature Communications, is based on forecasts of rainfall in Africa that were achieved by analysing weather patterns in great detail. “Africa is one of the parts of the planet that is going to be most vulnerable to climate change,” said Kendon. “Our study of rainfall patterns shows there are going to be some very severe problems to face food security and dealing with droughts.”"

Share this...FacebookTwitterLately we’ve been seeing and hearing lots media reports of cooling and cold weather extremes. Global temperature data, such as HadCrut 4, show warming has disappeared altogether.

Global temperatures have fallen over the last 8 years. Source: www.woodfortrees.org/.
Looking at the data for the last decade or so, one thing stands clear: Global temperatures have been showing many more signs of cooling than warming. Already we are sensing that global temperature has lost the battle to stay up. The HadCrut data series above shows that cooling has gained the upper hand. Indeed warming is now in the history books, having died some 15 years ago.
Forget the missing heat – the real story is the present cooling.
And a number of media outlets have kept up with this inconvenient development. Numerous reports have appeared lately, and they ought to serve as a wake-up call to policymakers who have long been heavily intoxicated with the fantasy of a run-away warming planet.
There is a growing number of undeniable signs showing the planet is cooling:
– The Arctic has seen a 60% gain in sea ice, the highest late summertime level since 2006. In fact, there hasn’t been any warming in the Arctic in 8 years. The North Pole region has long been touted as the canary in the coal mine. Nowhere were temperatures supposed to rise faster than in the Artic. The fact that the Arctic is now cooling should be telling us something.
– At the other end of the earth, Antarctic sea ice has been above normal for more than 700 consecutive days and this year it has been setting dozens of record highs for sea ice extent. With about another week left before the season peaks, the South Pole is poised to set an all time record high since satellite measurements began.

– Central Europe has seen 5 consecutive colder-than-normal winters – a record. Worse, early forecasts for the 2013/14 winter show we may be looking at a spectacular 6 colder-than-normal winters in a row.
– The online UK Express reports here that the globe is cooling, and so does the UK flagship newspaper Daily Mail in a detailed piece well worth reading.
– The UK Telegraph also recently reported on a cooling planet, quoting climate scientist Professor Anastasios Tsonis of the University of Wisconsin: “We are already in a cooling trend, which I think will continue for the next 15 years at least. There is no doubt the warming of the 1980s and 1990s has stopped.”
– Finally, reader Ed Hoskins has been charting CET temperature data from the UK Met Office: “The overall annual temperature shows a diminution of pretty much a full degree Celsius over the last 13 years.” Here’s the chart:

CET temperatures have been plummeting over the last 13 years (fall 2013 data not included). Chart by Ed Hoskins, data source: UK Met Office.
It turns out the alarmists are correct: Global warming can no longer be denied. That’s because there is none left to deny!

Share this...FacebookTwitterThe timing for the scandal just couldn’t be worse for Germany’s third largest political party, the Greens. Only three days before Germany’s national elections, and it is now exploding out of control.
This cat is out of the bag, and it’s not about to be put back in and forgotten. The German media, once coddlers of the environmentalist Greens, are no longer holding back. The news of Germany’s Green Party earlier involvement in supporting rights of adults to have sex with kids is threatening to be the party’s worst ever scandal.
Germany’s Green Party leader regrets campaign to ‘legalise paedophilia’
The head of Germany’s Green Party has expressed regret about a two-decade-old political pamphlet containing calls to legalise some forms of pedophilia.

Jürgen Trittin was listed as “legally responsible” for a 1981 election pamphlet, which called for the decriminalisation of sex acts between adults and children “that occur without the use or threat of force.” […]

The party’s support for making paedophilia legal only ended in 1990 but the past has haunted them throughout this election campaign. […]
Daniel Cohn-Bendit, a student leader in the 1968 unrest in Paris, claimed in a 1975 book that he interacted sexually with children while working at a kindergarten. …”
