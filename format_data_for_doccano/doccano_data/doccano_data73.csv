"Fear of wasps has always seemed to me irrational, but since inadvertently standing on a wasps’ nest two weeks ago my opinion has been revised. Deep in a local wood and stopping to admire a fungus on a log pile, I was alerted by a deep buzzing to the fact that both trouser legs were filling up with wasps. Not content with stinging both legs, the workers also attacked my face and neck, as well as the dog. They were still stinging both of us when we reached the car half a mile away and followed us into the vehicle.  This alarming and painful experience led to some research. According to most literature, worker wasps are benign most of the time, but particularly aggressive when defending young queen wasps as they are about to set off on the annual mating ritual. But the same sources suggest colonies of wasps should have done all that and begun to die off by November because of cold weather and starvation. Since the incident there have been some moderate frosts, but observation of the nest, from a safer distance, shows a lot of wasps going in and out on hunting expeditions as if it is still summer. It is possible to understand how they have survived the cold weather as the nest is deep in a pile of wood and leaves, but they should have starved to death by now. This is because, as part of their complex lifestyle, wasps need to feed from their own grubs to survive. But there should not be any left by November. Perhaps climate change is lengthening their life cycle. "
"Four of the world’s biggest cities are to ban diesel vehicles from their centres within the next decade, as a means of tackling air pollution, with campaigners urging other city leaders to follow suit. The mayors of Paris, Madrid, Athens and Mexico City announced plans on Friday to take diesel cars and vans off their roads by 2025.  Anne Hidalgo, mayor of Paris, led the initiative at the C40 conference of mayors on climate change, taking place in Mexico this week. She said: “Mayors have already stood up to say that climate change is one of the greatest challenges we face. Today, we also stand up to say we no longer tolerate air pollution and the health problems and deaths it causes, particularly for our most vulnerable citizens.” “Soot from diesel vehicles is among the big contributors to ill health and global warming,” added Helena Molin Valdés, head of the United Nations’ climate and clean air coalition, noting that more than nine out of 10 people around the globe live where air pollution exceeds World Health Organisation safety limits. Miguel Ángel Mancera, mayor of Mexico City, said increasing investments in public transport would also help clean the city’s air, and reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Giorgos Kaminis, mayor of Athens, said his goal was to remove all cars from the city centre. The city authorities will also work with national governments and manufacturers, and promote electric vehicles and cleaner transport. Recent research has uncovered the scale of the problem, with 3 million premature deaths a year attributed to dirty air, as well as millions of other illnesses, particularly in children. Green campaigners welcomed the announcement, saying it showed that it was possible to clean up big cities.  Alan Andrews, lawyer at the NGO ClientEarth, whose legal victory has forced a UK government re-think of air pollution plans, said: “This shows political leaders across the world are waking up to the damage diesel is doing to our health. But 2025 is a long time away when you consider the 467,000 premature deaths caused by air pollution in Europe [alone] every year.” He called on other leaders to “go further and faster [with] bold new measures”. Jenny Bates, of Friends of the Earth, added: “This bold move to get rid of diesels, the most polluting vehicles, is exactly what is needed. We need cleaner vehicles and fewer of them. Getting rid of diesel is essential and we must also give people genuine alternatives to driving.” She also called on London’s mayor, Sadiq Khan, to phase out diesel vehicles from the city by 2025, and for new clean air zones in all of the UK’s cities and major towns, with funding taken away from roads to promote sustainable alternative transport. Diesel fuel use is a key cause of air pollution in cities, as the engines produce nitrogen dioxide, a harmful gas, and tiny particulates that can lodge in the lungs. These forms of pollution can also interact with other substances to create, in some conditions, a toxic soup. Yet diesel use has been rising in many countries, partly for economic reasons and partly as a consequence of measures to combat climate change – diesel vehicles burn fuel more efficiently than conventional petrol engines, reducing carbon dioxide emissions. It is not clear whether diesel vehicles in the four cities will be subject to a total ban, or what areas of the cities will be covered. Some cities already have measures in place intended to reduce congestion and clean up the air, such as low-emission zones that involve traffic restrictions. Last year, the Volkswagen Group was engulfed by scandal when it was discovered that some of its diesel cars contained technology to disguise the true level of their harmful emissions."
"It seemed impossibly good news for the Queensland government in its push to transform Australia’s biggest carbon-polluting state into a renewable energy powerhouse in little more than a decade. An expert advisory panel steeped in what the energy minister, Mark Bailey, described as “hard-nosed economic experience and extensive modelling” last month concluded the state could effectively have its cake and eat it in its pursuit of a greener energy sector.  Coal-fired Queensland, with just 7% of its power generation from renewables, could lift that to 50% by 2030 with little appreciable cost to electricity consumers. The government, which owns two-thirds of electricity generation, could bear the burden of subsidising renewables. Those costs would range from $50m if the feds ponied up on climate policy, including carbon pricing, to $900m if the state went hard early (and alone). The draft report by the panel, chaired by ex-Macquarie banker Colin Mugglestone, found the worst-case scenario for generators was the closure of a single coal-fired station. This was based on the observation that competition in the market from a new variety of power generators in solar and wind would put downward pressure on wholesale electricity prices. The caveat was that this pricing outcome was “not guaranteed” and could differ if more coal-fired power disappeared from the market. The panel’s conclusions have since been attacked by the Grattan Institute, which branded the claim of no price impact on customers as an “economic illusion”. The federal energy minister, Josh Frydenberg, has also sought to rain on Queensland’s parade by claiming the scheme would cost $27bn. But Bailey stands by the draft report, arguing the credibility of its authors and its detailed modelling put Frydenberg’s “desktop departmental review” in the shade. He says Frydenberg still hasn’t produced any details of where the $27bn figure came from – two months on – despite Bailey’s direct requests. “If he had those genuine concerns you think he’d be sending in a big pile all the documents relevant to it … but I still haven’t received anything in my inbox,” Bailey tells Guardian Australia. “So I think this is a stunt and it’s got no authority or is regarded with any seriousness by the energy industry.” Coal companies like Rio Tinto have called on Queensland to abandon its own renewables target to simply align with the commonwealth’s 2020 goal of 20%. But Bailey says it’s clear the state’s plan was “developed in the absence of federal policy” and with doubt that even the 2020 commonwealth target will be achieved. He says the failure of the prime minister, Malcolm Turnbull, to put policy daylight between him and his predecessor, Tony Abbott, shows conservative politics in Australia will be dragged kicking and screaming towards energy sector reform. Antipathy towards renewables and acting on climate change among the hard right of the Coalition stands in contrast to moves by “conservative parties in other parts of the world”, Bailey says. He cites Germany and California as advanced economies already boasting more than 30% renewable power. “You go to Europe, this is not an issue,” he says. “It seems to be a particular LNP [Liberal National party] Australian thing but they seem extraordinarily intransigent on it and, while we see more and more extreme weather events occur, they are stopping us from dealing with some of those big issues around climate change.  “We have to get away from strong ideological positions both pro and anti [renewable energy] and drill down into what the evidence is.  “And this report nailed a range of key facts that are relevant to this debate and certainly one of them is by producing and creating more generators and more competition in the marketplace, then there’ll be some gains in terms of bringing the wholesale price down.” The Grattan Institute in a submission to the Queensland renewable energy expert panel said the draft report seemed to have understated the “full costs of infrastructure to manage the intermittency of wind and solar”. Renewables still cost more than existing coal and gas power but the cost of shifting to renewable could be balanced in the short term by state generators cutting their profits. “[But] as the proportion of wind and solar increases, this balance will not be sustained and prices will rise in line with the underlying higher costs,” the Grattan Institute said. Bailey stands by the assumption that “by getting more suppliers in the market, more competition, you see the wholesale price come under pressure to come down”.  “I’m not saying that, the independent panel full of energy specialists are saying that,” he says. “So you can have renewable energy and you can stabilise prices at the same time and that’s what’s happening to Queensland right now.” Bailey touts the model of “a very private sector-orientated panel” examining the climate-driven power sector shift as one for other states to follow. The power sector, with just under half of emissions, was the single largest source of carbon pollution in Queensland in 2014. The state as a whole made up 28% of national emissions with 146.7m tonnes. Bailey says governments cannot “be serious about acting on climate change without dealing with emissions from the energy sector, full stop”.  “You’ve got Mr Frydenberg overseas saying nice things and signing Australia up to greenhouse targets, which is terrific, but then he comes back to Queensland and bags us for actually backing in that target and acting on climate change,” he says. “He speaks with forked tongue on this.” A 14-year transition for the energy sector means an “average of a couple of per cent a year” of additional renewables generation capacity, Bailey says. ‘That’s very responsible, highly manageable,” he says. “Given the impact of climate change on our economies and communities right now, the most irresponsible thing to do is not do anything about it. “People are not of the view that this move towards renewable energy shouldn’t happen, they support it, and they want to know governments are on the front foot and they’re managing it.” The panel, which is due to release its final report by the end of 2016, has mapped out three scenarios for reaching the 50% renewables goal. If the commonwealth prices carbon, the preference of energy companies such as Adani, that would drive Queensland to 41%, leaving the state to deliver an extra 1900 megawatts to hit its 50% target.  If the state is forced to go it alone it must choose between a steady increase in renewable generation – which would lead to greater cumulative emissions cuts but cost $900m – and a “ramp up” scenario closer to 2030 to take advantage of cheaper technology which would cost $500m. One of the factors in Queensland’s favour is the fact four of its “super critical” coal-fired generators were built since 2000, meaning the dirtiest plants to be closed first are interstate.  Bailey says the government will consider its tack once it has the final report. Asked if any long-range plans may be vulnerable to being scuttled by future state LNP governments, Bailey maintains that “any party that is positive and has a plan to manage the transition to renewable energy, I think, will be marked up by the electorate”. “Any political party that wants to stick their head in the 20th century sandpit and deny this issue and live in the past will get punished.” Bailey acknowledges the political sensitivity of electricity prices, which will likely be the Achilles heel for any state government unable to make out its case that renewables will be “cost-neutral”. Low-income households in particular are smarting after a 42% rise under the former state LNP government, Bailey says, adding this was a product of “network costs with very little progress on renewables”. “Those largely anti-renewable-energy figures who try and say it’s a choice between [less] renewables or increased prices are simply wrong.”"
"With my new hope that deniers of climate change will take ownership of the consequences, I am sad to report that this week, terrible wildfires have swept through Tennessee, a southeastern state in the USA. This state is beset by a tremendous drought, as seen by a recent US Drought Monitor map. There currently are severe, extreme, and exceptional drought conditions covering a wide swath of southern states. The causes of drought are combinations of lowered precipitation and higher temperatures.  The patterns of drought are the result of many weeks of weather (warm and dry) that have led to the current conditions. The recent high-temperature map from NOAA below provides just one example. Why do we care about the crazy drought in the southern USA? Because it leads to bad consequences. As I write this post, we can read about the horrific fires in Tennessee that are destroying both natural habitat as well as towns and economies. A video about Gatlinburg Tennessee fires can be seen here. There, wildfires are threatening the resort town. It is too early to tell what economic damages will result.  Was this fire caused by climate change? The answer is yes. We are now in a world where all of our weather is impacted by humans. We know human-caused warming is making drought and heat more severe – that leads to fires like the one we are seeing. We also know that 2016 will be the hottest year ever recorded and the first time temperatures have reached the critical mark of 1C (1.8F) above normal. Of course we feel sorry for the folks who are affected by the wildfire in Tennessee. But, Tennessee has not helped itself. In 2012, Tennessee passed a law encouraging teachers to present alternative reasons for climate change, even though those views are not supported by science.  Here are some insightful comments from legislators in Tennessee, as reported by Bill Moyers (found here).  So, I will just tell my friends in Tennessee, make sure to give a big THANK YOU to Diane, Marsha, John, Chuck, and Phil. Maybe they will come to help your town clean up after these fires.  Climate change is something we can prevent, but not with legislators like this."
"The government of Bolivia, a landlocked country in the heart of South America, has been forced to declare a state of emergency as it faces its worst drought for at least 25 years. Much of the water supply to La Paz, the highest capital city in the world, and the neighbouring El Alto, Bolivia’s second largest city, comes from the glaciers in the surrounding Andean mountains.  But the glaciers are now shrinking rapidly, illustrating how climate change is already affecting one of the poorest countries in Latin America. The three main dams that supply La Paz and El Alto are no longer fed by runoff from glaciers and have almost run dry. Water rationing has been introduced in La Paz, and the poor of El Alto – where many are not yet even connected to the mains water supply – have staged protests. The armed forces are being brought in to distribute water to the cities, emergency wells are being drilled, and schools will have to close two weeks ahead of the summer break. President Evo Morales sacked the head of the water company for not warning him earlier of the dangerous situation, but the changes produced by global warming have been evident for some time. A recent report by the Stockholm Environment Institute (SEI) says: “Temperatures in the region have risen by 0.5C (0.9F) in the period 1976 to 2006, and the people of La Paz and El Alto can observe evidence of climate change in the form of the shrinking snowline in the mountains above them. One glacier on Chacaltaya mountain – which rises above El Alto and which once hosted the world’s highest ski resort – has already completely disappeared. And the two Tuni-Condoriri glaciers that provide water for El Alto and La Paz lost 39% of their area between 1983 and 2006 – at a rate of 0.24 sq km per year.” The SEI says that if the regional and global climate models that predict a two-degree rise in temperatures by 2050 are right, many small glaciers will completely disappear, while others will shrink dramatically. It warns: “Glaciers are estimated to provide 20% to 28% of water for El Alto and La Paz. Therefore glacier loss will have a considerable impact, which will be felt particularly during the dry season, when glacial water provides the majority of urban water. “The glaciers and mountain water systems also support agriculture, power generation and natural ecosystems throughout the region.” The problem is exacerbated in El Alto, a sprawling settlement of more than a million people who have migrated from the countryside. The city’s population grew by at least 30% between 2001 and 2012, and the city’s land area has rapidly expanded by 144% in the last decade, spreading into the flat open countryside to the south and west. By 2050, the population is expected to double to two million people. The SEI believes that one of the causes of this increased influx into the city will be climate change. It says: “Evidence from El Alto’s history indicates that the fastest periods of population growth coincided with droughts, floods and bad harvests associated with the meteorological phenomena of El Niño and La Niña. “The years 1985 to 1987, when migration into El Alto reached heights of 65,000 new immigrants, were also years of poor harvests.” By 2009, demand for water in El Alto had already outstripped supply, and that supply is now increasingly under threat as climate change melts the glaciers. Bolivia cannot rely on new sources to resolve its water crisis, given both the costs and potential range of climate change impacts. So one of the country’s most critical challenges in coming years will be to plan and implement strategies for managing water under uncertain climate conditions. Conservation and recycling methods, the SEI says, will be needed to build the resilience of Bolivian cities’ water systems to climate change. The cities will also need to find ways of reducing water consumption, especially from industries and commercial enterprises, but also from the profligacy of a small number of rich domestic consumers. The SEI paper recommends community participation in developing strategies and decision-making on the management of water resources. But, at the moment, the only role for those affected communities is that of protest. "
"After Donald Trump won last month’s US presidential election, hot takes speedily declared it game over for the planet. But as Al Gore said at the weekend, “despair is just another form of denial”. About this, he is entirely right. Now is not the time to cry into your graphs of melting Arctic sea ice. That only helps the people who profit from delay on climate change.  Because climate denial isn’t just something other people do – bad people, sad people, stupid people. It’s not just a niche hobby practised by the president-elect and weirder bits of the internet. It’s mainstream. Yes, there are those marginal, attention-seeking types who see a bit of light climate denial as banter. You know the type, that annoying guy your mate went to uni with, Ukip candidates, embarrassing relatives. Then there are the lonely ones who do it to make friends. There’s a strong social element to a lot of climate scepticism – conversations in comment threads, debates in forums, offline meetups. There’s even climate sceptic fanfic if you know where to look. There are “lukewarmer” types who admit climate change is happening but flail around looking for reasons why we shouldn’t bother to act. They might argue it won’t be that bad, or even that it’ll have positives – see, for instance, most oil executives. Some have a genuine – albeit skewed – love of science. The idea of busting a global warming myth carries the attractive illusion of heroic, outsider genius. It’s not for nothing that a group of Australian sceptics style themselves on Galileo. There’s also a narrow empiricism to the idea that if you can see snow, global warming can’t be real. As Prof Joanna Haigh politely explained to Boris Johnson in response to one of his less-than-rigorous newspaper columns, it’s because scientists are so into empiricism that they bother to look at a load of data – not just what you can see out the window at that moment. But there is an even bigger group than any of the above: the rest of us. You probably agree climate change is happening, have maybe even bothered to cut down on how much meat you eat or bunged Greenpeace a quid or two when Russia locked up those Arctic activists. But most of the time you avoid looking global warming in the eye. In many ways this everyday denial is understandable. Climate change is abstract. We only know about it through vast, complex, global and multi-generational networks of interdisciplinary, highly advanced science. It’s easy for it to drop out of our minds, even if we believe in it. It’s also very scary. A friend who, once upon a time, was the greenest person I knew, hugs her infant son tight and tells me softly, slowly: “I just can’t think about climate change since I had him.” This feels entirely rational to me. But it’s this rather prosaic climate denial that lets the Trumps of the world get away with their more extreme forms. It also lets less extreme politicians and businesses off the hook, helping keep climate change as a low-priority topic. At best it puts the issue to one side, and allows us to imagine that Chinese solar businesses, Elon Musk, Ivanka Trump or some other ethereal hero will save us. At worst, it skips the issue entirely. Not everyone has the luxury of ignoring climate change. People are already feeling it as droughts, wildfires and floods become more common. As temperatures creep ever higher, it’ll hit more and more of us, more and more obviously. Knock-on effects mean that, along with battling fire, water and mud, food will become more scarce. If you don’t spot climate change in the rising tides, you may well feel it in your stomach. This is already happening. Arguably, the way climate change affected crops was a contributing factor in the Arab spring. But here’s the hopeful bit. Climate change happens by degree, and every fraction of a degree celsius matters. Last month’s report saying we’re already 1.2C above pre-industrial levels is bad. But 1.2C is less risky than 1.5C, which is less risky than 2C. This doesn’t let us off the hook. Indeed, the idea that 2C is somehow safe is itself a pernicious bit of climate denial. But there isn’t a single point or temperature at which everything is lost. There will always be something to fight for. A few years ago I saw a climate scientist glumly sitting on a table in a seminar room, swinging his legs, quietly sketching out the vision of the future that kept him awake at night. His picture wasn’t an all-out dystopia where we’ve destroyed humanity. What scared him was a future where we do take action on climate change, but only some. A few rich people live in a comfortable bubble they’ve managed to insulate themselves in, and everyone else is left to battle the storms. Perhaps those lucky few notice the plight of the people they’ve left behind. Or perhaps they insulate themselves from that too. That future is possible. It might even be probable. But it’s not inevitable. We can choose to see climate change, and we can choose to do this before it’s too late. So how can we escape the quagmire of denial? As it turns out, the first step isn’t that hard: just talk about it. To your friends, family, colleagues – even to yourself. By talking about climate change, you’ll make it feel less scary. By talking about it, we’ll unlock solutions. And, crucially, it’s by talking about climate change that we’ll break the silence that allows it to go unnoticed and ignored."
"The US should completely quit the United Nations forum to tackle climate change in order to quickly exit the Paris climate agreement, according to a conservative lawyer who is part of Donald Trump’s transition team. Abandoning the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) would allow the US to back out of the international climate effort within a year, far sooner than the four-year period that would be required to ditch the Paris accord, which came into force in November. Such a move would probably prove a severe blow to global efforts to avoid dangerous warming.  Steven Groves, a lawyer at the conservative Heritage Foundation, said exiting the UNFCCC would be the “most practical” way for the US to drop its climate change commitments. Groves is part of the state department transition team for the president-elect, who has promised to “cancel” the Paris deal. “There’s a practical reason for canceling the UNFCCC in that it would provide the shortest timeframe,” Groves, who said he was speaking on the Heritage Foundation’s position on the issue as he was not authorised to speak on behalf of the Trump transition team, told the Guardian.  “If we only withdrew from the Paris agreement, that’s still three or four years. We’ve declined to join other international agreements and there were dire threats of the end of US influence in the world and that hasn’t come to pass. It’s not as if Nato would disband if we did that.” Although Trump recently said he has an “open mind” about the Paris agreement, he has consistently threatened to exit the deal. Reince Priebus, Trump’s incoming chief of staff, told Fox News Sunday that Trump’s position on the climate accord remains that “most of it is a bunch of bunk”. Trump, who has himself called global warming a hoax, has appointed a number of people who reject the overwhelming scientific position on climate change to his transition team.  Myron Ebell, who has said climate science is “phony”, is heading the transition team for the Environmental Protection Agency, while Groves, albeit in a less influential position, has used Twitter to assail “climate change alarmists” and Hillary Clinton for “shilling for the orthodox climate change ‘consensus’”. Meanwhile, Bob Walker, a Trump campaign adviser who is not part of the transition process, has advocated eliminating climate research at Nasa and claimed that scientists are deeply divided on the cause of warming. In fact, the vast majority of peer-reviewed science, along with all of the world’s major scientific bodies including Nasa and the Royal Society, agree that the world is warming and that human activity is the primary cause. Nine of the 10 warmest years on record have occurred since 2000, with 2016 set to be the warmest yet. Separate lines of evidence, such as rising sea levels, shrinking glaciers and the shifting range of species, all point to a rapidly changing climate.  President George HW Bush, with ratification from the Senate, committed the US to the UNFCCC in 1992 following the Earth summit in Rio. Following two decades of often fraught negotiations, 196 nations agreed in Paris last year to cut emissions in a bid to avoid a temperature rise of 2C globally. Trump’s election has raised concerns that the US, the world’s second largest emitter, could exit the process and discourage other nations during a period when emissions must be radically reduced to avoid disastrous heatwaves, sea level rise and the mass displacement of people. The new president could choose to simply ignore the Paris agreement but Groves said the US should quit the entire framework to undo what he said was Barack Obama’s improper signing of the deal. Obama did not ask the Republican-controlled Senate to ratify the Paris agreement, which has a binding goal but leaves emissions reduction targets and methods to individual nations. “The current administration wouldn’t submit it to the Senate, where it would’ve gone up in flames,” Groves said. “It’s being a little too clever with the constitution and the treaty-making power. There is a balance between Congress and the executive on this issue and the Paris agreement has thrown that balance off for raw political reasons.  “Just because you’re the president, you don’t become a dictator. President Obama was betting that another president, such as Hillary Clinton, wouldn’t withdraw the agreement. He made a political calculation and we’ll soon find out if that was right or not.” Other legal experts have maintained that Obama was well within his powers to put the US’s name to the Paris deal, given that it is largely unenforceable. John Kerry, the secretary of state, successfully pushed for key parts of the text to use the word “should” rather than “shall” in order to negate the need for Senate approval. David Wirth, of the Boston College law school and formerly of the state department, said that previous Senate approval of the UNFCC, along with the language of the Paris deal, meant there was no executive overreach. “There’s no question that it’s constitutional,” Wirth said. “The state department was extremely precise in making sure of that. If anything, they were extra cautious. These are aspirational provisions and the president has the authority to review an existing situation, that’s self-evident. The legal authority is already there.  “Withdrawing from the UNFCC would leave the US without a seat at the table, having withdrawn from a set of requirements that are procedural rather than onerous. That would be political grandstanding and contrary to the national interest. There would be opprobrium and criticism from the rest of the world, for no apparent benefit.” Scientists have warned that renewed efforts are required to avoid breaching the 2C threshold, with the current Paris commitments still leaving the world on course for a temperature increase of 3C or more.  Adam Sobel, a climate scientist at Columbia University, said Groves had presented “a misleading and inaccurate portrayal of both the science and economics of climate mitigation, greatly understating both the risks of human-induced climate change and the benefits of the Paris agreement while overstating the costs.  “It is transparently a piece of advocacy on behalf of the short-term interests of fossil fuel companies, against the broader interests of both the US and the rest of the world.  “The majority of the American people support US participation in the Paris agreement. If the US withdraws from the UN convention and the Paris agreement, history will judge us harshly.” The US’s status in international climate talks will be heavily influenced by Trump’s choice for secretary of state. Former presidential nominee Mitt Romney, ex-New York mayor Rudy Giuliani and former CIA chief David Petraeus have all been linked to the role. There has also been speculation that Rex Tillerson, chief executive of oil giant Exxon, is being considered by Trump for the position, a prospect that has horrified environmental groups due to the company’s history of concealing the full impact of climate change. “If the goal is to drain the swamp in DC, Tillerson might not be your man; Exxon’s business plan continues to require raising the level of the ocean to the point where Foggy Bottom will be well underwater,” said Bill McKibben, co-founder of climate group 350.org. “But this is certainly a good way to make clear exactly who’ll be running the government in a Trump administration - just cut out the middleman and hand it directly to the fossil fuel industry.”"
"The claim that Greece may receive an unfair exemption to increase lignite use (Report, 3 November, theguardian.com) is not justified – it is based on misinterpretations: 1) Greece is not trying to “revive its lignite-based model”. In fact, retirements of fossil fuel plants in 2014-23 amount to 4,095MW, including 2,671MW of lignite capacity.  2) The Public Power Corporatrion has reduced its lignite sales share to 35%, down from 60% a decade earlier or 75% 20 years ago – hardly proof of a regressive mindset. 3) Ptolemaida V, a unit under construction, is not funded with free allowances. Free allocation concerns new projects after 2021. Greece is actually among the best performers in emission reductions, as confirmed in the European commission’s 2015 progress report. In 2005-15 Greece achieved a 31% emissions reduction (vs its 6.5% target), 40% reduction of lignite use, and 400% increase in RES share, to 10,000GWh. The system operator’s 2023 projection of generation capacity mix comprises 56% renewable energy sources (RES) and a 14% lignite. The country’s energy plan for 2030 aims to reduce emissions by 55% vs 2005 (including a 62% reduction in lignite emissions). Adequate conventional reserve capacity is necessary at the national and regional level for the safe and stable transition from lignite to RES as Greece’s basic fuel, confronting the security supply risks posed by such a transition. Any other “planning” would directly increase dependence on imported gas in the interim. Greece has already achieved much and is showing further ambition towards meeting COP21 targets. Ensuring a level playing field in Europe for all member states in hardship is a sine qua non to enable all to contribute to climate policy.Andreas MitafidisDirector, Department of Energy Management and Trading, Public Power Corporation  • Join the debate – email guardian.letters@theguardian.com • Read more Guardian letters – click here to visit gu.com/letters"
"Every year Brazil, Congo and other developing countries are lambasted by environmentalists and western politicians for deforestation at a time when trees are needed to counter climate change and prevent flooding.  Now two prestigious organisations are warning that England may have tipped into deforestation, with more trees being cut down than planted for the first time in possibly 40 years.  “We are only planting 700 hectares (1,730 acres) a year, almost certainly less than we are felling,” said Austin Brady, the conservation director of the Woodland Trust charity which, with commercial forestry groups, wants government to pledge to meet its planting targets at a parliamentary debate on Wednesday. “Seven hundred hectares is well below the government and Forestry Commission aim of [planting] 5,000 hectares a year. In comparison, 2,400 hectares was planted in 2014-2015, but planting in England has been consistently low, at under 5,000 hectares a year since 2006,” he said. England is already one of Europe’s least wooded countries. “We think we are losing trees faster than we are planting them. It is difficult to say exactly because the government does not hold records of all trees felled. But technically, we may be in a state of deforestation.  “What is worrying is we have been planting mainly conifers and cutting down our native and ancient woodland. At a time when we are losing trees to tree diseases we are storing up ecological problems,” said Brady. Stuart Goodall, chief executive of Confor, the trade association for the UK forestry industry, said planting was at its lowest level in England in more than 40 years. “Forests are being lost to development and infrastructure; we are cutting a lot and planting so few, so it may be that England is technically deforesting,” said Goodall.  The steep decline in tree planting means the government is almost certain to miss its manifesto commitment to plant 11m trees in the UK in the lifetime of this parliament, he said.  “Only 1.35 million trees were planted in England in the 18-month period from April 2015 to September 2016. At this rate the 11 million tree target will not be hit until summer 2027, more than seven years late. “The 11 million target is neither ambitious nor linked to any policy objectives. It is simply a carry-forward from the number of trees planted by the 2010-2015 government. We should be planting many, many more than 11 million trees in the lifetime of this parliament,” said Goodall. Tree cover in England stands at about 10%, lower than the UK average of 13% per cent and well below the EU average of 38%. In response, the UK government said woodland cover was at its highest level in more than 600 years. “Woodland cover in England is at its highest level since the 14th century and, although planting rates vary from year to year, we are committed to planting another 11 million trees over the course of this Parliament,” a spokesperson said. But the Woodland Trust questioned the government statistics. “The 14th-century figure is a complete red herring. In England we have lost half of our irreplaceable ancient woodland since 1930, and many more were planted with non-natives to ‘commercialise’ them,” said Brady. “The big growth in woodland area more recently was the result of large-scale non-native plantations on marginal land in the first two thirds of the 20th century – whilst all the time our ancient woods are inexorably chipped away by development and infrastructure.” The Woodland Trust, Confor and large commercial forestry groups will, through MPs debating forestry in parliament on Wednesday, call on the government to commit to planting 7,000 hectares of woodland every year until 2020 and then to increase planting to 10,000 hectares a year. This would mean planting around 15-20m trees per year.  The groups point out that while England is barely planting new trees, Scotland is planting 16m trees a year and aims to reach 22m a year from 2017. Britain is only about 20% sufficient in wood, importing millions of tonnes a year from the US, Canada and Europe. "
"Standing next to a thin belt of rattling trees that represents the only line of green in vast stretches of orange desert, 70-year-old Hamud El-Nour Hamdallah recalls a time when this area in Sudan’s River Nile state was dense forest. If you had not found Goz El Halg village by nightfall, you would have to wait until morning to find your way out. But decades of drought and deforestation have allowed sand to roll through the desert and swallow homes and farmland. Hamdallah and his community now go to bed not knowing if they will make it out of their homes the next day. “It’s especially scary when the house is covered [in sand] at night and you can only wait in the dark until morning to dig your way out,” by shovelling through sand or using a tractor to wade through it, he said. The sand can even pour into homes through windows and doors or collapse buildings. “We have been almost buried in sand,” said Hamdallah. Research from a Sudanese government climate programme launched a decade ago shows that the boundary between desert and semi-desert has shifted 50-200km southward since the 1930s. In many villages like Goz El Halg, whose name derives from the encroaching ‘gezan’, or dunes, the desert has finally engulfed places that used to have so much wood it drew people to live there and spurred a boat-building industry. Hamdallah is one of many elders who have had to move villages three times as the sand took over. A previous village lying a few hundred metres away is now barely visible, with some houses reduced to brick outlines in the sand. The village now serves as a playground for children, who play hide and seek behind steep orange dunes, some of which tower above the height of the houses that once stood there. “I don’t like what has happened to the old village,” said 14-year-old Ruwaya Ferra, a student at the local school. The children here are taught about the importance of conserving trees and water to stop history from repeating itself. Small gangs of shy girls know all the words to jaunty songs about protecting trees, because they sing them once a week or more at school. Teachers stress the importance of protecting the environment, starting with the plants sheltered in small rockeries in the otherwise barren school yard, and pen poems about shooing goats away from the precious patches of green. “Don’t cut a leaf off a tree because we don’t want drought and desert to come to us,” said Ferra, repeating one of the mantras drummed into new generations. But tree-cutting for charcoal and land degradation due to mismanagement are not the only factors at play in Sudan. People here started feeling the effects of global warming in the 1980s, with temperatures of over 50C making summers unbearable and winters uncomfortable, erratic rains ruining harvests and floods or droughts turning arable land into dust or gravel.  Ismail El Gizouli, a Sudanese climate change negotiator and member of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), said:“Since the 1970s, we [the world] are moving very fast towards disaster, towards the end of the earth. So this is why we have to move very quickly now [to cut greenhouse gas emissions].”  In Sudan, decades of conflict, international sanctions against President Omar al-Bashir’s government and the loss of most of the country’s oil and forests in 2011 with South Sudan’s secession have exacerbated the effects of climate change. “The problem is caused by the big emitters [of greenhouse gases] but we are the first who are affected because our backbone is very weak, our infrastructure very weak,” said Gizouli. While developed countries can absorb weather shocks, Sudan’s ability to respond to droughts and floods is as poor as its people, two-thirds of whom are farmers. Currently Africa only attracts 5% of the world’s climate-related funding, despite suffering disproportionately from the impacts of global warming. “This is why people are attacking the rich countries. They want to live in luxury – let us therefore die,” said Gizouli, who is pushing richer countries for money for more projects to adapt to climate change. In Sudan, the Forests National Corporation started reserving areas in the 1980s, and a decade later the Sudan National Adaptation Programme of Action started planting belts of trees to protect fields and homes. Aid from Canada, the UK and the United Nations Development Programme is being spent on rehabilitation and irrigation projects in desert villages. In River Nile state, government officials say that around 8,000 trees have been planted over the past two years and that, as farmers’ crop yields increase, communities are turning to tree nurseries and swapping charcoal for butane gas. But it will take significant investment to scale up climate adaptation projects to stop heat, sandstorms and floods from sweeping away homes and fertile top soils. In Goz El Halg, Hamdallah and other elders come daily to water and bolster another 2.5km-long greenbelt planted five years ago with water from a well powered by a solar-pump that has eased reliance on the rain. These trees are the last line of desert defence standing between the burial or survival of a village that has already lost half of its residents to El Damer, the state capital around two hours’ drive away in a 4x4 through mostly empty desert. But Hamdallah believes that the people that stayed are better off than those who ended up in Sudan’s increasingly overstretched and under-resourced urban areas. “I’m delighted about these trees because they protect us,” he said, surveying the still-growing trees through a pair of oversized shades as he mulls whether or not he will move again in his lifetime. “I don’t think so. They have saved us from the sands, I think.”"

"I looked down at my son, playing with an old plastic aeroplane we’d found on the side of the road. Its propellers rusty and brown, its wings cracked and bent.  “Why did I bring you into this world?” I thought. “How could I possibly have thought that was a good idea?” A surge of tears pushed against my throat. I swallowed and turned away.   In my hand was my iPad, the device I read all my books on. My husband insists he can’t sleep with any lights on so I’ve reverted to reading in the dark on night vision. My obsession with post-apocalyptic literature, however, seems fitting for the dark.  The obsession began with a friend’s recommendation for Emily St John Mandel’s Station Eleven, a book about a travelling theatre group who journey from scattered camp to camp, performing Shakespeare to anyone who survived the flu pandemic. I fell in love with this disease-ravaged, post-electricity world where artists were the saviours, the rememberers of culture and romance and imagination. I was hooked. The next book recommendation I received was Clade by Australian author James Bradley. Clade begins with a scientist working in Antarctica while his wife is trying to conceive via IVF in Sydney. He becomes increasing frustrated with society’s refusal to heed the warnings of climate change, which leads him to feeling more and more anxious about the idea of bringing a child into this world. The book goes on to span multiple generations, showing the slow but devastating results of climate change on future generations. It is epic. Right there is where the seed was planted for me. Something to do with the adventure-fantasy of a new world where none of the rules apply anymore, combined with the very real possibility of environmental collapse, made the stakes so much higher and the book all the more riveting. As I continued on this cli-fi (climate fiction) bender, a creature grew inside of me. It started off small and restless in my belly, and over the months it grew teeth and claws. One day, Naomi Klein’s This Changes Everything entered my periphery and something twigged. I realised all the post-apocalyptic cli-fi books had led me to this moment. Enough of the fiction. Enough of the hinting. If the world was going to end, I wanted to read the facts. Hit me in the face with them, fuck it, let’s do this. Well, This Changes Everything did just that. If you do nothing else, just read the introduction to this most terrifying of apocalyptic non-fiction books. To learn that the very thing that drives our culture – profit and growth – is the very thing that is going to kill us was more terrifying than any flu pandemic story I’d read thus far. That at the root of our problem is possibly who we are as a species seemed more hopeless and paralysing than any zombie apocalypse. Then, when Klein spoke about the very real prospect of our children having to battle serious environmental collapse in their lifetime, I just fell apart. The creature inside me was thrashing about. “What have I done?” There my son was, glowing in all his angelic innocence, playing with the product of this sick, disposable dream. I wanted to cry. I wanted to collapse down to my knees, hold him and tell him I was sorry. That I didn’t know what the future held and I was scared. So scared. But instead, I watched him in all his wonder, in his blissful little bubble and I stayed there. If only for a sweet, sweet moment, I stayed there and I forgot.  • Missy Higgins is currently on an orchestral tour around Australia"
"Malcolm Turnbull’s climate change record is the equivalent of an athlete running 7km instead of 42km and claiming to be the greatest marathon runner of all time. Not only is he taking shortcuts, he’s setting future generations up for a massive clean-up bill. This is because Australia is banking its environmental and fiscal future on a climate change magic pudding.  In 2008, departmental projections estimated that we would have to cut cumulative emissions of greenhouse gases by 1,335 megatons of carbon dioxide equivalent (MtCO2) between 2013 and 2020. This has been successively revised down to 236Mt. This makes the government’s task of cutting emissions so much easier. According to the environment department, the projections have fallen because of lower electricity demand, the drought, lower manufacturing output due to factory closures and weaker than expected coal prices leading to lower production. In short, our underperforming economy has meant we’re producing fewer emissions than we expected. But the government isn’t just content with this shortcut. Enter the use of accounting tricks to make their race even shorter. How? Land clearing restrictions established by Peter Beattie led to less deforestation and consequently lower emissions for Australia between 2008 and 2012 (the first Kyoto period) than was required under the Kyoto Treaty. Under the treaty, the gap between the Kyoto requirement and actual emissions were then turned into “carryover permits” that could count towards the 2013-2020 period. This means that Australia is able to transfer 116Mt of avoided emissions, essentially credits, to the 2020 target. Taking all this into account means that the government’s Emissions Reduction Fund (ERF) only needs to cut emissions by 92Mt. Not much of a marathon now. But even this is too much of an effort to do properly. The ERF is wasting money and claiming credits on projects that are not additional. That is, paying for projects that were already going to happen without assistance. Paying farmers to not cut down trees they have already committed to retain under state laws, for example. We will meet our 2020 target, but because we use carryover permits and other tactics, our actual emissions in 2020 will be much higher than our emissions target. The government’s target implies that in 2020 Australia’s emissions will be 5% below 2000 levels. Instead Australia’s emissions will be 3% above 2000 levels, around 577Mt. In other words, because the government has taken shortcuts to meet the 2020 target, Australia is locked into a more polluting economic structure than implied by the minus 5% target. This in turn will make reaching the 2030 targets so much harder. The Government’s minimum 2030 emissions reduction target is minus 26% on 2000 levels. According to Government figures, this requires the Australia to cut its emissions over the decade 2020 to 2030 by 2,215Mt.  Yet the government’s own “Tracking to 2020” paper only claims it can secure 900Mt of abatement in this period. And this is through policies that are either non-existent or contain heroic assumptions including the post-2020 Emissions Reduction Fund (300Mt) and the lightweight National Energy Productivity Plan. The ERF is already running out of steam: 83% of the ERF funding is committed, participation by industry is dropping and the cost of the policy is rising. It is unclear how much additional funding has been allocated to secure the 300Mt of abatement that the government claims the ERF will deliver post-2020. Most ridiculous is that 200Mt of the 900Mt of abatement is predicted to come from a magic pudding of “technology improvements and other sources of abatement”. If this 900Mt of abatement is somehow achieved – and it is a big if – this leaves a gap of 1,315Mt of abatement that must be found to reach the minus 26% target. Even if a ramped-up ERF could find enough projects to bridge this gap, it would require massive funding. At the ERF average price of $11.83, and without even allowing for inflation, that is a fiscal cost of $15.6bn. The government has just released the terms of reference for a review of its climate change policies to ensure that Australia can achieve the 2030 target in an effective manner. This gives the government an opportunity to reverse the disastrous course they have set Australia on. If no change occurs and current trends continue, the government will have locked in an economic structure for 2020 that is more polluting than in the past with no realistic plan to reduce it.  This will not just make tackling climate change much harder, it’s setting Australia up to miss out on the huge economic opportunities that real action to modernise our economy represents. Turnbull may win his 7km marathon, but Australia will be in no position to ever race again."
"On election night in Tubridy’s bar, one of few buildings in the village of Doonbeg, Ireland, that was still open at midnight, pints of Guinness were being poured with “Trump” written on top in creamy froth. A few local men huddled around the bar discussing their man’s chances.  “If he wins, we’ll get that wall built, sure enough!” one of them cheered.   The wall, however, wasn’t the one you would first think of.  Long before he set his sights on Mexico, Donald Trump had his eyes on a different wall. He wanted to build one on the Irish coast of County Clare – a 13ft high structure erected to protect his luxury golf resort, the Trump International Golf Links and Hotel, from increasingly volatile storms and rising sea levels.  While the president-elect announced a climate-change skeptic as the leader of the Environmental Protection Agency transition team, this move to protect his investment suggests Trump recognizes the effects of a changing climate. Propped at the bar, Martin Kelly, a 46-year-old local contractor from Doonbeg, boasted of how he helped lay the foundations of the first golf resort in the village. He hopes to be a leading contender for the contract to work on the wall Trump is determined to build. His mother works at the golf resort, and Kelly says the company has been good to its employees and local contractors.  “I’m delighted to see him get in,” Kelly said the next morning as he drove along the wide, curving expanse of Doughmore beach in front of the course. “He spends money and is minding jobs. He gets the local man like me.”  This summer, the Irish Times reported that planning authorities at An Bord Pleanála rejected an application to designate the wall a “strategic infrastructure development”, further delaying the construction of the planned 200,000-ton structure that would span 2.8km (1.74 miles) of the dunes. But Trump’s Irish firm, TIGL Ireland Enterprises, is relodging an application with the local county council and warned that without the wall, the “viability of the entire resort and its potential closure” would be in question.  His son, Eric Trump, visited the course this summer, a property he says his family loves and invested upwards of $50m to $60m in. He recalled first seeing the course in 2014 when “20 or 30 metres of dunes” had already been eroded. A few more heavy storms, and he worried their redesigned, luxury course might be lost completely.  Kelly was one of the first to join the club but had to give up his membership, unable to afford the high fees, which cost thousands of dollars a year. Today, he is more concerned about the jobs the resort provides and the land he grew up on. “I tell you, it’s not about the golf course, it’s about all this lower area,” he said, pointing towards the land stretching behind the course, where families he knows have farms and land.  “The wall is an issue at the minute, but if [the dunes] go, the water’s coming straight over it, that’s the big issue,” he warned. “Long term, they’re going to get washed away, and if the water gets in, there’s no way to get it out.” He has seen the storms increasing over the years and the way the coastline has been eaten away. He is no skeptic when it comes to climate change and rising sea levels. “They be rising a bit, with the global warming, the Antarctic and all that, the melting away of the ice,” he said. “It’s there to be seen, sure and certain.”  With the fight for planning permission continuing, Kelly thinks construction of the wall might be delayed another two years but hopes sections can be built to protect the worst-hit areas.  “There’ll be a lot of damage before then,” he said. “The whole beach does need to be done.” There have been other measures taken to try to protect the course, none of which have worked. In 2001, owners of the original golf course tried to implement sand trap fencing, a “soft” erosion protection measure, but it was washed away by a storm within weeks. A 2014 report warned that erosion was a natural part of the dunes’ dynamic system and that “construction of physical barriers” could lead to “beach starvation and increased rates of erosion”. Even if built, the wall in Doonbeg may be unable to hold back the sea in a few years. Robert Devoy, a researcher with the Centre for Marine and Renewable Energy Ireland (MaREI), says according to models, the waters on the west coast could rise 45-55cm in the coming decades, though realistically he thinks the waters will rise by a metre. “Who knows what areas around Doonbeg would be flooded,” Devoy said.  Trump tried to build the wall once before but failed. On a marshy patch of land beside the hotel, boulder-sized chunks of rock lay strewn about, left over from the first attempt to build the wall in 2014, after storms almost washed away the 18th hole and damaged other sections of the course.  The local county council halted the construction and Trump’s wall was thwarted by the tiny, narrow-mouthed whorl snail, which lives in the dunes. The snail, around since the ice age but now endangered, is protected in Ireland, and binding conditions in the original planning permission demand regular monitoring to ensure activities on the golf course do not endanger it. The snail has become a mascot for those opposing the wall, with organizations such as Friends of the Irish Environment, Save the Waves and local surfer associations backing a #NatureTrumpsWalls campaign. More than 100,000 people have signed an online petition to “Stop Trump’s Irish Wall”. For the wall to go forward, Clare County council will have to grant new planning permission, and the application that Trump’s firm is submitting could take months to process. Years before the resort was first built, 55-year-old Alan Coyne remembers surfing the swells that roll into Doughmore beach, using the highest sand dunes – the only major landmarks – to navigate. He has followed their shifting over the years, living for three decades in the nearby town of Lahinch.  Now a pristine environment is threatened, in his eyes, by a wall meant only to protect “a playground for multimillionaires”, as he describes Trump’s resort. “There’s a generation of kids learning to surf,” Coyne said, tussling the hair of his 11-year-old son. “It doesn’t matter what age you are, what your beliefs are, if you want to go out and catch a wave, you can.” Lahinch thrives off its surf schools and nearby swells, fueled by the very storms increasingly rolling across the Atlantic. “By doing what [Trump] wants to do, it’s going to kill off a beautiful place,” he said. “I was never so embarrassed at how the Irish government welcomed him into our country.”  When Trump landed at the Shannon airport after purchasing the course in May 2014, finance minister Michael Noonan was part of a welcoming party that laid out a red carpet in front of his private jet. The night after the election in Tubridy’s bar, Fox News playing on a large screen, a handful of local men, most wearing jackets or hats printed with the Trump Doonbeg logo, were celebrating his election. But not everyone was as enthused. One local man, who lives beside the golf course, leaned in close and whispered that he could never support Trump. For one, he said, he has nine sisters. But he also worried if the wall is built, the sea will be forced around and flood his own land. “I’ll end up on an island,” he said.  Behind the counter of a local shop, Christina Buckley planted a red baseball cap on her head. She said she pretends it’s a “Make America Great Again” cap, but it reads “Whelan’s Foodstore and Deli”. “I met him face to face on the dunes,” she said of Trump. She recalled him asking whether she and her two friends were “good neighbors or bad neighbors” due to some local tensions over his resort. Her friend warned Trump he “was on Irish soil”. Buckley said she believed Trump would succeed in building the wall, and that people in her village would support it, with more jobs promised if the project gets the green light. But she worried the wall could also affect those living nearby. “My home place, we border that [wall]. It’s going to drown us, it’s going to drown people on the other side. When the tide comes, it has to go somewhere,” she said. “That’s only one place to protect – why not protect the people who have been there all their lives?” "
"I’ve spent a lot of time with indigenous peoples in remote places. So when I argue that the best way – or at least the cheapest way – to stop climate change is to grant land rights to indigenous communities, you might suspect I’m not coming from an entirely objective viewpoint. You’ve probably also heard various industry spokespeople saying the best and cheapest way to stop climate change is through windfarms, solar panels, electric cars and cavity wall insulation. But while I may be biased, and may even have “gone native” now and then, I’m not trying to sell you anything.  On a global scale, one of the main causes of climate change is land-use change, and particularly changing land from forest to agriculture. Stopping deforestation is the most economically efficient way of preventing carbon emissions because, in simple terms, all it amounts to is not flooding forests for dams or cutting down and burning them for agriculture. The efficiency of not cutting down trees as a climate change mitigation strategy is fairly well-established. The UN is pushing the international community to cooperate on an agreed plan to stop deforestation and its associated emissions, which add up to about the same level as road transport and haulage emissions. But this is where a beautifully simple idea becomes complicated. How exactly do you stop deforestation? How do you compensate industries reliant on the agriculture that entails deforestation? And how do you compensate them in a way that doesn’t create perverse incentives and unforeseen consequences? What is the value of a forest and the land it stands on? There’s the value of the timber it can produce, and after that, the crops that could be grown. Or the value of an Amazonian valley flooded for a hydroelectric dam. Then there’s the forest’s value if we don’t chop it down. Its value as a carbon sink, its value as a biodiversity reservoir, its value as a weather maker and regulator, its value as a source of oxygen and air purifier. All the things that are invisible to accountants but vital to humans. And forests also have a value that even environmental scientists can miss, but is very, very real to forest peoples. As the environmentalist David Suzuki says: “The way we see the world shapes the way we treat it. If a mountain is a deity, not a pile of ore; if a river is one of the veins of the land, not potential irrigation water; if a forest is a sacred grove, not timber; if other species are biological kin, not resources; or if the planet is our mother, not an opportunity – then we will treat each other with greater respect.” This is why indigenous peoples are the forests’ greatest conservationists. They can cut through the Gordian knot of the UN’s interminable processes. They see and understand the value that enlightened, developed cultures are blind to, and which modern science is only beginning to rediscover. Translating that value into the hard currency we value is difficult. The World Resources Institute has taken a step in that direction, with a study of the environmental and economic costs and benefits of governments granting indigenous land rights in Brazil, Bolivia and Colombia. It reports that giving indigenous people land rights leads to the preservation of forests as carbon sinks. And, as a means of storing carbon, it is between five and 42 times more cost-efficient than fitting carbon capture and storage systems to fossil-fuel power stations. If we are unwilling to spend money on protecting rainforests, their spectacular biodiversity, indigenous cultures, their ecosystems and their ineffable beauty and meaning, then we’ll have to spend a lot more sucking from the atmosphere what was once a rainforest, and burying it in the ground. There is a test case going on right now in Brazil, home of the world’s biggest rainforest. The country’s official body for looking at indigenous people’s land rights, FUNAI, is due to decide this month on whether to grant them to the Munduruku people. They live in the Tapajos basin, an area in the heart of the Amazon being eyed up for the construction of more than 40 hugely destructive mega-dams. The Munduruku can protect their bit of the Amazon for us, as they have done for centuries, preserving its amazingly varied flora and fauna and saving us the money we’d have to spend on taking carbon out of the atmosphere if industry is allowed turn it into carbon emissions. The Munduruku have been campaigning for their rights for decades. The Brazilian constitution says they should be given them. A cold, hard, financial cost/benefit analysis says they should be given them. And if the Munduruku don’t get their land rights, there’s an industrial-scale queue of people waiting to trash their beautiful home. While many of us have yet to fully understand this, the truth is, their home is also our home."
"Policy Exchange has become the latest organisation to call for the retention of the UK’s carbon price floor ahead of next week’s autumn statement, arguing changes to the policy would seriously undermine the government’s efforts to phase out coal power by 2025. The influential thinktank joins the CBI and trade body Energy UK in arguing the levy should be kept in place, despite lobbying from some industry groups calling for it to be axed. Critics of the levy have said it pushes up energy bills and undermines the competitiveness of UK industries – a scenario the government has attempted to address by providing support for industries deemed to be at risk from overseas competition because of environmental policy costs. However, in a new paper Policy Exchange argues that while the carbon price floor has largely failed in its original goal of mobilising investment in clean energy it has inadvertently become the primary policy mechanism for shifting the energy mix from coal to less carbon intensive gas – a phenomenon that has happened so quickly coal provided just three percent of total power generation in the three months to October this year. “We recommend that the government retains the carbon price support until the early 2020s, to support the government’s plan to phase out coal generation,” the report states. “Scrapping the carbon price support now … would damage policy credibility and undermine the government’s decarbonisation plans.” The government last week launched a consultation on its plans to phase out unabated coal power, confirming it wants coal power off the grid by 2025 at the latest. “The original rationale in 2010 was it would support investment in wind and solar and so on and it hasn’t done that, investment has happened despite the carbon price floor not because of it,” Policy Exchange’s Richard Howard told BusinessGreen. “But what it has done is deliver a massive coal to gas shift, that’s because the price is just sufficient to make coal slightly more expensive than gas at the moment.” He added that scrapping the carbon price floor would be “nuts” as it would ensure that coal plants were “back in the money”. “It would undermine the carbon budget period we are on now and it would make the coal phase out target harder to achieve,” he said. “You could use an emissions performance standard to still deliver the coal phase out, but using carbon prices is an easier way to do it in the first instance.” However, the report argues that once coal has been removed from the grid the carbon price floor, which adds an estimated £36 a year to average household energy bills, should be phased out, bringing UK carbon prices back into line with those set by the EU emissions trading scheme (ETS). “Modelling suggests that this would reduce wholesale energy prices in the UK by around £4/MWh, saving consumers as much as £12.5bn over the period 2019 to 2030,” the report states. “Aligning carbon prices in the UK and Europe would mean that we import less power from the continent through interconnectors, and invest in new generation in the UK instead, increasing jobs and GDP.” Howard added that further decarbonisation of the energy system could then be achieved through other policy measures and the reform of the EU ETS to deliver a more meaningful carbon price across the bloc as a whole. “We’re not saying get rid of carbon prices completely, but let’s have the same one across Europe and make it work,” he said. “It’s not clear whether that is where we are heading post Brexit, but there is a lot of support across Europe for reform. “"
"Last week, Donald Trump’s space policy advisor Bob Walker made headlines by suggesting that the incoming administration might slash Nasa’s climate and earth science research to focus the agency on deep space exploration. This caused great concern in the scientific community, because Nasa does some of the best climate research in the world, and its Earth science program does much more. Walker suggested the earth science research could be shifted to other agencies, but climate scientist Michael Mann explained what would result:  It’s difficult enough for us to build and maintain the platforms that are necessary for measuring how the oceans are changing, how the atmosphere is changing, with the infrastructure that we have when we total up the contributions from all of the agencies ... we [could] lose forever the possibility of the continuous records that we need so that we can monitor this planet.  Walker’s comments set off alarm bells for another reason. Were it simply a matter of transferring Nasa’s climate and earth science programs to other agencies, what would be the point? Such a transfer would be logistically difficult, and if the research funding weren’t cut, it wouldn’t save any taxpayer money. And it’s not as though the branches doing Nasa’s climate research are distracting other branches of the agency from conducting deep space exploration. The suggestion does however look a lot like a Trojan horse whose true purpose is to cut government-funded climate research, perhaps transferring some of Nasa’s programs and budget to other agencies and simply scrapping the rest. In an interview with The Guardian, Walker accused Nasa of “politically correct environmental monitoring” and “politicized science.” Carol Off from CBC’s program As It Happens conducted a follow-up interview with Walker and asked for examples to support his accusations. Walker cited the example of Nasa’s announcement that 2014 was the hottest year on record, claiming: The fact that they have reported temperature that they said was the highest temperatures...in history...it turned out that they were only 39% sure of that figure. Well that’s a press release, not a scientific kind of statement. I’m interested in scientific integrity. I’m interested not in scientific analysis that goes to a politically correct outcome. The reason Walker knew that Nasa estimates gave 2014 a 38% (not 39%) chance of being the hottest year on record (Noaa put its odds at 48%) is that Nasa and Noaa included this information in their announcement. There is uncertainty in every scientific measurement. That’s why scientific theories and conclusions aren’t proven; they’re only supported or disproved by the available evidence.  Nasa and Noaa concluded that 2014 was about twice as likely to be the hottest year on record than the second-most likely year (2010). Thus they decided that they could announce that 2014 was likely the hottest year on record, but they also included the uncertainty in that conclusion, as good scientists do. For that, Walker wrongly accused them of “politicizing science.” Coincidentally, 2015 broke the 2014 record, and 2016 is about to shatter the record for hottest year once again. In the CBC interview, Walker also claimed: “the models that the scientists have used on global warming have been extremely flawed.” In reality, as documented in my book, climate models have been incredibly accurate at predicting global warming. But Walker’s most glaring red flags were raised when he was asked about the 97% expert consensus on human-caused global warming, to which he replied: I don’t think it’s the vast majority of climatologists who believe that [global warming is happening and man-made] ... among climatologists there is still a debate about the causes of the global warming. And so I think that debate is healthy, and I am entirely concerned about the fact that some of the climatologists that do not buy into the orthodoxy are being prevented from even having their works published. Walker followed up to the interview with three sources he claimed supported his rejection of the 97% expert climate consensus. In this answer, Walker checked off three of the five characteristics of science denial.  First, he engaged in conspiratorial thinking by accusing the climate science community of blocking contrarian research. In reality, the 3% of climate scientists who dispute the expert consensus on human-caused global warming are able to publish their work in scientific journals. It’s just that the contrarian research tends to be flawed and falls apart under scientific scrutiny, so it doesn’t get much attention outside of certain biased media outlets. Second, in denying the 97% expert consensus, Walker instead appealed to fake experts. He cited three sources to dispute the consensus, one of which was the National Association of Scholars; but digging deeper, the source was actually a 2011 interview the association did with Fred Singer. Singer is a tobacco and fossil fuel industry-funded scientist, who claimed in the interview: the number of skeptical qualified scientists has been growing steadily; I would guess it is about 40% now. In short, one of the sources Walker cited to dispute the 97% expert consensus on human-caused global warming is the unsubstantiated guess of a fossil fuel-funded fake expert. Walker also referenced the Open Source Systems, Science, and Solutions Foundation (OSS), which says:  97% of working climate scientists say the temperature is rising, and human activity is a significant contributing factor. On the same page OSS does mention that 31,000 scientists signed the Oregon Petition disputing the consensus, but only to debunk this particular myth. Strike two for Walker. His third source was “The Center for Climate Research,” which most likely refers to a paper published by David Legates, who used to head the University of Delaware’s so-named center. While Legates’ paper was published in a scientific journal, it badly misrepresented the expert consensus on climate change by focusing on the papers that didn’t explicitly quantify how much global warming humans are responsible for. By that logic, there’s no expert consensus on evolution, or the Earth not being flat, or on any scientific question, because in every scientific field most papers don’t focus on answering the most basic, settled questions. The problem is that Walker is getting his climate information from inaccurate, biased sources, and he’s an advisor to the president-elect. It’s possible that the incoming administration won’t follow his dangerous, biased advice. The issue will predominantly be in the hands of Congress in any case, but Republicans in Congress have been trying to slash Nasa’s earth science budget for years. Now they have an ally in the White House. Additionally, Trump has surrounded himself with advisors and cabinet members who likely don’t view climate research favorably. The head of his EPA transition team denies climate science and opposes efforts to cut carbon pollution. For EPA head, he’s considering Scott Pruitt and Kathleen Hartnett White. Pruitt is among the attorneys general attacking the Clean Power Plan in court, and his arguments have been delivered directly by the oil industry. Hartnett White has worked for several fossil fuel-funded think tanks and has compared expert scientific conclusions to religious dogma. Trump will likely select an Interior Secretary in favor of opening public lands to oil drilling.  While Trump himself has claimed to have an open mind about climate change, he’s also displayed a lack of basic knowledge about the subject, to put it mildly. Trump will be forced to rely on his advisors, but he’s surrounded himself with Big Oil cronies, and his chief of staff has said that Trump’s default position on climate science is that “most of it is a bunch of bunk.”  It’s very possible that Congress will send Trump a budget that slashes Nasa climate research, and it’s also possible that his oil-allied team will advise him to sign it. Doing so would be a terrible mistake that would cripple the scientific community’s ability to monitor how rapidly we’re changing the Earth’s climate.  We can’t simply bury our heads in the sand and hope the problem goes away. If our political leaders try to kneecap our climate monitoring, citizens must make them aware that this is an unacceptably irresponsible action that will not be tolerated."
"The Arctic is experiencing extraordinarily hot sea surface and air temperatures, which are stopping ice forming and could lead to record lows of sea ice at the north pole next year, according to scientists.  Danish and US researchers monitoring satellites and Arctic weather stations are surprised and alarmed by air temperatures peaking at what they say is an unheard-of 20C higher than normal for the time of year. In addition, sea temperatures averaging nearly 4C higher than usual in October and November. “It’s been about 20C warmer than normal over most of the Arctic Ocean, along with cold anomalies of about the same magnitude over north-central Asia. This is unprecedented for November,” said research professor Jennifer Francis of Rutgers university.  Temperatures have been only a few degrees above freezing when -25C should be expected, according to Francis. “These temperatures are literally off the charts for where they should be at this time of year. It is pretty shocking. The Arctic has been breaking records all year. It is exciting but also scary,” she said.  Francis said the near-record low sea ice extent this summer had led to a warmer than usual autumn. That in turn had reduced the temperature difference between the Arctic and mid-latitudes.  “This helped make the jet stream wavier and allowed more heat and moisture to be driven into Arctic latitudes and perpetuate the warmth. It’s a vicious circle,” she added.  Sea ice, which forms and melts each year, has declined more than 30% in the past 25 years. This week it has been at the lowest extent ever recorded for late November. According to the US government’s National Snow and Ice Data Centre, (NSIDC), around 2m square kilometres less ice has formed since September than average. The level is far below the same period in 2012, when sea ice went on to record its lowest ever annual level.  Francis said she was convinced that the cause of the high temperatures and ice loss was climate change. “It’s all expected. There is nothing but climate change that can cause these trends. This is all headed in the same direction and picking up speed.” Rasmus Tonboe, a sea ice remote sensing expert at the Danish Meteorological Institute in Copenhagen, said: “Sea surface temperatures in the Kara and Barents seas are much warmer than usual. That makes it very difficult for sea ice to freeze. “When we have large areas of open water, it also raises air temperatures, and it has been up to 10/15C warmer. Six months ago the sea ice was breaking up unusually early. This made more open water and allowed the sunlight to be absorbed, which is why the Arctic is warmer this year,” he said. “What we are seeing is both surprising and alarming. This is faster than the models. It is alarming because it has consequences.” Julienne Stroeve, the professor of polar observation at University College London said ice that should be growing at this time of year was retreating. “It’s been a crazy year. There is no ice at Svalbard yet. In the last few days there has been a decline in sea ice in the Bering sea. Very warm air has flooded into the Arctic from the south, pressing the ice northwards.  “Air temperature drives the formation of the ice. It has been really delayed this year so the ice is also much thinner than it usually is. The speed at which this is happening surprises me. In the Arctic the trend has been clear for years, but the speed at which it is happening is faster than anyone thought,” said Strove.  “Ice is very sensitive to weather. There is a huge high pressure over the Kara sea, and Eurasia and Canada. We are seeing very strong winds bringing warm air north.”  The significance of the ice forming late is that this affects its growth the following year, with consequences for climate. “Extreme wind and high air temperatures [now],” she said, “could see ice extent drop next year below the record 2012 year”.  She added: “The ice could be even thinner than it was at the start of 2012. This is definitely a strange year.” Ed Blockley, the lead scientist of the UK Met Office’s polar climate group, said: “The sea ice is extremely low. It is freezing but very slowly. Last week the Barents sea reduced its ice cover. There was less ice at the end than the start.  “These temperature anomalies are not unprecedented but this is certainly extraordinary. We are seeing a continual decline in ice. It it likely to be a hiccup but it puts us in bad starting position for next year.” "
"Come on, you can admit it. I admit it. I admit that after Trump’s election victory, I secretly hoped and even though that his rhetoric was worse than its bite. He only said those crazy things during the campaign to get elected. He wouldn’t really follow through on his plans to completely gut the US commitment to keeping the Earth habitable. Oh how naive we were. Trump’s plan to fill positions in his administration shows things are worse than we could have ever feared. According to recent reports, Trump has picked long-time climate denier and spokesperson for the fossil fuel industry Myron Ebell to head the Environmental Protection Agency transition. This basically means the EPA will either cease to function or cease to exist. It also appears that the US will pull out of any agreements to limit greenhouse emissions.   It means we have missed our last off-ramp on the road to catastrophic climate change. That may sound hyperbolic, but I study the rate that climate change is happening – the amount of heat accumulating in the Earth’s system. We didn’t have any time to waste in implementing Obama’s aggressive plans, and Trump will result in a decade of time lost. So who is Myron Ebell? He is a director at the Competitive Enterprise Institute and chair of the Cooler Heads Coalition. Where did he get his PhD in science? Nowhere. In fact, he isn’t a scientist at all, but he does have a degree in economics. Yeah! Is there any conflict that Ebell’s Competitive Enterprise Institute is funded by companies such as ExxonMobil and groups such as the Charles Koch Charitable Foundation? Surely not. Myron Ebell is not new to obstructing action on climate change. Years ago, it was reported that he favored editing Bush-era scientists’ reports on climate change.  It isn’t just Ebell. Trump has other insiders, some of who represent fossil fuel companies, working on the transition. What this selection also tells us about Trump is that he is surrounding himself with people who are not knowledgeable in a topic and will not effectively educate him. Not that educating Trump was ever possible. But there was always the outside chance he would take his contrarian streak to a new level and be contrarian to the contrarians. We now see that is not going to happen. If Trump listens to anyone, it will be people who think like he does and represent special interests who would be most affected by his policies. We have a fox guarding the hen house. I know Trump won’t listen, but I have a wager for him. I could randomly pull an Earth scientist’s name out of a hat and any name I pulled would be better than Myron Ebell. I challenge Trump and his administration to actually include real scientists in forming legislation and action on environmental issues. And I am not talking about scientists that are connected to rightwing thinktank groups. I am talking about independent unaffiliated scientists. Cripes, just go down to the neighborhood university, pick anyone – they will be better than what you have now.  Or Trump could attend the world’s largest geophysics meeting, which occurs in just a few weeks (American Geophysical Union Fall Meeting). He could walk around with a TV camera and a clipboard. Ask any random 10 scientists any question on climate change. Let’s see how their answers compare to the information he is going to get from his handpicked insiders. Let’s put it on TV; Trump likes TV. Maybe someday Trump will realize that he actually could be the savior of the Earth. Could you imagine the transformative power of a Republican president getting the Republican party to find solutions to climate change? It would fit a megalomania frame. It would be powerful and inspiring. However, the chances it will happen are about as good as the chance we can avoid our targeted 2C temperature rise (almost zero). Not if you surround yourselves with foxes as you go in to raid the hen house. At the risk of losing objectiveness but keeping candor, we are fucked."
"The federal government’s Direct Action carbon reduction policy appears to be running out of steam, with participation from industry dropping, the cost of the program rising and the budget for emissions reduction nearly exhausted. The Clean Energy Regulator announced on Thursday it would pay a further $367m to polluting industries, in return for a commitment for them to reduce carbon emissions by 34.4m tonnes.  It is the smallest of four auctions held by the regulator, and leaves about $440m left in the emissions reduction fund for further carbon abatement contracts. With about 83% of the fund now spent, the federal government’s central climate policy is almost exhausted, with no further funding committed to the program. At the previous auction in April 2016, the government awarded $516m worth of carbon abatement contracts under the scheme, and achieved a slightly cheaper price per tonne of carbon abatement – $10.23, compared with today’s $10.69. The reduced amount of money spent in the latest auction, and the higher cost of abatement, appeared to reflect a lack of interest from the industry, with the regulator receiving about half as many bids in this round as it did in April 2016 – 52 bids compared with 103 in the previous auction. Hugh Grossman, executive director of energy advisory firm RepuTex, said the results showed high emitting companies were losing interest in the scheme. “Results indicate that interest in the ERF has fallen, with low supply and reduced competition leading to a nominal increase in the average price of abatement, in line with our earlier outlook,” Grossman said. He said the lack of interest was driven by administrative complexity, a diminishing ERF budget, and the low price being paid for carbon abatement. “This is unlikely to change until compliance obligations are placed on industry to offset their emissions” Grossman said. The majority of the projects – 24 out of 47 – were for vegetation projects, where farmers are paid to either plant trees, or to not cut them down. An analysis from earlier this month by the environmental group the Green Institute, found that they would not have cleared the land anyway. They also found the price paid to the farmers to not clear each acre of land, was sometimes more than that acre of land was worth. The scheme is also occurring alongside skyrocketing land clearing by other farmers in Queensland and New South Wales. Wilderness Society national director Lyndon Schneiders said: “It would be far cheaper just to stop tree clearing and spend that money on hospitals and schools. The Turnbull government’s climate policy is completely illogical and a waste of taxpayers’ money.” According to Reputex, Australia’s emissions are likely to rise despite the money spent through the Emissions Reduction Fund. In a media release, minister for energy and the environment Josh Frydenberg said: “The ERF provides a broad range of opportunities to reduce emissions right across the economy while generating income and employment for rural and Indigenous communities and improving biodiversity.” Erwin Jackson, deputy chief executive of the Climate Institute said the ERF was only effectively addressing emissions in the land sector, which is a “tiny fraction of Australia’s contribution to climate change”. “Emissions from the burning of coal, oil and gas are the real drivers of escalating climate change impacts,” he said. “As the world switches to clean energy, global emissions from fossil fuels have now been flat for the last few years, and falling in major economies like China and the United States. But they’re rising in Australia, because we have no national strategy to replace our ageing coal plants with clean energy. “This highlights how crucial it is that next year’s federal policy review produces a credible and scalable decarbonisation strategy that can get Australia to net zero emissions.”"
"The former head of the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority has called for a ban on all new coalmines in Australia, saying the move is needed to protect the Great Barrier Reef from climate change. “I love the reef and I have worked to preserve it since 1979; I will oppose anything that threatens to destroy it,” said Graeme Kelleher, who was the first chief executive of GBRMPA, a position he held for 16 years. “The Great Barrier Reef is one of the seven wonders of the world.”  Kelleher, who is also a member of the Ocean Elders – a group of global leaders concerned about ocean conservation including Richard Branson, James Cameron, Jane Goodall and EO Wilson – said: “Australia cannot have a healthy Great Barrier Reef and a continuing coal industry.” Kelleher put his name to a petition started by Greenpeace Australia Pacific, calling on the prime minister, Malcolm Turnbull, to put an immediate ban on all new coalmines. The Australian government’s deadline for reporting to Unesco’s world heritage committee on its handling of the reef is approaching. After Australia submits the report Unesco will decide whether or not to again consider listing the Great Barrier Reef on its “list of world heritage in danger”. The government will need to report on how it has funded and implemented its Reef 2050 long-term sustainability plan, as well as how the recent bleaching event has affected the reef.  Since it last considered including the Great Barrier Reef on its list, the reef has undergone the worst bleaching event in recorded history. According to government agencies, 22% of the reef was killed in one hit, as unusually warm waters bleached and killed the coral. And that comes at the end of a long-term decline of the reef, Kelleher said. “Over the last 30 years, the reef has lost 50% of its coral cover and one of the major causes of this is climate change,” Kelleher said. Kelleher said the continued health of the reef demanded action on climate change and a halt to all new or expanded coalmines. He said the Adani’s huge Carmichael coalmine must not go ahead and that the high court ought to find in favour of the Australian Conservation Foundation and overturn the federal environmental approval of the mine. The ACF will argue, on appeal to the high court, that emissions from the burning of coal dug up from the mine will exacerbate climate change and harm the Great Barrier Reef. The government has argued, successfully so far, that there is no link between the mine’s coal and climate change. “A proper court that, shall I say, was scientifically attuned, would recognise this,” Kelleher said. “Although the coal will not be burned in Australia, it will still be burned in india and that will affect the Great Barrier Reef.” Greenpeace Australia Pacific reef campaigner Shani Tager said: “Graeme is a giant when it comes to the Great Barrier Reef and has a wealth of experience and knowledge about the threats it faces. His comments are a stark reminder of our need to take serious action to save the reef.”"

"Australia’s greenhouse gas emissions are rising despite global reduction efforts, according to detailed projections made by the consultants NDEVR Environmental. Australia’s emissions jumped by 2.56m tonnes in the three months to September, putting them 1.55m tonnes off-track compared with commitments made in Paris, and 4.06m tonnes over levels demanded by scientifically based targets set by the government’s Climate Change Authority. Emissions for the year to September are above those for the year to September 2015. The results mean Australia has emitted about twice what is allowed by the CCA’s carbon budget since 2013. In the three years and nine months to September 2016, the country emitted 19.8% of its share of what the world can emit between 2013 and 2050 if it intends to maintain a good chance of keeping warming to below 2C. If Australia continues to emit carbon pollution at the average rate of the past year, it will spend its entire carbon budget by 2031. Projected to the current second, the graphic shows how much of the carbon budget has been spent. The government has failed to report its emissions since the quarter ending December 2015. Last year it released data on Christmas Eve, when it reported a jump in emissions. The analysis was produced by NDEVR Environmental, which analysed data for all of Australia’s major emissions sources and compared the results with the government’s commitments made in Paris and the cuts recommended by the CCA. “The national greenhouse gas inventory, it’s six to nine months behind, it doesn’t compare against any targets, and it doesn’t mean a whole lot to a lot of people,” said Matt Drum, director of NDEVR Environmental. “So we put our backs into it and replicated their report, updating it to the latest quarter. It was no mean feat. We wanted to show how Australia is tracking, not in real time, but as close as we can get.” The jump in the latest quarter was not unexpected, since it represents increased use of power during winter months, according to Drum. But the analysis suggests Australia’s emissions have not fallen over the longer term either, with emissions over the year to September rising by 1.3m tonnes compared with the previous year. “Since the carbon pricing mechanism was repealed, slowly but surely carbon emissions have been increasing both in intensity and in volume, so it’s no surprise that overall emissions have started creeping up as well,” Drum said. The government has not committed to any interim targets before 2030 but the analysis shows that Australia is not cutting its emissions at all – and certainly not at a steady rate that would meet its 2030 targets. The carbon budget recommended by the CCA, which it described as “equitable and feasible”, was never agreed to by the government, but represents the authority’s view of Australia’s fair share if global warming is to be kept under 2C. Australia’s emissions did drop steadily from 2005, almost entirely owing to changes in land-clearing laws in Queensland and NSW. Those changes have now been reversed in Queensland and New South Wales has also just made the clearing of land easier. This is expected to cause an increase in emissions which may not yet be reflected in the projections. The federal government’s primary carbon reduction tool is Direct Action, under which it pays polluters to pollute less through a reverse auction – the emissions reduction fund. There is no evidence the emissions bought through that fund reduce overall emissions, and many of the emissions the government pays to avoid are unlikely to have occurred anyway. About 83% of the emissions reduction fund has been spent, with the latest auction attracting relatively little interest from polluting industries, resulting in fewer reductions being offered and a higher price being demanded.  The government has committed to reviewing its climate change policies in 2017 but there have been doubts about how rigorous that review will be since the minister for energy and the environment, Josh Frydenberg, described it as merely a “sit rep” – a situation report.  • You can support important journalism like this by making a one-off or monthly contribution"
"The Paris agreement has been ratified. Only one year after negotiating this historic treaty, it has come into force. This signals that the vast majority of governments around the world remain committed to fighting climate change.   Yet that was the easy part. Actually realising these commitments made at COP21 in Paris will require concerted, concrete action for many years to come. Though the vast majority of countries in the world have clear goals in the form of nationally determined contributions (NDCs), these are not action plans, nor are the NDCs strong enough to actually keep global average temperature from rising more than 2C. The Paris agreement is a truly global commitment, spanning developed and developing countries around the world. Yet for many developing and least-developed countries, in particular, contributing to the fight against climate change requires taking targeted actions while also prioritising economic development and poverty reduction. Here are five areas in the energy sector that offer such a win-win. While energy is the foremost contributor to carbon emissions, access to it is also a critical enabler of human and economic development. At the same time, the billions who lack access have not contributed to climate change. Any concerns that achieving energy access for all would magnify the challenges of energy security or climate change are unfounded: it would only increase global energy demand by 1% in 2030 and CO2 emissions by 0.6%. The latest figures, recently published in the World Energy Outlook 2016, show that an estimated 1.2 billion people, 16% of the global population, still do not have access to electricity. Access to clean cooking receives far less attention than electrification and in many ways is more difficult to achieve. An estimated 2.7 billion people, or almost 40% of the global population who are concentrated in sub-Saharan Africa and developing Asia, still rely on the traditional use of biomass for cooking. Despite the urgency of the problem, investment is falling far short of what the International Energy Agency (IEA) estimates is needed to achieve universal access by 2030 – around $50bn (£40bn) per year. Dedicated policies to promote access are essential to break the vicious cycle of energy poverty, in which growth in incomes and living standards are severely hindered by a lack of energy services. Technology can also be a major enabler of effective policymaking and improvement on the ground: decentralised renewable energy is providing an increasingly viable way to close the access gap in rural areas, particularly for remote settlements far from the existing grid. Around 6.5 million premature deaths worldwide are attributed each year to poor air quality, making this the world’s fourth-largest threat to human health after high blood pressure, dietary risks and smoking.  This is an energy sector problem, as energy production and use, mostly from unregulated, poorly regulated or inefficient fuel combustion, are the most important sources of air pollution from human activity. The harmful effects of energy poverty are felt most heavily in developing countries in Asia and sub-Saharan Africa. Confronting the twin challenges of CO2 emissions and air pollution means dispensing with short-term thinking and stop-gap solutions. IEA analysis shows that proven energy policies and technologies can chart a development path that delivers major cuts in air pollution around the world and bring health benefits, universal access to energy and improve sustainability. Though the Paris agreement is a global accord between countries, much of the hard work will be taken in the cities of the world. Cities dominate energy demand, and by extension are responsible for a significant share of carbon emissions. As IEA’s Energy Technology Perspectives 2016 highlighted, the world’s urban areas accounted for about 64% of global primary energy use and produced 70% of the planet’s CO2 emissions in 2013. These shares will rise as cities grow and urban economic activity expands. As the world seeks to make more efficient use of its energy resources, increase energy security and meet global climate targets, cities must take a leading role in the energy transition. Leadership must of course start from the top; policy at the national level must encourage the deployment of clean energy technologies, and include greenhouse gas emission reduction targets, carbon pricing mechanisms, and investment in energy research, development and demonstration. But these targets must then be complemented by action at the local level through efforts including sustainable transportation planning, building codes and improved data collection. Unfortunately today, many of the megacities of the world, particularly those in Asia, are still powered by antiquated subcritical coal-fired power plants. These can have emissions intensities of around 1,000kg of CO2 per megawatt-hour (that is, the amount of carbon dioxide that is released for each unit of power produced). More modern, highly efficient coal-fired power plants may have an intensity of around 800, yet a natural gas turbine can reach about 350. A coal plant equipped with carbon capture and storage can release less than 150kg of CO2 per megawatt-hour. At the very end of the spectrum, renewable sources like wind and solar have zero emissions. Globally, the average intensity of power generation today is just over 500kg of CO2 per megawatt-hour. But, to align with the 450 Scenario in the IEA’s World Energy Outlook 2016 – a scenario consistent with limiting the global increase in temperature to no more than 2C – the emissions intensity of power generation needs to fall much further and faster, to around 80kg of CO2 per megawatt-hour by 2040.  A path to achieving this is likely to include a combination of a more rapid shift to low-carbon technologies worldwide (especially wind, solar and hydropower), fuel switching (such as from coal to gas), efficiency improvements and in some markets, adoption of carbon capture and storage. This low-carbon transition must take place on a level playing field. Fossil-fuel subsidies distort energy markets, promoting inefficient use of energy and increasing energy-related CO2 emissions. They are a roadblock on the way to a cleaner and more efficient energy future. They have also consistently dwarfed the amounts allocated by governments to subsidise renewable energy. In 2014, for example, fossil fuel consumption subsidies of almost $500bn (£400bn) were more than three-times higher than renewables subsidies of some $140bn (£112bn). But there has been progress. World Energy Outlook 2016 reports that the value of global fossil-fuel consumption subsidies in 2015 was estimated at $325bn (£260bn), reflecting lower fossil-fuel prices but also a subsidy reform process that has gathered momentum in some countries. In the case of renewables, rapidly falling costs in recent years have been welcome, but in many cases subsidies are still needed to level the playing field with fossil-fuel alternatives that emit CO2 and other pollutants. But as technology costs continue to come down, and hopefully the environmental impacts of fossil fuel use is better reflected in pricing, more and more new renewable energy projects will be competitive without support. Achieving universal access to clean, modern energy services while meeting global climate targets is no easy task. But with the right policies, aimed at the right sectors, with the right technologies, the world can soon be on track for a sustainable energy future.

"The image of the Earth from space is so seared into human consciousness that it is hard to conceive what it was like to live without the picture of our planet as a blue sphere that we all now carry in our minds. The first photographs of the Earth’s surface seen from 100 miles were taken in 1947. By 1968, the famous Earthrise image photographed by the crew of Apollo 8 framed our planet as a beautiful oasis in black space. Today, stunning and intensely informative pictures of the Earth’s surface are being taken from space constantly: so comprehensively, for so long, that Google has now created timelapses that show three decades of change.  It induces anxiety to watch, in just a few seconds, a desert in Saudi Arabia turn into a vast agribusiness complex, a lake in Bolivia vanish or cities grow spectacularly in China. History has become a car crash in speeded-up motion. We can see, in these timelapse satellite videos, how the Earth is being torn apart by human acts. We can also see, in timelapse videos of Arctic ice, great glaciers melt before our eyes. Yet, are human beings capable of assimilating such global perspectives or is our consciousness tragically limited to a pre-space age, even pre-Copernican mentality? Are people only capable of acting on immediate, personal and local concerns, even though images from space can show us the bigger picture? This is one of the real problems of our time. The new vistas on Earth opened up by Apollo 8 in 1968 may seem to have sunk into the very fabric of human consciousness, but it also seems that we can watch any number of videos of expanding cities and vanishing ice without becoming globally conscious. Extreme scepticism about climate change has proved a vote winner for Donald Trump. Specifically, Barack Obama’s environmental policies have been accused of creating a “war on coal”. Pennsylvania miners were not happy to accept that their traditional jobs were doomed for the greater good. All the images of climate change, the timelapse videos of a crumbling Earth, the crash of glaciers, don’t apparently mean anything compared with the direct experiences people have in their own neighbourhoods. If a truth is inconvenient, ignore it. If you want to experience, directly, the gap between imagination and reality, science and common sense, that threatens our ability to act rationally to save the planet, just consider your smartphone. Walking down the street, I can see myself move on the screen of my phone, in a real-time, real-life link between myself and a network of satellites. Yet do we go around pondering this magic? No, and perhaps it even seems naive to do so. We just use the app to check how far we are from the meeting or pub we’re trying to get to. We are now a species in space, our lives as well as the health of our planet scanned by satellites. Globalisation is not abstract but a scientific reality that is made visible in these timelapse images of our changing world. Yet that knowledge somehow does not get into the depths of our psyches. The GPS in our smartphones and cars is an unfortunate metaphor for a crushing failure of human imagination. We literally refuse to engage with the dazzling global and extra-global nature of modern life. It’s all too complex, apparently. We are mentally imprisoned, unable to soar in our minds to see the Earth as a satellite can see it. And it’s killing us."
"President Barack Obama has staked his legacy on the environment, positioning his administration as the most progressive on climate change in US history. However, an obscure agency within his own administration has quietly spoiled his record by helping fund a steady outpouring of new overseas fossil fuel emissions – effectively erasing gains expected from his headline clean power plan or fuel efficiency standards. Since January 2009, the US Export-Import Bank has signed almost $34bn worth of low-interest loans and guarantees to companies and foreign governments to build, expand and promote fossil fuel projects abroad. That’s about three times more financing than the taxpayer-backed bank provided during George W Bush’s two terms, and almost twice the amount financed with loans and guarantees under the administrations of Ronald Reagan, George HW Bush and Bill Clinton – combined. The bank, which operates within Obama’s administration, provides US exporters with financing to sell goods and services overseas. Bank officials say it supports US jobs and fills a financing gap by allowing companies to access funding when private lenders will not. Since 2009, it has financed 70 fossil fuel projects. When they are all completed and operating at full capacity, the bank estimates they will push 164m metric tons of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere every year – about the same output as the 95 currently operating coal-fired power plants in Ohio, Pennsylvania and Oklahoma. That number does not include emissions from the numerous foundries, mines and smelters the bank also has financed around the world since 2009, nor does it include more than 600 transactions listed in the bank’s authorization database, in which the product or export is labeled as “N/A”, making it impossible to estimate the true size and extent of the bank’s carbon footprint. The findings come after Guardian US and Columbia University’s Graduate School of Journalism’s Energy & Environmental Reporting Project spent almost six months viewing documents and data released under the Freedom of Information Act. The investigation team studied tens of thousands of bank transactions, interviewed dozens of sources, and examined scores of government, watchdog and academic reports showing how the 82-year-old bank has undercut the president’s environmental legacy. Since 2014, the bank has made an effort to become more climate-conscious. Indeed, the vast majority of the bank’s fossil fuel financing took place before December 2013, when it adopted the president’s climate action plan and announced its intention to stop financing coal in all but the poorest countries. But environmental critics say that in its zeal to increase exports after the 2008 financial crisis, the bank – which financed the construction of two liquid natural gas plants on an island in the Great Barrier Reef, two of the largest coalmines on the planet, and more than a dozen refineries and petrochemical plants in countries such as Saudi Arabia, India and Turkey – has put a permanent stain on the president’s environmental legacy. “There is a tension between Obama’s strong efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions on the one hand and some of its lending activities abroad,” said Michael Gerrard, director of the Sabin Center for Climate Change Law at Columbia University. Our investigation shows the president’s domestic climate policies, including the 1.1bn ton carbon reduction promised with his new vehicle engine efficiency standards and the 2.5bn ton carbon savings the pending clean power plan is estimated to make, will largely be erased by the bank’s overseas emissions. The last thing we should be doing is providing corporate welfare to some of the biggest polluters on the planet The bank – which a growing number of Republican members of Congress oppose , viewing it as a symbol of government largesse and corporate welfare – is almost universally supported by Democrats, who see it as a job maker and economic leveler for US exporters in the global market, who must compete against foreign companies financed by their own country’s export banks. However, our findings show that not only does the bank violate Democrats’ environmental platform to reduce carbon emissions, but more than 28% of the bank’s long-term loan financing since 2009 has supported foreign-owned exporters that directly compete with US companies – including nearly $540m to Caterpillar’s biggest foreign competitor, the Japanese-owned Komatsu, to build a copper mine in Mongolia. “At a time when we need to boldly transform our energy system away from fossil fuels and into energy efficiency and sustainable energies, the last thing we should be doing is providing corporate welfare to some of the biggest polluters on the planet,” said Senator Bernie Sanders, who opposes the bank. The Export-Import Bank was established in 1934 by executive order from Franklin D Roosevelt to support the exchange of goods to and from the United States. Today, it provides insurance, working capital, loan guarantees and low-interest loans to US exporters, as well as overseas corporations using American-made goods.  The bank is self-sustaining and returns any surplus to the treasury, which was about $280m in 2016. Since 1 January 2009 the bank has authorized more than 25,000 transactions worth more than $170bn total. Nearly 80% are insurance deals in which the bank insures a US exporter against nonpayment from a foreign country or company. In some cases, it is difficult to determine for whom or for what purpose the insurance policy was made.  However, the majority of authorizations – 68% or $116bn – are in the form of taxpayer-backed loans and guarantees, which generally go to foreign borrowers to use the services of American exporters. For instance, in 2012, the bank loaned nearly $5bn to Dow Chemical and the Saudi Arabian state-owned oil and gas company, Saudi Aramco, to employ the Swiss engineering firm, ABB and “additional exporters” to build a power boiler and heat exchanger for a new petrochemical plant in Saudi Arabia. ABB manufacturing plants in Pennsylvania and Oklahoma engineered the parts. Other multibillion-dollar financing included $3bn in loans to a consortium led by ExxonMobil to build a liquid natural gas plant in the Papua New Guinea highlands, and $2.8bn in loans for the construction of a refinery in Colombia. Since Obama became president in 2009, overall financing by the bank has nearly doubled, going from about $13bn a year under President George W Bush, to an average of $25bn during Obama’s eight years. Yet, according to our investigation, investments in overseas fossil fuel projects have tripled under Obama. We thought the situation was going to improve under Obama. We had no idea it was going to be far worse “When President Obama got elected we had great hopes,” said Douglas Norlen, director of economic policy for Friends of the Earth US. “And then we watched Ex-Im’s fossil fuel financing skyrocket. We thought the situation was going to improve under Obama. We had no idea it was going to be far worse.” Included in these transactions are two of the largest coal-fired power plants on the planet: Eskom’s Kusile power plant in South Africa and Reliance Energy’s Sasan plant, with combined yearly carbon emissions of more than 56m tons. To put that into perspective, the average US coal-fired power plant produces 3.5m tons of carbon dioxide every year, with the largest, the James H Miller Jr plant in Alabama, producing 19m tons a year, according to the Environmental Protection Agency. Bank officials say both overall and fossil fuel-related funding increased in the Obama years as a result of the economic downturn and a concurrent boom in commodities, which “precipitated an interest in large projects, including mining, power and petrochemical facilities”, said Caroline Scullin, the bank’s senior vice-president of communications. During the president’s 2010 State of the Union address, he pledged to double exports over the following five years. In response, the bank, which supports about 2% of the country’s exports, identified fossil fuel and extractive industries as areas for growth. Financing jumped from $2.9bn in 2009, when Obama took office, to a peak of $10bn in 2013. Between 2009 and 2015, transactions included 28 loans and guarantees worth $8.5bn to the Mexican state-owned oil company, Petróleos Mexicanos, for exploration and drilling, as well as $1.5bn for gold, iron ore and copper mining in Mongolia, Ukraine and the Dominican Republic. The bank was blocked from making new investments in July 2015, when Congress let its charter expire. And although the House and Senate voted overwhelmingly to reauthorize the bank five months later, it was down to two board members – and unable to approve transactions larger than $10m. Senator Richard Shelby, a Republican from Alabama and chairman of the Senate committee on banking, housing and urban affairs, has refused to hold hearings for new board appointees, saying he “will continue to fight against any congressional action that would allow the bank to resume its role as an engine of corporate welfare”. Congress is now looking for ways to circumvent Shelby’s blockade, a move that may happen before 9 December. According to the bank’s website, potential projects include more dirty fuel investments – a coal-fired plant in Vietnam, a petroleum refinery in Kazakhstan and power plants in Pakistan, Egypt and Saudi Arabia. Obama’s efforts to reduce carbon emissions in the US are indisputable and include new fuel economy standards for cars and trucks estimated to reduce carbon emissions by 1.1bn tons – and his signature clean power plan, which, if enacted, will reduce the nation’s carbon dioxide output to 32% below 2005 levels. His administration has also shown international leadership and invested in global efforts, including $3bn toward the Green Climate Fund, a coalition designed to help developing nations invest in low-emission energy sources and climate-resilient development. It is unclear how these efforts will fare under Donald Trump’s presidency. He has called climate change a hoax and has promised to “cancel” the Paris climate deal, which aims to hold the planet’s temperature from rising more than 2 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels.  Despite Obama’s efforts, our investigation shows the Ex-Im Bank’s $34bn financing of overseas fossil fuel coal plants, refineries and pipelines undermines the carbon savings made by his fuel efficiency standards and clean power plan. Using information from the Energy Information Administration, if the clean power plan were enacted this year, over the next 15 years it would reduce US carbon emissions by about 2.5bn tons. That is nearly the same number that the Ex-Im Bank’s overseas fossil fuel projects will produce over 15 years, assuming they were all running at full capacity. While emissions supported by the bank aren’t counted toward US totals, their impact on climate change is identical whether they flow from a smokestack in Kentucky or South Africa. “One unfortunate aspect of the current international climate change regime is that only a country’s own emissions within its borders count in its emissions inventories,” said Gerrard, the Columbia University law professor. “Those emissions go on the inventories of the countries where the pollution occurs, even though they have global impacts.” Both the bank and the White House took issue with our findings. John Morton, the National Security Council’s senior director for climate and energy, said:“Comparing projected emissions of Ex-Im-supported projects internationally to the emissions avoided by the clean power plan is at best an apples to oranges comparison, and at worst deliberately misleading. The clean power plan is projected to reduce emissions in the United States off of a specific business-as-usual baseline. This analysis includes no equivalent baseline, and therefore disregards the fact that without Ex-Im support, the vast majority of these projects would have been built with less efficient and higher polluting technologies, meaning more pollution than without Ex-Im action.” He said 90% of the projected emissions came from projects financed in the early years of the Obama administration, before the president’s climate action plan was announced in 2013, adding: “The real story here is in the leadership that the president and the Ex-Im Bank have shown in adopting a policy to restrict financing for new coal-fired power plants overseas.” Scullin, the bank’s spokeswoman, said our analysis overstated the bank’s emissions because the numbers the bank reports represent the total estimated carbon contribution from a project, not just the parts it financed.For instance, because the bank financed just the furnaces and ovens in the Star oil refinery in Turkey, she argued that it should not be accountable for all 2m metric tons of greenhouse gases emitted every year by the refinery. Norlen, of Friends of the Earth, said Morton and Scullin’s arguments were weak, disingenuous and minimized the bank’s impact. “The bank’s presence makes these projects more palatable to other financial institutions,” he said, providing the financial security and foundation for other credit agencies and banks to come on board. Bank officials also said that despite their funding of fossil fuel projects, they are on the forefront of advancing green and climate-friendly policies. In 1999, the US Export-Import Bank was the first export credit agency to track carbon emissions from its financed projects, and in 2013, acting on Obama’s climate action plan, bank officials announced they would stop investing in coal plants except in the poorest countries, including Bangladesh, Mozambique and Rwanda, or in middle-income income countries, such as Papua New Guinea and Vietnam. The investments would also be contingent on emissions being captured. Officials note that one-third of the bank’s emissions are attributable to the two mega-coal plants financed before adopting Obama’s climate plan, and since then, projected emissions have fallen.  However, according to the bank’s website, a new coal plant in Vietnam is being considered for financing, along with a natural gas plant in Mozambique estimated to emit more than 5m tons of greenhouse gases every year and a petrochemical complex in Egypt that is projected to annually emit 3m tons. Bank officials note they have also increased financing of renewable and clean energy projects under Obama’s tenure – 17 times more than during the Bush years. According to the bank’s data and annual reports, the board financed nearly $2bn in clean energy projects since 2009, including about three dozen wind projects in countries such as Mexico, Peru and Honduras and nearly 30 solar energy projects in India and South Korea. The bank “is committed to advancing global efforts toward renewable and sustainable energy and power”, said Scullin, the bank’s spokeswoman. “We also recognize – as do the other 200 signatories of the landmark Paris climate agreement – that countries have different and sometimes pressing needs for power and energy investments.” In recent years, the bank has met growing resistance from members of the House and Senate who see it as an instrument of corporate welfare, providing billions of low-interest, taxpayer-backed loans and guarantees to major corporations such as Boeing, General Electric and Caterpillar. Since 2009, seven of the bank’s 10 largest deals went to oil and gas giants, including ExxonMobil, BG Energy Holdings – which is now part of Royal Dutch Shell – and Australia Pacific LNG. Among these was a $1.3bn loan to Petróleos Mexicanos, which contracted with the misleadingly named exporter, Solar Turbines – a San Diego-based gas turbine manufacture – for oil and gas field services. In addition, a review of the bank’s loans suggests that nearly $9bn – almost 28% of all loans – went to foreign-owned exporters, many of which are direct competitors of US-based companies. For instance, the bank provided nearly $540m for Turquoise Hill Resources, a Canadian mining company, to buy equipment from Japanese-headquartered Komatsu America, a direct competitor of Caterpillar. And between 2012 and 2015, the bank provided companies in Saudi Arabia and Peru more than $600m to buy steam, gas and wind turbines from German-headquartered Siemens Energy. Siemens is a direct competitor of General Electric. In both cases, manufacturing took place in the United States. The bank’s focus is “jobs supported in the US regardless of the ownership of the corporate parent”, Scullin said. “When Siemens or any other foreign company manufactures in the US and provides jobs to American workers, we will finance the export of the American-made products. When they manufacture in Germany, we won’t finance.” Bank officials say they have supported 1.4m jobs since 2009. However, phone calls to about 80 US exporters affiliated with more than 20 large fossil fuel projects revealed few keep statistics tracking jobs tied to bank financing. Of the nine companies that responded to requests for jobs numbers, only four companies reported that jobs were created or supported because of the bank. One said no jobs were created, three said there was no way to estimate, and one declined to offer any speculation. Scullin says the bank uses a methodology approved by the Government Accountability Office to estimate jobs numbers, which includes not just jobs created directly by the financing, but downstream, indirect ones as well.  The bank’s future is unclear. While it enjoys majority support from Congress, a growing number are questioning its mission. And Trump has called it “featherbedding” for select politicians and companies. Whether it lasts beyond 2019, when Congress debates reauthorization again, is uncertain. What is certain is that the greenhouse gases it financed with US taxpayer support will be with us for centuries.

"As Ali Kawu eases his handcart to a halt on a recent morning in north-east Nigeria, it is the first time he has dared to stop walking in more than 24 hours. A day earlier, at 8am, Boko Haram militants raided his village. Kawu, 25, escaped with what he could – his wife, their three children, and kindling for a fire. They left behind their papers, six sacks of beans, up to 15 dead neighbours, and 10 kidnapped villagers. Then they walked all day and all night. “Every minute I would look back to see if they were following us,” Kawu says, shortly after reaching the safety of Monguno, a town recaptured from Boko Haram last year. “Walking forward, looking back, walking forward, looking back. I thought it was the end of my life.” But safety doesn’t mean comfort. Kawu is just the latest of approximately 140,000 displaced people sheltering in this remote town of 60,000 people. North-east Nigeria has been hit by a displacement crisis that dwarfs any migration flows seen in Europe in recent years. Since the Boko Haram insurgency began, more people have migrated to Monguno alone than left all of north Africa for Europe in the first nine months of this year. One upshot is a food crisis that the UN warns might see hundreds of thousands die from famine next year. About 40% more people have been displaced throughout Borno state (1.4 million) than reached Europe by boat in 2015 (1 million). Across the region, the war against Boko Haram has forced more people from their homes – 2.6 million – than there are Syrians in Turkey, the country that hosts more refugees than any other. The comparisons mirror a wider trend across Africa. Of the world’s 17 million displaced Africans, 93.7% remain inside the continent, and just 3.3% have reached Europe, according to UN data supplied privately to the Guardian. “No matter how many problems Europeans have, it’s nothing like this,” summarises Modu Amsami, the informal leader of Monguno’s nine camps for internally displaced people (IDP), as he strolls past Kawu’s newly erected hut. “Please, I’m appealing to Europeans to forget their minor problems. Let them come here and face our major problems.” For 18 months, Monguno endured its migration crisis largely alone. Amsami is an IDP but decided to run Monguno’s nine camps himself in the absence of any government officials. It was not until this June, a year and a half after the Nigerian army retook the town from Boko Haram, that aid groups and civil servants felt safe to return. “We were shaken by what we saw,” says Mathieu Kinde, an aid worker with Alima, a medical NGO that was the first to arrive. Many people were starving, having been cut off from their farmland. There was a polio outbreak – Nigeria’s first case in two years. Just one government doctor was left in the town. To this day, the townspeople cannot farm their fields – Boko Haram remains too close to the town’s perimeter. Aid convoys from Maiduguri, the state capital, risk ambush. Most food can arrive only by helicopter, which is how the Guardian reached the town. The number of people in a famine-like state has been slightly reduced, but every week Alima treats up to 200 new cases of malnutrition. “The situation remains alarming,” says Kinde. About 68 miles (110km) to the south, Maiduguri seems calmer. It remains under curfew but the roads into the city are largely secure, the streets are clean and its nightlife is reportedly experiencing a tentative revival. But if you know where to look, it is a city under extreme pressure.  More than 600,000 IDPs have migrated to this city of just 1.1 million during peacetime over the past three years, according to the International Organisation for Migration (IOM). About a quarter have been put up in half-built schools, or in housing projects intended for teachers and civil servants. The rest have been taken in by friends and relatives. “It’s an amazing story,” says Toby Lanzer, the UN’s assistant secretary general for the Sahel and the Lake Chad region. According to Lanzer, the local community has in effect said: “We built that as a school, but you [IDPs can] have it. And we built that as a new neighbourhood, but we will put you lot in it. How’s that for generosity, Europe?” But that generosity has come at a price, says the governor of Borno state, the province where the majority of the fighting and displacement has taken place. Unemployment in Maiduguri has exceeded 50% since the start of the crisis, says the governor, Kashim Shettima, while more beggars gather at the major road junctions because the IDPs have few means of alternative income. “Health facilities are at breaking point,” he says. “All resources have become overstretched. We ask all people of conscience to help.”  Across the region, about 65,000 people are suffering from famine-like conditions. Inside a makeshift clinic run by Médecins Sans Frontières in a Maiduguri suburb, you can find some of the most dire cases. On bed after bed, about 100 skeletal babies and toddlers stare vacantly into space. Many have plastic nodules stuck to their skull, to allow the nurses to attach them to a drip. Many children are so thin their scalp is the only place a visible vein can be found. “Getting food became so difficult after my husband was killed [by Boko Haram],” says one mother, whose malnourished three-year-old lies motionless on the bed beside her. “I would beg every day but I wouldn’t get more than 100 naira [25p] a day. And that’s how he got hungry.” The international community has largely failed to help: UN funding is still 61% ($297m) short of its target. Local residents have stepped in where they can. Babakara al-Kali, a Maiduguri businessman, has given a plot of land to about 3,000 IDPs – forgoing the 10m naira (£25,000) he previously charged construction workers and mechanics to rent it every year. “If you help someone, God will help you,” Kali says. “So I decided to help them.” Still, the conditions inside this makeshift camp are abject. Streams of slurry trickle through the site. A family mourns a child who died yesterday of hunger. Two elderly men have become blind in recent days and the camp’s elders blame the lack of food. Some residents spend their mornings collecting spilt grain at the local market; in the afternoons, they sift through them piece by piece, sorting the edible grains from the rotten ones. “We have lost count of the number of people killed by hunger,” says Bulama Modusalim, the camp’s informal leader. Aside from their physical problems, many of the IDPs across the region are suffering from psychological trauma. Almost every interviewee tells a story of being woken at dawn by gunfire, of emerging from their huts to find Boko Haram fighters killing their neighbours or kidnapping their relatives.  Ali Falfami, 73, has a missing hand; it was amputated after being shot by Boko Haram. Karu Modu, 28, has a missing son – he was shot by the militants – and a missing husband: they slit his throat. Modu survived because she agreed to watch their murder. “They forced me to watch them die so that I would not be slaughtered,” she says, before breaking down in tears. Modu was then kidnapped and held for nearly two years. After escaping with a group of fellow captives, six of their children died of thirst as they trekked to the safety of Maiduguri. On arrival, they were initially ostracised. People feared the women had become indoctrinated during their time with the extremists, and were wary of talking to or even sitting with the returnees. These are not isolated experiences. The #BringBackOurGirls campaign has focused on the group of schoolgirls kidnapped from Chibok in 2014 – but away from the media spotlight, thousands of others are believed to have also been abducted in other incidents. At one point, Boko Haram controlled an area the size of Belgium and killed an estimated 20,000 people. Now the group is in retreat, but millions more still face food shortages.  “The narrative of this deepening humanitarian crisis in north-east Nigeria has been largely overlooked by the media, whose focus remains on the kidnapping of roughly 300 Chibok school girls,” says Orla Fagan, a spokesperson for UN’s office for coordination of humanitarian affairs.  “Each one of the girls who remains captivity is a minuscule representation of the millions of Nigerians who now face starvation across the north-east as a result of Boko Haram violence. They are some of the poorest, most vulnerable members of society, who also continue to struggle for their basic needs to survive each and every day.” Many of them are being encouraged to return home where they face uncertain futures. The Nigerian army has retaken several key towns from the insurgents, and the government wants their former residents to go back to what they say are now safe areas. But the reality is more complex: the roads in and out are often still contested, as are the fields surrounding the towns. Many buildings lie in ruins and, as a result, returnees are often forced to live in IDP camps even after they have nominally reached their hometown. Bulama Modusalim, the leader of the informal camp in Maiduguri, took a group of villagers back to Konduga in August, after the government assured them it was safe. “But when we went back we found that Boko Haram was still [in the surrounding area],” says Modusalim. “We went back and we found our houses were destroyed. We couldn’t go further than 1km from the town, so we couldn’t farm.”  Eventually, the situation became so desperate that they went back to Maiduguri, despite the poverty they knew they would face there. In a choice between war and starvation, they would rather risk the latter. Amid all this misery, Boko Haram is the most obvious explanation for what has gone wrong. Nearly everyone is running from the jihadis who still control significant parts of the Lake Chad basin. But what led to the group’s rise in the first place? Local leaders say the group was initially able to present its fighters as victims of police brutality – and more generally positioned Boko Haram as a radical alternative to the high levels of regional poverty and unemployment.  But according to several interviewees, including the local governor, this social alienation was partly fuelled by rapid climate change. North-east Nigeria borders Lake Chad, a vast inland lake that supplies water to about 70 million people in four countries – Nigeria, Chad, Cameroon and Niger. But since the 1970s, it has shrunk by 90% – from 25,000km2 to less than 2,500km2. And those who live near its former shores say this shrinkage is one indirect cause of violence in the region, and the subsequent displacement. Modu Amsami, the IDP who runs the nine camps in Monguno, comes from the village of Gumnari, which was once just 2km from the lake. Now it’s 18km away.  “In the 70s, you could put this tree in the lake,” Amsami says, pointing at a nearby tree, “and you wouldn’t even see it. Now if I walked in there, the water wouldn’t even reach my chest.”  As a child, Amsami’s father would tie him to a tree to stop him entering the lake and being eaten by crocodiles. Today there would be no need. The water is nowhere in sight and it’s difficult to even see a crocodile. All this has led to unemployment for thousands of fishermen and farmers – including several people from Amsami’s family. He reckons this worsened living conditions, created a wave of unemployed and disaffected youth – and so helped fuel the anger and resentment that created Boko Haram. “If the Lake Chad water was normal,” says Amsami, “all these problems [with Boko Haram] would be eliminated economically, because nobody would have time to do all these things.” According to the IOM, few of the roughly 35,000 Nigerians who have in Europe this year are fleeing from the insurgency in the north-east. But the west would be wise to take the Lake Chad crisis seriously, lest the millions seeking sanctuary in the region decide to move towards Europe. Lanzer says he is “willing to bet a month’s salary that the proportion of people who will arrive in Europe from Nigeria, Chad, Cameroon and via Niger will grow substantially”. Shettima speaks in even starker terms: “As long as the underlying problems that precipitate the crisis are not met, then there is a risk that more Nigerians will try to go to Europe.  “At the moment, most of them are economic migrants, but if this madness is not solved, believe me you will see a mass of humanity trying to get to Europe via the Mediterranean.”"
"Earth is warming due to the release of heat-trapping greenhouse gases. Scientists are working hard to measure how fast the planet is warming, how much warming has occurred over the past few decades, and how this is affecting coastal areas, ecosystems, and fisheries. By understanding these factors, scientists can better project future climate impacts. A large component of Earth’s warming involves the oceans, which absorb excess heat. The difficulty of gathering measurements in the oceans is that they are vast, deep, and often hard to reach. It’s also costly. Think about it: if you wanted to take the ocean’s temperature, how would you do it?  Centuries ago, ocean measurements were made with buckets dropped from the sides of ships. Over time, measurements have become more numerous and more accurate, partly thanks to technology advances. Today, a global array of floats that take continuous profiles of the upper ocean monitors ocean temperatures at more than 3000 locations to depths of 2000 meters.  However, this array was put in place in 2005. Prior to that, the backbone of ocean measurements was a device or probe called the expendable bathythermograph (XBT for short). These small, torpedo-like probes, deployed from ships, gather temperature data to depths of 300 to 2000 meters as they descend through the water.  XBTs were designed as a simple, inexpensive way to obtain temperature measurements from virtually any ship. These XBTs were originally used by navies to determine the depth of the sound channel, where sound waves can travel thousands of miles. They were first introduced in 1967 and immediately adopted by scientists worldwide. Since their debut, several million have been deployed, with some 20,000 launched annually in all ocean basins.  A very important and critical component of their success has been the excellent relationship established by the scientific community with commercial shipping companies. Commercial vessels aid scientists by voluntarily deploying XBTs along routes that are continuously repeated, often in remote regions not sampled by other types of oceanographic equipment. With XBT use dating back to the 1960s, these measurements offer a unique historical perspective on temperature change in the oceans, which is often associated with global warming or even varying location and the intensity of ocean currents. XBT records, together with those of other observational tools later put in place, are crucial for determining how fast the ocean is warming - an essential factor for quantifying our effect on climate. XBT data are also used to measure how ocean currents change and how heat is transported across ocean basins, both of which are linked to extreme weather events worldwide.  Background information and photos of XBT devices are provided at several sites, such as through the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), Scripps Oceanographic Institution, and Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution.  My own research has been partially focused on how to make XBT measurements more accurate. As part of this research, I recently attended an international meeting on XBTs hosted by the Japan Agency for Marine-Earth Science and Technology (JAMSTEC) in Tokyo. At the meeting, I met with colleagues from around the world to discuss how to refine and improve XBT data from the various models of this probe.  Dr. Gustavo Goni, an oceanographer at NOAA and co-organizer of this meeting, reminded me that despite their basic technology, XBT probes are still relevant for scientific research—they are simple to use, cost-effective, and provide unique data that other, more technologically-advanced measurement systems still cannot retrieve. I asked Dr. Goni to summarize the role of XBTs in measuring the ocean.   Obtaining ocean temperature measurements in a sustained manner is critical for assessing global changes and for studying how they may potentially impact climate, weather, and ecosystems. This is truly and international and multi-institutional effort, which for example, together with other types of ocean observations, satellite data and numerical models, has allowed us to estimate the heat transported in the South Atlantic Ocean and helped us to identify and assess connections with global extreme weather events.  XBTs provide a unique tool that allows us to gain insight on how these changes are occurring, which very often provide managers and decision makers with information to evaluate and facilitate mitigation efforts. Research institutions make long-term decisions on the type of measurement equipment they develop and deploy, and decisions made now will impact ocean-observing efforts of the globe for decades to come. Collectively, we invest in satellites, floats, drifters, ships, moorings, marine weather instrumentation, and other measurement platforms. Yet, the XBT is a low-tech device that has already successfully measured our oceans for 50 years.  Few, if any, other instruments have consistently delivered the quality, quantity, and type of information about our oceans as the simple XBT. In our current uncertain state about the future foci of organizations like NASA and NOAA, and with great uncertainty about what measurement tools will be funded, the XBT reminds us that cheap instruments have their benefits."
"Marrakech has an ancient heart — centuries old and unafraid to show it — and it has all the ingredients needed to disorientate an outsider. You get lost, often. Lanes in the centuries-old medina are narrow and the walls are high, making it impossible to spot a landmark and get a fix on where you are.   Mopeds, bicycles and horses slice through noisy and dense human traffic. The smells from the food stalls, spice shops, a gazillion cats and the horses and scooters are supremely contradictory. Half farmyard, half inner-city traffic stop.  No analogy is ever perfect, but if you want to understand the challenges of negotiating a global deal to secure a safer climate, then the full frontal sensory attack of the medina feels like as appropriate a comparison as any other.  Few transactions are straightforward in the medina and, just like the global United Nations climate talks here in Morocco, there is always a time to barter.  As the talks draw to a close, let’s have a walk through the medina that is the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change.  Last year in Paris, almost 200 countries agreed a deal to limit global warming to “well below 2C” while aiming for a safer guardrail of 1.5C.  This, the deal said, would mean that global emissions of greenhouse gases would need to be net neutral in the second of this century.  In the lead up to Paris, each country submitted a climate plan — called a Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC) — to stay below the warming target.  But the problem is that when analysts add these plans together, they show that rather than meeting the “well below 2C” goal, they instead shoot far passed.  The United Nations Environment Programme released a report earlier this month, saying even if all the Paris pledges were implemented in full, global temperatures would rise between 2.9C and 3.4C by the end of this century. The respected group of analysts at Climate Action Tracker, which also monitors the NDCs, says the current pledges will deliver about 2.8C of global warming.  So as part of the Paris deal, countries agreed to revise their plans every five years. Every NDC must improve on the one before. No backsliding allowed.  This is what some call the “ratchet mechanism” and many see it as the saving grace of the new deal struck in Paris. The first turn of the ratchet comes in 2020, when nations will have to submit their new climate plans.  Then in 2023 there’ll be a “global stocktake” to track progress, before another turn of the ratchet in 2028, and so on. Dr Joeri Rogelj, of Austria’s International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis, is at the Marrakech talks. He tracks global emissions closely and his work helps inform the United Nations projections. “The INDCs are not in line with limiting global warming to below 2C and definitely not in line with 1.5C,” he says.  Because countries and economies can’t get their emissions down to zero overnight, Rogelj looks at the “pathways” that economies could take. He says if countries don’t raise their ambition, then by the year 2030 the world’s annual carbon footprint will be between 15 and 17 billion tonnes too high to make the 1.5C target (take off three billion tonnes for the 2C target). The world currently emits about 32 billion tonnes.  But despite this gap being a key issue, it was not a focus of the Marrakech talks.  Instead, one focus in Marrakech was to clarify all the rules related to NDCs so that each country could be confident that others were being transparent about their actions.  But in Marrakech, countries still sent out strong political signals about raising ambition while getting on with the job of cutting emissions.  A group of 47 countries most vulnerable to the impacts of climate change released a statement pledging that before 2050, they would get all their energy from renewable sources.  A new coalition of countries, including Australia, the UK and US, was announced with an aim to help developing nations deliver on their climate plans. Late into the second week, all countries agreed to the “Marrakech Action Proclamation” that called for “urgently raising ambition and strengthening cooperation amongst ourselves to close the gap between current emissions trajectories and the pathway needed to meet the long-term temperature goals of the Paris Agreement.” The medina-style bartering over just how ambitious countries are prepared to be on cutting emissions will go on, with the next major negotiations on this taking place in 2018.  “The gap is still large, but I didn’t expect anything else from Marrakech,” says Rogelj. “Probably it is a bargaining game, yes. That’s what these diplomatic negotiations are about. To find a way forward that’s acceptable to all the parties.”  Rogelj uses models that can deliver a whole suite of possible pathways that countries could take to slash their greenhouse gas levels. Just like in Marrakech’s snaking medina, there are multiple routes.  “You can slash emissions in ways that do not jeopardize economic growth, the eradication of poverty or food security,” he says.  “But these models can equally show pathways where things like food security are jeopardized. In the end, that’s a question for society. “They show trade offs for society and tell you that there might be consequences of choosing a particular pathway.” It’s easy to get lost in the medina, just as you can get lost in the complicated world of United Nations climate change negotiations.  But the political statements that have come from Marrakech suggest that when the bartering starts again, political leaders are clear about the price of failure."
"Climate change is set to cause a refugee crisis of “unimaginable scale”, according to senior military figures, who warn that global warming is the greatest security threat of the 21st century and that mass migration will become the “new normal”. The generals said the impacts of climate change were already factors in the conflicts driving a current crisis of migration into Europe, having been linked to the Arab Spring, the war in Syria and the Boko Haram terrorist insurgency.  Military leaders have long warned that global warming could multiply and accelerate security threats around the world by provoking conflicts and migration. They are now warning that immediate action is required. “Climate change is the greatest security threat of the 21st century,” said Maj Gen Munir Muniruzzaman, chairman of the Global Military Advisory Council on climate change and a former military adviser to the president of Bangladesh. He said one metre of sea level rise will flood 20% of his nation. “We’re going to see refugee problems on an unimaginable scale, potentially above 30 million people.”  Previously, Bangladesh’s finance minister, Abul Maal Abdul Muhith, called on Britain and other wealthy countries to accept millions of displaced people. Brig Gen Stephen Cheney, a member of the US Department of State’s foreign affairs policy board and CEO of the American Security Project, said: “Climate change could lead to a humanitarian crisis of epic proportions. We’re already seeing migration of large numbers of people around the world because of food scarcity, water insecurity and extreme weather, and this is set to become the new normal. “Climate change impacts are also acting as an accelerant of instability in parts of the world on Europe’s doorstep, including the Middle East and Africa,” Cheney said. “There are direct links to climate change in the Arab Spring, the war in Syria, and the Boko Haram terrorist insurgency in sub-Saharan Africa.” After Donald Trump, who has called climate change a hoax, won the US presidential election in November, Cheney said he expected senior military officials to impress upon Trump the grave threat posed to national security by global warming. “I’ve got to believe there are enough folks on the national security side that we can make a dent in this.” R Adm Neil Morisetti, a former commander of the UK maritime forces and the UK’s climate and energy security envoy, said: “Climate change is a strategic security threat that sits alongside others like terrorism and state-on-state conflict, but it also interacts with these threats. It is complex and challenging; this is not a concern for tomorrow, the impacts are playing out today.”  Morisetti said climate change would mean the UK military will be deployed more often to conflict and disaster zones. The military leaders were speaking ahead of an event in London on Thursday. In September, a coalition of 25 US military and national security experts, including former advisers to Ronald Reagan and George W Bush, warned that climate change poses a “significant risk to US national security and international security” that requires more attention from the US federal government.  In 2015, a UK foreign office report made a stark assessment of the dangers posed by unchecked global warming, including very large risks to global food security, increased risk of terrorism as states fail, and unprecedented migration that would overwhelm international assistance. “Countries are going to pay for climate change one way or another,” said Cheney. “The best way to pay for it is by tackling the root causes of climate change and cutting greenhouse gas emissions. If we do not, the national security impacts will be increasingly costly and challenging.”"
"It seems likely that the Paris climate accords will offer one of the first real tests of just how nuts Donald Trump actually is. For a waiting world it’s a public exam, his chance to demonstrate either that he’s been blowing smoke or deeply inhaling.  Think, if you will, of the Paris agreement as a toy painstakingly assembled over 25 years by many of the world’s leading lights. It has now been handed, as a gift, to the new child-emperor, and everyone is waiting to see what he’ll do. His buddies – the far-right, climate-denying, UN-hating renegades who formed his campaign brains trust – are egging him on to simply break it, to smash it on the floor for a good laugh. In fact, they’re doing their best to give him no way out. “President-elect Trump’s oft-repeated promises in the campaign are fairly black-and-white,” said Myron Ebell, head of his Environmental Protection Agency transition team, last week. (Ebell believes that the Paris deal is an attempt to “turn the world’s economy upside-down and consign poor people to perpetual poverty” – and that climate science is done by “third-rate, fourth-rate and fifth-rate scientists”.) On the other side are the world’s business leaders, 365 of whom just signed a letter asking Trump to keep America engaged in the Paris process to provide “long-term direction”. These are not people who have spent their lives in obscure rightwing thinktanks. They run stuff – like DuPont, General Mills, Hewlett-Packard, Hilton, Kellogg, Levi Strauss, Nike and Unilever. And it’s hard to run stuff if the rules keep changing There’s also a gang of Americans who care what the rest of the world thinks. A group of former military leaders this week sent Trump’s transition team a briefing book arguing that climate change presents a “significant and direct risk to US military readiness, operations and strategy”. Ben Cardin, a Delaware senator and the top Democrat on the Senate foreign affairs committee, said withdrawing from the Paris deal would damage “our credibility on other issues”. And then there’s the rest of the world. Other nations can’t be “weak” or “naive”, said France’s former (and perhaps future) president Nicolas Sarkozy. If Trump pulls the US out of Paris, Sarkozy proposes a carbon tariff on US goods. That won’t happen, but diplomats at the current climate talks in Marrakech have made it clear that leadership on the 21st century’s most important issue would pass from Washington to Beijing. So Trump faces a dilemma. Does he please his most extreme friends? If so, he will own every climate disaster in the next four years: every hurricane that smashes into the Gulf of Mexico will be Hurricane Donald, every drought that bakes the heartland will be a moment to mock his foolishness. That’s how that works. Or does he back down? It’s clear he won’t do anything to enforce the Paris accords anyway – to all intents and purposes Obama’s clean power plan expires at noon on 20 January, and Trump’s guys will give the green light to any pipeline anyone proposes. But if he doesn’t actually smash the global architecture of the Paris accords, he’ll win points from responsible people. That’s how that works. It’s entirely possible he’ll decide to do neither, and send the Paris accords to the Senate for some kind of show vote, letting the entire Republican party take the heat for its climate-denying views. This would demonstrate weakness of a particularly childish sort – the coat-holding boy who goads everyone else into a fight and steps back to watch. The irony here is that the Paris accords aren’t even very strong. They represent a lowest-common-denominator effort, one that will allow the world’s temperature to keep climbing dangerously. They were passed in no small part to allow the world’s leaders to strenuously pat themselves on the back for having done something. But at least the pact keeps the process moving – and there are mechanisms that might allow the world to ratchet up its efforts as the temperature climbs. It’s a tissue of compromise and gesture, a flimsy bulwark against the climbing mercury and rising sea. But wrecking it would be an act of political vandalism, one that would define Trump’s legacy before he has even taken office. So we’ll see."
"An appraisal of the winter floods of 2015-2016, published on the first anniversary of Storm Desmond, reveals it ranks alongside the devastating flooding of March 1947 as the largest event of at least the last century. November 2015 to January 2016 was the wettest three-month period in records dating back to 1910, while December was both the wettest and, on average, the warmest on record for the UK.  The highest ever rainfall recorded in the UK was seen at Honister Pass in the Lake District with 341.4mm (13.4 inches) falling in the 24 hours leading up to 6pm on December 5 2015, as Storm Desmond hit. The storm, which caused an estimated insurance bill of more than £1.3bn, was part of a persistent pattern of weather that also included the major storms of Abigail, Frank and Gertrude. Many rivers across northern England and Scotland saw record peak flows, as did the Mourne in Northern Ireland, the study by the Centre for Ecology and Hydrology (CEH) in collaboration with the British Hydrological Society found. The rivers Eden, Tyne and Lune in England saw record peaks of around 1,700 cubic metres per second – a volume of water that could fill London’s Royal Albert Hall in less than a minute, the experts said. Some 16,000 homes and businesses were flooded in December alone, with more flooding in January, although a further 20,000 homes were protected by defences. The study’s lead author, Terry Marsh, from CEH said: “At a national scale the winter floods of 2015-16 were the most extreme on record. The November to January period was the wettest three-month sequence in the UK rainfall series – which begins in 1910. “The associated flooding was both extensive and repetitive, and total river outflows from Great Britain following the passage of Storm Desmond in December exceeded the previous maximum by a substantial margin.” Dr Ed Henderson, a co-author of the review from the British Hydrological Society and Cumbrian resident, said the effects of the flooding were personal. “Thousands of Cumbrians, like people in other flood-affected parts of the country, have seen their lives upturned. Many have experienced life-changing financial losses and incredible stress. Speaking with flood victims, the words that come out are despair, fear and anxiety – fear of flooding again and the anxiety of an approaching winter. “Floods don’t just take your home, the place where you should feel safe, they often take your future as well.” The storms and flooding last winter follow the 2013-2014 flooding in southern England and other severe events including the 2005 and 2009 floods in Cumbria. Natural variability from year to year makes it hard to attribute the trend towards higher river flows in the last five decades to climate change, but recent studies do point towards manmade global warming playing a role in recent floods, said the report’s co-author Jamie Hannaford from CEH. Along with March 1947, which saw heavy rain and snow thaw after a freezing winter, causing flooding, the 2015-2016 floods are the largest such event of the last 100 years, the study said.  Last winter’s floods were more extreme in scale, but the 1947 events had a greater impact in terms of homes flooded and crops destroyed, in a country recovering from war and with only rudimentary flood defences."
"Malcolm Turnbull has been warned to expect backbench hostility if the government attempts to adopt carbon trading, even if a new scheme is restricted only to the electricity sector. The Liberal MP Craig Kelly, who chairs the backbench committee on environment and energy, told Guardian Australia on Monday carbon trading was “contrary to Coalition policy” and argued it was “highly unlikely that the Coalition would adopt carbon trading at any stage”.  The comments were backed up on Monday evening by the South Australian Liberal Senator Cory Bernardi, who told Sky News contemplating carbon pricing would reopen old divisions in Coalition ranks, and was one of the “dumbest” things he’d heard in politics for some time. LIVE NOW: @corybernardi says Government's climate change review will cause division in the party. On @SkyNewsAust https://t.co/CtxJNSkE5Y Kelly’s comments follow the release on Monday of terms of reference for a review of the government’s Direct Action policy, which leave open the option of reinstating a form of carbon trading in the electricity sector. Some stakeholders believe the Finkel review into energy security and Australia’s climate commitments may also float the desirability of an emissions intensity scheme for the electricity sector when it presents its preliminary fundings to Friday’s meeting of the prime minister and the premiers. The Direct Action review will require consideration of policy mechanisms to reduce emissions on a “sector-by-sector basis” – which is code for considering the adoption of a trading scheme in the electricity sector to manage the transition to low-emissions power sources. In media interviews on Monday morning, the environment and energy minister, Josh Frydenberg, said explicitly the review would canvas the desirability of a trading scheme for the electricity sector. Frydenberg also appeared to lay the ground not to extend the current federal renewable energy target of 23.5% by 2020, arguing the government was interested in lowest cost abatement. “When you look at the effectiveness, both in terms of cost as well as reducing emissions, of the various mechanisms that we have, the RET is not at the top of the list,” he said. Last week, the prime minister telegraphed the review could lead to changes to the federal RET. Kelly said on Monday it was a good time to review Direct Action and he said Frydenberg’s decision not to rule various policy changes in or out was reasonable. But he said there was no way Frydenberg would be able to persuade colleagues on the merits of carbon trading. “It wouldn’t have the support of the Coalition party room,” Kelly said. Kelly also poured cold water on the idea of looking at sectoral responses to reducing emissions, warning that could create “distortions if you tinker with one sector but leave another”. On extending the federal RET beyond 2020, Kelly said the current scheme was not causing problems for industry “but as soon as you start ramping it up beyond where we have it now it starts to bite in terms of costs and competitiveness”. He contended Australia could meet its commitments under the Paris international climate agreement without raising the RET by using other mechanisms such as energy efficiency. The government’s problems won’t be restricted to internal opposition if it ultimately goes down the carbon trading path. Kelly’s opposition to carbon trading was echoed on Monday by the One Nation senator Malcolm Roberts, who does not accept that climate change is occurring, or that humans are contributing to it. Federal Government to consider ‘ⓐⓝⓞⓣⓗⓔⓡ’ carbon price for power companies. https://t.co/D28fAQcEMe But business, energy and climate groups argue that Direct Action will not deliver the emissions reductions required to ensure Australia meets its international commitments. Business and climate groups have also been dismayed by a rerun of Australia’s toxic climate politics, triggered when the prime minister linked a statewide blackout in South Australia in September explicitly to the state’s use of renewable energy – which led to brawling between Canberra and the states on renewable energy targets. Both business and environmental groups want policy certainty, given hundreds of millions of dollars of new investment in low emissions technologies are on the line. The Climate Institute said on Monday the Direct Action review presented an opportunity to get serious about the challenges before Australia. “This 2017 review and consideration of post 2030 targets will make clear the choices that Australia’s political, business and community leaders make,” said the institute’s chief executive, John Connor. “We will stick with the chaos and point-scoring of the last decade, or move forward to manage the risks and grab the opportunities of the climate and clean energy challenge. “The review offers the chance for a real national conversation about how Australia can join other nations working towards net zero emissions by mid-century and modernising and decarbonising their energy systems. “As part of the review, next year Australia can choose to continue with costly and disruptive policy chaos and political point-scoring that is impacting on investment, electricity prices and energy security. Or we can choose to join the real world of responsible risk management and recognition of the economic opportunities in a world turning to clean energy.”"
"Two-year-old Zeka screams as a health worker measures the circumference of her arm while another holds her legs and presses her flesh. The nurses agree: Zeka has clear signs of edema, a swelling condition caused by extreme hunger. “She will live, but she needs to go to hospital. The situation in this area is much worse than when we were here just a few weeks ago.  “It looks like 10% of children here are now malnourished. It will certainly get worse,” said chief health assistant Ane Banda, who is leading a government assessment of rural areas near Nsanje, close to the Malawian border with Mozambique. “We have not eaten for days,” said Zeka’s mother, who has been living off wild fruit, water lilies and the kindness of neighbours but has been told to attend a food handout in her village the next day. Malawi is one of seven southern African countries on the brink of starvation and in a situation that the UN says needs requires immediate action. It has been devastated by a combination of a long drought caused by a strong El Niño weather cycle and climate change. Successive maize harvests have failed, leaving communities there and in Zambia, Congo, Zimbabwe, Mozambique and elsewhere, desperate for food. Madagascar is the most critical, said David Phiri, UN food and agriculture coordinator based in Harare, Zimbabawe. “Hundreds of thousands of people are on the brink of famine. We may see deaths there from starvation. People appear to have no food or money. The cost of inaction or further delaying our response is too ghastly to contemplate. It needs immediate action,” he warned. Hunger levels in parts of southern Madagascar stand at phase four of a five-point scale used by aid agencies, in which five is famine. “Our fear is not a widespread famine across southern Africa but hotspots of deep hunger in different countries. People have exhausted all their reserves now and their coping mechanisms. “If food does not arrive, it will lead to serious issues like childhood stunting, which have lifelong impacts. Even if people recover, they will be prone to cardiovascular diseases.” Forty million people in southern Africa and a further 11 million in Ethiopia will need food aid over the next few months, Phiri said. But many may get little or nothing because only 25% of the $2.9bn in aid sought by the seven most affected countries has been pledged. A separate World Food Programme appeal for $600m is only half-funded. “We expected more money to have been pledged by now but we understand donor budgets are limited. There are many hotspots around the world which need food relief and which are considered more critical than southern Africa,” said Phiri. “The numbers of people needing emergency food are rising fast,” said Coco Ushiyama, head of the World Food Programme in Malawi. “The situation is building up. In November 5.7 million Malawians needed food, in December it will be 6.2 million. “By January we will have 6.5 million hungry people – almost one in three people. This will last until at least March. Malawi is the highest impacted of all the affected countries. “Money [from donor governments] has come, though not as fast as we would like. We have had to cut people to half rations when there was not enough. We are diverting ships, and money is being reallocated from other budgets.” “The peak of the crisis will be in January. Distributing the food to remote areas will be difficult,” said Danny Harvey, country director of Concern Worldwide in Zambia, where nearly 1 million people need aid. Southern Africa has been forgotten again. “The food is just not there in some places. The water situation is quite desperate in some places. Streams have dried up,” she said . China has delivered 5,500 tonnes of rice to Zimbabawe, but the country has received only 40% of the $350m requested to feed 5.5 million people, said the UN. Britain says the Department for International Development has given the second most humanitarian aid after the US. “[We have provided] £356m for the total UK response to El Niño across Africa, including £43.1m for Malawi. The humanitarian system as a whole still needs to improve its early response mechanisms,” said James Wharton, international development minister. “While some international agencies reacted well to the El Niño early warning in 2015, others have not. Tackling the global challenges of our time, such as climate change, which can fuel migration, insecurity and instability, is firmly in Britain’s national interest,” he said following a visit to Malawi. DfId says 52 million people suffer from food insecurity, one million children require treatment for severe acute malnutrition and 5.8 million people need emergency water and sanitation in Ethiopia alone. “The response to this predicted, slow-onset crisis has been too little too late. Despite the crisis coming on the heels of a poor growing season in 2014 and an economic downturn, the region’s governments were slow to scale up their response, as were the humanitarian agencies,” said Oxfam in a briefing note. Above-normal rains are predicted in most parts of the region, which could support harvests and replenish water sources, but are also likely to bring the threat of flooding, said Nellie Nyang’wa, Oxfam Zambia director. “Farmers desperately need seeds and fertilisers if they are to take advantage of rains and produce better harvests next year,” she said."
"Wave the magic wand and the problem goes away. Those pesky pollution laws, carbon caps and clean-power plans: swish them away and the golden age of blue-collar employment will return. This is Donald Trump’s promise, in his video message on Monday, in which the US president-elect claimed that unleashing coal and fracking would create “many millions of high-paid jobs”. He will tear down everything to make it come true. But it won’t come true. Even if we ripped the world to pieces in the search for full employment, leaving no mountain unturned, we would not find it. Instead, we would merely jeopardise the prosperity – and the lives – of people everywhere. However slavishly governments grovel to corporate Luddism, they will not bring the smog economy back.  No one can deny the problem Trump claims to be addressing. The old mining and industrial areas are in crisis throughout the rich world. And we have seen nothing yet. I have just reread the study published by the Oxford Martin School in 2013 on the impacts of computerisation. What jumps out, to put it crudely, is that jobs in the rust belts and rural towns that voted for Trump are at high risk of automation, while the professions of many Hillary Clinton supporters are at low risk. The jobs most likely to be destroyed are in mining, raw materials, manufacturing, transport and logistics, cargo handling, warehousing and retailing, construction (prefabricated buildings will be assembled by robots in factories), office support, administration and telemarketing. So what, in the areas that voted for Trump, will be left? Farm jobs have mostly gone already. Service and care work, where hope for some appeared to lie, will be threatened by a further wave of automation, as service robots – commercial and domestic – take over. Yes, there will be jobs in the green economy: more and better than any that could be revived in the fossil economy. But they won’t be enough to fill the gaps, and many will be in the wrong places for those losing their professions. At lower risk is work that requires negotiation, persuasion, originality and creativity. The management and business jobs that demand these skills are comparatively safe from automation; so are those of lawyers, teachers, researchers, doctors, journalists, actors and artists. The jobs that demand the highest educational attainment are the least susceptible to computerisation. The divisions tearing America apart will only widen. Even this bleak analysis does not capture in full the underlying reasons why good, abundant jobs will not return to the places that need them most. As Paul Mason argues in PostCapitalism, the impacts of information technology go way beyond simple automation: they are likely to destroy the very basis of the market economy, and the relationship between work and wages. And, as the French writer Paul Arbair notes in the most interesting essay I have read this year, beyond a certain level of complexity economies become harder to sustain. There’s a point at which further complexity delivers diminishing returns; society is then overwhelmed by its demands, and breaks down. He argues that the political crisis in western countries suggests we may have reached this point. Trump has also announced that on his first day in office he will withdraw America from the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP). He is right to do so, but for the wrong reasons. Like TTIP and Ceta, the TPP is a fake trade treaty whose primary impact is to extend corporate property rights at the expense of both competition and democracy. But withdrawal will not, as he claims, “bring jobs and industry back to American shores”. The work in Mexico and China that Trump wants to reclaim will evaporate long before it can be repatriated. As for the high-quality, high-waged working-class jobs he promised, these are never handed down from on high. They are secured through the organisation of labour. But the unions were smashed by Ronald Reagan, and collective bargaining has been suppressed ever since by casualisation and fragmentation. So how is this going to happen? Out of the kindness of Trump’s heart? Kindness, Trump, heart? But it’s not just Trump. Clinton and Bernie Sanders also made impossible promises to bring back jobs. Half the platform of each party was based on a delusion. The social, environmental and economic crises we face require a complete reappraisal of the way we live and work. The failure by mainstream political parties to produce a new and persuasive economic narrative, which does not rely on sustaining impossible levels of growth and generating illusory jobs, provides a marvellous opening for demagogues everywhere. Governments across the world are making promises they cannot keep. In the absence of a new vision, their failure to materialise will mean only one thing: something or someone must be found to blame. As people become angrier and more alienated, as the complexity and connectivity of global systems becomes ever harder to manage, as institutions such as the European Union collapse and as climate change renders parts of the world uninhabitable, forcing hundreds of millions of people from their homes, the net of blame will be cast ever wider. Eventually the anger that cannot be assuaged through policy will be turned outwards, towards other nations. Faced with a choice between hard truths and easy lies, politicians and their supporters in the media will discover that foreign aggression is among the few options for political survival. I now believe that we will see war between the major powers within my lifetime. Which ones it will involve, and on what apparent cause, remains far from clear. But something that once seemed remote now looks probable. A complete reframing of economic life is needed not just to suppress the existential risk that climate change presents (a risk marked by a 20°C anomaly reported in the Arctic Ocean while I was writing this article), but other existential threats as well – including war. Today’s governments, whether they are run by Trump or Obama or May or Merkel, lack the courage and imagination even to open this conversation. It is left to others to conceive of a more plausible vision than trying to magic back the good old days. The task for all those who love this world and fear for our children is to imagine a different future rather than another past."
"More than 300 people rallied in Melbourne on Monday to protest against a proposed $1bn federal government loan to Adani for a rail line before an expected meeting in the city between Malcolm Turnbull and the head of the Indian mining company, Gautam Adani. Adani and Turnbull were expected to meet on the sidelines of the Australian Indian Leadership Dialogue in Melbourne, which they are both scheduled to attend. The minister for northern Australia, Matt Canavan, confirmed the federal government was considering lending $1bn toward the construction of a 310km rail line from the proposed Galilee Basin coalmine to the port.  The potential funding deal was reported on Saturday. Canavan told the ABC’s RN Breakfast that the proposal was currently before the independent panel of the National Australia Infrastructure Fund (NAIF), which makes recommendations to government on how the $5bn fund should be spent. Canavan said there was “no decision to be made by the federal government at this stage” but that it would not be unusual for it to support mining infrastructure. He said progress on the proposed mine was “good news for our country”. “It is a major project, it will be the first time a new minerals basin has opened up for 40 years, and this has the potential to be the platform for many other projects in our region as well,” he said. “We have some of the highest-quality coal in the world, so providing India with its energy needs from Australian coal is good for the environment because it burns at a higher rate and produces less emissions per kilowatt hour produced.” The Galilee Basin is the largest untapped coal reserve in Australia but the coal is lower quality. Six companies, of which Adani is the largest, have sought permits to develop the basin, despite warnings from scientists and conservationists that it could damage the already fragile Great Barrier Reef. A recent report said mining Australia’s untapped coal reserves, including the Galilee Basin, could produce enough emissions to push global warming beyond 2C. Canavan dismissed concerns about the quality of the coal, saying it was higher quality than coal being mined in Indonesia and South Africa, India’s two other options for cheap fuel. India, he said, was “agnostic” about where the coal came from. The Australian Conservation Foundation’s campaign director, Paul Sinclair, said at the protest in Melbourne’s Treasury Gardens that committing any funding toward the project would break the Turnbull government’s election promise.  “Malcolm Turnbull has a very clear choice to make,” Sinclair said. “He made an iron-clad promise during the election campaign, which he can honour, or he can make a dirty deal with a billionaire polluter and bankroll coal.” Behind him, the crowd chanted “reef not coal.” Under these terrifying Pixar bobbleheads are Sean Dougherty (Nemo) and Marie Lakey (Dory). They look uncomfortable. #adaniprotest pic.twitter.com/ShtyfZbHdV Sinclair said Canavan’s comments about the relative quality of the coal was misleading and accused the government of trying to drum up public support by leaking the NAIF proposal. “I think that the government is in fairyland when they say coal is good for the environment,” he said. “It’s like saying smoking is good for your health.” Charlie Wood, campaign director for 350.org, said the suggestion of any federal funding for Adani’s project was “deeply concerning.” “It’s a sign that the government is putting the big polluters ahead of the people they are here to represent,” Wood said. “Here we are outside while Gautam Adani, the head of one of the biggest coal companies in the world, is meeting with our prime minister ... has that level of access. This is outrageous.” Behind Wood, two masked protesters showing Turnbull as a puppet being controlled by Adani tried not to crash into the crowd.  Among the protesters was Mary Beech, who told Guardian Australia she began fighting to save the reef to honour her parents, who moved to northern Queensland after the second world war. “It is 30 years ago tomorrow that my mother died,” Beech said. “At the funeral she didn’t want flowers, all the money went toward saving the reef and saving the Daintree … I’m so against the government using taxpayers money to fund this dirty, dirty coalmine.” India, she said, could meet its energy needs elsewhere. “If it wants its coal that badly it can get it from somewhere else,” she said."
"Some may know the US photographer Danny Lyon for late-1960s shots of outlaw motorcycle gangs. Others may be familiar with his photograph of Bernie Sanders as a young protester at a 1962 Chicago University sit-in, which surfaced during this presidential campaign, or Lyon’s record of the marches staged by the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee, which remain some of the most valuable visual representations of the civil rights movement.  This one-time Magnum Photos member has photographed John Lennon, Muhammad Ali and Bob Dylan, and documented the industrialization of peasant life in China and the lives of homeless children in Bogotá. A travelling retrospective of his work, Message to the Future, just opened at San Francisco’s de Young museum after a successful run at the Whitney earlier this year. Other, less confrontational septuagenarians might settle for promoting a few classic images in their later years. Not only does Lyon reject this (“There is a show now of my work in a London gallery,” he says. “I have nothing to do with it and no interest in publicizing it”), but he’s applying his type of 60s-style protest tactics to what he regards as today’s most pressing issue: climate change. Lyon’s new photobook, Burn Zone (available on his site as a free PDF and as a $25 printed book) is, in part, a record of the ecological collapse he has witnessed as an on/off resident within the New Mexico stretch of the Rio Grande valley. Lyon, a New Yorker, arrived in the region back in 1970, “with some marijuana in my pocket and $5,000 from a Guggenheim Fellowship, enough to purchase two and a half acres of irrigated valley land”, as he puts it in Burn Zone. Living off the grid, the photographer built his own house and grew his own food, until his marriage collapsed in the late 1970s. Heading back east for the next three decades, the photographer has returned to New Mexico in recent years, to find river levels have dropped, the temperature has risen and droughts and wildfires afflict his smallholding. “The largest fire in the history of New Mexico could be seen from my house,” he explains. “I was able to take my truck and my dog and drive right into the burn zone. It’s stunning, as if the battle of Verdun had taken place over a 40-mile stretch of national forest.” The pictures Lyon shot of this and other aspects of local climate change are moving, yet his new book isn’t a simple ecological lament. Working with the 33-year-old climate activist Josephine Ferorelli, Lyon has also included a list of 50 “Climate Criminals” in Burn Zone, detailing not only their names and alleged actions, but also telephone numbers, postal and email addresses, and social media handles. Vice-President-elect Mike Pence and the Koch brothers make the list, as well as many lesser-known fossil fuel executives and statesmen. “I wanted to make it clear that the forces actively trying to destroy life on Earth as we know it, and who are doing it for the basest of motives – greed – are real live humans like ourselves, with homes, addresses, phone numbers, emails and that they should be shunned,” explains Lyon. “To do this they have to be identified.” Lyon, who was once jailed a few cells along from Martin Luther King Jr, knows he is using an old playbook to fight for his new cause. “I am a 60s person and think in terms of the civil rights movement,” he admits. However, he also recognizes that this new threat is both graver and more diffuse. “The climate movement is global and vast,” he says. “It is so vast, it involves so many actions and people and is so diverse as to be, in a way, invisible.” The photographer feels climate change threatens both his land and his bloodline. Lyon met co-author Ferorelli via his youngest daughter, Rebecca, after she showed interest in Ferorelli’s organisation Conceivable Future. The group supports reproductive justice amid the dangers of climate change, Ferorelli says. “As a selfish parent, hoping to spend his dotage playing with grandchildren,” says Lyon, “I was alarmed when via Facebook I learned of Conceivable Future and of my daughter Rebecca’s keen interest.” It’s unclear whether Danny’s involvement has encouraged his daughter to rethink motherhood, yet this new cause has certainly invigorated the photographer. “I think it is extremely important for everyone to have a bit of courage,” he says, “to step up to the plate, so to speak, whatever the consequences.” And perhaps it is a tiny bit easier for Lyon to find the courage because he has stepped up before."
"The Turnbull government has left open the option of reinstating a form of carbon trading in the electricity sector, allowing its looming review of the Direct Action climate policy to consider policy mechanisms to reduce emissions on a “sector-by-sector basis”. The government has also put the emissions reduction fund and its safeguard mechanism on the table for the review, which will be conducted internally within the federal Department of Environment and Energy, and report at the end of 2017.  Many experts argue the existing framework of Direct Action could be converted to a baseline and credit scheme with a few tweaks. A baseline and credit scheme is a form of carbon trading. The terms of reference for the review will be outlined on Monday by the minister for environment and energy, Josh Frydenberg. A preliminary report of the Finkel review into energy security and Australia’s climate commitments will also be handed to the prime minister and the premiers at a Coag meeting early this month. The Direct Action review is a key test of the Turnbull government’s bona fides on climate change, as the current policy has been widely criticised as inadequate to the task of allowing Australia to meet its international emissions reduction targets under the Paris climate change agreement. Business, energy and environment groups have also repeatedly called on the government to stow the toxic climate politics and provide policy certainty in order to allow the long-term investments necessary in low emissions and renewable energy sources to ensure the national electricity market, and emissions-intensive sectors of the economy, can manage an orderly transition to a carbon-constrained future. But if the government attempts to use the review to create a more ambitious climate policy, or to reopen the carbon pricing debate, that will almost certainly trigger significant internal divisions within Coalition ranks, with conservatives and Nationals already engaged in preliminary positioning on the issue. A recent decision by the government to ratify the Paris climate agreement triggered a contained breakout on the Coalition backbench, with some arguing the election of Donald Trump to the presidency of the United States meant global climate action was, as they termed it, “cactus”. The Direct Action review, while carefully worded, is potentially wide ranging in scope, allowing consideration of the potential role of international carbon credits in meeting Australia’s emissions reduction targets – a practice Tony Abbott comprehensively ruled out as prime minister. The review also allows consideration of a post-2030 emissions reduction goal for Australia. Opening up the sector-by-sector conversation would potentially allow the government to contemplate an emissions intensity trading system for the electricity sector, which some stakeholders think the Finkel review may recommend to the government. The South Australian government has been championing an emissions intensity trading scheme through the energy ministers council to drive an orderly transition in the electricity sector from coal to lower-emissions power sources. An emissions intensity scheme for electricity would favour gas as a transitional fuel, and Frydenberg has been laying the groundwork for months on policies that would allow more gas exploration. The Direct Action review requires an assessment of the impact of climate policies on “jobs, investment, trade competitiveness, households and regional Australia.” It also implicitly references a brawl the Turnbull government has been indulging with state governments over their state-based renewable energy targets, by requiring an examination of the “integration of climate change and energy policy, including the impact of state-based policies on achieving an effective national approach”. State governments argue they have stepped into the breach with ambitious RETs because the commonwealth made such a hash of renewables policy during the period of the Abbott government, putting a question mark over the federal RET which triggered an investment drought in the sector. The states also point out that their RETs are doing a lot of the heavy policy lifting to help Australia meet its Paris targets. The review also requires an examination of international developments in climate change policy, which is code for an assessment of what is happening on global climate action in the event the US pulls out of the Paris climate agreement. The Turnbull government has already indicated that it intends to stay the course with the Paris agreement, and it has argued it would take the US four years to withdraw from the deal under the terms of ratification. Frydenberg said in a statement the government would consult with business and the community throughout the 12-month Direct Action review process. “Australia’s approach to climate policy is to meet our international emissions reduction commitments while at the same time maintaining energy security and affordability,” the minister said. “The government is committed to adopting a non-ideological approach to emissions reduction to ensure we secure the lowest cost of abatement.”"

"Because America is entirely governed by two political parties, passage of legislation usually requires bipartisan support in US Congress. However, the Republican Party is the only major political party in the world that denies the need to tackle climate change. Therefore, for several years any hope of passing climate legislation hinged upon breaking through the near-universal opposition among Republican legislators. A number of groups have focused on doing just that. In the wake of the 2016 US election results, I contacted these groups to assess their feelings about the prospects of US government action on climate change in the near future. The general sentiment was understandably one of discouraged pessimism, but each group identified glimmers of hope.  Citizens’ Climate Lobby (CCL) is one of the leading grassroots climate organizations in America, and has also expanded rapidly internationally. The group has seen explosive growth in recent years, now hosting chapters in 356 of America’s 435 congressional districts (over 80%), with a membership approaching 50,000 strong. Under the CCL proposal, carbon pollution is taxed at the source, and 100% of the revenue is returned to taxpayers via a regular rebate check. It’s a bipartisan solution – liberals get their desired carbon pollution tax, while conservatives get a free market policy that doesn’t grow the size of government. Moreover, modeling projects that the policy will have a net overall positive effect on the economy. Citizens’ Climate Lobby has also achieved several significant successes. The group was involved in spearheading the Gibson Resolution, in which 15 Republican members of Congress called for action to tackle the risks posed by climate change. CCL was also the driving force behind the creation of the House Climate Solutions Caucus – a group currently comprised of 10 Republican and 10 Democratic members of Congress exploring bipartisan climate policy solutions. And CCL initiated the California state government’s Resolution urging the federal government to pass a revenue-neutral carbon tax. According to CCL Executive Director Mark Reynolds, the 2016 election didn’t change group’s strategy. As Reynolds told me, because Democrats are already on board with climate policy: Our path to legislation has always gone through the Republican Party. As an organization with a long history of working with Republicans on climate policy, now that the Republican Party controls US government, CCL is now more relevant and important than ever. Reynolds told me that since the election results, traffic to CCL’s website has increased eightfold, and attendance of its weekly introductory calls has spiked from an average of about 20 to 200 last week. The majority of Americas who are unhappy with the election results have become galvanized, which bodes well for grassroots support of climate solutions. Reynolds also sees an opportunity for Republicans to take control of the climate issue after many liberals rallied against a revenue-neutral carbon tax proposal in the state of Washington. This opens up a window for the Republican Party to take ownership of one of the best policies to tackle climate change. As Donald Trump might put it, a revenue-neutral carbon tax is “a great deal” because it efficiently addresses the problem while boosting the economy, and the rebate protects American wallets from rising energy prices. The Republican Party has thus far opposed all climate policies in Congress, but the Supreme Court ruled that the EPA must regulate carbon pollution, and it began doing so under President Obama. Some have proposed that the easiest way for the GOP to eliminate those government climate regulations – which party leaders abhor, but most Republican voters support – would be to replace them with free market legislation. For example the Niskanen Center is a free market think tank that supports this type of policy, and has proposed swapping EPA regulations for a revenue-neutral carbon tax. The group’s president Jerry Taylor wrote a detailed post about the prospects of a carbon tax under the incoming Republican leadership, which is well worth reading. Taylor thinks that Republican leaders are now less likely to propose a climate tax than prior to the election for several reasons. First, they will likely devote the next several years to delaying, weakening, and/or eliminating the EPA regulations, rather than replacing them. Because of the Supreme Court decision, eliminating the regulations will be difficult, but since Trump will appoint at least one justice to the court, it may not fully survive legal challenges. However, if it does survive, the next president could fully restore the EPA regulations if Congress declines to replace them with legislation. While this offers a glimmer of hope that the GOP could pass a climate bill, it’s doubtful that party leaders will be so forward-thinking. Second, the election results made it clear that climate denial will not hurt most Republican politicians in elections. Third, while many Republican members of Congress privately accept the reality of climate change and the need to address it, and Niskanen has identified several who would be willing to introduce climate legislation if the opportunity were to present itself, Taylor believes the election results make such a political opportunity less likely. The R Street Institute is a free market think tank that has likewise made the conservative case for a revenue-neutral carbon tax. The group’s president Eli Lehrer believes the chances of carbon tax legislation would have been low regardless of the election outcome. As he told me: A carbon tax would be a possibility in the context of broad tax reform and if such reform moves forward as it may, I suppose there is some chance it could be part of a package … A carbon tax per se is not highly likely and is not something we plan to push ourselves right now but it is not impossible either.  R Street Energy Policy Director Catrina Rorke elaborated where she sees opportunities in cutting carbon pollution under the incoming government: We’re focused on streamlining regulatory barriers to entry to electricity markets, an obstacle that plagues emerging and advanced technologies with characteristics quite different from their predecessors. We also think we can make major strides in updating the way the federal regulatory machine works, given that the underlying legislation is outdated and insufficiently flexible ... If politics is the art of the possible, we’re really going to see some interesting things happen -- for governance and for the climate. These groups were generally pessimistic about the prospects of a climate bill coming from the next Congress, but they did spot glimmers of hope, and the future isn’t set in stone. In its 2016 Congressional lobbying effort, CCL reported that Republican members of Congress were 10 times more likely to be receptive to the group’s message than to be hostile, up from a 3-to-1 ratio just two years ago. Many GOP policymakers recognize the threats posed by climate change, at least in private. As Jerry Taylor noted, they just need the political opportunity for climate legislation to present itself. That political opportunity would require something to change – for Republican climate leadership to be rewarded rather than punished. It’s difficult to envision that change happening in the next few years, but not impossible. Groups like CCL will continue working behind the scenes to help make it happen. In the meantime, the R Street Institute foresees other opportunities to chip away at US carbon pollution levels. It’s not an encouraging landscape for protecting future generations from a climate catastrophe, but at least there’s hope. And if the GOP crushes that hope over the next four years, it seems likely that the Democratic Party will have a good chance to restore it in 2020."
"Please don’t read this unless you are feeling strong. This is a list of 13 major crises that, I believe, confront us. There may be more. Please feel free to add to it or to knock it down. I’m sorry to say that it’s not happy reading.  The next occupant of the White House will be a man who appears to possess no capacity for restraint, balance or empathy, but a bottomless capacity for revenge and vindictiveness. He has been granted a clean sweep of power, with both houses and the supreme court in his pocket. He is surrounding himself with people whose judgment and knowledge of the world are, to say the least, limited. He will take charge of the world’s biggest nuclear and conventional arsenals, and the most extensive surveillance and security apparatus any state has ever developed. In making strategic military decisions, he has a free hand, with the capacity to act even without the nominal constraint of Congress. His national security adviser, Michael T Flynn, is a dangerous extremist. Trump’s team is partly composed of professional lobbyists hired by fossil fuel, tobacco, chemical and finance companies and assorted billionaires. Their primary political effort is to avoid regulation and taxation. These people – or rather the interests they represent – are now in charge. Aside from the implications for the living world, public health, public finance and financial stability, this is a vindication of the political model pioneered by the tobacco companies in the 1960s. It demonstrates that if you spend enough money setting up thinktanks, academic posts and fake grassroots movements, and work with the corporate media to give them a platform, you can buy all the politics you need. Democracy becomes a dead letter. Political alternatives are shut down. Meanwhile, on this side of the Atlantic, Britain’s attempts to disentangle itself from the European Union are confronted with a level of complexity that may be insuperable. Moreover, there may be no answer to the political fix in which the government finds itself. This is as follows: a) either it agrees to the free movement of people in exchange for access to the single market, in which case the pro-Brexit camp will have gained nothing except massive embarrassment, or b) the EU slams the shutters down. Not only is it likely to reject the terms the government proposes; but it might also try to impose an exit bill of about €60 billion for the costs incurred by our withdrawal. This would be politically impossible for the government to pay, leading to a non-negotiated rupture and the hardest imaginable Brexit. The Italian banking crisis looks big. What impact this might have on the survival of the eurozone is anyone’s guess. Whether it is also sufficient to trigger another global financial crisis is again hard to judge. If such a thing were to occur, governments would not be able to mount a rescue plan of the kind they used in 2007-8. The coffers are empty. Automation will destroy jobs on an unprecedented scale, and because the penetration of information technology into every part of the economy is not a passing phase but an escalating trend, it is hard to see how this employment will be replaced. No government or major political party anywhere shows any sign of comprehending the scale of this issue. Marine Le Pen has a moderate to fair chance of becoming the French president in May. Whether this would be sufficient to trigger the collapse of the EU is another unknown. If this is not a sufficient crisis, there are several others lining up (especially the growing nationalist movements across central and eastern Europe in particular, but to a lesser extent almost everywhere) that could catalyse a chain reaction. I believe that when this begins, it will happen with a speed that will take almost everyone by surprise. From one month to the next, the EU could cease to exist. If Le Pen wins, the permanent members of the UN security council will be represented by the following people: Donald Trump, Vladimir Putin, Xi Jinping, Theresa May and Marine Le Pen. It would be a stretch to call that reassuring. National climate change programmes bear no connection to the commitments governments made at Paris. Even if these programmes are fully implemented (they won’t be), they set us on a climate-change trajectory way beyond that envisaged by the agreement. And this is before we know what Trump will do. One of the many impacts of climate breakdown – aside from such minor matters as the inundation of cities, the loss of food production and curtailment of water supplies – will be the mass movement of people, to an extent that dwarfs current migration. The humanitarian, political and military implications are off the scale. According to the UN food and agriculture organisation, at current rates of soil loss we have 60 years of harvests left. The extinction crisis appears, if anything, to be accelerating. Enough already? Sorry, no. One of the peculiarities of this complex, multiheaded crisis is that there appears to be no “other side” on to which we might emerge. It is hard to imagine a realistic scenario in which governments lose the capacity for total surveillance and drone strikes; in which billionaires forget how to manipulate public opinion; in which a broken EU reconvenes; in which climate breakdown unhappens, species return from extinction and the soil comes back to the land. These are not momentary crises, but appear to presage permanent collapse. So the key question is not how we weather them but how – if this is possible – we avert them. Can it be done? If so what would it take? I write this not to depress you, though I know it will have that effect, but to concentrate our minds on the scale of the task."
"Canada has announced plans to phase out the use of coal-fired electricity by 2030. The move is in stark contrast to President-elect Donald Trump’s vow to revive the American coal industry.  The environment minister, Kathleen McKenna, said the goal is to make sure 90% of Canada’s electricity comes from sustainable sources by that time – up from 80% today. The announcement is one of a series of measures Justin Trudeau’s Liberal government is rolling out as part of a broader climate change plan. Trudeau also has plans to implement a carbon tax. Trump, in contrast, has also said he would “cancel” the Paris agreement. Trudeau told President Obama this past weekend he would miss working with him because he shared so many values. France, Britain, the Netherlands, Austria and Denmark have all announced accelerated coal phase-outs, McKenna said. “Taking traditional coal power out of our energy mix and replacing it with cleaner technologies will significantly reduce our greenhouse gas emissions, improve the health of Canadians, and benefit generations for years to come,” McKenna said. Four of Canada’s 10 provinces still use coal-based electricity. Alberta had been working toward phasing out coal-fired electricity by 2030."
"Hurricane Otto strengthened to a category two storm as it made landfall on the sparsely populated Caribbean border between Nicaragua and Costa Rica as an unusually strong late-season event. The US National Hurricane Center said Otto hit land near the town of San Juan de Nicaragua with winds of 110 mph around midday local time.   Nicaragua also closed schools and was evacuating more than 10,000 people from communities in the storm’s path. Heavy rains were expected to affect the whole country on Thursday and Friday, raising the possibility of flooding and landslides. Heavy rains from the storm were blamed for three deaths in Panama, and officials in Costa Rica ordered the evacuation of 4,000 people from its Caribbean coast and closed schools nationwide for the rest of the week as the storm approached.  Costa Rica has already experienced flooding in some areas and the president, Luis Guillermo Solís, announced that public employees would not have to work on Thursday or Friday. The country’s National Meteorological Institute noted that a hurricane had never made landfall in Costa Rica since records-keeping began. Otto is the southernmost hurricane on record to hit Central America. The US National Hurricane Center said the storm had regained hurricane strength late on Wednesday night after fluctuating between tropical storm and hurricane status earlier in the week. By Thursday morning, Otto’s maximum sustained winds had increased to nearly 105mph (165km/h) with additional strengthening possible before landfall. In Bluefields, Nicaragua the nearest big town on the Nicaraguan coast residents prepared to ride out the hurricane.  “In our house, we have packed up some things in plastic bags and we went out to buy some provisions, just in case,” said Bluefields resident Jean Hodgson. “But if we had to leave our house, we don’t know where we could take refuge.” The area is low-lying and easily flooded.  Further south and closer to where Otto hit residents in the coastal town of Punta Gorda said they were planning to ride out the hurricane. “There is fear, because these kinds of things are scary, but we are praying and doing what the authorities have told us to do,” said Punta Gorda resident Sara Pantin.  By Thursday morning, 16 government shelters in Costa Rica held about 1,335 evacuees. People often take shelter with relatives during such evacuations.  Costa Rican President Luis Guillermo Solís said Otto could damage the country’s important coffee and agriculture sectors. Nicaragua also feared damage for impoverished farmers and to coffee crops that are almost ready to harvest."
"Arctic scientists have warned that the increasingly rapid melting of the ice cap risks triggering 19 “tipping points” in the region that could have catastrophic consequences around the globe. The Arctic Resilience Report found that the effects of Arctic warming could be felt as far away as the Indian Ocean, in a stark warning that changes in the region could cause uncontrollable climate change at a global level. Temperatures in the Arctic are currently about 20C above what would be expected for the time of year, which scientists describe as “off the charts”. Sea ice is at the lowest extent ever recorded for the time of year. “The warning signals are getting louder,” said Marcus Carson of the Stockholm Environment Institute and one of the lead authors of the report. “[These developments] also make the potential for triggering [tipping points] and feedback loops much larger.” Climate tipping points occur when a natural system, such as the polar ice cap, undergoes sudden or overwhelming change that has a profound effect on surrounding ecosystems, often irreversible. In the Arctic, the tipping points identified in the new report, published on Friday, include: growth in vegetation on tundra, which replaces reflective snow and ice with darker vegetation, thus absorbing more heat; higher releases of methane, a potent greenhouse gas, from the tundra as it warms; shifts in snow distribution that warm the ocean, resulting in altered climate patterns as far away as Asia, where the monsoon could be effected; and the collapse of some key Arctic fisheries, with knock-on effects on ocean ecosystems around the globe. The research, compiled by 11 organisations including the Arctic Council and six universities, comes at a critical time, not only because of the current Arctic temperature rises but in political terms.  Aides to the US president-elect, Donald Trump, this week unveiled plans to remove the budget for climate change science currently used by Nasa and other US federal agencies for projects such as examining Arctic changes, and to spend it instead on space exploration. “That would be a huge mistake,” said Carson, noting that much more research needs to be done on polar tipping points before we can understand the true dangers, let alone hope to tackle them. “It would be like ripping out the aeroplane’s cockpit instruments while you are in mid-flight.” He added: “These are very serious problems, very serious changes are happening, but they are still poorly understood. We need more research to understand them. A lot of the major science is done by the US.” Scientists have speculated for some years that so-called feedback mechanisms – by which the warming of one area or type of landscape has knock-on effects for whole ecosystems – could suddenly take hold and change the dynamics of Arctic ice melting from a relatively slow to a fast-moving phenomenon with unpredictable and potentially irreversible consequences for global warming. For instance, when sea ice shrinks it leaves areas of dark ocean that absorb more heat than the reflective ice, which in turn causes further shrinkage, and so on in a spiral. The Arctic ice cap helps to cool sea and air temperatures, by reflecting much of the sun’s radiation back into space, and acting as a global cooler when winds and ocean currents swirl over and under it. It has long been known to play a key part of the global climate system, but the difficulty and expense of close monitoring have meant that scientists have only in recent years been able to make detailed assessments. The report, billed as the first comprehensive study of ecosystems and societies in the region, found: “The potential effects of Arctic regime shifts [or tipping points] on the rest of the world are substantial, yet poorly understood. Human-driven climate change greatly increases the risk of Arctic regime shifts, so reducing global greenhouse gas emissions is crucial to reducing this risk.” The authors also warned that people living in and near the Arctic would be badly affected, and called for communities to be provided with equipment and skills to survive. They took evidence from a variety of settlements in the region, finding many signs of stark changes already under way. Joel Clement, co-chair of the project and director of the office of policy analysis at the US Department of the Interior, said: “This groundbreaking report is an unprecedented effort to gain insight from what is happening on the ground. The findings are foundational to a more informed, coordinated response to building resilience across the region.”"
"At first glance, the progress reports on the Great Barrier Reef released last week by the Australian and Queensland governments might seem impressive. The update on the Reef 2050 Plan suggests that 135 of the plan’s 151 actions are either complete or on track. The Australian government’s apparent intention in releasing five recent reports is to reassure Unesco that the Great Barrier Reef should not be listed as “world heritage in danger” (as the world heritage committee has previously threatened). Sadly, behind the verbosity and colour of these reports, there is disappointingly little evidence of progress in the key areas needed to make a significant difference to a world heritage area that is in crisis. The government framework for protecting and managing the reef from 2015 to 2050, the Reef 2050 Plan, has been widely criticised as failing to provide a sound basis for the necessary long-term protection of the reef. As well as providing a shaky basis to build effective actions, the Reef 2050 Plan has few measurable or realistic targets. It is therefore not easy to report on the actual progress. Several of the actions that will have the greatest impacts on the overall health of the reef are shown in the progress reports as “not yet due”. In some cases, such as climate change, the Reef 2050 Plan is silent, instead simply referencing Australia’s national efforts on climate change. Instead, the plan is to “[improve] the reef’s resilience to climate change by reducing local pressures”. Besides addressing water quality, there are many things that should also be considered but they involve making some really hard decisions, such as choosing between coal and coral. The overview of progress claims that 135 of the 151 actions in the Reef 2050 Plan are either completed (dark green) or are on track for their expected milestones (light green), as shown below. The reality, however, is that many of the 103 of the actions described as “on track/underway” have not progressed as initially proposed when the Reef 2050 Plan was submitted to Unesco, and that the definition of “underway” is far too loose to be meaningful. Our rapid assessment of the status of actions indicates that the level of progress reported for at least 32 of these 151 actions (around 21%) has been overstated. The following are just some examples: The unfortunate truth is that neither Unesco nor the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has the time or resources to conduct their own comprehensive assessment of the Great Barrier Reef. They rely heavily on these reports when deliberating on what to recommend to the world heritage committee, including whether the reef should be placed on the world heritage in-danger list. Our rapid assessment indicates there are real concerns with relying on the government to self-report accurately. It would appear the only way that Unesco will receive an accurate update is if that assessment is done independently of government. Fortunately, Unesco and IUCN do consider other evidence. It is also concerning that the members of the government’s independent expert panel and the Reef 2050 advisory committee were not involved in making the final assessments for the 2016 update report. Despite pronouncements that the Great Barrier Reef remains healthy, the evidence of the 2015 water quality report card, along with numerous expert opinions (for example, Jon Brodie on water quality; Terry Hughes on coral health; the Queensland government on scallops; and the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority on inshore dolphins) shows that the real situation is not as rosy as Unesco and the Australian public are being told. It is important to recognise some progress is being made – but sadly too little and not enough to reverse the declining trend for many of the values for which the reef was listed as world heritage. We should also question some of the priorities in the Reef 2050 Plan given the widely acknowledged critical issues (see page 252 in the government’s 2014 outlook report). Adopting best practice for water quality from point sources such as sewage discharge (action WQA11 under the plan) and protecting habitat for coastal dolphins (BA12) should be immediately addressed. Whether we have the money to do what’s necessary is another question. The government’s pledge to spend $2bn over 10 years is the current collective yearly spending ($200m) of four federal agencies, six state agencies and several major research programs, extrapolated over the coming decade. While the level of funding is significant compared with many other world heritage areas, the amount and priorities must be questioned, given that many of the reef’s values are continuing to decline. So far most funding has been spent on addressing water quality, and while this has achieved some positive results, it has not managed to stop the deteriorating trends. As Jon Brodie recently wrote on the Conversation: The best estimate is that meeting water quality targets by 2025 will cost $8.2bn … If we assume that … $4bn is needed over the next five years, the amounts mentioned in the progress report (perhaps $500-600m at most) are … totally inadequate. The reef is unquestionably of global significance. Given its sheer size and location, no other world heritage area on the planet includes such biodiversity. The worst-known bleaching event in the Great Barrier Reef demonstrates the limitations of the Reef 2050 Plan, which is silent on the impact of greenhouse emissions from Queensland’s coalmines and the effects of climate change more generally. Governments have an obligation to protect all the reef’s values for future generations. To do this they must recognise growing global moves to address climate change, and the widespread national and international expectations that more needs to be done to protect the reef. Australia is a relatively rich country and has the technical capability to address the issues. This provides an opportunity to show some global leadership for managing such a significant part of the world’s heritage. Listing the reef as world heritage in danger won’t in itself fix the problems – but it will certainly focus the spotlight on the issues. As the world heritage committee prepares for its next meeting in July 2017, and considers once again whether to officially list the reef as in danger, it will need to study all the evidence, not just the government’s reports. Certainly the true picture is more complicated and dire than the most recent government reports imply.  • Jon C Day, Alana Grech and Jon Brodie are from the ARC Centre of Excellence for Coral Reef Studies at James Cook University.

"The urgent threat of climate change means there is “no time to despair” over the election of Donald Trump, according to former vice-president Al Gore, who hopes that Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton will join an escalated climate campaign against the president-elect.  Gore told the Guardian he remained hopeful Trump would reverse some of his positions on climate change but predicted an unprecedented backlash from environmentalists over the next four years. Trump, who has called climate change a hoax, has pledged to withdraw the US from the Paris climate accord, dismantle the Clean Power Plan, slash renewable energy funding and somehow prop up the ailing US coal industry.  His advisers have also advocated cutting climate research at Nasa and completely exiting the international climate effort. Gore said such threats mean there will “likely be a huge upsurge in climate activism. I’m encouraged that there are groups that are digging in to work even harder. Those groups working in the courts are even more important now; those organizing on campuses are even more important now. “My message would be that despair is just another form of denial. There is no time to despair. We don’t have time to lick our wounds, to hope for a different election outcome.  “We have to win this struggle and we will win it; the only question is how fast we win. But more damaged is baked into the climate system every day, so it’s a race against time.” On Monday, Gore spent around an hour meeting with Trump and his daughter Ivanka, who reportedly plans to speak out on climate change despite her father’s skepticism of the issue. “I had a lengthy and very productive session with the president-elect,” Gore said, after emerging from the meeting at Trump Tower in New York City. “It was a sincere search for areas of common ground. I had a meeting beforehand with Ivanka Trump. The bulk of the time was with the president-elect, Donald Trump. I found it an extremely interesting conversation, and to be continued, and I’m just going to leave it at that.” Gore said he hoped Obama and Clinton, who was defeated by Trump in the 8 November 8 despite winning the popular vote by more than 2.6m ballots, will join in the effort to call for action to combat dangerous climate change. “I would hope they do get involved. They both have the right positions on climate change and in his second term president Obama did a really excellent job in highlighting the climate crisis,” he said. Gore has devoted himself to the climate issue since his failed presidential bid in 2000 – in which he won 500,000 more votes than George W Bush – most notably through the film An Inconvenient Truth and more recently via his advocacy group the Climate Reality Project. He said he was “very concerned” by how pro-fossil fuel interests surround Trump but remained optimistic that the president-elect could be engaged with on climate change. “Presidents can be vulnerable to the headstrong opinions of appointees and a few appointees can take the ball and run with it before a new president can undo the damage,” Gore said. “So that concerns me, of course.  “But it’s still premature. It’s not naive or Pollyanna-ish to express hope that some of his statements won’t turn into policies after the inauguration.  “Trump has said that he has an open mind to the Paris agreement. I frankly don’t know how open his mind is. Until hope is foreclosed, it’s worthwhile to see if there’s an opportunity to build green infrastructure, for example, or eliminate fossil fuel subsidies based on market-based competition.  “Regardless of what he does, a sustainable energy revolution is under way.” Despite an abrupt end to the El Niño climate event, which causes warm temperatures across much of the world, 2016 is still on track to be the hottest year on record. Arctic ice retreated to its second smallest extent on record during the summer, with winter regrowth occurring at an unusually sluggish rate.  The United Nations has warned that global greenhouse gas emissions must be radically cut within the next four years if the world is to avoid disastrous heatwaves, sea level rise and displacement caused by runaway climate change.  Gore’s Climate Reality Project is hosting its sixth annual 24 Hours of Reality broadcast, starting on Monday evening. Each hour of the 24-hour live event will focus on climate change in one of the 24 largest national emitters of carbon dioxide in the world.  Broadcast across various TV channels and Facebook, the event will feature politicians and celebrities including Ryan Reynolds, Jon Bon Jovi and Gisele Bundchen."
"Human carbon pollution is heating the Earth incredibly fast. On top of that long-term human-caused global warming trend, there are fluctuations caused by various natural factors. One of these is the El Niño/La Niña cycle. The combination of human-caused warming and a strong El Niño event are on the verge of causing an unprecedented three consecutive record-breaking hot years.  Simply put, without global warming we would not be seeing record-breaking heat year after year. In fact, 2014 broke the temperature record without an El Niño assist, and then El Niño helped push 2015 over 2014, and 2016 over 2015. Sadly, we live in a post-truth world dominated by fake news in which people increasingly seek information that confirms their ideological beliefs, rather than information that’s factually accurate from reliable sources. Because people have become incredibly polarized on the subject of climate change, those with a conservative worldview who prefer maintaining the status quo to the steps we need to take to prevent a climate catastrophe often seek out climate science-denying stories. Into that environment step conservative columnists David Rose at the Mail on Sunday, parroted by Ross Clark in The Spectator and James Delingpole for Breitbart, all trying to blame the current record-shattering hot global temperatures entirely on El Niño. Perhaps saddest of all, the House Science, Space, and Technology Committee tweeted the Breitbart piece, to which Senator Bernie Sanders appropriately responded: Where'd you get your PhD? Trump University? https://t.co/P5Ez5fVEwD The conservative columnists made their case by claiming that, with the recent strong El Niño event ending, temperatures are “plummeting,” thus blaming the record heat on El Niño. There are several fatal flaws in their case. First, the “plummet” they cite is not in global temperatures on the surface where we live, and where temperatures are easiest to measure accurately, but rather in satellite estimates of the temperature of the lower atmosphere above the portions of Earth’s surface covered by land masses. Second, although the satellite data extend as far back as 1979, and the global surface temperature data to 1880, they cherry pick the data by only showing the portion since 1997. Third, the argument is based entirely upon one relatively cool month (October 2016) that was only cool in that particularly cherry-picked data set. The argument is easily debunked. While there was a strong El Niño event in 2015–2016, there was an equally strong event in 1997–1998. The two events had very similar short-term warming influences on global surface temperatures, but according to Nasa, 2016 will be about 0.35°C hotter than 1998. That difference is due to the long-term, human-caused global warming trend. In fact, according to Nasa, even October 2016 was hotter than every month on record prior to 1998. These “plummeting” post-El Niño temperatures are still as hot as the hottest month at the peak of the 1998 El Niño. In fact, just three days after the conservative columnists’ pieces came out, the November 2016 satellite data was published. It turned out to be the hottest November in the entire record. Oops. Climate scientists have strongly pushed back against this misinformation. Climate scientist Adam Sobel told the Guardian, “they’re not serious articles” and “grossly misinterpret” the data. For Climate Feedback, seven scientists graded David Rose’s piece, and gave it a “very low” credibility score of -1.9 (the lowest possible score is -2.0). The scientists described Rose’s article as “incredibly misleading,” “flawed to perfection,” and “completely bogus.” Real science journalists have also taken the biased conservative pieces to task (I define real science journalists as those whose primary goal is to accurately inform readers about science, as opposed to fake science journalists whose primary goal is to distort science in order to advance an agenda). For example, see the Guardian, New York Times, Washington Post, Slate, Carbon Brief, and climate science bloggers. Admitting that conservatives have pushed us into a post-truth world, Donald Trump supporter and CNN political commentator Scottie Nell Hughes said on The Diane Rehm Show: People that say facts are facts, they’re not really facts … Everybody has a way of interpreting them to be the truth or not true. There’s no such thing, unfortunately, anymore of facts. And so Mr. Trump’s Tweets amongst a certain crowd, a large part of the population, are truth. When he says that millions of people illegally voted, he has some facts amongst him and his supporters, and people believe they have facts to back that up. On issues of belief, like politics, it’s true that differing opinions are roughly equally valid. While policy questions can be supported by evidence and data, ultimately they often come down to subjective individual preferences and opinions. In science, that’s not true. A scientific theory or argument is either supported by evidence and data, or it’s not. Opinions are not equally valid. We all live on the same planet, in the same universe, governed by the same laws of physics. Whether we lean toward liberal or conservative ideology, those physical laws don’t change.  Unfortunately, conservatives are increasingly likely to deny this reality. As Trump’s chief of staff Reince Priebus told Fox News: as far as this issue on climate change … he has his default position, which most of it is a bunch of bunk This is effectively the default position of the Republican Party, and it’s the only major political party in the world in denial about scientific reality. The party can take that position because the conservative media outlets that its voters consume misinform them with post-truth nonsense like this.  Unfortunately, when it comes to science, we don’t get to choose our own truths. Scientists and science journalists effectively held the post-truth crowd accountable on this story. They’ll have their work cut out for them in the coming years."
"The Australian government’s official “response plan” to the worst ever bleaching event on the Great Barrier Reef commits it to no new action, pledges no new money and does not make any attempt to address climate change, according to a draft seen by the Guardian. The Northern Great Barrier Reef Response Plan, marked “draft” and “confidential”, begins by describing the bleaching event as “the worst ever coral bleaching” and attributes its cause to climate change.  It says: “In the aftermath of the bleaching event it is more important than ever to building [sic] the resilience of the reef.” But the recommendations appear to contain no new money for action to help build resilience. It says the plan will be “nested under the Reef 2050 plan”, which is a document the federal and Queensland governments created to convince Unesco not to include the Great Barrier Reef on its “world heritage in danger” list. On Thursday the government needs to report to the Unesco world heritage committee on the implementation of the Reef 2050 plan, as well as how it has been funded. But, in June, the Guardian revealed Australia would also need to report on how it is responding to this year’s bleaching event. At the time, Tim Badman, the director of the IUCN’s world heritage program, which advises the committee on the state of its natural world heritage properties, told the Guardian: “We would expect that that report from Australia is going to cover all the significant things that have happened since June 2015 and whether there are changes in the picture of the management or the response that is needed … The bleaching event is a new issue to be considered.” It is not known whether this plan is what the government intends to present to Unesco in response to that requirement. It was revealed this week the bleaching appeared to kill about 67% of coral in the northern third of the reef. Across the entire reef, early estimates suggested about 22% of coral had died but scientists now say that figure is likely to be higher. But the government’s plan for dealing with the bleaching, at least in its draft from October, appeared unable to point to any significant new action. It divides actions into four groups. One group is “new initiatives to boost recovery” and the others are activities that have either been in place for a long time, were enacted as part of the Reef 2050 plan, or were introduced since the Reef 2050 plan. The document indicates the list of activities under “new initiatives to boost recovery” are not complete but it does indicate they require “no new money” and mostly deal with reducing sediment runoff through gully remediation. Under the actions labelled as “additional” since 2015, it lists a grab-bag of activities initiated by other groups, including WWF. That includes the two shark licenses WWF bought, which they will retire, and research they are conducting into turtle health – neither of which were primarily a response to bleaching.  The draft document was presented to the Reef 2050 advisory committee, which mentioned it in its communique on 11 October. The communique said the committee “welcomed the draft and provided comments”. “The committee noted that the aim was to finalise the Northern GBR Response Plan by the end of 2016,” the communique said. It remains unclear whether this document was still set to be completed by the end of 2016 or whether it would form the basis of the government’s reporting to Unesco in relation to the bleaching. The government is also preparing a Reef 2050 plan investment framework, which is expected to form a key component of its reporting to Unesco on Thursday. A Queensland government study found $8.2bn needed to be spent over 10 years to reach water targets set in the Reef 2050 plan. The government currently says it is spending just $2bn and much of that is not being spent on water quality but also other activities such as maritime safety. A spokeswoman for the federal Department of Environment and Energy said: “The department does not comment on draft confidential reports. Australia will provide its status update on the Reef 2050 plan to Unesco on 1 December 2016.”"
"British seaweeds are among our most underrated resources and hugely important for the ecology of the seas, but they get nothing like the recognition that, say, a wild meadow or ancient woodland gets.  There are more than 700 species of seaweed growing in British waters and some have long been harvested for food. Probably the best known is the seaweed Ulva that is made into laverbread. British seaweeds are still harvested in Scotland, Wales and Cornwall, and the potential for cultivating seaweed in British waters is vast.  Even though seaweeds for food fell out of fashion until recently they are now enjoying a renaissance in restaurants and supermarkets, though many of these are imports. Apart from food, the demand for seaweed – for biofuels, pharmaceuticals, toothpaste, fertiliser and industrial gels – is booming. The industry is worth more than £5bn worldwide. There is interest in finding new drugs from seaweed. In the food industry alginates are used in ice cream, they also improve the foaming head on beer and allow fast setting in puddings. They are used too in cosmetics, medicines, paints, and lots more besides. There is particular interest in seaweed farming for biogas and that could become a significant renewable energy for the west coast of Scotland in particular. Seaweed would be harvested and broken down in digesters to release methane gas for heating and electricity – all without using fresh water, chemical fertilisers or valuable farmland. The cultivation of seaweed fights climate change, soaking up carbon dioxide and locking carbon away. And for added benefit, seaweed grows far faster than land plants, making it even more efficient at getting rid of carbon dioxide. "
"Opponents of a contentious Canadian pipeline project are preparing for a lengthy, multifaceted battle that will see thousands take to the country’s streets, courts and legislatures to contest the government’s recent approval of the project. Prime minister Justin Trudeau announced on Tuesday that the Liberal government had cleared the way for Kinder Morgan’s C$6.8bn Trans Mountain Expansion project. Designed to transport Alberta’s landlocked bitumen to international markets via Vancouver’s harbour, the project will expand an existing pipeline to nearly triple capacity on the artery to 890,000 barrels a day. But the decision will run into a roar of opposition, said grand chief Stewart Phillip of the Union of British Columbia Indian Chiefs. “The marches and rallies will intensify. It will become more litigious, it will become more political and the battle will continue.” More than 14,000 people have so far signed onto his organisation’s pledge to halt the project, driven by concerns over environmental risks, First Nations rights and the fight against climate change.  Other actions are also being planned, from a public interest group that has signed up hundreds of volunteers to canvass signatures for citizen-drafted legislation to block the pipeline to a group that is working to train its members on how best to physically block construction.  “Let’s be clear,” said Caitlyn Vernon of the Sierra Club of British Columbia. “Prime minister Trudeau has picked a fight with British Columbians by approving Kinder Morgan – and it starts now. The Kinder Morgan pipeline will not be built. Not on our watch.” Trudeau said the approval of the project was the best option for all Canadians. “This is a decision based on rigorous debate, on science and evidence. We have not been and will not be swayed by political argument, be they local, or regional or national,” he said. “We have made this decision because we are convinced it is safe for BC, and it is the right one for Canada.” The announcement was welcomed by the Greater Vancouver Board of Trade and the province’s Chamber of Commerce who called it a “big economic win for BC and for Canada”. Texas-based energy infrastructure company Kinder Morgan said in a statement that it was excited to move forward with the project. Construction is expected to begin in 2017 and the pipeline could be in service by late 2019.  But the government’s approval was swiftly condemned by many others – some of who suggested that the Canadian project could see its own version of the Standing Rock protests that have gripped North Dakota.  “In the event that this gets to a place where Kinder Morgan is attempting to do work on the ground, there will be actions on the front line, there’s no question about that,” Phillip said. “I, along with a lot of other people, are prepared to be arrested again and again in our efforts to stop this.” Some two years ago, as Kinder Morgan crews began carrying out survey work for the proposed expansion, the grand chief was among the more than 100 people arrested during a days-long protest. A well-respected First Nation elder and a group of retired seniors from number of churches were also among those detained, he said. “This is not just an indigenous issue, it’s not a radical environmentalist issue. It’s an issue that is of enormous concern to all British Columbians from all walks of life.”  Elizabeth May, leader of Canada’s Green party, said she was also prepared to go to jail to halt the pipeline project. “And I think I’m not the only one,” she told reporters. “I think I’ll be sharing a cell with the mayor of Vancouver, the mayor of Victoria, the mayor of Burnaby [and] First Nations leaders.” Since the government announced its decision, the team at West Coast Environmental Law has fielded a steady stream of phone calls from First Nations groups curious about the possibility of legally challenging the project. Of the 120 aboriginal groups consulted by Kinder Morgan, just 39 have written letters of support for the project.  The Kinder Morgan project is already facing seven legal challenges, said Jessica Clogg of the organisation, with more expected in the coming weeks. “We’re also quite likely to see further legal proceedings from local governments, for example the city of Burnaby or the city of Vancouver.” Many of the project’s opponents are taking inspiration from Enbridge Inc’s Northern Gateway oil pipeline project. Despite being approved by the previous Conservative government in 2014, the proposed northern BC pipeline was the target of 18 court cases. In June a Canadian court overturned the approval of the project after finding the government had failed in its duty to consult with indigenous peoples. On Tuesday the Trudeau government said the Northern Gateway project would not be moving forward, offering what Clogg described as a demonstration that “lawsuits, steadfast community opposition and indigenous law-based strategies can stop a pipeline”. For those opposing Kinder Morgan, she said, the lesson to be gleaned from the decade-long battle against the Northern Gateway project was clear. “This is very much not over.”  "
"A new study has found that higher water temperatures have ravaged the Great Barrier Reef, causing the worst coral bleaching recorded by scientists. In the worst-affected area, 67% of a 700km swath in the north of the reef lost its shallow-water corals over the past eight to nine months, the Australian Research Council Centre of Excellence for Coral Reef Studies based at James Cook University study found. “Most of the losses in 2016 have occurred in the northern, most-pristine part of the Great Barrier Reef,” Prof Terry Hughes said. “This region escaped with minor damage in two earlier bleaching events in 1998 and 2002, but this time around it has been badly affected.” The southern two-thirds of the reef escaped with minor damage, Hughes said. This part was protected from the rising sea temperatures because of cooler water from the Coral Sea. Scientists expect that the northern region will take at least 10 to 15 years to regain the lost corals but are concerned a fourth bleaching event could interrupt the slow recovery. The dire assessment of the reef’s health comes as the Australian government is due to report to Unesco’s world heritage committee on its handling of the reef. After the federal government submits the report Unesco will decide whether to again consider listing the Great Barrier Reef on its “list of world heritage in danger”. The government will need to report on how it has funded and implemented its Reef 2050 long-term sustainability plan, as well as how the bleaching event has affected the reef. Since it last considered including the Great Barrier Reef on its list, the reef has undergone the worst bleaching event in recorded history. According to government agencies, 22% of the reef was killed in one hit, as unusually warm waters bleached and killed the coral. Climate change poses such a threat to the reef that the former head of the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority has called for a ban on all new coalmines in Australia to protect the reef from climate change. Graeme Kelleher, who was the first chief executive of the authority, a position he held for 16 years, said: “Australia cannot have a healthy Great Barrier Reef and a continuing coal industry. “I love the reef and I have worked to preserve it since 1979; I will oppose anything that threatens to destroy it,” he said."
"Many businesses that supply the goods and services we use every day understand that they have a role to play in keeping global warming in check. Their profits depend on it. The long term rise in global temperatures will change where and how we extract raw materials and produce the many things we take for granted, from the grapes crushed to make wine to the cotton spun to make the shirt you are wearing. Nearly 400 companies and nonprofits signed a letter last week urging president-elect Donald Trump to stay in the Paris climate agreement and support policies that combat global warming. The list covers a wide range of industries and includes Ben & Jerry’s, Patagonia and Sierra Nevada Brewing. It also contains surprising signatories: companies that aren’t known to take part in environmental initiatives, such as Tiffany & Co, Monsanto and Staples.  We asked people from a handful of brands who signed the letter why they voiced support for the Paris agreement, and how they address climate change in their business. Phil Miller, vice president of global corporate affairs Climate change has a significant impact on agriculture, and agriculture can be a significant part of the solution to address climate change. Modern agricultural innovations can help with both adaptation to and mitigation of climate change. With the help of external experts, Monsanto has developed carbon neutral crop production models to share with the broader agriculture and climate modeling communities. These models demonstrate the potential of a crop production approach, which builds soil carbon in amounts equal to or greater than the total amount of carbon emitted to grow and harvest those crops. We signed the recent letter because we believe climate change is real and a potential threat to global food security. Jenn Vervier, director of sustainability & strategy I did not hesitate to sign New Belgium onto the letter urging the incoming administration to honor the Paris climate accord. It’s the planet’s best chance to avoid the most catastrophic effects of climate change. As brewers, we are dependent upon agricultural cycles and so climate change is a direct threat to our industry. Like all businesses, we depend on economic stability. But most importantly, as humans, climate change imperils our way of life. All the work we’ve done at New Belgium for the past 25 years to be environmental stewards – while at the same time growing our company – seems almost irrelevant given the prospect of US inaction. If the Trump administration walks away from efforts to protect our planet, it will be tantamount to lighting the match that finally sets it fully aflame. Individuals, businesses, political leaders – we all need to raise our voice loudly on this. Time is running out. Jake Swenson, director of sustainable products & services As the climate continues to change, it will affect our direct operations, our customers, our suppliers and ultimately the products we sell. For one example, the forests of landowners who sell wood to our paper product suppliers could be adversely impacted by increasing risks of fires, drought and/or insect damage from rising temperatures. In 2010, we set a goal of reducing our total carbon emissions by 50% by 2020, and we’re halfway there, with a 28% reduction through 2015. By aggressively pursuing energy efficiency and shifting to renewable and cleaner energy sources, we can save money while reducing our carbon emissions at the same time. Jerry Lynch, chief sustainability officer The climate affects most of what we do, from how much rain falls on a farmer’s fields to how much energy it takes to heat and cool our production facilities. And our choices, from how we ship our ingredients to how our suppliers plow their fields, have an impact on the climate. We believe – and scientists agree – that in order to halt or slow climate change, we need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions We are working toward sustainable emissions levels by 2050 and reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 28% by 2025. We’re also focusing our efforts on something many of us take for granted, but farmers never do: dirt. Healthy soil is alive – and it works hard for our planet. It contains the nutrition crops and wildlife need. It holds water, even through the drier times. It holds onto gases that would otherwise contribute to climate change. That’s why we’re helping farmers grow good, clean dirt – because that’s where a healthy planet starts. Josh Prigge, director of regenerative development The wine industry is particularly vulnerable to climate change because we depend on specific climates to produce quality grapes for our wines. Any changes in these climates can directly impact the quality and yield of the fruit that we bring to our winery. We farm all of our nearly 1,000 acres of vineyards in Northern California organically. Not only does this practice – sometimes referred to as regenerative agriculture – help soils retain vital moisture during dry periods, it also retains more carbon in the soil, thus helping mitigate the effects of climate change. We have been taking concrete steps to implement smart climate practices for decades. We were the first winery in California to operate on 100% renewable energy, in 1999, and the first winery in the world to publicly report and verify our greenhouse gas emissions to the Climate Registry, in 2005. Tedd Saunders, chief sustainability officer  Saunders Hotel Group has already been impacted by carbon-fueled extreme weather. Our hotel in New Haven, Connecticut was pummeled and flooded by Hurricane Sandy and then the blizzard Nemo, which dumped three feet of snow on our property. Both times we lost power for six days and had considerable lost revenue, canceled events and major food spoilage. We have been helping lead the world’s largest service sector industry – travel and tourism – on sustainable business practices since 1989, but we are ramping up our efforts to meet the internationally agreed upon science-based goals. In addition to installing EV charging stations at our Lenox Hotel and other properties, and a co-gen power plant and CNG (compressed natural gas) vans at our Comfort Inn & Suites Boston/Airport, we have dozens of energy efficiency and water conservation initiatives in place. We also buy local goods to reduce transportation impacts, offer carafes of filtered water in The Lenox guestrooms, encourage guests and team members to use public transit, green cabs and rental bikes. Amy Hall, director of social consciousness  Climate change is a critical business issue for Eileen Fisher. Water scarcity affects the crops that provide fibers for our clothing and the dye houses that process the fabrics. Energy sources affect our decisions about shipping materials and goods around the globe. These are no longer future risks, but rather present-day concerns. Companies like Eileen Fisher can no longer afford to continue conducting business as usual.  Jan Koninckx, global business director for biofuels DuPont’s belief in the importance of taking prompt, coordinated and strong action to address climate change is why we were a founding member of the US Climate Action Partnership and why we have invested substantial resources in renewable energy, including hundreds of millions of dollars to construct a state-of-the-art commercial cellulosic ethanol facility. Not only is cellulosic ethanol a critical technology to decarbonizing the transportation sector and lowering greenhouse gas emissions, it has the added benefit of reducing our dependency on foreign oil, revitalizing the rural economy and bringing lasting opportunities to farmers across America.  Lynelle Cameron, senior director of sustainability Climate change will affect everything that our millions of customers design and make – from consumer products to cars to buildings and even the design of whole cities.  With the design technology available today, customers now have the ability to understand the energy – and therefore climate – implication of everything that gets made. Customers can use our software to design clean energy solutions that mitigate climate change, including simulating wind turbines and micro hydropower turbines. Beyond working with our customers to address energy concerns, we have also committed to all seven We Mean Business commitments, including our latest effort to power our business with 100% renewable energy. Anna Walker, senior director of policy and advocacy Apparel production depends on access to raw materials and natural resources. As a 160-year old American company, we must do our part to combat climate change to allow us to be a successful business for another 160 years. Our goal is to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 25% in our direct operations and grow our renewable energy purchases to 20% by 2020. "
"Donald Trump has tossed around the term “clean coal” in his murky plan to boost jobs in the fossil fuel industry for months now. Most recently in a video in which the president-elect vowed to “cancel job killing restrictions on the production of shale energy and clean coal, creating many millions of high-paying jobs” during his first 100 days in the office. What Trump meant by “clean coal” is unclear. Coal is a dirty fuel with a declining fortune. With production falling, at least half a dozen coal mining companies have filed for bankruptcy within the past two years. Technical advances in fracking have increased the production of natural gas and driven down prices, making it cheaper than coal and a more attractive source of energy for power generation. How Trump plans to beat that economic reality to promote the production of both coal and natural gas is puzzling.  While the term feels like an oxymoron, it’s used more often within the energy industry to refer to an expensive technology called carbon capture and storage (CCS) that once promised to keep coal power a dominant source of electricity for decades to come. Efforts to make clean coal technology affordable in the US have so far failed despite hundreds of millions of dollars in government and private funding. But public and private funding continue to pour in as proponents believe the technology will play an important role in many countries that have pledged to cut emissions and abide by the Paris climate agreement that went into effect last month. Putting a price on carbon to force businesses to cut emissions will help to create a market for CCS, energy experts say. But how will Trump make it work if he is bent on relaxing regulations? CCS refers to a family of technologies that catches as much as 90% of the carbon dioxide emissions from burning fossil fuels, preventing them from escaping into the atmosphere and contributing to global warming. The captured emissions are then either stored underground or used to boost oil production by pumping it underground to pry loose the sticky oil from the rocks. On a much smaller scale, carbon dioxide has been used to make a variety of products, including paint, plastic and fuels such as diesel. Energy experts at organizations such as the International Energy Agency and the United Nations’ Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change believe CCS is an essential tool in the battle against global warming because fossil fuels remain major sources of emissions. The technology can capture carbon dioxide released while making products such as steel, cement and chemicals. The cost of testing and building CCS projects remains high after more than a decade of significant investments. One of the most notable flops, called FutureGen, was a $1.7bn public-private project that began in 2003. FutureGen was killed twice, by both the Bush and Obama administrations, after it ballooned into an expensive undertaking that faced lawsuits and couldn’t line up the money necessary to complete it in Illinois. By its second demise, the government had spent about $116.5m of the $1.1bn it committed in 2010. Yet, public funding for its research hasn’t stopped. The US Department of Energy has invested more than $4.8bn in CCS development and testing since 2009. Last week, it announced a $44m grants to 16 CCS projects from California to Georgia. Currently, there are 38 large-scale CCS projects underway around the world, including three in the US, though pilot and demonstration efforts and other CCS initiatives number in the hundreds globally, the Global CCS Institute noted in its 2016 report. The three ongoing industrial-size CCS projects in the US are the Illinois Industrial Carbon Capture and Storage Project; the Kemper project in Mississippi, which is something of a poster-child for delays and cost overruns; and the $1bn Petra Nova project, a 50-50 joint venture of NRG Energy and JX Nippon Oil & Gas Exploration Corp, Japan’s largest oil producer. Petra Nova is scheduled to come online by the end of the year. It will capture carbon dioxide from a retrofitted, not newly built, coal-fired power plant southwest of Houston. NRG plans to pipe the captured carbon dioxide to an oil field 80 miles away to help its boost production. Petra Nova’s funding includes a grant of $190m from the energy department, $300m from JX Nippon, $300m from NRG and $250m in loans from a pair or Japanese banks. While NRG is able to complete the project, it doesn’t plan to build another unless one of two things happen: oil prices rise to create demand for carbon dioxide, or carbon capture prices fall. “The model that we put together was extremely financially viable at $100 oil,” said David Knox, a NRG spokesman. Currently, oil prices hover around $50 per barrel. In the meantime, power plant owners and other businesses that rely on fossil fuels will likely face a continual pressure to cut their emissions and figure out how to dispose of them. As a result, NRG and Canada’s Oil Sands Innovations Alliance (COSIA) are sponsoring a $20m competition to find new use for carbon dioxide. They’ve selected 27 semi-finalist teams from six countries, including 18 teams from the US. The teams have proposed to convert carbon dioxide into products as varied as concrete, biofuels, toothpaste, fish food and fertilizer. The money will be divvied up among several winners. NRG’s partnership with other firms in Petra Nova and the competition reflects the growing interest in CCS by the oil and gas sector. Ten of the world’s biggest oil companies, mostly European companies such as Total, BP and Shell, earlier this month pledged to invest $1bn to develop climate-friendly technologies, including a large chunk for CCS. Critics called the pledge minuscule. Some environmental groups oppose CCS altogether because they believe backing the technology signals support for fossil fuels. Private investments alone may not be enough to make CCS a good tool to fight climate change. One of the best ways to create a market for CCS, according to more than 80% of economists with climate expertise, is to enact a broad reaching carbon policy that forces businesses to pay for their emissions. But the Trump administration and Republican-led Congress won’t likely favor enacting this type of regulation. “Carbon capture can’t compete in today’s environment where there’s no penalty for releasing CO2 emissions into the atmosphere, because it’s always cheaper to release emissions than to try and clean up them up,” says Howard J. Herzog, senior research engineer at the MIT Energy Initiative at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Legislation is pending in Congress to increase CCS tax subsidies. Tax credits likely won’t sufficiently lower the cost of building a new coal plant, but it could encourage the use of CCS for existing power plants and industrial processes, says David Hawkins, director of the Climate Program at the Natural Resources Defense Council.  CCS could gain greater support outside of the US as countries move to meet the emission reduction targets of the Paris agreement, proponents of the technology believe. China could be a big market for CCS because it depends heavily on coal for energy and has expressed an interest in using carbon capture to meet its Paris targets, says Matt Gray, senior utilities & power analyst for the nonprofit financial think tank Carbon Tracker, in a new report. The country’s political system also makes it easier for CCS to take off. “And the Chinese government is suited to implementing a CCS strategy because it’s very top down,” he says."
"The World Health Organization declared on Friday that Zika virus, shown to cause microcephaly in infants and spread by mosquitos, was no longer an international emergency. The virus causes a mild fever and flu-like symptoms in healthy adults but has been linked to malformed heads in newborns, and research has suggested possible links to other birth defects.  The organization noted, though, that while no longer a “public health emergency of international concern”, the virus remains “a significant enduring public health challenge requiring intense action”. The WHO shifted to a “longer-term technical mechanism” to confront the crisis, it said. Almost 30 countries have reported birth defects linked to the virus, and thousands of people have tested positive in Brazil and the US territory of Puerto Rico. Florida has reported 139 locally acquired cases of the virus, according to the CDC’s most recent count. The White House and leaders in Congress quietly abandoned the Trans-Pacific Partnership, the free trade deal that would have set up new rules of commerce for 12 countries, including the US, Japan, South Korea, Australia and Peru. The trade deal became a symbol of globalization and lost manufacturing jobs during the presidential campaign, and Donald Trump had promised to take it off the table. The deal would have phased out thousands of tariffs and made it easier for US vendors to sell products abroad, and vice versa. It also had provisions for internet and copyright provisions, guards against wildlife trafficking and child labor, and rules designed to curb China’s influence in Pacific trade. Its opponents included unions, which argued it gave too much power to foreign manufacturers. Barack Obama will meet with leaders of Japan, China, Australia and other countries in Peru this weekend for the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum. He will face questions about trade and, inevitably, Trump. The housing startup blocked a Harvard professor, Ben Edelman, from its service after he found evidence of racial discrimination by its users. Edelman said he had found that black guests were more often rejected than white guests who used the site; he reached his findings in part by creating multiple fake accounts as black and white users. Airbnb said it suspended his service for violating policy about multiple fake accounts. The $30bn company also announced a big expansion to create entire itineraries for tourists, though it already faces opposition in cities such as New York and San Francisco, where critics say the company is making exploitative housing practices worse. The north pole was reported at about 20C (36F) warmer than normal, with record low sea ice, alarming climate scientists. “The extreme behavior of the Arctic in 2016 seems to be in no hurry to quit,” Jennifer Francis, a Rutgers University scientist, told the Washington Post. Meanwhile, China’s deputy foreign minister, Liu Zhenmin, felt compelled to remind the US president-elect that global warming is real and that Republican presidents including Richard Nixon and Ronald Reagan have supported environmental measures. In 2012 Trump wrote: “The concept of global warming was created by and for the Chinese in order to make US manufacturing non-competitive.” The energy company trying to build a pipeline through North Dakota has asked a federal judge to intervene in the project, which the US government ordered delayed and against which Native Americans have protested for months. “It is time for the Courts to end this political interference and remove whatever legal cloud that may exist over the right-of-way beneath federal land at Lake Oahe,” CEO Kelcy Warren said in a statement. In response, the Standing Rock Sioux tribal chair, Dave Archambault II, said: “Dakota Access is so desperate to get this project in the ground that it is now suing the federal government on the novel theory that it doesn’t need an easement to cross federal lands.” More than 400 people have been arrested in demonstrations so far. The Iraqi army and Kurdish peshmerga, backed by US special forces and airstrikes, have made tentative gains in the gruelling battle for Mosul, Iraq’s second largest city and one of Isis’s most important strongholds. Reuters reported that advances into Mosul had slowed out of concern for civilians trapped in the city, and that 54,000 people have been displaced by the four-week campaign.  Iraqi forces also retook Nimrud, the site of an ancient Assyrian city where the king Ashurnasirpal built his palace. Isis militants tried to bulldoze sections of the site last year, and released video purportedly showing fighters destroying artifacts. In Syria, civil war between the regime of Bashar al-Assad, rebels and Isis continued to devastate the country. A children’s hospital in Aleppo was bombed by chlorine gas, leaving only four functioning hospitals in the city for some 250,000 civilians in the area. The bombing was believed to have been carried out by Syrian government forces, which have launched a new assault with airstrikes and support from Russian allies."
"Malcolm Turnbull says Tony Abbott is responsible for the review of the Coalition’s Direct Action policy because it was built into the work program when he was prime minister. The prime minister on Tuesday attempted to hose down a breakout within Coalition ranks triggered by the government releasing the terms of reference for the Direct Action review on Monday. The minister for energy and the environment, Josh Frydenberg, has flagged that the review, to run throughout 2017, will consider the merits of an emissions intensity trading scheme for the electricity sector. While that course of action has been recommended by some climate groups, by the energy industry and by Csiro, and by the Climate Change Authority, the preliminary signal sent various Coalition backbenchers to the barricades and prompted the defence industry minister, Christopher Pyne, to declare that the Coalition was not in favour of carbon pricing. The South Australian Liberal senator Cory Bernardi has declared carbon trading “economic suicide”. The chair of the Coalition’s backbench committee on energy and the environment, Craig Kelly, said on Monday that carbon trading was not government policy, although he said on Tuesday he might consider an emissions intensity scheme for electricity if it lowered power prices. While some in the Coalition clearly want to revive the toxic carbon “tax” debate prosecuted by Abbott in the lead-up to the 2013 election, Turnbull told reporters in Sydney on Tuesday he had never supported a carbon tax. An emissions intensity scheme is not a carbon tax but a form of carbon trading known as a baseline and credit scheme. Baseline and credit schemes would force electricity generators with sufficient emissions intensity to breach the baseline to buy credits to offset their excess emissions. As to thelooming review of Direct Action, the prime minister said this had been part of the Coalition’s policy since 2010, which made it a legacy item of business from the Abbott years. “The review of the climate policy which will be undertaken next year has been part of the Coalition’s policy for many years, long before I was prime minister,” Turnbull said on Tuesday. “This is absolutely part of our policy. It’s part of the policy we took to the election in 2013 and 2016 and, indeed, we took to the election in 2010. This is business as usual.” The renewed outbreak of infighting came as Australia’s electricity and gas transmission industry called on the Turnbull government to implement a form of carbon trading in the national electricity market by 2022 and review the scope for economy-wide carbon pricing by 2027. While Abbott once characterised carbon pricing as a wrecking ball through the Australian economy, the new report, backed by Csiro, says adopting an emissions intensity scheme is the least costly way of reducing emissions and could actually save customers $200 a year by 2030."
"     We live in an era in which humans have become the dominant force of change on the planet. First proclaimed at the turn of the millennium by the climate scientist Paul Crutzen, the Anthropocene asserts that since the Industrial Revolution, humans have altered the environment so extensively as to create a new geological epoch. It might seem an enormous subject to tackle with art, but in my projects I like to consider disciplines like physics from an artistic point of view, and to think about the larger context in which the Earth exists. Many of my works seek to merge the poetic and the scientific to delve into a field that’s unknown to me. It is through this context that my current project, an exhibition called Crystalline, has been percolating over the past few years.  In 2010, my direct experience of Eyjafjallajökull erupting in Iceland catapulted my practice as a painter into working directly with the primary materials of geology and physics. Working on site next to a volcano felt like travelling to the centre of the Earth. Looking at seismology charts to explore how an earthquake can inscribe itself into scientific records I started to visualise these dark fluctuations as patterns generated by the forces of nature. My drawings of the unseen world of the microscopic brought a new form of alchemy into my paintings. In 2013, I was offered a place at Parity Studios, University College Dublin (UCD) and I am currently working on a commission for the school of biology and environmental science, which aims to rediscover the many hidden and inspiring collections in the university. To be working in a studio in school of Biology and Environmental Science at University College Dublin has enabled my collaboration with scientists to broach subjects at the edges of current scientific knowledge. Meeting with Jenny McElwain, professor of palaeobiology, opened the the depths of space and time for me, and prompted my curiosity in the period of time just before climate change was identified around 1820. This was a time of polar exploration just preceding the Industrial Revolution when humans started to etch ourselves into geological history. For the exhibition I am making a work called Cyathea australis, using the early tools of photography reducing this medium to its bare essentials in a series of photogenic drawings that interrogate an era before the Anthropocene. Jenny has been using fossilised leaves to reconstruct the ancient atmospheric carbon dioxide record from 330 to 260 million years ago, when large rainforests expanded throughout the tropics, leaving as their signature the world’s coal resources. In tandem with this scientific study, I set up a dark room in the atmospheric chambers to record the silhouettes of our earliest plants. Using silver nitrate and light I created a series of ghostly imprints generated by a 400-million-year-old atmosphere – an atmosphere so deadly that two inhalations would suffice to kill a person. This constricting and resonant environment calls to mind the fatal impact our collective activities have had on our planet.   My research for this project was extended in 2015 when I found myself on a barkentine Arctic expedition in the same waters that had subsumed ships and Arctic explorers for hundreds of years. By 1823 the North American Arctic was still the last undiscovered ecosystem on the planet. It was a landscape so cold that it fractured everything it penetrated, including the stones. It was uncharted, unclaimed territory and Europeans had perished in it miserably.  I was captivated by the story of the disappearance of the Franklin ships in 1845: the expedition of two vessels, HMS Terror and HMS Erebus, that vanished while searching for the Northwest Passage. I am retracing this territory by developing Unknown Landscapes, a series of oil paintings based on photographic plates from these expeditions. The cameras survived in the permafrost when the ships and crew disappeared into nothingness. The plates carry the melancholy and the magic of those frontier times.  In September, the story of the 1845 Franklin Expedition hit the headlines again with the discovery of HMS Terror. I discovered that the doomed ship’s captain was an Irishman with a keen interest in botany. Thanks to his interest, buried in the Antiquities Department of the National Botanic Gardens is a superb collection of Arctic pressings from the 1825 Franklin expedition that have never been on public view. Matthew Jebb, the director, graciously opened the collection to me over the summer to extract some 75 seeds from the pressings. These seeds that belong to another time are an important finding as they represent that moment just before the industrial revolution that we can’t go back to. I am now developing a work, A Space And Time Outside, with the Millennium Seed Bank at Kew Gardens, to explore the potential life force of these seeds from the Arctic that have been around for close to 190 years. For the duration of the exhibition scientists will test the seeds as a live project.  Another work related to the theme of the expedition stems from a collaboration with the European Space Agency (ESA) this summer. The piece is called Crystalline, which is also the overall title of the exhibition In this work, a series carbon works dominate the entrance of the exhibition hall. This work is a poetic response to the retreating Arctic glaciers that were mapped circa 1845, when the region was still a blank space.  To make this installation, I am working with a material developed by scientists at an Irish company called Enbio. They have developed a revolutionary use for carbon, which is intriguing to me given that it is one of the most indestructible materials on the planet and essential to all forms of life on Earth. Each piece in my installation is coated with a pigment once used by early cave painters to coat the walls of their shelters. In spray painting the material, I am re-enacting the process used in space technology; engineers at Enbio will apply a contemporary version of the charcoal, made from carbon and burnt bone, to the outside of the European Space Agency’s Solar Orbiter. The spacecraft is due to launch in 2018 and will study the sun at unprecedentedly close proximity. The pigment will be added to the outside of a spacecraft’s titanium heat shield.  The surfaces for Crystalline are also cured at high temperatures to create a motif of cracked and disjointed cartographies, which exude an air of shabby beauty. Their cracked surfaces seem both vulnerable and inveterate.   A sound piece in the show is prompted by my experience of the Arctic shelf melting. On my Arctic research trip in 2015, I used a heliograph – a device that was historically used to record the sun. Tom McCormack, a physicist at UCD designed a version for me, which I attached to the binnacle of the expedition ship to create a response to the melting glaciers by recording a sound score of the sun’s track at the summer solstice. I recorded messages and pulses as the sun moved through the sky on 21June 2015 to produce a series of notations for the score. The burn holes created are photographic in the strictest sense, as each mark is a small black sun, and each dot is a repeat pattern of the sun’s image scaled down many million times on its journey to the Earth. In March 2017, an original music score by Irene Buckley, with recordings I made in the Arctic, will be beamed into space from by ESA.  In art as in science, in the process of following an enquiry, many other enquiries emerge – my forthcoming exhibition in Paris is certainly a point of resolution of some of these, but many other stories have opened up, and the interconnectedness of the parts has been astonishing. I am realising the power of expression that visual art can bring in unleashing the potential infinity encapsulated in a given story.  Crystalline, curated by Helen Carey, will open at the Centre Culturel Irlandais, Paris, on 26 January 2017 and will travel to the European Space Agency in April 2017.

"By the end of this decade it may be too late to limit global warming to scientifically guided limits, if the infrastructure built in the next four years is constructed along the same lines as currently planned. Building high-carbon infrastructure – from transport systems predicated on motor car use, to new coal-fired power plants, and buildings that leak energy – effectively “locks in” a future of greenhouse gas emissions that are likely to far exceed the planet’s capacity to absorb carbon.  Though such factors have been the subject of numerous scientific studies in the past decade, countries have been slow to take the implications on board. The latest warning comes from the C40 group of mayors and city authorities that have signed up to their own limits on carbon and actions to combat climate change and reduce its impacts, often independently of their national or federal governments. In a new report, entitled Deadline 2020, published on Tuesday and co-authored by the engineering firm Arup, they suggest that the next four years to the end of 2020 will be crucial in determining whether the world is able to limit warming to no more than 2C above pre-industrial levels – as called for in the Paris agreement signed by world governments last year – or busts that goal, with unpredictable and potentially irreversible effects on climate change. It's a climate change accord agreed by nearly 200 countries in December 2015, which came into force on 4 November 2016. The agreement commits world leaders to keeping global warming below 2C, seen as the threshold for safety by scientists, and pursuing a tougher target of 1.5C. The carbon emission curbs put forward by countries under Paris are not legally-binding but the framework of the accord, which includes a mechanism for periodically cranking those pledges up, is binding. The agreement also has a long-term goal for net zero emissions which would effectively phase out fossil fuels.   Actions and regulations introduced by cities are increasingly seen as an important alternative to the national targets and measures that have been the main feature of international climate change negotiations, culminating in the Paris agreement. While national governments may be reluctant to make sweeping changes or new regulations, many mayors and local authorities in large cities, in both the developed and developing world, have sufficient autonomy to set their own path. Such initiatives are seen as having particular potential in the US, where the president-elect Donald Trump has vowed to “cancel” the Paris agreement, but where the political leaders of many large cities are using their powers to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, for instance through improvements to public transport and new regulations on energy. The authors of the report calculate that city leaders acting alone could deliver roughly half of the carbon savings required to meet the Paris agreement goals. But there is much to do. Megacities, for instance, defined as those with more than 10 million inhabitants, must reduce their carbon emissions from about 5 tonnes per capita per year at present to less than 3 tonnes within the next decade or so. About $375bn (£301bn) will be required globally by the end of the current decade to meet the goals, the report found, though some of this expenditure may already be included in planned city budgets."
" EU countries are on track to meet their 2020 targets for renewable energy and emissions cuts but could fall short of ambitious longer-term goals, the European Environment Agency (EEA) said on Thursday. “The EU’s 2020 targets on energy and climate are now well within reach,” EEA executive director Hans Bruyninckx said. “But certain trends are alarming, in particular for transport. In that sector, renewable energy use remains insufficient and greenhouse gas emissions are rising again,” Bruyninckx added. The bloc’s 2020 target calls for 20% of gross final energy consumption to come from renewable sources, and that number rose to 16.4% in 2015 from 16% in 2014, according to preliminary estimates cited in the report. Energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions grew slightly in 2015 but the increase came after “an exceptionally warm winter” the previous year, which led to lower energy demand for heating, the report said. The EU was also well on its way to meeting its target of reducing energy consumption by 13% compared to 2005 levels. Preliminary data showed that by 2015 consumption was 11% lower. Under the Paris climate deal struck almost a year ago, the bloc plans to make renewable energy account for 27% of energy use by 2030, and to cut greenhouse gas emissions by 40% compared to 1990 levels. By 2050, it hopes greenhouse gas emissions will be down by 80%. Meeting the 2030 target for renewable energy would “require additional efforts because regulatory changes affect investors’ confidence in renewables, while market barriers persist,” the agency said. Similarly, the energy efficiency target would need “effective implementation of energy efficiency measures as well as a rapid change in consumer behaviour.” The EU on Wednesday unveiled “clean energy” plans to boost renewables, cut waste and reduce subsidies for coal power in a bid to meet its commitments under the Paris climate deal. Binding energy efficiency targets would also be raised by 30% by 2030 under the sweeping package of measures from the European commission. But environmental groups have accused the bloc of doing too little to end subsidies for carbon-spewing coal power plants, and of undermining investments in renewables."
"Donald Trump has said he has an “open mind” over US involvement in the Paris agreement to combat climate change, after previously pledging to withdraw from the effort. Asked by the New York Times whether he would pull the US out of the Paris climate accord, which has been signed by 196 nations, Trump said: “I’m looking at it very closely. I have an open mind to it.” The president-elect also wavered on his previously stated position that climate change is a “hoax” and just a “very, very expensive form of tax”. Questioned over the link between human activity and global warming, Trump said: “I think there is some connectivity. Some, something. It depends on how much.” He added that he was thinking about how the issue “will cost our companies”. Trump’s partial acceptance of the overwhelming scientific view that burning fossil fuels is changing the climate, along with his equivocation over American involvement in the Paris deal, are subtle departures from the position he took during the presidential campaign. Trump has said he would “cancel” the Paris climate agreement, which was ratified earlier this month and requires a three-year notice period to quit. The president-elect has said he would also cut all money spent on climate change aid to developing nations and slash clean energy funding. The election of an apparent climate change denier to the US presidency has caused consternation among scientists and overseas climate negotiators, but some have voiced hope that Trump will follow a more pragmatic path that will avoid political fallout over the issue. In Trump’s recent pronouncements on his first 100 days in power he has pledged to cancel money for climate change programs and lift restrictions upon fossil fuel exploration on public land, but made no mention of quitting the Paris deal. Michael Brune, executive director of Sierra Club, said of his latest comments: “Talk is cheap, and no one should believe Donald Trump means this until he acts upon it. We’re waiting for action, and Trump is kidding nobody on climate as he simultaneously stacks his transition team and cabinet with climate science deniers and the dirtiest hacks the fossil fuel industry can offer. Prove it, president-elect. The world is watching.”"
"Back in December 2015, Donald Trump gave a 30-minute live interview to the website Infowars.com and its combustible leader, Alex Jones. “Your reputation is amazing and I will not let you down,” said Trump, who, at the time, was leading in most polls for the Republican presidential nomination. Jones, a fervent Trump supporter, is a conspiracy theorist writ large. He insists there is “iron clad” evidence that the 11 September terrorist attacks in the US were an “inside job”.  Jones has also said that in 1996 governments deployed a worldwide program to secretly put chemicals into the fuel of aircraft to poison people. These “chemtrails” don’t hurt the “globalists” though, because Jones says they have a “special detox”. Oh, and Jones also thinks climate change is a hoax.  Climate change is an issue he covers regularly on his shows, where he has interviewed climate science deniers such as Christopher Monckton (a familiar name to Australians given his multiple speaking tours here), Marc Morano and James Delingpole. While it’s easy to dismiss the conspiracy culture pushed by Jones as pseudoscientific rubbish, it is not so easy to dismiss the size of the audience he has been building. Jones’s website gets 57m page views per month – double where it was six months ago. According to analytics site Social Blade, the Alex Jones YouTube channel has 1.8m subscribers and just racked up its one billionth (that’s not a typo) video view. (For comparison, the BBC News YouTube channel has 992,000 subscribers.) Jones’s Infowars site is part of an ecosystem of hyperpartisan media outlets that insist climate change is a hoax. Like Jones, that ecosystem is rapidly building a receptive online audience. Those sites can now reach hundreds of millions of people with headlines insisting that human-caused climate change is a hoax, that global warming has stopped or that adding CO2 to the atmosphere is good. One example. The most popular climate change story across social media in the past six months was not some diligently researched piece from one of the many very good science journalists writing for major news organisations around the world.  Rather, the story claimed that thousands of scientists had come forward to declare that climate change was a hoax. The writer was a guy running a website in Los Angeles who worked for eight years for the UK conspiracy theorist David Icke. Icke thinks the moon might be some sort of spaceship, that the world is controlled by a globalist illuminati and, yes, that climate change is a hoax. Icke is a regular guest on Infowars.  Infowars will often source material from Breitbart – the website that used to be run by Trump’s campaign chairman and soon-to-be chief strategist, Steve Bannon.  Many of Breitbart’s most popular climate change items are written by Delingpole, a British polemicist. Guess what he thinks of climate change? Given that climate science denial has become a part of the Republican party’s identity, it was hardly surprising that the GOP-led House of Representatives committee on science should tweet a link to a Breitbart climate story written by Delingpole (a story based on a deeply misleading article in the UK’s Daily Mail). Breitbart is also building its audience. According to data from SimilarWeb, the site now gets 168m page views per month, doubling its reach in the past six months. The Drudge Report – the wildly popular conservative-leaning news aggregator site with 1.7bn page views a month – also helps drive traffic to sites such as Infowars and Breitbart. Its founder, Matt Drudge, was another recent guest of Jones. Since Trump won the US election, there has been much talk of the influence of “fake news”, with Facebook in particular identified as a key conduit. That encompasses news that is blatantly fabricated but also lounge room content farms that pass themselves off as news. Then there are the hyperpartisan opinion sites. I’m happy to admit the online growth and reach of climate science denialists and conspiracy theorists terrifies me. Why? The problem is not that these sites exist but that not enough people seem to know the difference between actual news, fake news, partisan opinion and conspiratorial bullshit. One of those people is the president-elect of the United States. Either that, or people don’t even care to differentiate between fake and real, especially if what they read taps into their own prejudices.  There is a concerted attempt to cut sensible climate policy off at the knees by building a popular online movement against the science itself. For decades, the fossil fuel industry and so-called “free market” ideologues at conservative thinktanks have misled the public on the science and the risks of climate change.  Now, the decades of material produced by that climate science denial machinery is finding a new audience. Those talking points are being reheated and screamed, in FULL CAPS. So what’s the answer? No one seems to know but much appears to be in the hands of Google and Facebook. Other than that, a crash course in critical thinking and recognising climate science denial brought to you by the illuminati might be the order of the day."
"Australia’s electricity and gas transmission industry is calling on the Turnbull government to implement a form of carbon trading in the national electricity market by 2022 and review the scope for economy-wide carbon pricing by 2027. Energy Networks Australia warns in a new report examining how to achieve zero net carbon emissions by 2050 that policy stability and regulatory certainty are the key to delivering lower power prices and reliable electricity supply.  While Tony Abbott once characterised carbon pricing as a wrecking ball through the Australian economy, the new report, backed by Csiro, says adopting an emissions intensity scheme is the least costly way of reducing emissions, and could actually save customers $200 a year by 2030. The forceful intervention by the industry on Tuesday follows the Turnbull government on Monday flagging an emissions intensity trading scheme for the electricity sector as part of its scheduled review of its Direct Action climate policy. Some stakeholders also believe the Finkel review into energy security and Australia’s climate commitments may also float the desirability of an emissions intensity scheme for the electricity sector when it presents its preliminary fundings to Friday’s Coag meeting of the prime minister and premiers. But the difficulties for the government emerged immediately after the baseline and credit scheme was flagged by the energy and environment minister, Josh Frydenberg, on Monday when the chairman of the Coalition’s backbench committee, Craig Kelly, warned carbon trading was not Coalition policy and would not be accepted by the party room. Energy Networks Australia has been working for two years on what it calls a policy roadmap to achieve zero emissions by 2050. A report to be released on Tuesday argues that the goal can be achieved but only with an integrated policy approach. The report recommends that the government adopt an emissions intensity baseline and credit scheme for the electricity sector by 2022, and set a light-vehicle emissions standard policy to provide incentives for electric vehicle uptake. The report also recommends policies that would allow an extensive rollout of smart meters, impose demand-based network tariffs – with a choice for customers to opt out – and pursue decentralisation of the grid, including standalone systems and micro-grids as a substitute for traditional delivery models. It notes that the next decade to 2027 “is likely to see a step change in the rapid adoption of new energy technologies, driven by falling costs and global carbon abatement measures”. “This decade provides a limited window of opportunity to reposition Australia’s electricity system to deliver efficient outcomes to customers.” Energy Networks Australia worked with Csiro on the report. The peak research body’s chief economist, Paul Graham, said it was entirely possible with the right policies to maintain a reliable, stable electricity grid while achieving zero net emissions by 2050, which would ensure Australia kept its international undertakings made in the Paris climate agreement. He told Guardian Australia that the modelling carried out for the roadmap indicated the emissions intensity scheme was the best option to reduce power prices over the medium term because the scheme subsidised low-emissions technologies. The roadmap assumes the federal renewable energy target will continue through until the late 2020s but Graham said it would be possible to scrap the RET around 2030 if the trading scheme was delivering sufficient low-emissions technologies into the system. He said the transformation now under way in the electricity sector was best managed with market frameworks that didn’t pick winners and were technology-neutral. The chief executive of Energy Networks Australia, John Bradley, issued a call for sensible policy that was developed as far as possible on a national basis and was not subjected to outbreaks of politicking. Bradley said carbon policy which could “change dramatically at every election or differs in every state is a recipe for a high cost and less secure electricity service to customers”."

"Ahead of the autumn statement next week (Report, 18 November), we urge the chancellor not to answer calls from oil producers in the North Sea for another round of government subsidies. Instead, Philip Hammond should put an end to the taxpayer-funded bonus for oil and gas companies and set the UK on a pathway to a more prosperous, clean energy future. If the world is to deliver on the Paris agreement on climate change, most of the known oil, gas and coal reserves must remain untapped. Yet in spite of warnings about risks of stranded assets from the governor of the Bank of England, the UK continues to promote the production of yet more oil and gas. The tax breaks introduced by former chancellor George Osborne in 2015 and 2016 have been costly. The Office for Budget Responsibility estimates that the Treasury will hand oil and gas companies a net £4.8bn in rebates between 2015 and 2021. These tax breaks have also failed to protect jobs. Even with current subsidies, North Sea oil and gas operators expect to lay off one in six UK-based workers this year. By contrast, a recent UK Energy Research Centre study found that similarly sized renewable energy projects create 10 times more jobs than their fossil fuel counterparts.  As the industry is now asking this government to shift wider production costs and even more of the £70bn in decommissioning costs to the taxpayer, the government must acknowledge that the transition to a low-carbon future offers a much larger benefit to the UK than continuing to chase uneconomic fossil fuel production. Removing existing tax breaks is critical for establishing a financial framework for a prosperous and clean energy future. In next week’s autumn statement, the chancellor should eliminate these perverse incentives which do not serve the UK’s economic and environmental interests. This would be an important first step for the UK in meeting a call by businesses and civil society to phase out all fossil fuel subsidies by 2020.Shelagh Whitley Head of climate and energy, Overseas Development Institute, Stephen Kretzmann Executive director, Oil Change International, Mika Minio-Paluello Programme coordinator, Platform UK, Marc Stears Chief executive, New Economics Foundation, Dylan Tanner Executive director, InfluenceMap, Peter Wooders Group director, energy, International Institute for Sustainable Development, Mike Barrett Acting executive director, global programmes, World Wildlife Fund UK, Simon Bullock Senior campaigner, climate change and energy, Friends of the Earth England, Wales and Northern Ireland, Richard Dixon Director, Friends of the Earth Scotland • Join the debate – email guardian.letters@theguardian.com • Read more Guardian letters – click here to visit gu.com/letters"
"China could waste as much as half a trillion dollars on unnecessary new coal-fired power stations, a climate campaign group has said, arguing that the world’s top carbon polluter already has more than enough such facilities. China’s rise to become the world’s second largest economy was largely powered by cheap, dirty coal. But as growth slows, the country has had a difficult time weaning itself off the fuel, even as the pollution it causes wreaks havoc on the environment and public health.  Many of China’s giant state-owned coal mining firms are unviable and plagued by overcapacity, but the ruling Communist party is reluctant to turn off the financial taps and risk widespread unemployment, with its potential for anger and unrest.  As of July, China already had 895 gigawatt in coal-fired power stations – representing more than half its electricity generation – said the London-based Carbon Tracker Initiative, which argues for limiting carbon emissions using financial data. The country was operating the coal units at less than half their capacity, the campaign group said on Monday, but “perversely” had another 205GW already under construction and plans for an additional 405GW. At an estimated $800m per kW, that could cost $490bn in total, CTI said. “This misallocation of capital is a microcosm of wider structural woes within the Chinese economy,” it said in a report. Power demand growth had slowed from 10% to 3% or less per year, it added. Even if power consumption grew at 5% a year until 2020 and coal-fired stations were run at 45% capacity, it said, existing plants and those currently under construction would be more than enough. “China no longer needs to build any additional coal plants and therefore should act with conviction to contain its coal overcapacity crisis,” the report said. Beijing has repeatedly pledged to cut overcapacity in several sectors as it seeks to reform the economy to make it more efficient. It set a target of reducing coal production capacity by 250m tonnes this year, which premier Li Keqiang announced last week had been met by the end of October. But even though capacity cuts do not necessarily lead to reductions in production, they have been blamed for rising coal prices, giving stricken producers a new lease of financial life. CTI’s comments echo statements by the environmental campaign group Greenpeace, which estimated in July that China has up to 300GW of excess coal-fired capacity. Two new coal power plant projects were being begun each week across 10 different provinces, Greenpeace said. China’s current five-year plan – a blueprint for economic and social development in 2016 to 2020 – was “disappointing” and “far from ambitious enough” in tackling coal power overcapacity, Greenpeace has said. Public discontent about the environment has grown in China, leading the government to declare a “war on pollution” and vow to reduce the proportion of energy derived from fossil fuels, but critics say efforts have fallen short of expectations."
"As the host of this year’s COP22 climate change conference in Marrakech, Morocco has been keen to demonstrate its green credentials and make this COP the “African COP”. In the past year, Morocco has banned the use of plastic bags, launched new plans for extending the urban tram networks in Casablanca and Rabat, started the process of replacing its dirty old fleet of buses and taxis, launched Africa’s first city bicycle hire scheme, and launched a new initiative – the “Adaptation of African Agriculture” – to help the continent’s farmers adjust to climate change. But by far the most attention has been on the development of “mega” infrastructure projects in an ambitious plan to transform the country’s energy mix. Morocco has no fossil fuel reserves so is almost entirely reliant on imports. In 2015 King Mohammed VI committed the country to increasing its share of renewable electricity generation to 52% by 2030, aiming for the installation of around 10 gigawatts (GW). Of that, 14% is expected to come from solar, with plans to install 2GW of new capacity by 2020, as well as increases in wind power and hydraulic dams. Morocco has even opened the door to exchanging electricity produced from renewable sources with Europe. Morocco’s INDC (Intended Nationally Determined Contribution) plan submitted to the UNFCCC is equally ambitious and commits the country to cutting greenhouse gas emissions – particularly in agriculture – by 32% by 2030, compared to business as usual. Morocco has also committed to planting 200,000 hectares of forest (pdf) and greatly increasing in irrigation. The commitment is dependent on accessing climate financing, but translates to a cumulative reduction of 401 megatonnes of C02 over the period 2020-30. In 2015 Morocco completely removed subsidies on petroleum products. The first phase of the giant Noor solar complex near Morocco’s southern desert town of Ouarzazate is the 160MW Noor One plant, which was opened by the king in February. Instead of PV (photovoltaic) solar panels, Noor uses CSP (concentrated solar power) technology – giant mirrors to reflect the sun’s rays on to tubes containing liquid which is super-heated to drive turbines. CSP offers storage of electricity for up to three hours after the sun has set, which covers peak demand times.  Close to the site of Noor One, Noor two, currently under construction, will use the same CSP technology, but on a bigger scale with the hope of storing electricity for seven hours. Noor Three however will use a new variant on CSP technology – the solar tower, where the mirrors are directed at a central point. Between them they will add another 350MW to the national grid, and are expected to be completed by 2017/18. Noor Four will be constructed near the High Atlas town of Midelt and Morocco’s renewables agency, Masen, announced this week at COP22 that it would open the bidding for two 400MW combined PV and CSP plants in early 2017. Morocco is also investing in wind. A consortium of Enel Green Power, Nareva (owned by King Mohammed VI’s investment company) and Siemens won a bid in March to build five new wind farms at different sites across Morocco – Midelt, Tangier, Jbel Lahdid, and Tiskrid and Boujdour in the disputed Western Sahara territory. Their combined capacity will be 850MW, a huge increase taking Morocco closer to its aim of producing 14% of electricity from wind by 2020. The unit cost in the tender documents was one of the lowest in the world, at just $0.03 per kWh.  But while developing renewable power sounds good on paper, cost will be a big factor. The launch of the Noor CSP project has helped the price of electricity produced by CSP to come down to around $0.16 per kWh, but that looks expensive compared to solar PV which has fallen as low as $0.03 per kWh. It remains to be seen whether the costs of CSP will fall low enough to be globally commercially competitive, and deliver cost-effective renewable power for Moroccan consumers. CSP also uses large amounts of water to keep the mirrors clean – a real problem in water-stressed Morocco. At the same time, Morocco has not totally kicked the fossil fuel habit – coal still makes up the biggest part of energy production today (35%) and is set to be expanded over the next five years. The new energy mix will include at least 3,900MW of energy from natural gas, and the search for hydrocarbon deposits on Moroccan soil continues."
"Nicolas Cage is to take the lead in a new sci-fi movie depicting a world ravaged by climate change. The film, called The Humanity Project, takes place in 2030, when much of the midwest of America has been rendered uninhabitable.  The government agency of the title exiles people felt to be unproductive and banishes them to a colony, New Eden. Cage plays a caseworker seeking to appeal the exile of a single mother (Sarah Lind) and her son (Jakob Davies).   The film has been scripted by Dave Schultz, will be directed by Rob King, and is due to start shooting in British Columbia next week.  The eco-disaster movie dates back to the early 1970s, with Bruce Dern vehicle Silent Running. Other notables in the genre include Soylent Green (1973), Waterworld (1995), The Core (2003), The Day After Tomorrow (2004), Children of Men (2006), Wall-E (2008) and 2012 (2009).  George Miller’s Mad Max series is set in a post-apocalyptic wasteland whose inhabitants seek to defend themselves against drought; Christopher Nolan’s Interstellar depicted an Earth no longer inhabitable, hence the need to explore other potential planets. However that film did not explicitly attribute the situation to global warming. "
"The challenge of climate change is global and it demands action on an international scale, such as the Paris Agreement. But a large part of the solution will be local, involving all of us in the way energy is produced and consumed.  The potential for citizen involvement in electricity production is considerable. A recent study showed that by 2050 half of all Europeans could produce their own electricity either at home, as part of a cooperative, or in their small business. Counting generation from wind and solar power alone, these small actors could meet almost half of Europe’s total electricity needs.   Even more people could support the energy transition, and share in the benefits, by storing power in batteries, electric vehicles and smart boilers. This enables the grid to draw power when it’s cheap and plentiful, and temporarily lighten the load if there’s a peak in demand.  These projections may seem generous, but they must be considered in the context of the unprecedented fall in wind and solar prices. Since 2009, the price of solar panels has fallen by 80% and wind turbines by 40%. And it won’t stop there. Renewable energies are becoming competitive with fossil fuels and new nuclear, such as Hinkley Point, where EDF will try to build the most expensive reactors in the world and provide electricity at an unprecedented cost. Renewable energies and supporting technologies, like storage and demand response, are advancing in leaps and bounds. The old energy companies have been sluggish in catching up, so a regulatory framework that favours the status quo will slow the necessary change to clean energy. Conversely, the right policies can fulfil the great potential for citizen-owned energy. Too often the debate around renewable energy focuses just on the technology. But the benefits of citizen-owned renewables are manifold. Encouraging ordinary people to invest in renewable energy taps a large source of reliable funding for projects. As local people profit from renewable energy projects, and have a say in their planning and running, opposition to developments is avoided in an equitable way.  This also builds more public support for renewable energy generally, with a positive knock-on effect for government policy. The returns on investment in these citizen-owned projects are likely to be spent in the local economies, supporting employment and businesses. The European commission has at least paid lip-service to the important role ordinary people have to play in energy production, as they set out their plan for an EU energy system “with citizens at its core” who “participate actively in the market”. As they and our national governments develop energy policy, we should be demanding that they allow citizens to become active participants, not just passive consumers. What rules do we need in order to unlock this potential? There should be recognition that peoples’ active participation in the market doesn’t just mean the ability to switch supplier – it means producing, consuming and selling their own energy either individually or collectively through cooperatives.  These new entrants need to have fair access to the market, with rules designed for small, medium and large producers alike, without discrimination. For example, the impending tax hike in the UK for owners of commercial and public sector buildings that have installed solar panels is very problematic. We need to see fair prices for the electricity people put back into the grid as well as fair access to the distribution networks. We also need to see an end to punitive taxes, charges and administrative procedures that favour the bigger established players in the energy market. That urgent climate action needs to be taken is no longer up for debate. But we must recognise that there are opportunities as well as challenges. Millions of people are ready to transform our energy system, if the right environment is created for them to do so. We are on the cusp of true energy democracy. It is a chance we cannot miss. • Magnin joined the board of EDF in 2014 but stepped down in July 2016, criticising the plan to construct Hinkley Point C. For more than 25 years, he advocated for energy system changes as founder of the Energy Cities network and now runs a citizen-financed renewable energy cooperative."
"A sudden drop in temperature in Melbourne on Monday evening from peaks of 35C brought with it severe thunderstorms and triggered a mass asthma event that left hospitals struggling to treat 8,500 patients. There is a small group of researchers around the world working to understand the phenomenon known as “thunderstorm asthma”, which although rare, can have devastating consequences. Climate change, they say, may be where part of the blame lies. On Sunday 20 people remained in hospitals across Victoria, struggling with respiratory and related conditions, while four remained in critical condition. At least six people are known to have died after their asthma was triggered during the thunderstorm, the health department confirmed over the weekend. A major, state-wide investigation into the response of emergency services to the event has been ordered.  Paramedics did the best they could to respond to an unprecedented 1,900 emergency calls in five hours on the evening of 21 November but were unable to reach everyone in a reasonable time. Ambulances made constant trips to emergency departments that were already overwhelmed as hundreds of patients streamed in under their own steam. The acting general secretary of Ambulance Employees Australia, Danny Hill, says it would have been a traumatising night for paramedics. “For anyone who worked that night, from staff on the ground to senior management, they regarded it as the busiest night they ever worked in their whole careers,” he says.  “Very few crews got fed. They worked 14 hours straight. Everyone worked together, worked hard, and stepped up. There was about 30 people who were so severely ill that they had to be taken straight into intensive care. So you’re talking an event equivalent to a bushfire where people are severely burned, or a terrorist attack where people are critically injured. “That’s the level of chaos our crews dealt with on Monday night.” Asthma patients can be some of the most difficult for paramedics to respond to. They deteriorate very quickly, and severe cases require more than the immediate treatment a paramedic can provide, including continuous days of intravenous drugs and ventilation. Many, Hill says, went into cardiac arrest. Kathy Bowlen from St Vincent’s hospital says the emergency department there had considered opening a temporary emergency department in the foyer of the hospital to cope with the demand. While not the first case of thunderstorm asthma in Melbourne, it was the most deadly and the severe. What researchers don’t know is why sometimes a combination of high pollen counts and thunderstorms leads to a mass asthma event, while other times, those two factors combined have little impact on people’s respiratory health at all. What other factors might be playing a part? What is known is that grass pollen is usually too big to get into the lungs to cause asthma, and instead causes a reaction in the superficial respiratory systems of those with pollen sensitivity: a hay fever reaction such as a runny nose, sore throat and itchy eyes are more common. But when a thunderstorm occurs, pollen which had settled during the day can be swept back into the air and the moisture in those winds combined with wind power causes the pollen to rupture into smaller pieces, between 0.5mm and 2.5mm in diameter. Those small fragments are then able to penetrate the superficial respiratory system and get into the lungs, triggering asthma and other serious respiratory responses.  Gennaro D’Amato is a professor of respiratory medicine in Italy and chairman of the World Allergy Organisation’s climate change, biodiversity and allergy committee. He is the world expert on thunderstorm asthma and one of the most published authors on the phenomenon in the scientific literature. He has been monitoring thunderstorm asthma events throughout the world and says they have also been seen in London in Britain, Naples in Italy, and Wagga Wagga in New South Wales. A sudden and extreme asthma outbreak that occurred in London in June 1994 coincided with a heavy thunderstorm, D’Amato says. In the space of just 30 hours, 640 patients with asthma or other airway diseases attended London hospitals, nearly 10 times the usual number. For 283 patients, the storm triggered their first known attack of asthma. And for every patient that did seek help, many more suffered at home. “Fortunately, even though it can induce severe asthma, outbreaks associated with thunderstorms are neither frequent nor responsible for a high number of disease exacerbations,” D’Amato tells Guardian Australia.  “However, the mechanisms involved in the release of allergens from pollens during thunderstorm should be known so that patients can receive information about the risk of an asthma attack, including in those usually only affected by seasonal allergic rhinitis [hay fever].” The frequency of thunderstorms has recently increased in some geographical areas, he says, particularly in temperate and subtropical climates. Research has shown that thunderstorms and their destructive winds are expected to become more severe as the climate changes. D’Amato has found a number of characteristics common to all the asthma epidemics. Their occurrence is closely linked to thunderstorms, limited to late spring and summer when there are high levels of airborne pollen grains, and has an onset close to the arrival of the thunderstorm and to major rises in the concentration of pollen grains. People with hay fever and asthma and who stay indoors with windows closed during the thunderstorm are unaffected. Those not undergoing asthma treatment are at major risk, his research has found. In the Melbourne epidemic on Monday, between 20% and 40% of those affected had never had asthma before, and so would not have been undergoing treatment. Associate Prof Paul Beggs, an environmental health scientist with Macquarie University in Sydney, is best known for his research on climate change and its impact on allergens such as pollen. Some research has found that the potency of pollen grains had been increasing, he says. Anthropogenic climate change through the release of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere could be responsible for this growing pollen potency. Between 20 and 40% of those affected had never had asthma before, and so would not have been undergoing treatment “Plants use carbon dioxide in photosynthesis,” he says. “It’s like if you change your diet, there are changes in your body. So plants use carbon dioxide through photosynthesis, and if you change the concentration of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere then their growth conditions are changing.” “A few smart scientists thought to put these highly allergenic plants into a glass house where we can control all the conditions, from the temperature to light, water and levels of carbon dioxide.” What they found, he says, is increasing the amount of carbon dioxide leads to a whole range of changes in the plants, including more pollen and more potent pollen. “All of these thing are happening in the background: climate change, increasing pollen potency, and they all mean a thunderstorm asthma episode is more likely than it was 20 years ago.” Beggs is a researcher with the AusPollen Partnership, a multicentre cross-disciplinary team of investigators including eminent allergy physicians and scientists looking at pollen aerobiology and climatology. Their work is essential given Australia is the fourth worst country for allergic hay fever and asthma. The principal investigator on that team, Associate Prof Janet Davies, says another factor researchers believe may trigger asthma is a sudden temperature change – which occurred in Melbourne on Monday as the temperature fell rapidly from 35C into the low 20s. But much more research and data is needed to understand the phenomenon, she says. “The AusPollen Partnership is encouraging people to tell us about their symptoms and triggers, and free app downloads allow people to do this daily if they want to,” she says. “That will help us understand regional patterns and, by integrating that data with geo-spacial data, will help us understand who is at greater risk and the threshold for triggering a higher risk.”  The difficulty for researchers is that pollen monitoring, though extensive in Melbourne, does not go back far enough to help them develop a clear picture of all the factors triggering thunderstorm asthma. This would allow them to issue alerts when they could see a perfect storm of risk factors about to collide. But Associate Prof Ed Newbigin from the school of biosciences at the University of Melbourne says thunderstorm asthma is going to be “a hard thing to get a handle on” because of the lack of data. “The big question is why sometimes high pollen counts combined with thunderstorms sometimes trigger these asthma events and sometimes don’t,” he says. “We need to understand what other factors work together if we want to reduce thunderstorm asthma. Because in Melbourne, high pollen counts and thunderstorms often coincide. But most of the time when they do, nothing happens.”"
"China has rejected Donald Trump’s claims that climate change is a Chinese hoax, urging the US president-elect to take a “smart decision” over his country’s commitment to the fight against global warming. Trump, who is the first self-declared climate change denier to lead one of the world’s top emitters, has dismissed global warming as “very expensive … bullshit” and claimed the concept “was created by and for the Chinese in order to make US manufacturing non-competitive”.  But speaking at UN climate talks in Marrakech on Wednesday, China’s vice foreign minister, Liu Zhenmin, pointed out that it was in fact the billionaire’s Republican predecessors who launched climate negotiations almost three decades ago. “If you look at the history of climate change negotiations, actually it was initiated by the IPCC [Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change] with the support of the Republicans during the Reagan and senior Bush administration during the late 1980s,” Liu was quoted as saying by Bloomberg.  The IPCC was set up by the UN Environment Programme and the World Meteorological Organisation (WMO) in 1988 in a bid to better understand and respond to the risks of climate change. It received the 2007 Nobel peace prize for helping build “an ever-broader informed consensus about the connection between human activities and global warming”.  Less than three months ago climate campaigners were celebrating after China and the US, the world’s biggest greenhouse gas emitters, agreed to ratify the Paris climate agreement during a meeting between the Chinese and US presidents, Xi Jinping and Barack Obama.  Signatories to the deal, which came into force at the start of November, committed to limiting global warming to no more than 2C above pre-industrial levels, after which scientists believe its effects will become irreversible.  “We have a saying in America that you need to put your money where your mouth is. And when it comes to combating climate change that is what we are doing … we are leading by example,” Obama said during the announcement in China in September.  But the shock victory of Trump threatens to undo much of that work. The president-elect has pledged to pull out of the Paris climate deal and scrap Obama’s Clean Power Plan to slash US carbon emissions. “A Trump presidency might be game over for the climate,” Michael Mann, a prominent climate researcher, told the Guardian last week.  Fears over the environmental cost of a Trump presidency have been heightened by reports that Myron Ebell, a notorious climate change skeptic, has been appointed to head his Environmental Protection Agency transition team.  Such concerns have dominated the UN Climate Change Conference in Marrakech, the first such meeting since the historic 2015 talks in Paris. The Morroco talks began on the eve of the election and conclude on Friday. With some fearing Trump’s victory could embolden other fossil fuel-rich countries to step back from their commitments under the Paris deal, China’s vice foreign minister told reporters it was “essential” the US continued to back the agreement.  “We hope that the US will continue to play a leadership role in the climate change process as people are worried about a repeat of the experience of the Kyoto protocol,” which Washington never ratified, Liu told reporters. “We shall have to wait and see what position they will take … [But we] expect that they will take a right and smart decision to live up to the world’s expectations,” he added, according to Xinhua, China’s official news agency. John Kerry, the outgoing US secretary of state, has sought to reassure politicians and activists in Marrakech while conceding that Trump’s victory had left the international community “feeling uncertain about the future”.  “While I can’t stand here and speculate about what policies our president-elect will pursue, I will tell you this: in the time I have spent in public life, one of the things I have learned, some issues look a little bit different when you’re actually in office compared to when you’re on the campaign trail,” Kerry told delegates at the talks. He added: “No one, no one should doubt the overwhelming majority of the citizens of the US who know climate change is happening and who are determined to keep our commitments in Paris.” But with the American commitment to fighting climate change suddenly in doubt, activists have urged Beijing to continue leading the international effort.  “Not only is climate change no Chinese hoax, but Chinese seriousness may be our best hope,” Deborah Seligsohn, an expert in environmental governance from the University of California at San Diego, argued in an article on the China Dialogue environmental website."

"Yes, Donald Trump’s politics are incoherent. But those who surround him know just what they want, and his lack of clarity enhances their power. To understand what is coming, we need to understand who they are. I know all too well, because I have spent the past 15 years fighting them. Over this time, I have watched as tobacco, coal, oil, chemicals and biotech companies have poured billions of dollars into an international misinformation machine composed of thinktanks, bloggers and fake citizens’ groups. Its purpose is to portray the interests of billionaires as the interests of the common people, to wage war against trade unions and beat down attempts to regulate business and tax the very rich. Now the people who helped run this machine are shaping the government.  I first encountered the machine when writing about climate change. The fury and loathing directed at climate scientists and campaigners seemed incomprehensible until I realised they were fake: the hatred had been paid for. The bloggers and institutes whipping up this anger were funded by oil and coal companies. Among those I clashed with was Myron Ebell of the Competitive Enterprise Institute (CEI). The CEI calls itself a thinktank, but looks to me like a corporate lobbying group. It is not transparent about its funding, but we now know it has received $2m from ExxonMobil, more than $4m from a group called the Donors Trust (which represents various corporations and billionaires), $800,000 from groups set up by the tycoons Charles and David Koch, and substantial sums from coal, tobacco and pharmaceutical companies. For years, Ebell and the CEI have attacked efforts to limit climate change, through lobbying, lawsuits and campaigns. An advertisement released by the institute had the punchline “Carbon dioxide: they call it pollution. We call it life.” It has sought to eliminate funding for environmental education, lobbied against the Endangered Species Act, harried climate scientists and campaigned in favour of mountaintop removal by coal companies. In 2004, Ebell sent a memo to one of George W Bush’s staffers calling for the head of the Environmental Protection Agency to be sacked. Where is Ebell now? Oh – leading Trump’s transition team for the Environmental Protection Agency. Charles and David Koch – who for years have funded extreme pro-corporate politics – might not have been enthusiasts for Trump’s candidacy, but their people were all over his campaign. Until June, Trump’s campaign manager was Corey Lewandowski, who like other members of Trump’s team came from a group called Americans for Prosperity (AFP). This purports to be a grassroots campaign, but it was founded and funded by the Koch brothers. It set up the first Tea Party Facebook page and organised the first Tea Party events. With a budget of hundreds of millions of dollars, AFP has campaigned ferociously on issues that coincide with the Koch brothers’ commercial interests in oil, gas, minerals, timber and chemicals. In Michigan, it helped force through the “right to work bill”, in pursuit of what AFP’s local director called “taking the unions out at the knees”. It has campaigned nationwide against action on climate change. It has poured hundreds of millions of dollars into unseating the politicians who won’t do its bidding and replacing them with those who will. I could fill this newspaper with the names of Trump staffers who have emerged from such groups: people such as Doug Domenech, from the Texas Public Policy Foundation, funded among others by the Koch brothers, Exxon and the Donors Trust; Barry Bennett, whose Alliance for America’s Future (now called One Nation) refused to disclose its donors when challenged; and Thomas Pyle, president of the American Energy Alliance, funded by Exxon and others. This is to say nothing of Trump’s own crashing conflicts of interest. Trump promised to “drain the swamp” of the lobbyists and corporate stooges working in Washington. But it looks as if the only swamps he’ll drain will be real ones, as his team launches its war on the natural world. Understandably, there has been plenty of coverage of the racists and white supremacists empowered by Trump’s victory. But, gruesome as they are, they’re peripheral to the policies his team will develop. It’s almost comforting, though, to focus on them, for at least we know who they are and what they stand for. By contrast, to penetrate the corporate misinformation machine is to enter a world of mirrors. Spend too long trying to understand it, and the hyporeality vortex will inflict serious damage on your state of mind. Don’t imagine that other parts of the world are immune. Corporate-funded thinktanks and fake grassroots groups are now everywhere. The fake news we should be worried about is not stories invented by Macedonian teenagers about Hillary Clinton selling arms to Islamic State, but the constant feed of confected scares about unions, tax and regulation drummed up by groups that won’t reveal their interests. The less transparent they are, the more airtime they receive. The organisation Transparify runs an annual survey of thinktanks. This year’s survey reveals that in the UK only four thinktanks – the Adam Smith Institute, Centre for Policy Studies, Institute of Economic Affairs and Policy Exchange – “still consider it acceptable to take money from hidden hands behind closed doors”. And these are the ones that are all over the media. When the Institute of Economic Affairs, as it so often does, appears on the BBC to argue against regulating tobacco, shouldn’t we be told that it has been funded by tobacco companies since 1963? There’s a similar pattern in the US: the most vocal groups tend to be the most opaque. As usual, the left and centre (myself included) are beating ourselves up about where we went wrong. There are plenty of answers, but one of them is that we have simply been outspent. Not by a little, but by orders of magnitude. A few billion dollars spent on persuasion buys you all the politics you want. Genuine campaigners, working in their free time, simply cannot match a professional network staffed by thousands of well-paid, unscrupulous people. You cannot confront a power until you know what it is. Our first task in this struggle is to understand what we face. Only then can we work out what to do. • Twitter: @GeorgeMonbiot.

"From his claim that global warming was a gigantic hoax masterminded by China to his promise to pull the United States out of the landmark Paris agreement, Donald Trump’s surprise election win was widely decried by those who feared that recent progress in tackling climate change was about to come undone.  But a growing number of environmentally friendly American businesses – including major airlines and banks, as well as energy, tech and pharmaceutical companies – are pushing back against the president-elect’s attempts to dismiss climate change concerns and are planning to take the lead in the drive to make the US a worldwide leader at slowing or reversing the damage. At the first Companies vs Climate Change conference in Fort Lauderdale on Wednesday, a succession of company executives, sustainable business experts and environmental activists spoke of the need for corporate America to step up efforts to help guide policy and fight what many see as the biggest threat facing the world today. “If they don’t then the people who are hellbent on rescinding regulations and just allowing the market to function without any guardrails are likely to undo all the progress that the United States has made over the past 70 years,” said Richard Eidlin, vice-president of policy and campaigns for the lobbying group American Sustainable Business Council.  “Businesses that are in favour of addressing climate change, and maintaining environmental safeguards need to really express their views and express the business case for doing so. Not only is it good for them, and they’re generating profit and mitigating their risk, but what is just as important is stepping into the policy process.” The three-day summit, which brought together executives from companies including TD Bank, Citigroup, Nasdaq, Ingersoll Rand, Bright Power, United and Alaska Airlines, was arranged before Trump’s presidential election victory on 8 November. But because of that, the event became more poignant and provided companies a greater sense of urgency, according to Jason Youner, chief executive of solveclimatechange.com. “Complaining about the election and the incoming administration doesn’t help anybody. We’re not here to debate whether there is climate change. We’re here to try to save the world, because the government’s not going to,” he said. Joe Doolan, head of environmental affairs at TD Bank, said his company planned to press ahead with green initiatives that had won environmental awards and proved popular with customers, including a 15% reduction in its consumption of paper since 2010, partly through eliminating receipts and envelopes at ATMs. “We set ourselves up as an environmental leader back in 2007 and became the first carbon-neutral bank in the US in 2010,” he said.  “We’ve installed solar canopies over our drive-through lanes, which has helped us offset our energy costs, and 90% of our waste is diverted from landfills. For us it’s about reduction, reduction, reduction.” Jeffrey Perlman, founder and chief executive of New York-based Bright Power, an energy and water management company for mostly multi-family residential buildings, said he had “never been so happy for energy policies at a state level”. He said: “We have an incoming administration not willing to even admit that climate change is a thing [but] they won’t be able to dismantle a lot of the great energy policies in the states that are being more progressive. “If we’re talking about how people interact and consume energy, from how they heat and cool their homes to how they do business in a more environmentally friendly way, the only way that happens is through business.”  Smaller businesses say they also have concerns. Forest Green, a nature technology company in Virginia, has launched a “carbon transaction platform” that allows business and individuals to offset their carbon footprint using a mobile phone app. “If compliance isn’t going to come from the government it really is going to be the power of individual decision-making that’s going to create the change,” said company representative Sarah McDonough.  The conference opened with a keynote address from David Fenton, a prominent climate change publicist, who said the politicisation of global warming had dissuaded many businesses from taking action. “Business is more important than ever if we’re going to face a bunch of climate deniers,” he said. “The way climate change has become a partisan issue in the US has become a big issue in the world, other countries look at the US Senate, where one can’t get a simple, non-binding resolution passed that says humans are changing the planet, those countries say, ‘These yahoos in the US aren’t going to do anything, so why should we?’” Eidlin believes that businesses need to send a loud enough message that the Trump administration cannot ignore them. “Many companies have expressed support for US staying in the Paris agreement, more are working with municipalities across the US, so there is a lot of activity,” he said. “On the positive side, it’s great to see more companies stepping up. On the negative side, we need the policies put in place, which is why businesses, when they show up, really have an audience, because policymakers listen to what business people have to say.”"
"Nigel Kennedy asserts that lazy teachers at music colleges stifle individuality in violinists and focus solely on perfecting technique (“Classical ‘factory line’ takes the joy out of Beethoven and Brahms, says Nigel Kennedy”, (News). At the Royal Academy of Music, there are 24 violin professors, whose ages range from 30 to 92 and whose approach is enormously varied. What they have in common is a tireless dedication to nurturing young musicians and preserving at all costs their students’ evolving artistic personalities as communicators through music. We encourage students to take risks in live performance and follow their muse.  There are 103 violin students under my care, who are destined for multiple careers in music. I don’t recognise the perfectionist clones described by Nigel Kennedy, because they don’t survive as musicians. Our students do. I look forward to welcoming Nigel to the Academy to persuade him that he has got this wrong.Professor Jo ColeHead of Strings Royal Academy of Music, London The key element missing from Hillary Clinton’s campaign was the emotional force of Trump’s campaign, plus any hope for the future of the planet (“The shock lessons for liberals from Brexit and the Trumpquake”, Comment). Thanks to TV programmes about the natural world, of which Planet Earth II is a shining example, the public is well aware of the dangers of global warming, even if David Attenborough is prohibited by the BBC from uttering the words “climate change”. In the same vein, global warming did not feature in the Brexit debate or the US presidential election, even though Trump’s position – that climate change is a hoax invented by the Chinese – is absurd. Although Trump is a major climate change denier, most politicians, like much of the media, are in the minor denial camp. They take the view that it is happening, but now is not the time to deal with it as it is going to upset voters or persuade viewers to switch off.

Paul McNamaraSt Albans Leave campaigners absurdly assumed that the EU they painted as so malign would turn benign on negotiating exit (“Europe’s leaders to force Britain into hard Brexit”, News). Meanwhile, the Remain campaign did not point out that this would happen, assuming, I suppose, that admitting that the EU could be vindictive wouldn’t help their case. The election of a US president on a protectionist manifesto changes everything. Now we know that Trump will close down international trade, groups such as the EU will resort to protectionism. It will be impossible for the UK to survive economically outside the EU. We need our leaders to call off Brexit and tell people that what they voted for is no longer feasible.John WilsonLondon Your headline, “Consumers caught out as EU furnishes the UK with crippling copyright laws” (News) is contradicted by the article itself: “Professor Lionel Bentley, director of the Centre for Intellectual Property and Information Law, says it was not required by EU law.” Thus, it is the government (allegedly under pressure from Vitra) that furnished the crippling laws, not the EU.

"Plans to build a third runway at Heathrow may breach the government’s own climate change legislation if other sectors do not make big cuts to emissions, an independent advisory body has warned. The Committee on Climate Change (CCC) said it had “concerns” over how the Department for Transport (DfT) had presented its case for expanding the hub in relation to greenhouse gas emissions. The plans have come under fire over the potential to hit air quality for millions of people living near Britain’s busiest airport, and the CCC warned the proposals could also have a much wider impact on industry. The government announced it had chosen to expand Heathrow over other schemes in October following a review by the Airports Commission. In a letter to the business secretary, Greg Clark, the chairman of the CCC, Lord Deben, said: “The committee has concerns about how it [the DfT] presented the implications for greenhouse gas emissions from aviation in that business case.” The CCC has advised the government that, in order to stay within environment laws, emissions from air travel in 2050 should not exceed 2005 levels. The committee said it expects advances in technology to help to reduce emissions while air travel grows. There has been an 11% increase in demand in the last decade, although the latest data showed emissions are currently lower than in 2005. However, the government’s plan for Heathrow estimates that emissions from aviation will rise by 15% as demand surges by 60% by 2050. “The committee is now concerned that there is scope for misunderstanding of the DfT’s position based on the business case for a third runway at Heathrow,” Lord Deben wrote. “Using the government’s publications, it is not possible to assess whether the investment makes sense when emissions conform to the planning assumption.” Lord Deben warned that plans to expand Heathrow while keeping current targets meant “all sectors would have to prepare for correspondingly higher emission reductions by 2050”. “My committee has limited confidence about the options for other sectors to go beyond these levels by 2050,” he wrote. The Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy told BBC News the government agreed with the Airports Commission’s assessment that a new runway at Heathrow will not breach emissions targets. A spokesman said: “We are considering how we will continue to reduce our emissions across the economy through the 2020s and will set this out in our emissions reduction plan, which will send an important signal to the markets, businesses and investors. “Our commitment to meeting our Climate Change Act target of an at least 80% emissions reduction below 1990 levels by 2050 is as strong as ever.”"
"Oil and gas companies in North America are lagging behind their European counterparts in cleaning up their operations, new research has found, with higher greenhouse gas emissions and less investment in clean alternatives. ExxonMobil and Chevron of the US, alongside Canada’s Suncor, ranked lowest in a review conducted by the Carbon Disclosure Project (CDP) of 11 of the world’s biggest oil and gas companies. At the top of the table came Statoil of Norway, Italy’s Eni and the French company Total.  Companies were rated on criteria including their greenhouse gas emissions and their asset mix, which is determined by the hydrocarbons they extract, and the methods used; their climate-related goals, such as investments in renewables and other forms of low-carbon energy, if any; whether they make efforts to capture and use methane, or flare it; their use of water, and whether they are likely to be affected by water shortages; and the efficiency of their operations. The North American companies ranked so low in part because of their exposure to tar sands, particularly in Canada, and their lack of investment in conventional gas. This is in part explained by the history and geography of the different companies involved: Suncor, for instance, from its headquarters in Montreal, set up the first commercial operation to exploit the Canadian oil sands in the 1960s; while Statoil, with its history of exploration in the North Sea, has had a longer focus on conventional gas. However, factors such as investment in alternatives to fossil fuels, and efforts to reduce emissions from their operations, are matters that are within each company’s control. European companies also face more pressure from governments and activists to become cleaner and reduce emissions, while such pressure is likely to abate further in the US in the next few years under the presidency of Donald Trump and a Republican-dominated Congress. Three major companies – Saudi Aramco, Russia’s Rosneft and PetroChina – were unranked in the CDP report, entitled In the Pipeline and published on Tuesday, because they refused to respond to the organisation’s questions. The Bank of England is also pursuing greater disclosure on climate change issues from the oil and gas sector, with a view to assisting investors. Mark Carney, the governor, has asked a taskforce on climate-related financial disclosure to report to him in December, giving information that would be useful for investors to judge the climate strategies of fossil fuel companies. Paul Simpson, chief executive of the CDP, said: “There are reasons to be optimistic. Some oil and gas majors have the balance sheets to transition to much lower carbon business models, and play a key role in implementing the goals of the Paris agreement.” Tarek Soliman, senior analyst for investor research at the CDP, said: “On both sides of the Atlantic, international oil and gas majors need to look at how they fit into an energy system which achieves the goals laid out in the Paris agreement. Our research shows that European companies have been more active in developing transition strategies for the coming decade, which is expected to feature peak oil demand, and are starting to implement these. But more needs to be done across the board.”"
"The UK has become the 111th country to ratify the Paris climate agreement, which aims to avoid the most devastating effects of climate change by cutting carbon emissions. The foreign minister, Boris Johnson, who has flirted with climate scepticism, signed the pact in London on Thursday after a parliamentary deadline passed on Wednesday night, with no objections raised.  Speaking at the UN climate summit in Marrakech, Nick Hurd, the industry and climate minister, said: “The UK is ratifying the historic Paris agreement so that we can help to accelerate global action on climate change and deliver on our commitments to create a safer, more prosperous future for us all. “I hope this will send a very strong message of continued international commitment to implement Paris because it is obviously very important to send that signal out.” Salaheddine Mezouar, the Moroccan foreign minister and president of the COP22 summit, told the Guardian: “It is excellent news that the UK has ratified, and it comes at the right moment. It is a good response to all those people who are sceptical about climate change.” It's a climate change accord agreed by nearly 200 countries in December 2015, which came into force on 4 November 2016. The agreement commits world leaders to keeping global warming below 2C, seen as the threshold for safety by scientists, and pursuing a tougher target of 1.5C. The carbon emission curbs put forward by countries under Paris are not legally-binding but the framework of the accord, which includes a mechanism for periodically cranking those pledges up, is binding. The agreement also has a long-term goal for net zero emissions which would effectively phase out fossil fuels.   The US election of Donald Trump, who has renounced climate science and promised to withdraw from the Paris agreement, has fed anxiety about future efforts to contain climate change. But while the UK’s Brexit vote may be moving the country closer to the US geopolitically – and has literally shifted its climate summit pavilion from the EU to the US tent – its endorsement of the Paris deal was widely welcomed as a boost to the Paris treaty. Greenpeace UK’s chief scientist, Doug Parr said that having set a target for curbing carbon emissions, the UK now needed to find the quickest and cheapest route to get there.  “A mix of renewables, battery storage and efficiency measures is the way to go,” he said. “If Theresa May wants to have an industrial strategy that can cut emissions, create jobs, and help keep down bills, she should put low-carbon infrastructure at its heart.” The UK’s negotiating partners may also look to May to keep in check climate-sceptic impulses among some of her own ministers. Johnson has irreverently described the global leaders who drafted the Paris treaty as driven by “a primitive fear” that warmer weather was caused by humanity – a fear that he described as “without foundation”. Hurd said such talk should be taken with a pinch of salt: “Words count for one thing. You look for proof points. I think the fact that within days of this administration taking over, one of its first acts was to put into law the fifth carbon budget is an important proof point.” The shadow climate minister, Barry Gardiner, said: “The UK government must now show their commitment through climate action on the ground. We face a 47% shortfall to meet our 2030 climate target. Pursuing fracking and a six-fold tax hike on solar business rates only take us in the wrong direction.” To meet its climate commitments, the UK will have to decarbonise the lion’s share of its electricity by 2030 according to the government’s official advisers, the committee on climate change (CCC).  The government’s strategy currently favours an expansion in nuclear power and fracking for shale gas, the latter of which could ramp up carbon emissions if it is not displacing coal. Controversially, it has also rowed back support for solar and onshore wind power. Clean energy business groups, though, welcomed today’s announcement as a sign that the UK would continue to play a progressive role in the international climate process. Stephanie Pfeifer, the CEO of the Institutional Investors Group on Climate Change, which represents investors with over €14tn (£12tn) of assets in clean energies, said: “This encouraging announcement can only help sustain the ‘spirit of Paris’ and the momentum behind the international consensus to drive substantial action on climate change.” Jill Duggan, the director of The Prince of Wales’s Corporate Leaders Group (CLG), said: “The UK government’s ratification of the agreement today sends an important signal to international allies, businesses and investors about the inevitable transition towards a zero carbon economy.” Sir Crispin Tickell, former British ambassador to the United Nations, said: “Britain’s ratification of the historic Paris agreement is an important moment, not least because our country has for a long time led global efforts to cope with the effects of climate change.”"
"It is staggering that in 2016, the hottest year on record, the chancellor can present a budget that has no mention of climate change (Report, 24 November). Indeed, most policies and spending plans are heading in the wrong direction. We have more money for new roads and fracking keeps its subsidy, but cuts to the local authorities who subsidise bus services.  The freeze on fuel duty is another backward step and shows that the government cares nothing about climate change, air pollution or public health. Last year saw a record number of vehicles on our roads, especially in rural areas where bus services have been decimated. The government could bring us healthier air and less congestion by raising fuel duty and using the money to reverse the devastating cuts to buses. We need to give people the choice of travelling by public transport, walking and cycling, but that can only happen if we make the polluter pay and use the money raised to invest in things that are good for our health and our environment.Jenny JonesGreen party, House of Lords  • As a member of Citizens’ Climate Lobby, I thank Dana Nuccitelli for writing about our work (Groups working with Republicans on climate see glimmer of hope, theguardian.com, 21 November) and the advantages of (and roadblocks to) a carbon tax. A carbon tax is gaining favour with governments and economists worldwide. Ironically, if – as it appears – a tax is not in our immediate future, other countries could slap one on our exports. Then we might reconsider a fee-and-dividend to improve our own economy, environment, and public health rather than pay someone else’s tax. In any case progress will come, as it already has, from states, local jurisdictions, and the private sector because reducing emissions makes economic sense. Washington can at most help, or at least stay out of the way. China has a major role in this drama. It has taken praiseworthy steps to reduce its carbon emissions. It is a leading exporter of wind turbines, and its technology has made solar energy affordable worldwide. Now it hopes to wrest the mantle of climate leadership from America. You want to compete with China, Mr Trump? Then compete to save the climate. Denying reality, trashing the environment, rushing headlong toward climate catastrophe, and withdrawing from the global community won’t make America great.

"Donald Trump is poised to eliminate all climate change research conducted by Nasa as part of a crackdown on “politicized science”, his senior adviser on issues relating to the space agency has said. Nasa’s Earth science division is set to be stripped of funding in favor of exploration of deep space, with the president-elect having set a goal during the campaign to explore the entire solar system by the end of the century.  This would mean the elimination of Nasa’s world-renowned research into temperature, ice, clouds and other climate phenomena. Nasa’s network of satellites provide a wealth of information on climate change, with the Earth science division’s budget set to grow to $2bn next year. By comparison, space exploration has been scaled back somewhat, with a proposed budget of $2.8bn in 2017. Bob Walker, a senior Trump campaign adviser, said there was no need for Nasa to do what he has previously described as “politically correct environmental monitoring”. “We see Nasa in an exploration role, in deep space research,” Walker told the Guardian. “Earth-centric science is better placed at other agencies where it is their prime mission. “My guess is that it would be difficult to stop all ongoing Nasa programs but future programs should definitely be placed with other agencies. I believe that climate research is necessary but it has been heavily politicized, which has undermined a lot of the work that researchers have been doing. Mr Trump’s decisions will be based upon solid science, not politicized science.”  Trump has previously said that climate change is a “hoax” perpetrated by the Chinese, although on Tuesday he said there is “some connectivity” between human actions and the climate. There is overwhelming and long-established evidence that burning fossil fuels and deforestation causes the release of heat-trapping gases, therefore causing the warming experienced in recent decades. Walker, however, claimed that doubt over the role of human activity in climate change “is a view shared by half the climatologists in the world. We need good science to tell us what the reality is and science could do that if politicians didn’t interfere with it.” It’s understood that federal government scientists have been unnerved by Trump’s dismissal of climate science and are concerned that their work will be sidelined as part of a new pro-fossil fuels and deregulation agenda. Climate scientists at other organizations expressed dismay at the potential gutting of Earth-based research. Kevin Trenberth, senior scientist at the National Center for Atmospheric Research, said as Nasa provides the scientific community with new instruments and techniques, the elimination of Earth sciences would be “a major setback if not devastating”. “It could put us back into the ‘dark ages’ of almost the pre-satellite era,” he said. “It would be extremely short sighted. “We live on planet Earth and there is much to discover, and it is essential to track and monitor many things from space. Information on planet Earth and its atmosphere and oceans is essential for our way of life. Space research is a luxury, Earth observations are essential.” Michael Mann, a climate scientist at Penn State University, said Nasa has a “critical and unique role” in observing Earth and climate change.  “Without the support of Nasa, not only the US but the entire world would be taking a hard hit when it comes to understanding the behavior of our climate and the threats posed by human-caused climate change,” he said. “It would be a blatantly political move, and would indicate the president-elect’s willingness to pander to the very same lobbyists and corporate interest groups he derided throughout the campaign.” Nasa has appointed two officials, Tom Cremins and Jolene Meidinger, to lead the transition to the new Trump administration. However, the president-elect’s team has yet to formally review the space agency.  “The Nasa community is committed to doing whatever we can to assist in making the executive branch transition a smooth one,” a Nasa spokesman said. “The agency remains focused on the future, a future that will improve our understanding of our changing home planet from Nasa’s unique platforms in space.”"
"When Malcolm Turnbull was dumped by the Liberal party in 2009 because he refused to renounce support for emissions trading, the man now about to assume responsibility for implementing Donald Trump’s evisceration of US climate change policy was elated.  Myron Ebell, a veteran warrior against action on global warming, wrote on his “competitive enterprise institute” blog that “toppling Turnbull was a necessary step” in defeating Australia’s cap and trade scheme. And he understood exactly who deserved credit.  “A number of Liberal members have risked their careers to stop cap-and-trade, including Cory Bernardi and Nick Minchin as well as Tony Abbott. They should all be honored for their courageous stand,” Ebell enthused. Trump, who has claimed the “concept” of global warming was concocted by the Chinese to hurt American manufacturing, has vowed to withdraw from the Paris climate change treaty, abolish the Environment Protection Authority’s climate policy role, scrap Barack Obama’s centrepiece Clean Power Plan and dismantle any curbs on fossil fuel developments. Trump’s transition to government website says: “We will streamline the permitting process for all energy projects, including the billions of dollars in projects held up by President Obama, and rescind the job-destroying executive actions under his Administration. We will end the war on coal, and rescind the coal mining lease moratorium ... and conduct a top-down review of all anti-coal regulations issued by the Obama Administration.” Ebell, whose organisation has had financial links to the coal industry, is widely reported to be in charge of that transition at the EPA. The concept of global warming was created by and for the Chinese in order to make U.S. manufacturing non-competitive. Little wonder that his “honored” friends in Australia are elated. Abbott declared Trump’s election would “put climate change into a better perspective” and diminish the “moral panic” about global warming. Presumably the better perspective is one where we don’t do very much about it, and the “morality” not worth panicking about is the idea that we should not leave our children a world experiencing dangerous and irreversible change. And since the Liberal party dumped Turnbull the first time, some new conservatives have arrived who would also probably earn Ebell’s praise. One of them is the man Turnbull has now appointed as resources minister, the Liberal National party senator Matt Canavan. From the moment he took up the portfolio, Canavan has talked up the “uncertainties” of climate science. And soon after Trump’s election, Canavan was hailing it as a budgetary boon for Australia, in part because coal mining would be able to continue unconstrained. “Donald Trump is good for fossil fuels, good for steel and good for Australia,” he told the Australian.“President-elect Trump was very clear in his support for the coal mining sector, whereas President Obama had taken steps to restrict expansion of the coal industry,’’ he said. “The newly elected president has said he’ll rescind those regulations and that’s having an effect on world markets.” But at exactly the same time, Turnbull was announcing that Australia would go ahead and ratify the Paris agreement, despite some of his own backbenchers declaring that Trump’s victory had rendered the deal “cactus”.  The Paris pact, Turnbull declared, was “a watershed and a turning point”. Problem is, it’s only a turning point and a watershed if nations do what they promised – that is, constrain global warming to “well below 2C”, which requires them not only to meet the greenhouse emissions reductions already pledged but also to increase them over time to actually meet that aim. And that requires the phasing out, over time, of coal.  The latest world energy outlook from the conservative International Energy Agency shows that under the scenario necessary to meet the existing Paris targets (still not enough to limit warming to 2C), fossil fuels decline from 67% of the energy mix to 24%, and 16% of that 24% is carbon capture and storage, the viability of which remains uncertain. A Climate Analytics report has found that developed countries will have to stop burning coal for electricity by 2030, China by 2040 and the rest of the world by mid-century in order to meet commitments made in Paris.  To underline the obvious, we really cannot simultaneously hail the Paris agreement as a turning point and rejoice in a glorious long-term economic future for the coal industry. Except that is exactly what the Turnbull government is doing. There are many difficult choices facing Australia as a Trump administration upends the existing world order. And the Turnbull government was already stretching credulity with its insistence that it could meet the Paris targets, despite the emissions reduction fund probably running out of money next year and its suggestion that a looming policy review won’t impose any new requirements on industry. But, as in so many other ways, the ascent of Trump is polarising things, forcing a choice between the agenda of Ebell and Abbott, and the ever more urgent efforts to do something about global warming. We cannot keep pretending. Back when Ebell celebrated his ousting, we knew where Turnbull stood. He wouldn’t lead a party that wasn’t as committed to action on global warming as he was. Now he does, but those who overthrew him believe that despite his return to the leadership, they have him tamed. Time is running out for him to prove otherwise. And Trump’s radical reverse gear on climate makes it even harder for his government to continue its obfuscation."
"The global green movement is preparing for the fight of its life against efforts by Donald Trump to rollback action on climate change, with a surge in fundraising, planned court challenges and a succession of protests. Environmental activists said the election of a climate change denier as US president, along with the prospect of former vice-presidential nominee Sarah Palin and various oil billionaires holding senior posts, has prompted an “outpouring” of donations.   This week, comedian, John Oliver, used his show to urge viewers to give to the Natural Resources Defense Council, while EarthJustice, a specialist in environmental law, reported a “substantial increase” in donations to wage the expected legal battles ahead. The Sierra Club said it has had 9,000 new monthly donors since election day, more than they had in the year to date.  After spending eight years cheering and occasionally scolding Barack Obama, environmentalists are now moving on to a war footing. Campaigns will be pitched around climate action and protecting national parks, with green groups claiming that public support for these things means that Trump has no mandate to tear them apart.  With Congress and the White House in Republican hands, the message will have to resonate in conservative ears rather than just energise the base. “We won’t be in a defensive crouch for the next four years, licking our wounds,” said Michael Brune, executive director of the Sierra Club, America’s largest green group. “If Trump tries to go backwards on climate change he’ll run headlong into an organised mass of people who will fight him in the courts, in Congress and on the streets.” May Boeve, the director of international climate group 350.org, which during the Obama presidency fought and won against the Keystone oil pipeline that is now back on the agenda, said building alliances with Trump’s heartland would be key. “The best way to unite a progressive coalition with working class voters is to push for a 100% renewable energy economy that works for all,” she said. “Clean energy remains the greatest potential job creator in the 21st century, while climate change is still our greatest threat.”  The group said it was “preparing for the fight of our lives”, planning a mass mobilisation of people in Washington DC to put pressure on Trump, and a separate effort to push Obama to use his final days in office to pursue green measures, such as stopping the controversial Dakota Access pipeline. Environmentalists said that, while Trump’s hand in the courts and Congress might be stronger than it was when they fought against George W Bush, one key difference was that businesses were now convinced of the need for curbing emissions. At the UN climate talks this week in Marrakech, a coalition of businesses including Kellogg’s and Mars, urged leaders to commit to long-term carbon plans. “Ten years ago, US business wasn’t on board about tackling climate change,” said Craig Bennett, CEO of Friends of the Earth in the UK. “This time round you have a situation where US businesses and businesses more globally [support action], so this time around the environmental movement does not feel like it is on its own. We’re much better placed to fight this.” In the UK, a cross-party group of MPs and environment groups has already begun meeting to discuss how to respond to anti-environmental rhetoric from the Trump administration, and how to deal with the consequences of the president elect delivering on his promise to withdraw from the Paris climate agreement.  Climate campaigners are planning a protest outside the US embassy in London on Friday night at the prospect of the country pulling out of the Paris accord. “I am absolutely sure this will be one of many. There is another in a week. There will certainly be demonstrations on his inauguration day,” said Phil Thornhill, who is organising the protest that he hopes will attract a few hundred people. On inauguration day, activists in Britain are also planning to drop “Build bridges, not walls” banners from all of London’s bridges – and potentially famous bridges elsewhere – to call on Trump to rethink any regressive steps on climate change. In Australia, the Trump victory is driving an intensified focus from environmentalists to put a stop to a proposed coalmine there, which would be the biggest in the already coal-rich nation, and one of the biggest in the world. Indian company Adani has been trying for years now to get approval to develop a $16bn (£13bn) coal mine in outback Queensland, as well as an expanded port on the country’s Great Barrier Reef coast so the coal can be exported. Stopping the mine has already been a major focus of the climate movement in Australia, with several court cases challenging its environmental approvals, including on the grounds that the emissions its coal will produce will contribute to climate change. But after millions of working class voters in the US were convinced to vote for Trump – their concerns not adequately addressed by the Democrats or the climate movement – green groups in Australia are concerned there may be a risk of something similar happening there. And that could end up giving strengthened political support to the controversial mine.     GetUp is a campaigning group in Australia, which raises money through crowdfunding and says it fights for human rights, economic justice and environmental sustainability. Paul Oosting, national director of GetUp, told the Guardian he’s concerned the hard right in Australia were adopting similar tactics to those adopted by Trump. But he said they have plans to undermine that. “At the last federal election, GetUp targeted the hard right of Australian politics, because they hold Australia back on issues like global warming, and public health and education,” Oosting said. That strategy appeared to be effective. “What we found was that if you listen to people’s concerns, and highlight the threats to their interests posed by the hard right, people seize the chance to turf them out,” said Oosting.   Oosting would not reveal details of the strategy, but said they would use similar tactics they found successful during the federal election, and apply it against the Adani mine. GetUp is not alone. There is a consensus growing among environmental groups in Australia that Adani should be a primary focus of the climate movement there. Geoff Cousins, president of the Australian Conservation Foundation, said his organisation, which is currently fighting the mine’s approval in the country’s highest court, is going to redouble its efforts to stop the mine.   “We’ve commenced discussions with possible financiers [of the mine] – we met with banks and we will redouble those efforts. And we’re looking at a whole range of inventive measures that I’m not at liberty to discuss at the moment,” he said."
"Climate change is like the type of film director who, having already thrown the audience into seemingly inescapable peril, keeps piling on the jeopardy. The carbon budget to stay below the Paris climate accord’s target of 1.5C of warming is all but used up, and staying below even its lower goal of 2C now requires elaborate leaps of faith.  While signatories to that agreement make decisions on national infrastructure in direct contradiction to it, the most powerful economy on Earth falls under the spell of a reality TV demagogue, at best uninterested in the issue and at worst determined to promote the industries and energy choices that will make the problem catastrophic.  We need to find a new way to engage when the highest power is won on policies picked by a snake oil salesman who’s promised with a nod and a shrug to solve the nation’s problems. On everything from climate change, to the EU and international cooperation needed for action, our reality is being shaped by people who tell tales with plot holes, continuity errors and no regard for factual grounding. Those who care about these issues must learn to tell better tales. Yet there’s a problem. The presentation of evidence, sober argument and the appeal to reason is deeply engrained in the culture of campaigning for progressive change. Other approaches tend to leave advocates feeling insecure, suspicious or lacking confidence.  But this is what Philip Pullman, one of our greatest storytellers, has to say in the foreword for a new collection of modern folk tales for troubling times, ‘There was a knock at the door...’: Stories are one of the most ancient and most effective ways of making sense of the world. There are some very stern people who think that stories can’t be important or useful because they’re only ‘made up’. How wrong that is! The human imagination is profoundly important, and when it turns to exploring the problems we human beings find when we try to live a good life in a world we seem to be simultaneously destroying, there is nothing more valuable or worth encouraging. The collection opens, appropriately with a tale by the poet Jan Dean, called The Magician. In it, the promise of an easy life is made to a young woman in return for simply lighting the fires in the magician’s house each day for a year. But each day the house and fires grow, the task becomes impossible and the world beyond is gradually consumed. I recently heard of an academic who has taken to challenging his students when they propose responses to climate change with the question: ‘but is this a 1.5C solution, or a 2C, 3C or 4C answer?’ It’s a good question and one that should be put to every policy proposal to see if it is part of hauling the world back from the current climate brink. Of course, the actual number above about 2C becomes slightly immaterial, as beyond this level there’s no guarantee of stabilising temperature rise (and many argue that to be the case at 2C as well, which is why the lower 1.5C figure appears in the Paris accord). Whatever tale we come up with, it will have to be one of rapid transition. Last weekend I took the slow train from London to Uppsala in Sweden, wherewe are working with the climate scientist Prof Kevin Anderson and his Swedish university colleagues to explore current and historical examples of rapid transition in our energy use, infrastructure, cultural norms and behaviour.  We hope, alongside other related work to end up better able to understand and describe the conditions in which rapid, progressive change occurs. And with that, allow people to imagine such change and help remove resistance to it. The work will be evidence-based, analytical and factual. But that will not be enough.  We will also have to find a better story to tell, in which people can discern a better future and answers to a host of social and economic problems. It will have to be a tale people can believe in and will want to read to the end.  On the journey to Sweden, at one point the train leaves the land and goes physically on to a ferry boat. Unusual and surprising as that is, then there’s a moment when you’re poised between the sheltering harbour and the vast horizon of an uncontrollable sea. This is the point where our story might begin."
"Most of Australia can expect a hotter-than-average December, with temperatures being forced up by both regional climate patterns and a global upwards trend. Temperatures were forecast to peak between 29C and 34C on Thursday, the first day of summer, in all states bar Victoria and Tasmania. Melbourne and Hobart could look forward to highs of 21C and 24C.  Queensland would be the worst affected, with Friday expected to be Brisbane’s hottest December day in 15 years peaking at 38C. Severe heatwave conditions forecast in southern and central parts of the state were forecast to continue into early next week. The Bureau of Meteorology (BoM) warned residents to be mindful of the impact of heat stress. There were also low- to severe-intensity heatwave conditions across northern Western Australia and the Top End of the Northern Territory.  Almost all of Australia could expect drier-than-average conditions in December, with a 70 to 80% chance of below-average rainfall across most of the eastern part of the country. Above-average temperatures were forecast for days and nights across eastern and northern Australia for the entire summer through to February. The higher-than-usual pressures in the short term were the result of a climate driver known as the Southern Annular Mode, typically associated with reduced rainfall and higher temperatures. It was forcing wind systems further north than normal, holding monsoon weather at bay while moving air far across the continent. “It acts a bit like a wall that blocks the influence of the tropical wet season,” said Andrew Watkins, the acting head of climate monitoring and prediction at BoM. The combination has resulted in severe fire danger for parts of NSW, Queensland, WA and ACT, and that risk would persist with the drier and hotter conditions over the summer. The second-wettest winter on record had encouraged grass growth, prompting concerns about fast-running grass fires, particularly on the urban fringe, said Watkins. The Bushfire and Natural Hazards Cooperative Research Centre said the fire risk was predominately in grassland areas of Victoria and NSW.  Cyclone season is not set to begin in earnest until January, but Watkins said an average to above-average season – typically 11 cyclones – was forecast. Last season there were only three, a record low, because of an “exceptionally strong” El Niño. “We don’t want people to be complacent because not much happened last year ... It was not typical by any means.” BoM’s seasonal outlook for December to February also warned that “Australian climate patterns were being influenced by the long-term increasing trend in global air and ocean temperatures”. This year has already been declared the hottest ever recorded. Watkins said it was difficult to break down the impact of climate change on weather in Australia compared with local patterns and drivers. “The reality is climate change is playing a role in all of our weather and climate these days,” he said. "
"“We lose 5% of our potential GDP every year, and African industries cannot be competitive without access to electricity,” says Akinwumi Adesina, president of the African Development Bank. “I believe that’s why we can’t break away from reliance on exporting our raw materials – new industries will only go to where there’s power.” He is speaking on the sidelines of the COP22 climate change conference in Marrakech, which ends on Friday.  Adesina and colleagues from the bank have been using the conference to highlight its new initiatives on energy, including the New Deal on Energy for Africa, which will see $12bn (£9.7bn) invested in the sector over the next five years. “Africa is tired of being in the dark,” he says.  The African Development Bank (AfDB) has also created the role of vice-president on power, and been a major player in setting up the African Renewable Energy Initiative, which aims to generate 10GW of power from renewable sources by 2020 and up to 300GW by 2030. “This initiative was the major outcome for Africa of the Paris COP21 meeting last year, where G7 countries contributed $10bn towards it,” says Adesina.  Adesina says he is particularly impressed by the strides Morocco has taken to develop its capacity for solar energy. The AfDB was a major investor in the 160MW Noor solar plant at Ouarzazate, which was opened this year. The complex, which uses giant mirrors to reflect the sun’s heat on to liquid that then turns turbines, is being expanded to produce more than 500MW by 2018. Morocco has also recently signed a deal to build 1720MW in new wind farm capacity. “Africa should use what it has and not what it doesn’t have. We have limitless sunshine and great potential for wind, hydro and geothermal,” he says. However, he still believes there is a role for non-renewable sources of energy in Africa. “We need a balanced energy mix. Some African countries have gas and coal, which can be used in a clean way, and they should use it.” Another major challenge is to increase the amount of money spent on climate change adaptation – or helping countries to rebuild systems when they are destroyed by the impacts of climate change. In Africa, for example, governments are coping with floods, extreme temperatures and major droughts in east and southern Africa and the Sahel.  Wealthy countries have committed $100bn towards helping poorer states cope with climate change, but one of the major topics on the agenda in Marrakech has been how that money should be divided between adaptation and mitigation. Until now, only 14% of climate funds have gone to adaptation, and Africa, the continent most deeply affected by climate change, has received only 4% of the total green climate funds. “We’ve been short-changed by climate change and we should not be short-changed in financing,” says Adesina. “South Africa has spent $700m this year dealing with the impacts of the drought last year; Mozambique $200m; Namibia $13m. These emergency costs are continuously displacing public expenditure which should be going to health, education and infrastructure development, and endangering macro-economic stability. My view is that we need to increase the amount to be spent on adaptation so that we can spend money on development.” The AfDB is trying to garner support for an African insurance fund. An initiative called the African Risk Capacity Insurance has been launched, but of 32 countries that signed up, only seven have been able to pay the premiums. Adesina says the idea for the insurance fund was welcomed on Wednesday at an African heads of state meeting chaired by Morocco’s King Mohammed VI, and that one way in which climate finance can be better targeted to help African countries is for green climate funds such as the GEF (Global Environment Facility) to start paying the premiums for the African countries. He hopes that this could pave the way for action. “Whenever these drastic climate events like drought, flood or extreme temperature happen, the world has words of comfort for Africa,” says Adesina. “But words of comfort cannot pay the bills and rebuild when problems start.”"
"For thousands of years the ice-capped Aru mountain range in western Tibet has been a steady presence, but this year, two vast ice avalanches changed the shape of the region in an instant.  The first, which occurred without warning on 17 July, sent 60m cubic metres (24,000 olympic swimming pools) of ice and rock tearing down a narrow valley in Rutog county, killing nine herders and hundreds of sheep and yaks. By the time it stopped the debris covered 10sq km and was up to 30 metres deep.  Dramatic glacier collapses like this are exceedingly rare – the only known ice avalanche of comparable size was the 2002 Kolka glacier event in the Caucasus mountains – and yet, just two months later on 21 September, a neighbouring Tibetan glacier also imploded, generating a similarly large avalanche deposit, but thankfully no casualties this time.  That “one such event should occur is remarkable; two is unprecedented”, writes the geoscientist Dave Petley in his landslide blog. The trigger for these massive avalanches, which occurred on relatively gentle slopes, has left scientists baffled. One explanation for the sudden movement may be global warming. Temperatures in Tibet have risen by 0.4°C per decade – double the global average. Glacier melt plus increased rainfall may have rapidly lubricated the base of these glaciers.  “The most likely explanation for the Tibet avalanches … is climate change,” Petley concludes in his blog. If he is right then we can expect to see more of these events, and scientists are now keeping a careful eye on satellite images, to spot the next glacier failure before it occurs.  "
"If Malcolm Turnbull does provide $1bn in taxpayer support to the Adani Carmichael coalmine via the Northern Australia Infrastructure Facility (NAIF) it will show that while the prime minister may have lost many things in the past 12 months, he has not lost his agility. The man who once staked his leadership on the need for Kevin Rudd’s carbon price will be the champion of subsidising the world’s largest new coalmine. Never before has one announcement destroyed so many political cliches, so quickly, for so little political gain. In offering public money to subsidise the major cause of climate change, the PM simultaneously kills the idea that the Coalition is concerned about excessive public spending AND that they believe the world is committed to reducing greenhouse gas emissions. So much for faith in the market, the need to embrace the technologies of the future and the idea that our cities are the engine of prosperity and productivity. At 40km long and 10km wide, the size of the Adani coalmine is simply beyond most people’s comprehension. If you stood on top of the tallest building in Australia you wouldn’t be able to see as far as the open cut pits would stretch. But it is not just the size of the mine that is incomprehensible, it is the economics and the politics. As the world moves away from its reliance on coal, a raft of Australian politicians seem determined to place large taxpayer bets that things are going to turn around. China’s coal consumption peaked in 2014; the UK is closing all its remaining coal fired power stations within nine years; and consumption of coal across Europe has halved since 1990. And yet the Australian government hopes that emerging economies like Vietnam will embrace coal. They might, but they probably will not. Building new coalmines in a flat world market for coal simply pushes down the market share and market price for existing coalmines. Just as Uber is cutting into the market share of the taxi industry, starting new coalmines in Queensland will hurt workers in, and owners of, coalmines in NSW and the rest of Queensland. The silence of these mine owners makes as little sense as the Coalition’s new found enthusiasm for industry subsidies. But it is not just other coalmines that will be harmed by the construction of the Adani coalmine. The economic modelling commissioned by Adani themselves concludes that building the world’s largest coalmine in remote Queensland will “crowd out” hundreds of manufacturing jobs as mines need people with similar skills and there isn’t time to train up new apprentices. Despite the fact that Adani’s own economists have sworn under oath that the mine will create less than 1,500 jobs, the federal government, the Queensland premier and the Adani public relations machine all claim that the project would create 10,000 or more jobs. Unlike Adani’s economists, these public boosters for the project do not have to make their claims in front of a judge. There is also a remarkable silence about the fact that Adani plans to employ as many robots as it can and as few people as possible. According to Adani Mining’s CEO, “All the vehicles will be capable of automation. When we ramp up the mine, everything will be autonomous from mine to port. In our eyes, this is the mine of the future.” There are more than 140,000 unemployed people in Queensland and the Queensland unemployment rate would remain well above the national average with or without the environmental devastation of the Adani Carmichael mine. There is no doubt that the public wants action to create jobs, but there is also no doubt that the vast majority of the public would prefer that taxpayers’ money be used to do almost anything other than subsidise an enormous new coalmine.  According to a poll commissioned by The Australia Institute, the public is highly supportive of increased public investment in the infrastructure and services that are both used by, and employ, most Australians. The polling showed: Since his near death experience at the last election and the subsequent re-emergence of One Nation in Australia, Malcolm Turnbull has been dragged steadily away from his original agenda and back towards that of Tony Abbott and Barnaby Joyce. But the poll described above makes clear that the more the prime minister does to appease the conservatives in his party room, the further he moves away from the constituencies that made him prime minister. A world that is reducing greenhouse gas emissions needs less coalmines, not more. The fact that the Adani mine is not economically viable without public subsidies should send a powerful signal to the conservatives in the Coalition that they are backing the wrong horse. But rather than listen to the market, or the voters, the Turnbull government is listening to itself. Every billion dollars spent on fossil fuel subsidies is a billion dollars that is not spent on schools, hospitals, broadband connections and public transport. Building infrastructure to improve the functionality of cities and towns, including but not limited to those in the north, is a better long-term job creator than subsidising another coalmine. What’s more, research shows that ordinary Australians understand this economic reality better than the Turnbull government.  Any project can be made economic with enough government subsidy. Creating one of the world’s largest coalmines, which will create very few jobs, is the last thing taxpayers should be paying for. Ben Oquist is the Executive Director of The Australia Institute. "
"If you’ve ever visited the Great Barrier Reef, or are one of the 70,000 people whose job relies upon it, you know why it’s considered one of the seven natural wonders of the world. Yet it faces more pressure than ever before, from global warming, water quality, industrialisation of the coastline, and ever more extreme weather.  Earlier this decade, the coal bonanza coming out of Queensland saw proposals for six new or expanded ports and thousands more coal ships, fed by multiple proposed mega mines. It was this industrialisation of the reef with mass dredging and offshore dumping of sludge that first saw the world heritage committee warn Australia that the reef could be placed on the “in-danger” list. The community and scientists were outraged, and in parliament the Australian Greens moved Senate inquiries and private members’ bills to stop the onslaught the reef was facing. Faced with an international shame listing of “in danger” that would jeopardise this $6bn tourism icon, port proposals were marginally scaled back and both state and federal governments finally backflipped and ended offshore dumping of sludge into the reef’s waters from capital dredging.  The reef was placed on the watch list for in-danger listing and governments said pretty words about doing more to save it. Then 2016 happened. A combination of fossil-fuel-driven global warming and El Niño saw the reef’s water temperatures skyrocket, which caused the worst mass coral bleaching the reef had ever faced. There was no temperature respite for that coral to bounce back after the bleaching, and almost one quarter of the reef’s corals died, including two-thirds of the corals in the 700km northern section of the reef. On Friday, the Queensland and Australian governments had to hand in their homework to the world heritage committee on what they were doing about those earlier concerns and this mass bleaching event. It was a dog-ate-my-homework moment. What we saw was re-announcement of old plans and no new funding. The government is risking a fail on their reef homework by underfunding their Reef Plan, delaying water quality targets, spruiking new coal and ignoring global warming after the worst coral bleaching the reef has ever seen.  The federal government’s response plan to the worst-ever bleaching event on the reef says global warming was the cause but doesn’t include any action or new funding to address it. Worse still, the Australian and Queensland governments are still desperately pushing to open up the Adani mega coalmine which would put the Great Barrier Reef in grave peril. The Greens are worried that our governments’ inaction and their capitulation to big coal companies will tempt Unesco to put the reef back on the world heritage in-danger list. Global warming is the biggest long-term threat to the reef, but we must also urgently fix water pollution from land clearing and agriculture. We have ambitious water quality targets, including an 80% cut to nitrogen pollution by 2025, but report after report shows we’re nowhere near on track to meet them.  The experts in the Queensland government’s own Great Barrier Reef water science taskforce called for a massive funding boost up to $8.2bn, but our governments have simply dismissed them.  Just this week, the Queensland government decided to keep using the reef’s waters as a rubbish tip for dumping one million cubic metres of sludge from maintenance dredging, in their long overdue but nearly toothless Maintenance Dredging Strategy. Elsewhere in Queensland, more than 300,000 hectares of native woodland is being cleared every year, sending rivers of sediment flowing into the reef. Despite promising to stop this clearing frenzy, the Queensland Labor government waited too long to act, and tree-clearing protections were recently voted down in the parliament. Earlier this year, I visited the worst-hit area of the reef at Lizard Island along with some of Australia’s leading reef scientists and saw the destruction first-hand. The devastation was horrifying. Our leading scientists have told us of weeping into their dive masks as they witnessed the destruction. The have told us that if the current trajectory of global warming continues, even if we do fix water pollution, the reef will suffer terrible bleaching every two years by the 2030s.  To save the reef and avoid an in-danger listing, both levels of government need a response to global warming that includes scrapping the Adani coalmine and banning all new coalmines, moving to 100% clean energy, finally banning all dredge sludge dumping including maintenance dredging, and strong land clearing laws. It’s not too late, but time is running out to save our reef’s future and secure a bright future for all Queenslanders. It’s time for our leaders to step up."
"UK universities are helping lead the world on environmental research – but when it comes to their own back yard they appear to be falling behind. Only a quarter are on track to meet their carbon reduction targets by 2020. Teams leading environmental initiatives are being cut and sustainability strategies have not been renewed, according to the results of the 2016 People & Planet University League, published on Tuesday (see below).  Lack of government support for public sector sustainability is blamed for the stalling of energy-saving schemes. It is the fourth year that the league – ranking institutions by environmental and ethical performance – has recorded fewer universities on course to meet their legally binding target of reducing emissions by 43% from 2005 levels by 2020. But not all have abandoned their green goals, with “first class” status being awarded to 30 of the 150 universities. This year Nottingham Trent University, which tops the table, opened the Pavilion, its first carbon negative building. Brighton University, in second place, has made sustainability one of its four core values. The University of Warwick – the biggest mover, up from 129 last year to 34th – is launching a unique BASc cross-disciplinary degree in global sustainable development. Nottingham Trent’s high score reflects its commitment to engage staff and students, and its aim to include sustainability in all its courses, while the University of Brighton has managed to reduce its carbon footprint despite expanding in size and opening its buildings for longer hours. “Sustainability is a core value in our university,” says Prof Debra Humphris, Brighton’s vice-chancellor. “With students and staff we aim to embed sustainable practices; we all need to play our part.” A spokesman for the University of Warwick said its improved showing could be partly due to the different way statistics for the league have been collected this year. “They may have picked up more of the things we are doing this year, such as the bike hire scheme, the £5,000 fund to support student projects, and our staff and student green champions initiative,” he said. The 2016 league table, based on information in the public domain, scores institutions on such factors as the commitment of senior management, the employment of dedicated sustainability staff, divesting from investment in the fossil fuel industry and meeting public sector carbon reduction commitments. It also considers employment factors, such as paying staff the living wage, joining Electronics Watch to improve workers’ rights in that industry and investing in projects that do not exploit or pollute communities. Before 2010 and the election of the coalition and the Conservative governments, there was a flurry of carbon reduction initiatives linked to higher education funding, says People & Planet, a student campaigning network. “Sustainability drivers such as the capital investment framework (which made tranches of funding contingent on plans to reduce carbon emissions), the higher education green academy and the student green fund have all been removed. Today, it says, “the landscape looks bereft of any significant support or incentive for sustainable development in universities in England.” “We can now see the concerning impact of the current government’s short-termism with regard to energy and climate policy,” says Hannah Smith, co-director for campaigns and research. “Environmental sustainability has been removed from the government’s annual grant letter setting out higher education funding, leaving the Higher Education Funding Council [Hefce] without the resources it had in the past to support sustainable practice.” Wealth and academic prestige appear to be uncorrelated to progress on sustainability and ethical employment and procurement. The University of Oxford comes 46th and Cambridge 57th. Grant Anderson, Nottingham Trent’s environmental manager, says that in the past, external pressures were useful in engaging senior management in the sustainability drive. “These now don’t exist. However, it hasn’t impeded us. We continue to expand from an initial focus on carbon, waste, transport etc to a more holistic approach, understanding the sustainability opportunities of our core business of education and research. “We made it a formal requirement six months ago that all of our courses incorporate at least one of the 17 UN sustainable development goals. We don’t specify what they include, that is up to the academics, but we think it will give our students an edge in their careers to have considered some of the environmental challenges they will face in their lifetimes. For example, chemistry students are exploring their role in finding solutions to feeding the world in a sustainable way and primary education students learn practical gardening skills at the university’s food share allotments that they will be able to share with their future pupils.” Government policy is likely to continue to have an impact, however – but a less positive one. Abigail Dombey, Brighton’s environmental manager, says the university has recently installed 893 solar panels, which will save £40,000 a year in energy bills and reduce its carbon footprint by more than 100 tonnes a year. “But the feed-in tariffs – the financial incentives for generating electricity from renewable sources – have been slashed by the government so there is much less incentive to invest in renewable energy.” She fears some universities could also face higher taxes under the business rates revaluation from next April through the government’s proposal to increase the rateable value of solar panels. As charities, most universities are exempt from at least 80% of business rates but some pay 20% and all pay rates on buildings used commercially. The bottom 10 in the green league are mostly small, specialist institutions that are less likely to have the resources to employ staff to oversee environmental issues. However, the small specialist Royal Agricultural University, at 16th in the league, shows that a lot can be achieved on a smaller scale. St Mary’s University in Twickenham, London, with 4,400 students, came in the bottom 10 after researchers found it had no environmental policy or strategy, no publicly available carbon management plan, ethical investment policy or evidence of dedicated sustainability staff. In response, a spokesman said the findings were “not reflective of St Mary’s approach to sustainability” and that “the university has extensive environmental policies including strategies for carbon management, biodiversity and sustainable catering”. Hefce says its capital investment framework remains in force and requires universities and colleges to “demonstrate that their capital investment plans are aligned with the goal of managing environmental impact and that they have an acceptable carbon management plan in place”. It adds: “The HE sector has developed its expertise significantly over the last decade or so and they are the real experts in what the sector needs to do to drive sustainability plans forward.” Top 201 Nottingham Trent University2 University of Brighton3 Manchester Metropolitan University4 Cardiff Metropolitan University5 University of Worcester6 Aston University7 City, University of London8 = Newcastle University8 = University of Gloucestershire 10 Swansea University11 University of Bedfordshire12 Plymouth University13 De Montfort University14 London School of Economics15 Keele University16= University of Exeter16= Royal Agricultural University18 University of Greenwich19 University of Bradford20 Bournemouth University Bottom 10141 Heythrop College, University of London142 Writtle University College143 University of St Mark & St John144 St Mary’s University, Twickenham145 Royal Northern College of Music146 University College Birmingham147 Stranmillis University College148 University of Bolton149 Royal Veterinary College150 Trinity Laban Conservatoire of Music and Dance • For the full league table go to peopleand planet.org/university-league/table  • This article was amended on 22 November 2016 to correct the rankings for four universities in the top 20, and to put Bournemouth University at No 20 rather than Coventry University.

"The president of the COP22 climate summit in Marrakech has made a direct plea to the incoming US president Donald Trump to join the struggle against global warming for the sake of humanity and the planet. Salaheddine Mezouar, who is also the Moroccan foreign minister, had spent most of the week-long summit diplomatically trying to steer clear of questions about Trump, telling reporters at one point that “no one can stop history”. But asked for a direct message to the president-elect in the last question of the summit’s final press conference, Mezouar issued a heartfelt plea. “We count on your pragmatism as well as your commitment to the spirit of the international community, in a huge struggle for our future, for the planet, for humanity and the dignity of millions and millions of people,” he said.  “This is about what our planet is going to be tomorrow, and what we are going to leave behind,” he added.  Trump was a spectre haunting much of the COP proceedings and a final “Marrakech call” by nearly 200 nations yesterday affirmed their “highest political commitment” to combating climate change, in a thinly coded warning to the far-right tycoon. But his election did not prevent some of the world’s poorest countries from announcing a major emissions-cutting initiative before delegates boarded their planes home. In total, 48 nations promised to cut their carbon emissions dramatically and rapidly move to 100% renewable power as the UN climate summit in Marrakech drew to a close on Friday. Bangladesh, Ethiopia and the Philippines were among the countries which said they would now file plans for becoming zero-carbon societies by the middle of the century, in line with the Paris deal’s aspiration of limiting global warming to 1.5C. Al Gore, the former US vice-president, hailed the announcement as “a bold vision that sets the pace for the world’s efforts to implement the Paris agreement”. “These ambitious and inspiring commitments show the path forward for others and give us all renewed optimism that we are going to meet the challenge before us and meet it in time.” Mohamed Adow, Christian Aid’s spokesman, said: “It is moving to see, despite their relative poverty, the world’s most vulnerable countries leading the world in delivering the goals of the Paris agreement. They may be relatively small in size, but these countries have become titans in the world of climate leadership.” However, the summit made limited headway on other key issues. Crucially, just $165m of new money was pledged by advanced economies for the global climate fund which enabled poorer countries to sign up to the Paris agreement. A UN source insisted that the $100bn target would be met by 2020, but said trillions would be needed to make development more sustainable. “The question is, how are you going to change the whole financial structure on this planet to get these big sums going?” said the source.  “It is very, very worrisome,” Tosi Mpanu Mpanu, the chair of the Least Developed Countries group, told the Guardian. “If you have to make agriculture resilient, build a sea wall or ensure that diseases don’t spread, there is no money-making rationale behind it. So public money is needed. “Unfortunately, at this stage it is all about climate finance which is calculated using creative accounting, and methodologies that were not agreed upon and are not conducive to building trust.”  Shortly before the summit ended, Mezouar told the Guardian: “It is a priority of this COP22 presidency to mobilise finance as this is really becoming a necessity and an emergency.” OECD projections suggest that developed countries will have stumped up just one fifth of the initial funds needed for adapting to climate change of a $100bn-a-year global climate fund which is due to launch in 2020. The fund also addresses “mitigation” – or preventing climate change – and Morocco says that a roadmap proposed by the UK and Australia in Marrakech will eventually allow around two-thirds of funds to come from public sources.  The US has so far only delivered around $500m of a promised $3bn donation to the global climate fund, and doubts hang over the likelihood of more being provided under a Trump administration.  Asked by the Guardian whether the US could provide an emergency fast-tracking of funds before 20 January when Trump is sworn in, Jonathan Pershing, the US special envoy on climate change, said that it would be premature to speculate on the new president’s actions in office.   But he added: “We believe that this is an essential part of the movement forward and there will therefore be substantial value for US citizens and taxpayers in addressing these questions and providing technical support.”  Mezouar said that the $100bn promised in the global climate fund was “nothing” when measured against the costs of climate change mitigation and adaptation, but that it could draw private investors into realisable projects. Just 8% of climate finance committed to date has been disbursed, and of the largest money stream – energy finance – the poorest states have received just 5%, according to developing countries. "
"In one of the more entertaining moments of COP22, the global climate conference held in Marrakech last week, the Chinese vice-foreign minister Liu Zhenmin, gave the absent US president-elect a short lesson in the history of climate diplomacy. Climate change, he explained, was not a Chinese hoax. In fact, long before the issue had been discussed behind the high vermillion walls of Zhongnanhai, China’s contemporary Forbidden City, it had been put on the global agenda by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change in the 1980s, supported by Ronald Reagan and George Bush (senior).  Mounting international concern led eventually to the Kyoto Protocol, the first global agreement to try to limit climate change, signed by President Bill Clinton subsequently rejected by the US Congress. When President Obama’s administration formally entered the successor Paris Agreement in September this year, the president knew better than to try to seek endorsement from a hostile Congress. Yet the US has been present throughout, as the world grappled with how to distribute the burden of global action to ward off climate catastrophe, although its leadership has been, at best, intermittent. It has tended to resemble a temperamental adolescent, periodically playing the game, but intermittently flouncing off the field, its ball firmly under its arm.  This time, rather than seeing the announced US departure from the climate stage under a Trump administration as an excuse for others to slacken their efforts, Chinese officials made clear that this latest act of US self-harm would not deter China from pursuing its own interests, and that those interests lie firmly in a vision of a low-carbon future. As Liu Zhenmin said in Marrakech, any change in US policy “won’t affect China’s commitment to support climate negotiations and also the implementation of the Paris Agreement”.  It is a view that is widely shared in China’s circles of experts and policymakers. While this latest turn in the US administration’s climate policy might be disappointing for the global effort, China’s policy at this point has a standalone logic and an internal coherence that makes a change of direction highly unlikely. China plans to be the supplier of low-carbon goods to a carbon-constrained world: It already boasts the world’s biggest installed capacity of wind and solar power, and its climate policies are built in to its current five-year economic plan.  The departure of the US, far from crippling that effort, could further stimulate it: When the news of Donald Trump’s electoral college victory set cell phones beeping at a private climate change discussion in Beijing, one of China’s leading climate policy experts observed that China should now expect to assume climate leadership.  As recently as 2009, in the wake of the failed Copenhagen climate conference, such a response from China to the election of a man who held Trump’s views would have been unimaginable. At the time, the US and China were locked into a toxic opposition created by the structure of the 1997 Kyoto Protocol, the international agreement that made climate action obligatory for rich countries, but only advisory for emerging economies, even those as large as China. The world’s two biggest emitters of greenhouse gases seemed bound into a negative relationship in which the climate policy of one was conditioned by the willingness of the other to do as much, if not more. Since neither was willing, this dysfunctional pairing acted as dispiriting drag on global efforts.  But between Copenhagen and Paris, China’s global climate policy underwent a sea change, driven by domestic factors and assisted by the end of the Kyoto Protocol. When the Kyoto Protocol was negotiated in 1997, China had 21% of the world’s population, but was responsible for only 14% of global CO2 emissions. By 2009, China was producing 26% of the world’s emissions and had begun publicly to articulate a climate policy. Its first public goal was to reduce its carbon intensity by 40% to 45% by 2020, and as the 2015 Paris conference approached, China, then by far the world’s biggest emitter, announced that its emissions would peak by 2030 or earlier. It is a target most experts judge to be well within China’s reach; some believe that the peak could come in the early 2020s. The architecture of the Paris Agreement, ratified and brought into force in record time, played a significant role in the breakthrough. It does not impose mandatory action on its signatories; nor does it distinguish between the obligations of the rich and the less rich countries. Each nation, instead, is invited to volunteer its offer on reducing emissions, on the understanding that all will be encouraged to increase their efforts over time, in order to fulfill the common ambition of keeping the global average temperature rise below 2C above pre-industrial levels. This would, in practice, demand that net zero emissions be in effect by mid-century. Meeting that goal will demand much greater efforts than are currently on the table. The news announced in Marrakech that the world had already experienced1.2 degrees of warming only underlined the urgency of the effort to put the architecture of the Paris Agreement’s implementation in place. Ironically, the US and Mexico were among the first to present long-term carbon reduction plans, with the US offering to reduce emissions by 2050 by 80% from the 2005 level, and Mexico proposing a reduction of 50% by 2050 on a 2000 baseline. By way of comparison, Germany has plans to reduce its emissions by up to 95% by 2050.  How has China, the country that had been seen as the bad boy of climate policy, transformed itself into a potential global climate leader? And why, if Trump is correct in his assertion that efforts to mitigate climate change would cripple the US economy, do China’s leaders see it instead as the key to the next phase of China’s growth?  For China, multiple factors came together between Copenhagen and Paris: China’s growth was slowing and its leaders understood, from the examples of South Korea and Japan, that their economy needed to be more efficient in its use of energy and resources, and that it needed to upgrade its capacity to produce advanced, higher value technologies, preferably with China owning the patents, if it was to avoid stagnation.  By the time the 13th Five Year Plan was published in 2015, it was clear that China’s leadership had identified low-carbon technologies as the technologies of the future, and, since these were new technological frontiers, there was an opportunity for China to establish its dominance as an innovator as well as a manufacturer and exporter. For China, the opportunities that tackling climate offered began to be seen as the engine of the next phase of prosperity. Last year, China invested $102.9bn in renewable energy and installed half of the world’s new wind power. It is still highly dependent on coal, but its coal consumption has peaked and begun to decline, to be replaced over time by renewables, hydro, and nuclear power. China, like any other country, has vested interests that resist its energy transformation: the giant traditional energy companies defend their interests in China as elsewhere. But the environmental effects of three decades of high-carbon growth — the choking smog that blights China’s major cities, the water crisis and soil pollution, the mounting health and social impacts that threatened the standing of the Communist Party — also created a political space for action. Xi Jinping’s administration adopted “ecological civilisation” as its slogan and floated a raft of policies that included the restoration of decimated forests, efforts to reverse desertification, the promotion of electric mobility and eco-friendly urbanisation, as well as important investments in new technologies. Given the state of the air that China’s citizens were breathing, there was unlikely to be any popular opposition to a government that wanted to clean up. On top of that, China’s leadership had a clear understanding of the potential impacts of climate change on China, affecting its food security, exacerbating the threat of extreme weather events, ratcheting up its water crisis, and threatening to drown its most prosperous cities as sea levels rise.  China’s role at the Paris conference in December 2015 was constructive. A US-China pledge to cooperate on climate change in 2013 had held firm, despite many other tensions in the US-China relationship. A climate-literate US president and a Chinese leadership that saw the low-carbon economy as its next major opportunity together created a positive synergy that stimulated an extensive program of cooperation, despite the hostility of the US Congress.  Nevertheless, like the rest of the world, China’s leadership will be watching and waiting to see how much of Trump’s extreme rhetoric on climate survives the encounter with reality: He has threatened to “destroy” the Paris agreement and abolish the Environmental Protection Agency, Obama’s key regulatory instrument. A more likely approach is strangulation: The head of Trump’s EPA transition team is a prominent climate denier, Myron Ebell.  The US cannot leave the Paris Agreement quickly: The agreement came into force on 4 November, and it would take nearly four years for the US to withdraw. But the US could simply withdraw from the United Nations Framework on Climate Change, the overarching international climate agreement, within a year. Trump’s ascension to the presidency signals an end to American leadership on international climate policy. With the withdrawal of US support, efforts to implement the Paris agreement and avoid the most devastating consequences of global warming have suffered a huge blow. It could also cut off funding, refusing to contribute to funds that are intended to support poor and vulnerable countries to mitigate and adapt.  All of this would weaken the global effort, but it would not destroy it. China is poised to assume the role of steady, reliable climate ally, in sharp contrast to Trump’s US. Assuming leadership on climate has many attractions for China. As well as the economic opportunity, it is one of the few issues on which China could make a claim for the moral high ground. In terms of industrial strategy, the case seems clear: China still has relatively deep pockets and can finance the dissemination of technologies — from solar panels to nuclear power plants — across the developing world, consolidating trade and diplomatic links at a time when clean energy, according to the International Energy Agency, is projected to grow exponentially, creating millions of jobs and stimulating trillions of dollars in annual investment. That is where China sees its future."
"Stephen Hawking (This is the most dangerous moment for our planet, 2 December) brought tears to my eyes; of all the articles published since the Brexit and Trump votes, this one, with his insight and suggestions as to how we should act now, is the most compelling.

"In a couple of days the Atlantic hurricane season officially comes to a close. 2016 has been very active, with 15 named storms, seven of which became hurricanes.  It started nearly five months early with Alex in mid-January, and ended unusually late with Otto, just a few days ago. Three storms – Gaston, Matthew and Nicole – developed into major hurricanes, and Matthew’s long passage over land made it particularly deadly, taking 1,655 lives. In total the storms have unleashed over 60% more energy than an average hurricane season, and it’s also been the costliest since 2012, causing over $11.5bn (£9.2bn) of damage thus far.  Recent years have seen some eye-watering bills for hurricane damage. The storms of 2012 (which included hurricane Sandy) resulted in $79.2bn (£63.6bn) of damage, while 2005 (which included hurricane Katrina) cost $158.9bn (£127.7bn) – the most expensive Atlantic hurricane season in history. Now research published in Environmental Research Letters predicts that the cost associated with Atlantic hurricanes will keep increasing, with the average losses becoming three times greater by 2100. Modelling hurricane damage in the US for the period 1963 through to 2100, the scientists found that a third of the increased cost will be due to climate change (bringing more frequent and intense hurricanes), while two thirds of the increased cost will be due to socio-economic factors. Ownership of more expensive gadgets, and confidence that insurance policies or governments will pick up the tab, will lead to rapidly increasing hurricane damage bills.  Understanding where and why hurricane costs are increasing is important, to make sure governments select the best strategies to reduce the risk."

"This week Canada joined the growing list of major developed countries saying they will phase out coal power. The announcement comes against the backdrop of global demand for coal falling last year for the first time in nearly two decades, a development that could presage a new era of lower-carbon energy generation – or merely a blip in the long-term dominance of the highly polluting fuel.  The reversal of the upward trend in demand for coal marked “an inflexion point” for the world economy, according to the International Energy Agency (IEA), the gold standard for energy data. Since the 1990s, coal use soared in tandem with the rapidly developing economies of Asia, chiefly China and to a lesser extent India. By 2015, coal was taking a 41% share of global electricity generation. While coal companies enjoyed a renaissance, the world suffered from the higher greenhouse gas emissions that resulted, and from shockingly poor air quality in many major cities. These factors, combined with the seemingly unstoppable rise of natural gas that has followed the fracking revolution, have led to coal being at its current crossroads.  An increasing number of developed countries have moved to regulate, penalise and begin to phase out coal-fired power generation. In the UK, the government has pledged to phase out coal by 2025. France, the Netherlands, Austria, Denmark and Germany have similar plans, with differing timescales.  In the US, regulation has been slower to come but the economics of coal have changed markedly. Thanks to low natural gas prices as a result of the fracking revolution, for the first time in history as much US electricity was generated from gas last year as from coal. By 2030, under Canada’s plans, there will be no more coal-fired power generation in the country, with the gap to be filled by renewable or other “sustainable” forms of power. Kathleen McKenna, environment minister, said: “Taking traditional coal power out of our energy mix and replacing it with cleaner technologies will significantly reduce our greenhouse gas emissions, improve health and benefit generations to come.” China is where the changing fortunes of coal can be most clearly seen. According to the IEA, demand for coal stalled there in 2014, and according to some estimates fell by 3% last year. The faltering of China’s phenomenal growth rates has been one reason, but government policy has also played a major role, spurring investment in renewables and cutting down on the dirtiest coal to try to tackle some of the worst pollution. China is still unusual, however. Most of the world’s less industrialised economies, particularly those in Asia, are planning to increase their dependence on coal rather than follow Beijing’s lead.  This risks opening up a split whereby developed countries close down their most polluting fossil fuel assets, while developing countries continue to open them up. In the IEA’s projections, global coal demand is seen as likely to rebound to 2014 levels by as soon as the end of this decade, driven by growth in India and south-east Asia. This could be enough to more than offset declining demand in Europe, north America and China.  What will make the difference is whether governments adhere to the promises made in the Paris agreement to limit global warming, and whether investment is available for poorer countries to move away from the most polluting fuels. Simon Bullock, a climate campaigner at Friends of the Earth said: “Like going straight to mobile without bothering with landlines, developing countries can bypass dirty coal and gas and go straight to renewables.  “The main stumbling block remains the upfront investment and technology. For coal the only real costs are a person with a shovel. That’s why we need a global renewable energy fund, to help developing countries leapfrog coal and go straight to renewables.” Despite the problems coal causes, in climate change and air pollution, the World Coal Association sees a strong future for the fuel, in both the developing and developed world. Its chief executive, Benjamin Sporton,said: “Developed countries will continue to use coal for decades to come, and developing countries will increase [their use]. There are new high-efficiency technologies that reduce emissions, and developments in carbon capture and storage. Coal is a reliable fuel.” One of the most scrutinised markets for coal in the next few years will be the US, where president-elect Donald Trump has repeatedly vowed to revive the fortunes of the coal industry.  However, he may be fighting against economic reality. Fatih Birol, the executive director of the IEA, said: “Coal is losing ground because it is losing competitiveness. In the US gas is cheaper than coal. Gas will be a very economic option [for decades] unless there are new government policies and new fiscal measures to change the balance.” Such measures would be expensive, and paid for by consumers and taxpayers. Changing economics, led by fracking, may yet prevent the US from returning to the old days of King Coal."
"The Paris Agreement was ratified globally in November. This is unprecedented amongst international agreements for how quickly it has come into force. The Agreement allows each country to decide how it will tackle climate change, and requires as of 2020, regular reporting on progress. Countries of the world have officially embarked in a global race to implement ambitious climate policies that contribute to reducing green-house gas emissions at the planetary-scale. This process is not unlike the Olympics games where countries get together to compare their strengths and performance. If Canada wants to be a medalist in 2020, domestic climate policies must rapidly be adopted to accelerate the low carbon transition. In this context, Sustainable Canada Dialogues (SCD) – a network of 60+ scholars from across Canada – produced Rating Canada’s Climate Policy; a progress report on Canada’s climate actions over the past year. We analysed climate decisions made in Ottawa in 2016 in relationship to the 10 policy orientations that we proposed previously in our position paper entitled Acting on Climate Change: Solutions from Canadian Scholars.   Canada has recently taken two important steps forward. In September, the Government of Canada announced a $120 billion infrastructure investment plan that explicitly highlights support for infrastructures reducing greenhouse gas emissions. This investment plan raises hopes that Canada can make the transition to low carbon development, but its real impact depends on identifying and funding infrastructure projects that best contribute to desired low-carbon and sustainable outcomes. In October, the Government of Canada Announced a Pan-Canadian Pricing on Carbon Pollution starting in 2018. The price on carbon pollution should start at a minimum of $10 per tonne in 2018 and rise by $10 a year to reach $50 per tonne in 2022. This is a modest start given the Canadian government has stated a central value for the social cost of carbon (SCC) is about $41 Cdn/tonne; and could be as high as $167 Cdn.  Despite the progress discussed above, the Canadian Government decision to approve the Pacific Northwest liquefied natural gas (LNG) project is a step backward, casting doubt on the willingness of the Federal Government to address climate change with concrete and meaningful policies and actions. Our impact assessment indicates that this LNG project would be one of the largest point source of emissions in Canada and would increase BC’s emissions by 8.5%. Continued development of projects with high greenhouse gas emissions will compromise progress in other sectors. It will prevent Canada from meeting its emissions reduction target for 2030, and is incompatible with Canada’s stated goal to help limit global temperature increases to 1.5oC. Research indeed estimates that, to maintain global temperature increase below 2oC, half of existing gas reserves and one third of existing oil ones must remain unused. Canadian climate policy must tackle the most difficult question: how to transition away from fossil fuels? We call for federal political leadership that steadily and strategically adopts innovative low-carbon tools to drive future economic growth. This requires engaging with a broad range of stakeholders from the oil and gas industry, unions, Indigenous peoples, environmental NGOs, the clean technology sector, and academia. We must discuss how to redirect subsidies of $3.3 billion away from the fossil fuel industry. Those funds should promote transitions to low-carbon energy and ensure that workers from the oil and gas industry can transition their skills in other sectors.  Ambitious Canadian climate leadership is necessary more than ever. Only by working together and building commitment across all sectors will Canada live up the expectations created by joining the COP21 High Ambition Coalition in 2015. Our federal government has not developed a complete climate action plan. But two further steps forward have occurred since the close of the COP22 Marrakech Meeting. On November 19, Canadian Environment and Climate Change Minister Catherine McKenna announced details of support for Canadian and Global actions towards cleaner, more sustainable growth in Canada and internationally. As we pen this article, on November 21, Minister McKenna announced that Canada will phase out all coal fired electricity by 2030.  Sustainable Canada Dialogues applauds the Minister’s announcements. But SCD will continue to push for Canada to adopt actions on clean energy and climate policy that will decrease GHG emissions, increase certainty in Canadian and global business environments, and encourage companies to invest in low-carbon technologies. Canada, Canadians, can and will show international leadership on climate action.  Download Sustainable Canada Dialogues’ November 2016 Progress Report on National Government Leadership on climate actions. Our March 2015 Acting on Climate Change Report charted a path for eliminating coal fired electricity in Canada. SCDs’ Open Letter to Canadian Political and Indigenous leaders in March 2016 warned continued investment in oil extraction and transportation locks Canada into carbon intensive energy for decades.

"As a theoretical physicist based in Cambridge, I have lived my life in an extraordinarily privileged bubble. Cambridge is an unusual town, centred around one of the world’s great universities. Within that town, the scientific community that I became part of in my 20s is even more rarefied. And within that scientific community, the small group of international theoretical physicists with whom I have spent my working life might sometimes be tempted to regard themselves as the pinnacle. In addition to this, with the celebrity that has come with my books, and the isolation imposed by my illness, I feel as though my ivory tower is getting taller.  So the recent apparent rejection of the elites in both America and Britain is surely aimed at me, as much as anyone. Whatever we might think about the decision by the British electorate to reject membership of the European Union and by the American public to embrace Donald Trump as their next president, there is no doubt in the minds of commentators that this was a cry of anger by people who felt they had been abandoned by their leaders. It was, everyone seems to agree, the moment when the forgotten spoke, finding their voices to reject the advice and guidance of experts and the elite everywhere. I am no exception to this rule. I warned before the Brexit vote that it would damage scientific research in Britain, that a vote to leave would be a step backward, and the electorate – or at least a sufficiently significant proportion of it – took no more notice of me than any of the other political leaders, trade unionists, artists, scientists, businessmen and celebrities who all gave the same unheeded advice to the rest of the country. What matters now, far more than the choices made by these two electorates, is how the elites react. Should we, in turn, reject these votes as outpourings of crude populism that fail to take account of the facts, and attempt to circumvent or circumscribe the choices that they represent? I would argue that this would be a terrible mistake. The concerns underlying these votes about the economic consequences of globalisation and accelerating technological change are absolutely understandable. The automation of factories has already decimated jobs in traditional manufacturing, and the rise of artificial intelligence is likely to extend this job destruction deep into the middle classes, with only the most caring, creative or supervisory roles remaining. This in turn will accelerate the already widening economic inequality around the world. The internet and the platforms that it makes possible allow very small groups of individuals to make enormous profits while employing very few people. This is inevitable, it is progress, but it is also socially destructive. We need to put this alongside the financial crash, which brought home to people that a very few individuals working in the financial sector can accrue huge rewards and that the rest of us underwrite that success and pick up the bill when their greed leads us astray. So taken together we are living in a world of widening, not diminishing, financial inequality, in which many people can see not just their standard of living, but their ability to earn a living at all, disappearing. It is no wonder then that they are searching for a new deal, which Trump and Brexit might have appeared to represent. It is also the case that another unintended consequence of the global spread of the internet and social media is that the stark nature of these inequalities is far more apparent than it has been in the past. For me, the ability to use technology to communicate has been a liberating and positive experience. Without it, I would not have been able to continue working these many years past. But it also means that the lives of the richest people in the most prosperous parts of the world are agonisingly visible to anyone, however poor, who has access to a phone. And since there are now more people with a telephone than access to clean water in sub-Saharan Africa, this will shortly mean nearly everyone on our increasingly crowded planet will not be able to escape the inequality. The consequences of this are plain to see: the rural poor flock to cities, to shanty towns, driven by hope. And then often, finding that the Instagram nirvana is not available there, they seek it overseas, joining the ever greater numbers of economic migrants in search of a better life. These migrants in turn place new demands on the infrastructures and economies of the countries in which they arrive, undermining tolerance and further fuelling political populism. For me, the really concerning aspect of this is that now, more than at any time in our history, our species needs to work together. We face awesome environmental challenges: climate change, food production, overpopulation, the decimation of other species, epidemic disease, acidification of the oceans. Together, they are a reminder that we are at the most dangerous moment in the development of humanity. We now have the technology to destroy the planet on which we live, but have not yet developed the ability to escape it. Perhaps in a few hundred years, we will have established human colonies amid the stars, but right now we only have one planet, and we need to work together to protect it. To do that, we need to break down, not build up, barriers within and between nations. If we are to stand a chance of doing that, the world’s leaders need to acknowledge that they have failed and are failing the many. With resources increasingly concentrated in the hands of a few, we are going to have to learn to share far more than at present. With not only jobs but entire industries disappearing, we must help people to retrain for a new world and support them financially while they do so. If communities and economies cannot cope with current levels of migration, we must do more to encourage global development, as that is the only way that the migratory millions will be persuaded to seek their future at home. We can do this, I am an enormous optimist for my species; but it will require the elites, from London to Harvard, from Cambridge to Hollywood, to learn the lessons of the past year. To learn above all a measure of humility. • The writer launched www.unlimited.world earlier this year"
"There’s no point hiding from it – Donald Trump’s election should give us all concern for our future and the future of our children.  The chances of successfully mitigating climate change and holding global temperature increases to below a manageable 1.5 degree rise has nosedived. Trump, a man who believes that climate change is a “hoax”, wants to pull the US out of the Paris climate agreement. Even if that ends up taking time, he can decimate US federal agencies engaged in efforts to move to a greener society. He will probably cancel Obama’s Clean Power Plan, and slash federal funding for renewable energy.  It’s not for nothing that Noam Chomsky has said that the Republican party is now “the most dangerous organization in world history.” Their commitment to collaborating in climate change denial – and therefore, the destruction of our futures – is absolute, and they will now control the White House, Congress and the supreme court.  Deliberately manufacturing doubt about climate science in order to protect the profits of a few fossil fuel companies might just turn out be the biggest crime in human history. But don’t expect that to be recognized until the history books are written, nor for it to deter Trump. His administration spells disaster for the millions who will die climate change-related deaths from flooding, forced migration, starvation, drought and extreme weather. With all this unfolding, the rest of the world needs confidence to continue with climate action. The total commitments of the world’s nations so far aren’t enough to stop the crisis. They need to be emboldened further by activists and peoples all over the world to take the drastic action needed to save the planet and save ourselves. Trump’s election has dealt a blow to that confidence, but there is a way that the US climate movement can help restore it – fight for individual US states to defy the federal government and pledge to follow the goals of the Paris climate agreement.  The climate movement, working with unions, faith groups and everyone who doesn’t want to see the world burn, could push individual states to commit to draw up their own climate plans in line with the Paris agreement, effectively becoming honorary signatories to the accord.  Currently only UN member states are signed up to the Paris agreement’s parent treaty, the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change, but observer members are permitted (the Vatican is an observer), and when it comes to the most important fight in human history, no quibbles should be made around technicalities.  There is precedent for this kind of state-level action – after the US’s failure to sign the Kyoto protocol in the 2000s, a student group called Kyoto Now had similar objectives, calling for university campuses to draw up their own climate action plans in line with the Kyoto agreement. The difference between then and now is that the US climate movement is a hundred times stronger, and ready for this fight. For example, California alone is the sixth biggest economy in the world by gross domestic product, as well as the second-biggest state in the union for carbon emissions. California’s governor, Jerry Brown, has already reacted to Trump’s victory by saying California will continue with its nation-leading climate plans, and has dispatched a team to the UN climate talks in Marrakech.  New York state is another huge carbon emitter, with a population slightly smaller than Australia and some of the best climate policies in the US. Even small states in the world’s second-biggest carbon emitter can make a huge difference. If the Paris agreement could effectively cover large parts of America, this could send a hugely powerful signal to the rest of the world that not everyone in the US wants the country to become a “rogue state” on climate (as Mary Robinson, UN climate envoy, warned last week). It would do much to undermine the Trump administration’s denialism on the international stage and embolden other nations to continue the progress we’ve made so far. The US climate movement has got to fight the obvious battles that are coming to try and at least partly to save federal climate action. But a purely rearguard strategy isn’t going to cut it. A strategy of also pushing individual states to lead on climate action could set achievable goals for the movement, allow them to go on the offensive and demonstrate to the world that America isn’t a rogue state on climate – it just has a rogue president. Their actions and success in doing this could mean the difference between winning or losing for the climate change movement globally. The world is counting on the climate movement in the US to keep climate action going. The fate of the world quite literally hangs in the balance. Take it door-to-door, state-by-state to win."
"Climate scientists have denounced the House committee on science, space and technology after the Republican-held panel promoted a misleading story expressing skepticism that the earth is dangerously warming. On Thursday afternoon, the committee tweeted a Breitbart article alleging: “Global Temperatures Plunge. Icy Silence from Climate Alarmists”. The story linked to a British tabloid, the Daily Mail, which claimed that global land temperatures were plummeting, and that humans were not responsible for years of steadily increasing heat.  The Daily Mail story cited “Nasa satellite measurements of the lower atmosphere” without specifics, exaggerated the degree of the fall and left out three important points of context: how El Niño systems affect oceans and atmosphere, how ocean temperatures are rising, and the clear upward pattern of year-on-year changes. “They’re not serious articles,” said Adam Sobel, a Columbia University climate scientist. “They paint it as though it’s an argument between Breitbart and Buzzfeed when it’s an argument between a snarky Breitbart blogger and the entire world’s scientific community, and the overwhelming body of scientific evidence.”  Sobel said the articles “grossly misinterpret” a few accurate details, for instance that El Niño and La Niña systems play a large role in single-year fluctuations. “The temperature goes up for a couple of years and we have the largest year on record, then it goes down and it reaches a level that’s still well above 20th-century historical averages,” he said. “That in no way disproves anything about the causes of the long-term temperature trends.” Sobel called the committee’s use of Breitbart “distressing”. “If the House science committee wants to understand science they should talk to climate scientists.” Michael Mann, a climate scientist at Penn State University, noted that 2016 would soon be the hottest year on record, “by a substantial margin” over 2015, which took the record from 2014.  “Three consecutive record-breaking warm years, something we’ve never seen before, and a reminder of the profound and deleterious impact that our profligate burning of fossil fuels is having on the planet,” he told the Guardian. “For anyone, least of all the House committee on science, to at this particular moment be promoting fake news aimed at fooling the public into thinking otherwise, can only be interpreted as a deliberate effort to distract and fool the public.” Promoting the articles, Mann said, “is beneath the dignity of anyone holding higher office”. “This is an astounding example of cherry-picking the data,” said Kerry Emanuel, a professor at MIT. “Global land temperatures fluctuate significantly from one month to the next, and the article in question appears to have cherry-picked a drop on global land temperatures (not including the ocean, which covers 70% of the globe) for a single month.” Emanuel left politics to the committee, adding: “You may draw your own conclusions as to motives.” On their blog, a prominent climate writer who goes by the pseudonym Tamino, was less circumspect, saying the articles insulted readers by denying the melting ice, rising sea levels and floods and increased droughts around the world. “How stupid does he think you are?” A spokesperson for the committee did not return emails or phone calls requesting comment about whether anyone vetted the articles. Since 2010, the Republican chairman of the committee, Lamar Smith, has written five op-eds for Breitbart, the far-right website with a record of denying climate change and racist and misogynistic writing. A spokesman for Smith, Nick Cartwright, said “there is not a relationship” between the congressman and the site.  The former chairman of Breitbart, Steve Bannon, was named by president-elect Donald Trump as his “chief strategist” in the Republican’s incoming administration.  Democrats on the committee berated their colleagues for the tweet, with ranking member EB Johnson saying it reflected a longer trend of anti-science action. Republicans, she said, had “attempted to intimidate NOAA’s scientists over climate change research results that they didn’t like, put forth a Nasa bill that gutted Earth science, and continuously attacked any effort on the part of the administration to deal with climate change”. “This isn’t factual, it’s embarrassing, and Breitbart is not a credible news source,” wrote representative Don Beyer. “We need to bring *science* back to the Science Committee .” Representative Zoe Lofgren wrote: “Sign these guys up for the flat earth society.”  Senator Bernie Sanders, who has said he intends to fight Republicans who would dismantle climate change measures, mocked the committee by alluding to the president-elect’s defunct real estate school, which closed and was accused of fraud. “Where’d you get your PhD?” Sanders asked. “Trump University?” Several leading Republicans on the committee did not reply to requests for comment.  Democrats and Republicans each have their own teams of staffers for the committee, but share a news clipping service for providing information to elected officials. Since their party holds a majority in the House, the Republican team controls the search terms for what news clips are culled, said Kristen Kopshever, a spokeswoman for the Democrats’ office. “It’s constantly like the the Daily Caller and Texas GOP Vote Blog and just these random conservative publications that have made it into our clips,” she said. Kopshever echoed the representatives, noting that Smith had aggressively pursued investigations: intervening in a fraud case against ExxonMobil and the inquiry into Hillary Clinton’s email server, for instance. Kopshever said her office tried to rely on apolitical sources, such as Science Magazine and the academic journal Nature, and that she could not speak for her Republican counterparts. “I don’t know what their process is,” she said. “We don’t work a lot together.”"
"Malcolm Turnbull has acknowledged the looming review of the Direct Action climate policy in 2017 “may result in some changes” to the federal renewable energy target. The prime minister’s hedged observation on Thursday morning comes ahead of the release of the preliminary findings of the Finkel energy security review determining whether the national electricity market can deliver reliable base load power while meeting Australia’s climate change commitments.  Some participants in the Finkel process think it is possible the review could float the desirability of an emission intensity trading scheme for the electricity sector – a form of carbon trading currently being championed by the South Australian government through the energy ministers council. Even if Finkel doesn’t go down that path, pressure from business, energy and climate groups will build on the Turnbull government once the new political year opens, because there is widespread criticism that the Coalition’s climate policy won’t deliver the emissions reductions required to ensure Australia meets its international commitments. Business and climate groups have been dismayed by a rerun of Australia’s toxic climate politics triggered when the prime minister linked a statewide blackout in South Australia in September explicitly to the state’s use of renewable energy – which led to brawling between Canberra and the states on renewable energy targets. In a joint statement issued in October, major business organisations and energy users warned that, in the absence of bipartisanship, “uncertainty will cause essential energy investments to be deferred or distorted, to the ultimate cost of us all”. Many groups will use the review of Direct Action to call for greater policy certainty, either through a carbon trading mechanism, or longer legislative timelines on the federal renewable energy target – eventualities that would trigger renewed internal brawling within the Coalition about climate policy. The government’s recent decision to ratify the Paris climate agreement triggered a small internal breakout, with the chairman of the government’s backbench committee on the environment and energy, the Liberal MP Craig Kelly, declaring on Facebook after Donald Trump won the presidential election in the United States the Paris agreement was now “cactus”. George Christensen, the outspoken Liberal National party backbencher from Queensland, later backed Kelly’s view. Anticipating internal turbulence, both Turnbull and the minister for environment and energy, Josh Frydenberg, have been careful to play down the potential for the Direct Action review to lead to major changes in the existing policy. In his remarks on Thursday morning, Turnbull acknowledged the review could lead to change, but he also attempted to fence-sit on the issue. “The climate policy will be reviewed and the renewable energy target is agreed, it is legislated, we have got no plans to change it,” the prime minister said. “But the 2017 review, which has been part of our policy for a very long time, is to examine the mechanisms that we have to meet the 2030 Paris targets, which, as you know, is a reduction of our emissions by 26 to 28%.” But while playing down the prospect of big changes in the Direct Action review, Frydenberg has been making the case since he assumed the energy and environment portfolio for gas as the transitional fuel to help Australia continue to deliver reliable base load power while lowering carbon emissions. An emissions intensity scheme for the electricity sector is a favourable regulatory regime for gas, because gas would be considered preferable to coal in the short term to deliver base load power. Frydenberg used a speech this week to argue gas provided “a pathway to a lower emissions generation future with up to 50% fewer emissions than coal, depending on the generation technology”. “Recent events in South Australia in particular have brought home the role of gas in providing capacity to balance the intermittent nature of solar and wind. Gas can be dispatched in a short timeframe, something renewables cannot do in an affordable way at this stage.” Frydenberg has consistently criticised current moratoria on coal seam gas exploration.  “We need to improve market efficiency and competitiveness while attracting further investment in exploration and development,” the minister said this week. “We need to make it easier for new producers to enter the market and for buyers to more efficiently move that gas around our pipeline networks.”"
