"Cities are home to half the world’s population and produce around 75% of the world’s GDP and greenhouse gas emissions. By 2050, between 65% and 75% of the world population is projected to be living in cities, with more than 40 million people moving to cities each year. That’s around 3.5 billion people now, rising to 6.5 billion by 2050; a huge and singular event in human history. This places cities at the centre of economic activity affecting how economies grow, how resources are allocated, how innovation takes place, whether innovation is used well or badly and, if badly, how much damage it inflicts on others now and in the future. They can also be very exposed and vulnerable to climate risks such as water shortages, floods and heat stress. The mass congregating of people and rising demand for resources, under poor organisation and governance, make cities prime sources of pollution, congestion and waste.  However, cities are also a key part of the response. They afford multiple opportunities to dramatically reduce carbon emissions while sustaining prosperous standards of living. Indeed, there is no hope of reducing global emissions to safe levels if new and expanding cities are based on a sprawling, resource-intensive model of urban development. Compact urban growth can create cities that are economically dynamic and healthy. The Global Commission on the Economy and Climate, a partnership led by 28 business leaders and former heads of state, and its flagship New Climate Economy project (NCE), found that compact, connected and coordinated cities are more productive, socially inclusive, resilient, cleaner, quieter and safer. They also have lower greenhouse gas emissions – a good example of the benefits of pursuing economic growth and climate action together.   Cities are all about efficiency. It is why they are there in the first place. Gathering people together near accessible transport nodes (often rivers or sea ports) allowed materials, water and food to be imported and distributed efficiently, while waste and exports were shipped out. But cities afford an even larger, dynamic source of efficiency gains - the spread of ideas. Economic growth is driven by learning and innovation and the accumulation of ideas, skills and ‘knowledge capital’. Knowledge and innovation allow society to decouple growth from resource use to ensure that we can get more out of the resources we have. Unlike other resources, knowledge capital is weightless and does not deplete. Quite the reverse, knowledge builds on knowledge, making this a “magic resource” subject to unlimited economies of scale. The intellectual economy is often reliant on investment in physical capital. New equipment enables new ideas and innovation in technologies. For example, investing in computers induces bright ideas about how to use them. Investing in integrated public transport and cycle infrastructure changes people’s modal behaviour and enables new apps to monitor and report real-time departures and arrivals and cycle dock availability. Knowledge begets increased output and liberates resources for further investment. Its generation and use are closely related to its context: some of it will be very general, some of it location and community specific. Cities contain a concentrated mix of specialisation and diversity and economic activity which generates a fertile environment for innovation in ideas, technologies and processes. Ideas are shared and new techniques and innovations are learnt, scaled and deployed. Cities are well placed to benefit from strong action to reduce emissions while simultaneously improving resource efficiency, tackling waste, and reducing noise, congestion and pollution. The most dynamic and creative cities attract the best talent. The physical shape of cities will determine the behaviours of its citizens and the responsiveness of its institutions. For example, providing cycle infrastructure will encourage people to invest in cycling. More cyclists will put greater pressure on politicians to provide better cycle infrastructure, a virtuous physical and behavioural spiral that encourages better physical and mental health, life satisfaction and reduces carbon emissions. A similar story can be told for pedestrianisation.   Cities have governance mechanisms and planning systems which, if they function well, can make the creation and delivery of resource-efficient and less polluting policies easier to implement: action is often more effective at the city level where policymakers are closer, physically and culturally, to their citizens than national governments. The consequences of policies on waste, transport and the urban environment are readily observable and local officials are held to account for their success or failure. At the same time, a community with a shared sense of purpose can be very fertile in innovation and ideas on how it can develop and improve. Making cities effective can mean rethinking governance, planning and metropolitan finance. Reform of local public finances in many cases, including increased fiscal autonomy for cities and planning laws that provide mechanisms for local communities to share in the overall gains, is needed. This can help stimulate the significant private sector financing required for smart urban infrastructure development. Addressing corruption and containing the influence of local barons and mafias on town and city hall actions are also prerequisite to effective action. Urban leaders can enable the delivery of low-carbon programmes at scale, for example, through recycling schemes, energy from waste, broadband networks, plug-in car points, integrated public transport systems, ‘smart’ buildings, congestion pricing and biking networks. These tend to receive popular support. Surveys suggest urban populations place a higher premium on sustainability, generating a popular and clearly understood mandate. Leadership and community action go hand in hand. This is important because delaying action taken to counter climate change and aid resource efficiency will ramp up the long-term costs. This is because it is the stock of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere that has an effect on the climate, and not the annual flow into it. Every year of delay increases the stock and means the work we need to do to get back down to a stable equilibrium is harder (the same principle applies to the irreversible depletion of scarce resources).   Cities best exemplify the costs of delaying action on climate change and locking into resource-intensive infrastructure and behaviours. Cities in emerging economies are building the bulk of their infrastructures in the next two or three decades. The urban form they lock in to will have a massive impact on their resilience to resource costs for decades and centuries to come. Compact urban growth can significantly reduce the cost of providing services and substantially lessen urban infrastructure requirements. Urban sprawl on the other hand locks in inefficiently high levels of energy consumption, and makes it harder to implement more efficient models of waste management and district heating. Planning laws may need to change to encourage dense development, backed up by connected infrastructure and public transport systems such as rail, bus rapid transit, bicycle lanes, pedestrian access, car- and bicycle-sharing, smarter traffic information systems, and electric vehicles with charging point networks using renewable energy sources. For example, sprawling US cities in the United States use orders of magnitude more resources and create more emissions per capita than cities of similar income levels in Europe and Asia. The Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development estimates that cities such as Cincinnati, Houston and Minnesota generate between 20 and 30 tonnes of carbon dioxide per capita compared to between 5 and 10 tonnes in Stockholm, London and Tokyo. Atlanta and Barcelona each accommodate just over 5 million people and are similarly prosperous, but the latter has 4% of the urban area of the former, and less than a tenth of the carbon emissions. Opportunities and risks Rapidly urbanising developing economies still have a choice as to whether to adopt high or low resource-intensive development paths. The former may appear cheaper in the short run and require less careful planning, but is likely to be extremely costly over the medium term and very difficult to reverse. Resources such as coal, for example, may look cheap (say US$50 a tonne) but are generally more than four times that cost once pollution and climate effects, which have very real costs in terms of lives and livelihoods, are taken into account. A recent report by the World Resources Institute cites a valuation of the health impacts of pollution (including premature deaths) in OECD countries, China and India of $3.5 trillion a year. In some countries, such as China, costs are estimated by the World Bank, based on data from the World Health Organisation, to amount to more than 10% of GDP. As a proportion of regional GDP, the costs of traffic congestion are estimated at 4.0% for Cairo, 4.8% for Jakarta, 7.8% for São Paulo, and up to 15% for Beijing. A recent paper by researchers at the University of California at Berkeley showed that particulate matter (PM2.5) pollution in China has been estimated to contribute to 1.6 million premature deaths a year, ie 4,000 deaths per day, with some estimating that the problem in India is worse than in China. Cities in the developed world are not immune. The UK Committee on the Medical Effects of Air Pollutants estimated that premature deaths resulting from PM2.5 air pollution totalled approximately 29,000 in 2008. Denser cities with integrated transport facilities generate significant savings in operating costs. Yet suburban living remains a viable choice. People like suburbs, especially in weak cities suffering from ‘hollowed out’ centres. There is evidence to suggest that, all else being equal, richer people want more square metres, or – as economists describe it – the income elasticity of demand for space is high. However, all else is not equal and once the full list of externalities and the degree of lock-in and behavioural, institutional and technological feedbacks are accounted for, it is highly questionable whether wealthier societies are likely to benefit from sprawling urban design. Indeed, vibrant well-planned urban centres have also shown equal appeal to mobile skilled and highly educated workers. But policies must be coherently planned. For example, efficiently reducing congestion and emissions requires complementary measures on public transport, cycling, electric and shared vehicle infrastructure, urban planning, zoning and carbon pricing. It is estimated that people in Portland, Oregon, save $2bn annually through three decades of coordinated policies to change land use and transport systems. Measures include modest increases in building density, light rail transit schemes and policies to encourage walking and cycling. In many European cities, recycling levels are in the region of 50% of domestic waste, with Copenhagen sending a mere 3% of its waste to landfills. Even for cities already locked into sprawling development, transport connectivity can be significantly improved through options like bus rapid transit (BRT) systems. The economic returns of Johannesburg’s BRT in its first phase were estimated by the New Climate Economy report to be close to $900m. In Buenos Aires, travel time savings from its BRT have been calculated at as much as 50%. BRTs and other public transit systems can reduce traffic, improve safety and boost productivity. A 20% reduction in congestion in Lagos would be expected to inject $1bn into the local economy annually. Cycling can also enhance mobility for the urban poor. As already noted, community action is critical to much of this story. This includes recycling and reusing materials, district heating, public transport and car-sharing. Action on cities, productivity and climate is about strengthening communities. Many communities are revealed as economically unviable if the costs of pollution and congestion are taken into account. The costs of dealings with past mistakes in city development are immense: it is far better to think ahead while we have the opportunity.   Some of Europe’s most successful cities have also rapidly decarbonised. Stockholm reduced emissions by 35% from 1993 to 2010, but grew its economy by 41%, one of the highest growth rates in Europe. Since 1990, Copenhagen has reduced its carbon emissions by more than 40%, while experiencing real growth of around 50%. These statistics do not prove causality, but an examination of how and why this was achieved at the very least provides evidence showing that ambitious and innovative environmental targets need not impact negatively on competitiveness or economic performance. Other leading examples could include Barcelona in Spain, Hamburg and Freiburg in Germany, and Singapore. Major cities and urban leaders the world over are taking the lead in setting strong numerical targets for emissions. New York aims to cut its annual greenhouse gas emissions by 30% over the period between 2007 and 2030; Los Angeles plans 35% cuts in emissions between 1990 and 2030; Seoul plans 40% cuts from 1990 to 2030; and Hong Kong plans 50-60% cuts over the period from 2005 to 2020. China’s low-carbon city project run by its National Development and Reform Commission (part of ‘local’ 12th five-year plans) includes Tianjin, Chongqing, Shenzhen, Xiamen, Hangzhou, Nanchang, Guiyang and Baoding. Strong action in cities has the potential to influence the national agenda and influence international negotiations. International collaboration can help accelerate cost-effective climate action in cities. City networks such as C40, ICLEI, and United Cities and Local Governments allow for sharing best practices and facilitate new forms of finance. These organisations, together with the United Nations, helped jointly deliver the Compact of Mayors, committing to complying with a common accountability framework for tracking and reducing greenhouse gas emissions. This has been signed by 97 cities, representing 183 million people as of August 2015. With cities moving markets, joint procurement standards generate great potential for economies of scale, from buses to smart street lighting.   The need for coordinated policy does not end once the infrastructure for roads, buses railways and smart grids is in place; policy signals must continue to ensure sustainable behaviour and management, and harness the power of markets while limiting transaction costs and distortions. Pricing carbon pollution – explicitly via tax or trading, or implicitly through regulation - helps address numerous market failures without introducing policy failures. Bringing forward lower carbon technology, through funding for research, development and deployment, and overcoming information barriers and transaction costs through publicity campaigns, regulation and standards, also have a central role to play. Finally, inducing change in social norms by promoting a shared understanding of responsible behaviour across all societies goes beyond sticks and carrots, with such trends often originating at the urban level. This underlines the importance of leadership and community action, as well as learning from the experience of others. The future of sustained growth, poverty reduction, the world’s health and management of climate change, are tightly intertwined. Efficient cities are likely to be compact and ‘smart’ taking full advantage of the efficiency gains associated with the revolution in information and communications technology. Integrated technologies will help make dense complex cities work efficiently. A broadband digital infrastructure can connect people to people, people to city systems, and city systems to city systems, allowing cities and residents to respond to changing circumstances in near real-time. Cities are essentially tightly integrated systems, but with humans. This means that cities that think, adapt and evolve will learn to make good use of their resources, food, energy, health, communications and climate through the use of smart grids and buildings with responsive energy management, connected healthcare and integrated public safety. Cities can be clean, unpolluted and uncongested, attracting mobile capital, talent and creativity. The world is at a crossroads: inaction will reduce citizen welfare, increase costs and insecurity and eventually risk urban catastrophe as resources are depleted and climate damages mount. Resource- and carbon-efficient growth is the only sustainable long-term option. The choices made in cities today on transport, infrastructure, buildings and industry, as they grow rapidly over the coming decades, will determine the technology, institutions and behaviours they lock in and govern whether mankind can both manage climate change and capture the benefits of resource-efficient growth. Professor Lord Stern of Brentford and Dimitri Zenghelis, are respectively, chair and co-head of policy at the Grantham Research Institute on Climate Change and the Environment at the London School of Economics and Political Science. Urban Age is a worldwide investigation into the future of cities, organised by LSE Cities and Deutsche Bank’s Alfred Herrhausen Society.

"“Not getting lost in London will probably be the first hurdle,” laughed Jade Till, a teacher from Stroud, before adding that walking 19 miles on a cold November day will also be a challenge. Sat in the crypt of St Martin’s-in-the-Fields on the edge of Trafalgar Square on Friday, Till was about to walk 200 miles to Paris on a two week “pilgrimage” to crunch UN climate change talks where world leaders aim to negotiate a new deal on limiting greenhouse gas emissions.  She is joined by 44 other Christians, among them Methodists, Baptists and Catholics, from 18-year-old students to 75-year-old retirees. Many more will join for smaller sections along the way as the group stop to give talks and stay with schools, churches and environmental groups. “What we are trying to do is to get the church to see that the care of God’s creation, the care of the Earth is central to our Christian life and not a nice addition for some people who are keen on it. This is one of the key things about being a Christian today,” Bishop of Salisbury, Nick Holtam, the lead Bishop on the environment for the Church of England (CoE) told the Guardian. “Those of you making the journey will feel it through the soles of your feet. It’s a very physical thing you are about to do. It is November – cold days, wet weather – physically it will be a challenge,” he told the “pilgrims” before leading a service to mark the journey. Holtam is not the only church leader calling for stronger action on climate change within faith communities. Many hope that the Pope’s landmark climate change encyclical on the issue will galvanise believers worldwide, and in particular sceptics in the US. Islamic leaders and the Dalai Lama have issued similar calls to action.  On Friday the “pilgrims” walked 16 miles through Whitehall and across Westminster Bridge to Banstead, a few miles inside the M25. Other days will see the group cross through countryside, towns and along a disused railway. The longest day is 19 miles.  After taking the ferry from Newhaven to Dieppe, they will arrive in Paris in two weeks time and join the climate change march taking place there and other cities around the world. They will also deliver a series of petitions from faith organisations to Christiana Figueres, the Costa Rican diplomat leading the UN’s climate negotiations.  Kevin and Ros Durrant from Gloucester, both 56, were prompted to join the pilgrimage after hearing economist Nicholas Stern speak at the Hay Festival in May. “It was a bit of a throwaway line – but he said that the faith communities could be doing more in the run-up to the conference. It prompted us to come and find out what the Baptist church is doing,” said Ros Durrant.  “Like lots of people we’ve been armchair environmentalists for a long time and we wanted to show our commitment in some way,” added Kevin.  The pair have only done “social pub-to-pub walking” before and have been training for three months. Their church is in the process of being credited as an “eco-congregation” for taking environmental measures such as getting energy from renewable sources, teaching on environmental issues and encouraging members of the congregation to make lifestyle changes Other environmentalists around the world are also taking a symbolic journey to the talks. Yeb Saño, the Filipino diplomat who shot to fame after breaking down and leading a two week fast at climate talks in Poland two years ago, has already been on the road for six weeks as part of a 1,500km “people’s pilgrimage” from Rome to the French capital.  Two climate scientists have gone many steps further, leaving their desks to walk and cycle from the two polar regions to the conference in an effort to raise awareness. "
"Australia has already met its 2020 greenhouse emissions reduction target, an outcome the government claims enhances its credibility ahead of the Paris climate summit next week, but analysts and climate campaigners say is proof the target was always far too low. Having foreshadowed for weeks that revised greenhouse projections would mean Australia had already met its 2020 target, the environment minister, Greg Hunt, has confirmed the official figures, showing Australia is 28m tonnes of greenhouse abatement ahead of what it needs to reach the target of a 5% reduction by 2020 based on 2000 levels.   In 2008, when Kevin Rudd was devising the emissions trading scheme, Australia thought it would have to reduce cumulative greenhouse emissions by 1,335m tonnes to get to a 5% reduction. When the Abbott government came to power in 2010, that was down to 755m tonnes. More recently it was assessed at 236m tonnes, and new figures show it is now down to nothing. The government is also likely to receive up to 16m free tonnes of abatement in the form of international permits from landfill operators who ended up with a windfall gain after the abolition of the emissions trading scheme.  Australia has actually pledged to the United Nations that it would reduce emissions by between 5% and 25% by 2020, with a 5% cut being what we would do even if the rest of the world did nothing, and giving specific conditions for moving to a 15% or 25% target. The independent Climate Change Authority has found 5% is “not credible” as Australia’s share of the global effort to keep global warming at 2C, and the conditions for a higher target have already been met, but neither major party has said they would move from the minimum 5% goal. Australia is meeting its minimum goal via accounting rules – most forecasts show its emissions will rise by 2020. The latest analysis by research firm RepuTex shows Australia’s actual emissions will rise 4% by 2020 compared with 2000 levels, and 6% compared with today. But Australia will be able to count “carry over”, under the accounting rules governing international emissions calculations, because it “overshot” or did better than the special deal it received at the Kyoto meeting for its first climate change pledge to 2012. (Unlike most developed countries, Australia was allowed to increase its emissions by 8%.) Emissions have fallen due to the drought, the slowdown in the economy, the decline in manufacturing and to a small extent the impact of the renewable energy target and other climate policies such as the emissions reduction fund. The deputy chief executive of the Climate Institute, Erwin Jackson, said the new forecasts meant Australia should take on a tougher target. “Are we going to sit on our hands for the next five years or are we going to look at the conditions for a higher 2020 target? The Coalition was originally assuming its policies would cut Australia’s emissions by 160m tonnes in 2020, so if we are already meeting the 5% target, taking exactly the same policy action should be able to meet a target of 25%,” he said. “The truth is the actions the government has taken will have the net effect of increasing Australia’s emissions, not decreasing them. They repealed the carbon price and weakened the renewable energy target.” The Australian Conservation Foundation’s chief executive, Kelly O’Shanassy, said that “when Australia’s minimum 5% target was set, the government said it would increase it when other countries committed to stronger targets. This has happened, but our target remains low. The government is shirking its commitment. “Strengthening Australia’s 2020 and 2030 targets would send a positive message about the government’s commitment to climate action leading up to the meetings in Paris.” The government will also take a longer term climate pledge to the COP21 conference in Paris, to reduce emissions by 26% to 28% by 2030. It argues this is a significant commitment because it is one of the largest reductions on a per capita basis. Australia is and will remain one of the world’s largest per capita emitters. Hunt will address the national press club today."

"The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation would have had $1.9bn (£1.3bn) more to spend on its lifesaving health projects if it had divested from fossil fuels and instead invested in greener companies, according to a new analysis.  The Canadian research company Corporate Knights examined the stock holdings of 14 funds, worth a combined $1tn, and calculated how they would have performed if they had dumped shares in oil, coal and gas companies three years ago.  Overall, the funds would have been $23bn better off with fossil fuel divestment. The Wellcome Trust, which is the world’s biggest health charity after the Gates Foundation, would have been $353m better off. The huge Dutch pension fund ABP would have had $9bn in higher returns, while Canada’s CPP would have had $7bn more. Campaign sign up “There are billions of dollars potentially being left on the table by these large funds as a result of hanging on to fossil fuel stocks and being underexposed to the $3tn [environmental] sector,” said Toby Heaps, chief executive of Corporate Knights. Separately, a fossil free index from one of the world’s largest providers of financial indexes, MSCI, has just completed its first year with returns 60% greater than its parent index.  The Gates Foundation and Wellcome Trust are widely recognised for their important work and have been the focus of a Guardian campaign asking them to divest their large endowments from fossil fuels. Climate change poses the greatest threat to health in the 21st century, according to doctors, and to avoid catastrophic impacts, most known fossil fuel reserves must be kept in the ground. If the world’s governments keep their word and halt global warming, those reserves could become worthless, meaning there are both financial and moral arguments for divestment. Investors managing over $2.6tn of assets have already committed to divestment, including Norway’s sovereign wealth fund, the world’s largest. The Bank of England has also warned of potentially huge losses. “The number one complaint about divestment we’ve heard from fund managers is that it would cost them too much money,” said Jamie Henn, communications director at 350.org, the climate campaign that commissioned the new research. “As it turns out, they are dead wrong. The energy industry of the 21st century is going to look nothing like the fossil fuel industry of the 20th. Institutions that don’t change with the times stand to lose big and, as this new analysis shows, they already are.” 350.org are partners on the Guardian’s Keep it in the Ground campaign. The Corporate Knights research examined how 14 large investment funds would have performed if they had divested from fossil fuels in October 2012. The fossil fuel firms excluded were the top 100 coal companies and top 100 oil and gas companies, ranked by the size of their reserves by Fossil Free Indices, plus utilities generating more than 30% of their power by burning coal, as ranked by South Pole Group. In the analysis, the excluded investments were replaced by increased investments in green companies already held by the funds. Green companies were those getting more than 20% of their revenue from environmental solutions as verified by FTSE Environmental Markets or Bloomberg New Energy Finance, a pool of 1,600 companies with a combined market capitalisation of $3tn. The analysis found the New York City Employee Retirement scheme would have been $1.6bn better off with divestment, as would Australia’s Future Fund. “The period of analysis coincides with a tough market for oil and commodities in general,” said Heaps. “Over the next few years, many oil stocks – if not coal utilities – could jump back, but in the long term, I don’t think a lot of prudent market watchers are betting that the carbon intensive sectors are going to outperform the market in general.” A crunch UN climate summit begins in Paris in two weeks, at which governments are expected to agree a deal to significantly cut future carbon emissions. The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation Trust does not comment on its investment holdings and decisions. Bill Gates has called fossil fuel divestment a “false solution” and in June announced he would invest $2bn of his own fortune in innovative renewable energy projects over five years. A spokeswoman for the Wellcome Trust said: “The Trust’s long-term investment strategy has led to a total return of over £9bn since September 2008, while returns over both 10 and 20 years up to September 2014 have averaged above 10% per year in nominal terms.” This would allow charitable spending of £1bn a year for the next five years, she said. The director of the Wellcome Trust, Jeremy Farrar, said on Sunday that the impacts of climate change on health “affect us today, never mind affecting our children or our grandchildren. This is not some abstract threat; it is immediate and it is personal.” The MSCI fossil fuel free index replicates its broad All Country World Index (ACWI), but without 124 companies identified as having large reserves of coal, oil and gas. In its first year, to October 2015, the fossil free index produced gross returns of 6.5% compared to 4.1% for the ACWI. The significant outperformance of the fossil free index reflected the troubled year suffered by energy companies, said Tom Kuh, head of ESG indexes for MSCI: “The challenge for investors is to figure out whether what is going on with energy is cyclical or structural.” Kuh noted the upcoming UN climate summit, the coal industry’s troubles of the last five years and recent legal investigations in the US into ExxonMobil and said: “There seems to be more pressure coming from regulators and policymakers on fossil fuel companies because of the role fossil fuels play in climate change.” He said demand for fossil free and low carbon indexes was growing and that the fossil fuel divestment campaign had brought the issue to prominence in the last two years. MSCI will also be providing carbon footprints for all 160,000 of its indexes in 2016. “Carbon is increasingly becoming a factor that investors are looking at in understanding risk in their portfolios,” Kuh said.

"Perhaps it’s being forced to think about global matters and the dangers they pose, but the UK’s foreign secretary Philip Hammond, like his Conservative predecessor, both understands the risks of climate change and the urgent need to act. In a powerful speechthis week, he said: “Taking action to combat climate change is the right thing to do - the conservative thing to do.” Hammond had deliberately picked a tough crowd: the American Enterprise Institute, the free-marketeers who have for years have turned ExxonMobil and Koch dollars into climate change denial.   But the most extraordinary aspect of the speech is the chasm between the arguments Hammond made in Washington DC and the actions of his colleague George Osborne at home. Hammond was extremely clear on the costs of inaction: Many of the losses caused by climate change could be irreversible, regardless of our resources. Unchecked climate change, even under the most likely scenario, could have catastrophic consequences – a rise in global temperatures ... leading in turn, to rising sea levels, huge movements of people fuelling conflict and instability, pressure on resources, and a multitude of new risks to global public health. The worst case is even more severe: a drastic change in our environment that could see heat stress in some areas surpass the limits of human tolerance, leaving as the legacy of our generation an unimaginably different and more dangerous world for our children and grandchildren. The good news, Hammond said, is that many of the measures to reduce climate risk stimulate - not decimate - economic growth: The global low carbon economy is already worth $6tn, and is growing 4-5% a year. In 2013, additions to the world’s renewable energy generating capacity exceeded those to the fossil-fuelled capacity for the first time ever. Not only that, but the growth in the low carbon sector of the UK economy is now outpacing the growth rate of the economy as a whole. In the UK, [these] firms employed over 460,000 people and contributed £45bn to the UK economy in 2013, an increase of almost 30% in just three years ... Our businesses in the UK are looking at these trends, and telling us that we should be a leader, not a back-marker. The problem is that Osborne, despite any chancellor’s obsession with growth, appears determined to undermine the green economy. Since May, a catalogue of measures are ruining confidence in the sector and destroying jobs.  Support for both large scale and domestic solar power is being slashed, as are subsidies for biomass and biogas projects. Onshore wind farms, the cheapest green energy, are being blocked as are solar farms in the countryside. All this is happening just as the fast-falling cost of renewables means subsidies are close to no longer being needed: it is snatching defeat from the jaws of victory. Not content with undermining renewables, the chancellor is also tilting the playing field by ramping up subsidies for oil and gas, the only G7 nation doing so, as well as overseeing hundreds of millions of pounds subsidising filthy diesel generators.  Back in Washington DC, Hammond’s vision was as clear and Osborne’s is smoggy: The world is moving towards a low carbon economy; I would suggest that there may now be more risk in being left behind than there is in taking the lead ... Studies suggest that by stimulating greater innovation and efficiency, climate policies will increase our economic competitiveness.  Osborne’s response has been to scrap energy efficiency programmes without replacements and dump rules for future homes and offices to be zero carbon. Of course, as a Tory, Hammond strongly believes in the market over regulation as the best tool for change. He said that, with signals like a price on carbon to correct market failures, the market can deliver: Watch [the market] deliver solutions – as it has delivered solutions to every other problem we have faced and resolved in our history ... Moreover, a market solution is simple and gives business the certainty that they’re asking for. The Paris deal [at December’s UN climatye summit] is important because it will give all countries confidence in the direction of travel. It will level the playing field, confirm once and for all that climate action does not create competitive disadvantage, catalyse investment, and spur innovation. Stirring words - maybe today’s Gordon Gekko’s will be soon be saying “green is good”. But what is the direction of travel Osborne’s actions are setting for the market? The chancellor has imposed a carbon tax on renewable energy (which emits no carbon), has increased the tax on small, efficient cars and given huge tax breaks to oil and gas industry. The UK’s Green Investment Bank, set up to address a market failure, is to be privatised. The direction of travel is down a high-carbon dead end in a gas-guzzling SUV. Like Hammond, prime minister David Cameron also made strong statements on climate change in the US recently, saying “the UK is determined to play its part” in delivering an ambitious global deal in Paris. Yet at home, actions are speaking louder than words. "
"We Homo sapiens got lucky. Very lucky. Back in the 1920s, when looking for a “safe” gas to use in refrigerators, chlorine was the element of choice in a new family of manmade chemical compounds – chlorofluorocarbons. In the 1970s, Paul Crutzen, Mario Molina and Sherwood Rowland discovered that while it was safe in our fridges, it was destroying the ozone layer, which is essential to protect all life on land. Luck struck twice. Nasa scientists measuring ozone above Antarctica in the 1980s never saw the ozone hole in their data. Their computers were programmed to ignore any figures deemed “impossible”. Luckily, the British Antarctic Survey had no such technology and sounded the alarm. In 1987, nations signed the Montreal Protocol outlawing CFCs.  But here luck comes in threes. Bromine is as good as chlorine for fridges and air conditioners, but about 40 times more corrosive to ozone. And by mere chance, the industry chose chlorine as the global standard. If this had not happened, the ozone layer could have been ripped apart before we even knew it. In 1995, Crutzen, Molina and Rowland were awarded the Nobel prize in chemistry, obviously. This story barely gets mentioned in the history books covering the 20th century, but it is a significant subplot in an emerging meta-narrative of our species. In this narrative, the most significant event in the last century was not the world wars, the Cold War, the Great Depression, civil rights, or the moon landings. It was when our species overtook the great forces of nature to become the most significant driver of change of Earth’s biosphere, the space where life exists. It is this event that historians and geologists will be poring over for centuries to come. They will either wonder why, if this knowledge was known, did our species fail to act to prevent catastrophe after catastrophe – the tragedy of the global commons – or they will wonder how we found the political will and technology to navigate towards a safe and just future. The trajectory of our planet is in the balance. At the same time, ending poverty and ensuring there is food, clean water and energy for all are within our grasp. Remarkably, 2015 is the make-or-break year and all the signs are there that we are changing course – a great transformation is not only within sight, it is under way. Here’s why. First, world leaders met in New York recently to agree the sustainable development goals – applying equally to all nations. This is a paradigm shift in thinking; it acknowledges for the first time that our wellbeing, the global economy and human development all rely on a stable biosphere and that this very stability is at risk. Second, we have reached “peak child”; the number of children in the world is no longer increasing. Population will eventually stabilise at 10-12 billion. And third, world leaders meet again next month to seek a workable solution to the climate challenge. The best evidence from science indicates that there is still time to avoid dangerous climate change, but the window of opportunity is closing rapidly. The world’s biggest emitters – China and the US – are showing real global leadership for the first time. US leadership during the ozone crisis was critical to providing the necessary confidence to spark bold action by many nations. But first, more drama: we can articulate precisely how high the stakes have become. Last week, we learned that the Earth had passed two new landmarks. Carbon dioxide in the atmosphere crossed the 400 parts per million threshold. The last time carbon dioxide levels were this high was at least three million years ago, before modern humans existed and in a very different climate to today’s. Scientists estimate that if we really wanted to safeguard a stable climate, then our limit should be around 350ppm. The second landmark is linked directly to greenhouse gases. It was announced that the Earth’s temperature is 1C above pre-industrial levels. We are halfway to the 2C limit agreed by world leaders in 2009. Emissions of greenhouse gases are changing the global carbon cycle. Damming, water extraction, irrigation and climate change are affecting the global water cycle. We use an area the size of South America to grow our crops and an area the size of Africa for our livestock. We move more sediment and rock than natural processes. Biodiversity is reaching mass extinction rates. There have only been five mass extinctions in Earth’s 4.6bn-year history; the last, 65m years ago, ended the reign of the dinosaurs. The oceans are becoming more acidic at a rate not seen for at least 55m years. Don’t get me wrong. These changes have been remarkable for human wellbeing. Artificial fertilisers mean we can feed more people. Diseases are being eradicated on a global scale. We, in wealthy nations at least, live longer, healthier lives. But we have done this with a frontiers worldview – we have believed we can always expand and grow into new spaces to accommodate our needs. This is no longer tenable. We need to update our worldview: we are no longer a small world on a big planet. We are now a big world on a small planet. The base upon which we have built all of this is a stable biosphere. As long as the Earth was relatively large, with good resilience and ample abundance of resource, we could benefit from subsidies from ample natural resources, a forgiving ecosystem and a stable climate. Ecosystems provide fresh water, pollination, fertile soil and food. Indeed, the stability of the global climate over the past 11,000 years, which geologists call the Holocene, has been the foundation for our global civilisation. In 2000, Paul Crutzen proposed that Earth has left the Holocene and had entered a new geological epoch, the Anthropocene, where humans dominate. This is not the result of some gradual transition over the 200,000 years since we emerged from the plains of Africa. We have hit the Earth like a comet. We became a phenomenal global force in a single lifetime – since around 1950, with most change happening in the last few decades. The Anthropocene is up there with Copernicus’s heliocentricity or Darwin’s theory of evolution as one of the most profound shifts in worldview that has emerged from scientific endeavour. Since Crutzen’s remarkable intervention at a meeting of the International Geosphere-Biosphere Programme, the race has been on to answer one of the two biggest questions in science: if we are beyond Holocene boundaries, how stable is the Earth’s biosphere? A tipping point is a scientific concept best captured by the idiom “the straw that broke the camel’s back”, or by the scene in Monty Python’s The Meaning of Life where a waiter places a “wafer-thin mint” in the mouth of a grossly obese man – Mr Creosote – who explodes. We know Earth has lurched across tipping points before, causing temperatures to change drastically in a matter of decades as the planet slips into a new regime. Given that the Holocene is the only state we know can support a population of 7.3 billion, a degree of caution would be advisable to avoid Mr Creosote’s fate. While we are beginning to put together a picture of the Earth’s tipping points, the precise thresholds beyond which we risk irreversible change, deleterious for human societies, are as yet unknown. Earlier this year, my colleagues and I published our latest assessment on the state of the biosphere and the parameters that must be safeguarded to remain within Holocene-like conditions. We confirmed our previous work, showing that there are nine planetary boundaries relating to, for example, ozone, fresh-water use, ocean acidification, new chemicals (such as CFCs) and aerosols – small particles in the atmosphere. We estimated that the Earth has crossed four boundaries as a result of human activity, relating to climate change, biodiversity loss, deforestation and fertiliser use. We are in a danger zone. If we cross one tipping point then we risk crossing them all. So, we have reached the critical moment. What happens next is up to us. But we are already seeing warning signs. With just a 1C rise in temperature, there are strong indications that some parts of Antarctica are destabilising. This probably commits us over the next centuries to another one metre sea level rise (in addition to the up to one metre sea level rise committed to over the coming century, according to most science), and which could be a prelude to a long-term sea level rise of six to seven metres if the trend of tipping points continue. If we burn all known reserves of fossil fuels, the Antarctic ice sheet will melt completely, causing a rise in sea level of around 58 metres. Given the implications, speculative drilling for oil in the Arctic may one day be seen as a crime against humanity. Closer to home, climate change is implicated in Syria’s civil war. The unprecedented drought in 2007-10, which climate models indicate can be expected to be repeated in the region as greenhouse gases rise, led to a mass migration to cities, contributing to civil unrest and political instability. If we carry on emitting greenhouse gases, then by the end of the century the world will be 4C warmer than just before the Industrial Revolution. This will be devastating in itself, but by that stage climate change may be difficult to stop and may trigger accelerated change. Hence the political consensus that going beyond 2C is “dangerous” and must be avoided. Setting such a planetary guard rail is critical, even though our scientific planetary boundary for climate change is set at 1.5C, showing that even 2C – a political “boundary” – is a risky threshold for humanity. But after 21 years of trying, nations have yet to agree a global pact to avoid this fate. This is why, earlier this year, my colleagues and I published the Earth Statement, outlining the eight essential ingredients of a successful agreement in Paris. This has now been signed by business, political and religious leaders including Richard Branson, Arianna Huffington, Mary Robinson, Desmond Tutu, Al Gore and Paul Polman. In the weeks before the Paris summit, we have launched a social media campaign, This Is My #EarthStatement, to build public support. Instead of signing an online petition, people can sign their own bodies and post photographs online to show not just a strong message to politicians, but also personal commitment to act. We’ve seen enormous support from sports stars such as Olympic skier Julia Mancuso, musicians, business leaders and politicians – next week, 15 mayors from major capital cities will sign to show their support. Will the change be fast enough? Will emissions cuts be deep enough? So to the other most important question in science: how can societies transform? Science is good at solving constrained problems, such as “what is the structure of DNA?” or “how do you land on the moon?” Or even “what are the Holocene boundaries?”. It is less good at “wicked” problems, such as poverty and overpopulation. In the Anthropocene, we have “super wicked” problems (first identified by Kelly Levin, Benjamin Cashore, Graeme Auld and Steven Bernstein), where time is running out, there is no central control and the people attempting to solve the problem caused it in the first place . In this environment, transformation emerges when worldviews change (science can be a good driver here), when new goals are set, when rules are introduced (and enforced), when the flow of information changes and when confidence reaches a threshold and spreads throughout the network like wildfire. I believe the building blocks are in place. The shift in worldview is represented by the Anthropocene. After the largest consultation in the history of the UN, the sustainable development goals provide the new compass point. The planetary boundaries framework is a mind-shift in the relationship between people and planet and a first attempt to set some rules to minimise risk. Information flows have altered radically since the internet revolution. Three billion people have access to the internet and there are 7bn mobile phone subscriptions. In the next decade, this will explode further. The priorities of the UN goals are clear and aligned with science – end poverty, decarbonise the global economy, halt biodiversity loss and protect the remaining forests on Earth. We need nothing less than a new industrial revolution for rapid transformation. Incremental change is not enough. Moore’s Law describes how computer processor speeds double every two years. The entire industry is now built on this foundation – and this changes how companies operate. We need a Moore’s Law for global sustainability. We need to get on a curve where entire sectors of the economy will change radically in the next few decades. If global sustainability becomes the compass point for a million hi-tech entrepreneurs and developers from Bangalore to Tokyo to Silicon Valley and Stockholm, then this industry alone will put a significant dent in the universe, to paraphrase Steve Jobs. But technology is not enough. Policy support is essential. We need to decarbonise the global economy by 2050 and run on 100% clean energy. We need a price on carbon. We need to keep within a carbon budget of one trillion tonnes of carbon dioxide – or 27 years at current emissions rates. We need a $100bn-a-year investment in sustainable energy systems for rapidly developing countries. We need to invest in adaptation to the change that is now inevitable. And we need 193 nations to unite. These are the foundational principles of the Earth Statement. And here is the good news. The transformation is under way. Copenhagen has announced it will be free of fossil fuels by 2025. Now Sweden is seriously talking about being the first fossil-fuel-free country. I believe it could do this as early as 2030. Imagine the signal this will send. Germany aims to decarbonise the world’s fourth largest economy without relying on nuclear power. The UK has a climate law legally binding the country to 80% emission reductions by 2050. Now let’s return to Paul Crutzen. The Dutch chemist was one of the founders of the International Geosphere-Biosphere Programme, set up in 1987 to coordinate research internationally on global change. The findings that emerged from this research are changing how we think about our relationship with the planet, not least during the Anthropocene. It has had a seminal influence on the creation of a new academic discipline: Earth systems science. After almost 30 years of operation, it closes this year. In its place, we need a new research programme – a global endeavour with the vision of the Apollo missions – to ensure the stability of Earth’s biosphere. Or, to quote Mark Watney (Matt Damon) in The Martian, we need to “science the shit out of this”. This will require a new type of science to support the transformation of societies, one that brings together climate researchers and Earth systems scientists with economists, behavioural scientists, ecologists, health specialists, engineers and many more. It must also engage business, policymakers and the public in a new way. Unlike Watley, no single country can do this alone. The international research programme developed to support this is called Future Earth, which meets in Japan this week. It is bringing together the world’s leading intellectual might to tackle the greatest scientific challenge of our time and it needs the support of all nations.

"A new book makes the case that those who understand the basics of climate change and clean energy will be the “smart money” in the coming years. Those who don’t, however, will make bad decisions for themselves and their family. They might, for instance, end up holding coastal property after prices have begun to crash due to due the growing twin threats of sea level rise and storm surge. In short, climate change isn’t just something every educated person ought to know about because it will impact future generations or because everyone will be talking about it during the upcoming Paris climate talks. It is something everyone needs to know about now because “Climate change will have a bigger impact on your family and friends and all of humanity than the Internet has had.” “Climate Change, What Everyone Needs to Know” is part of the highly regarded Oxford University Press series of primers on subjects ranging from China to Islam, which all share the same subtitle. For its climate change book, Oxford chose Dr. Joseph Romm, the founder of the popular blog ClimateProgress.org. Romm, a physicist and former U.S. Energy Department official, writes as easily on climate science as he does on solutions. The book is written entirely in a Q&A format, which makes it a highly readable introduction to the subject. Romm answers such basic questions as, ‘Why are climate scientists so confident that humans are the primary cause of recent warning?’ ‘Which extreme weather events are being made worse by climate change and which are not?’ ‘Why did scientists and governments decide 2°C (3.6°F) was the limit beyond which climate change becomes “dangerous” to humanity?’.  Even people who consider themselves science literate will learn from this book. Consider the question: “What fraction of recent global warming is due to human causes versus natural causes?” As Romm explains, “The best estimate from the world’s top scientists is that humans are responsible for all of the warming we have experienced since 1950.”  On the solutions side, Romm offers clear and up-to-date explanations of the roles solar, wind, biomass, and nuclear power will play in the next quarter century. If you are wondering which alternative fuel will replace oil in our cars, Romm makes a compelling case why it won’t be hydrogen but will be electricity. Romm examines one question that few people have even thought to ask, “Does carbon dioxide at exposure levels expected this century have any direct impacts on human health or cognition?”. The surprising answer is “yes” – a subject Romm has explored in more detail in recent weeks on his website. In the final chapter, Romm examines “How will climate change impact you and your family in the coming decades?”. Romm explains how U.S. government policies artificially inflate coastal property values and why climate change means that this trillion-dollar-bubble is going to burst in the foreseeable future. He looks at the question of how climate change should influence any decision about where to retire. He looks at what students should study today “if they want to prepare themselves for working in a globally warmed world” and maximize their future employability.   “Climate Change, What Everyone Needs to Know” is a must-read for those who want to become climate literate and join the growing conversation about the greatest threat humanity faces today – or simply for those who want to be in on the “smart money” rather than the other kind.

"More than 2,000 academics from over 80 countries – including linguist Noam Chomsky, climate scientist Michael E Mann, philosopher Peter Singer, and historian Naomi Oreskes – have called on world leaders to do more to limit global warming to a 1.5C rise.  In an open letter, they write that leaders meeting in Paris at a crunch UN climate summit next week should “be mustering planet-wide mobilisation, at all societal levels” and call for citizens around the world to hold their leaders to account on the issue.  The world has already warmed by 1C above pre-industrial levels. Holding warming to 1.5C would be a far greater challenge than the 2C that leaders at previous climate talks have agreed to limit rises to. Current emissions pledges tabled ahead of the Paris summit would see warming of around 2.7-3C. They say that such a rise is: “profoundly shocking, given that any sacrifice involved in making those reductions is far overshadowed by the catastrophes we are likely to face if we do not.”   Separately, the CEOs from 78 companies collectively worth over $2tn – among them Nestlé, Accenture, HSBC, Lloyd’s, Microsoft, BT Group, PepsiCo, Siemens, SOHO China, UniLever, PwC, Marks & Spencer and the Mahindra Group – have pledged their support to governments to implement ambitious targets. The companies, which operate in more than 150 countries, call for support for alternative energy sources, a carbon price to bolster investment, “consistent policies and robust monitoring” and for greater disclosure on investments related to fossil fuels and alternative energies.  In a letter co-ordinated by the World Economic Forum, the corporations recognise the internationally agreed target to limit global warming to 2C. They write: “climate change is one of the biggest global challenges that will shape the way we do business now and in the coming decades. This coalition ... believes the private sector has a responsibility to actively engage in global efforts to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, and to help lead the global transition to a low-carbon, climate-resilient economy.” It also extends an “open offer” to governments to “co-design tangible actions”, reduce their emissions and energy consumption and incorporate climate risk into their business strategies. "
"One day about five years ago, Frank Nolwo, a compact, quietly spoken boat skipper from the upper reaches of the Sepik river, in northern Papua New Guinea, woke up and headed into town. Nolwo, who is 42, has nine children. He was adding an extension to his house, and needed to buy some building materials. You do not just pop to the shops if you live in the upper Sepik. Nolwo left Kagiru, his village, in the early morning. Like other isolated clutches of palm-roofed houses on the river, Kagiru has no electricity, no mobile phone signal, and no road connecting it to anywhere else. Even by Papua New Guinean standards, the region is regarded as hot, poor and difficult to live in. When it rains, the place floods. When there is a drought, the creeks and streams dry up, stranding people and their canoes. It takes days to walk anywhere. For powerful, almost unarguable, geographic reasons, life in the upper Sepik has resisted meaningful economic development for thousands of years. There are lots, and lots, of crocodiles. After a day on the water, Nolwo reached Ambunti, a large village of around 2,000 people, where he spent the night. The next morning, he motored on. Nolwo was a prosperous and influential local figure. As well as running his boat, he was the chairman of a district of more than 30 small villages that included Kagiru. Even so, the trip was a major undertaking. The fuel alone was going to cost around £200. At around lunchtime on the second day, Nolwo moored his boat and got on a truck bound for Wewak, the provincial capital and his destination, a four-hour drive away on the coast. It was at the market in Wewak, buying hardware, that Nolwo ran into another district chairman from the upper Sepik, named David Salio, who invited him to a meeting in a local hotel about carbon trading. The In Wewak Boutique hotel is the smartest place in town. Set on a bluff just outside the centre it is a white, two-storey building with a small swimming pool and verandas that look out over the South Pacific. The meeting that night was organised by Stephen Hooper, a former Aussie rules football player and entrepreneur. A huge, broad man with a background in mining, Hooper had been working on and off in Papua New Guinea since 2007, first on a timber project, and then on schemes to sell carbon credits derived from forests. Nolwo sat and listened. He had been to high school and remembered the idea of photosynthesis, so what Hooper was saying about leaves and carbon and oxygen was not completely bizarre, but it was pretty far out. The gist was this: because of pollution in countries far away, and something happening to the atmosphere, people along the Sepik river were going to be able to start selling the clean air produced by their trees. And by the sound of things, they might get very rich. “It was surprising to me,” Nolwo told me recently. “It was something I hadn’t ever heard before. Like, I can catch fish and sell them for money. But this one was totally different.” He was intrigued. Four other local chairmen had already signed up with their communities. Nolwo decided to think about it. He bought what he needed for his house and started the long journey back to Kagiru. Back on the water, Nolwo looked at the skinny, grey-barked trees set back from the muddy banks, thickening into forests on the hills behind. They framed the powerful and unforgiving landscape that he had known all his life: sources of food and fuel and spiritual energy, where men and women would spend a few days on their own from time to time, to prepare for rituals, and to come of age. Now he found himself considering the trees in a new light. Nolwo’s mind filled not only with financial possibilities, but with the chance to contribute to a project of global importance. “This is to save the life of the world,” he thought. When he got home, Nolwo explained the whole idea to his wife. The first time you hear about REDD+, it tends to make a big impression. The acronym stands for Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Degradation. It is the UN’s plan to bring forests into the fight against climate change: to measure their contribution to stabilising the atmosphere, and to pay for it. REDD+ is, among many other things, a beautiful idea. There are three trillion trees on Earth and they are perfectly made to take carbon dioxide out of the atmosphere. Every year, the world’s forests and bogs are thought to absorb around 1.6 gigatonnes of our 10 gigatonnes of manmade emissions. Of course we are degrading these ecosystems at a terrible rate. Practices such as cutting down trees, draining swamps and burning brush, all to make way for agriculture, produce anything between 10% and 20% of greenhouse gas emissions in their own right. In an era of climate change, destroying forests is one of the most harmful things we can do. It takes one of our best hopes of controlling the damage and sets it against us. It is what is known in the pidgin of Papua New Guinea as a “double buggerup”. There are three trillion trees on earth and they are perfectly made to take carbon dioxide out of the atmosphere REDD+ promises to turn the situation around. Given how valuable these biological systems are – forests are “carbon capture and storage” technology in a cheap yet wondrous form – the idea is that we should pay for what they do. Where intact wildernesses remain in developing countries, scientists should figure out how much carbon they soak up and store, and governments and communities should be incentivised to preserve them rather than turn them over to asphalt or industrial farming. On our battered, warming planet, a tree should be worth as much standing as felled. The mechanics of how to do this are complicated, no doubt, but when you think about it, not beyond the capabilities of 21st-century science and bureaucrats: satellites and ground inventories to monitor deforestation, carbon markets, offset payments, and international aid to channel money from richer, polluting countries to poorer, tree-protecting ones. A vision of this future has entranced UN climate change talks since REDD was first proposed in 2005. At a cost of around $6m each, 51 countries, from Ethiopia to Ecuador, have spent the last five years preparing for the programme. Some $7bn has been pledged to get the system up and running, and REDD+ is one of the elements that negotiators are pushing to include in the grand treaty that the world is seeking at the Paris climate change summit, which starts next week. If the whole thing works as it is supposed to, the benefits would be remarkable. Carbon emissions would go down and forests would be saved – the same forests that shelter 77% of the world’s threatened bird species, supply water to a third of the world’s large cities, and are home to 60 million indigenous people, among the most vulnerable communities on Earth. Money would flow from north and south and new kinds of forest economies, based on living things and biodiversity, rather than denuded landscapes, would arise. Sociologists sometimes call climate change a “wicked problem” because of all the noxious, mutually reinforcing elements that go into it. On paper, REDD+ sometimes has the appearance of a wicked solution for all the good that it might do. And that is its weakness too. Some theories just do not work in practice, and almost from its inception, REDD+ has been criticised as impractical, financially unsound and a diversion from mankind’s number-one priority of curbing our consumption of fossil fuels. In some quarters, the scheme represents everything that is wrong about the UN approach to tackling climate change: theoretical, multilateral, unwieldy, rather than something that might actually have a bearing on the nitty‑gritty, day-to-day skirmishes over land and resources that are quickly putting the health of the planet beyond reach. “It is bonkers,” Chris Lang, a blogger who has covered the programme since 2008, told me, “on so many levels.” The question is whether that is precisely what genuine solutions to climate change are going to look like. No one ever said it was going to be easy. One of the most bonkers things about REDD+ has always been that it was dreamed up in Papua New Guinea. In Wewak, in fact. Not on the day that Frank Nolwo came to town, but years earlier, in the spring of 2003. One afternoon, the former prime minister, and father of the country’s independence, Grand Chief Sir Michael Somare, was walking along the town’s beach with a charismatic business student called Kevin Conrad. Conrad was in his mid-30s. The son of American missionaries, he had grown up near the village of Hayfield in the Sepik – he was born under a tree, he liked to say – and had known Somare since he was a boy. After graduating from high school, Conrad had gone to study in California, working at Nasa’s jet propulsion laboratory in Pasadena and investment banks before taking a job with Angco, Papua New Guinea’s largest coffee exporter. Now he was studying for an MBA in London and New York, and working informally as an adviser to Somare. That day, the grand chief had forests on his mind. The country has the world’s third-largest rainforest, after the Congo and the Amazon. It is a kind of pleasure-dome of biological diversity: the haunt of 19,000 known plant species, tree kangaroos and the cassowary, a 6ft-tall flightless bird. But its trees are commercially valuable too, and for decades the country has been home to a notoriously corrupt logging industry. In 1987, a national commission described timber companies “roaming the countryside with the self-assurance of robber barons; bribing politicians and leaders, creating social disharmony and ignoring laws”. Sixteen years later, a follow-up report had concluded that “the robber barons are now as active as they ever were”, and Somare was under pressure from the international community to do something. Estimating that 70% of Papua New Guinea’s timber exports were produced illegally in some way, the World Bank offered the nation a one-time loan of $17m to suspend its logging industry altogether. But that was nowhere near the royalties that the government received every year – which were closer to $50m – and which Somare viewed as essential to the development of the country. On the beach in Wewak, Somare put the problem to his young adviser. “Sir Michael said, ‘Actually I agree with what the World Bank is offering in principle,’” Conrad recalled. But Papua New Guinea could not afford to give up logging on those terms. The country is poor. People get by on average earnings of about £4 a day. Somare challenged Conrad to come up with an alternative way to make money from its forests. Conrad spent two years working out his answer. He had no background in deforestation or climate science or economic development, but he was a quick study. He read about “payments for ecosystem services” – an idea that had been trialled in Costa Rica to reward landowners for maintaining healthy waterways, or bird habitats. He learned about carbon markets, in which companies support pollution-preventing schemes on international exchanges in order to offset their emissions. Conrad pondered the astonishing quantity of carbon that must be stored in Papua New Guinea’s forests, which cover 370,000 square kilometres, an area comfortably larger than Italy. He pored over the dense, forbidding texts of the UNFCCC, the UN’s mammoth climate change negotiating process, and he came up with an idea: could a country such as Papua New Guinea be paid to keep its forests intact? Could it sell, as carbon credits, the millions upon millions of tonnes of emissions that would be saved if it did not cut down its trees? Conrad was interested in money. He was determined to upend conventional thinking about aid and conservation. Growing up in the Sepik, he had seen foreign NGOs come with vague ideas about preserving the wilderness and no money for the communities that lived there. “It frustrated me,” he said. “It seemed to me they were asking them to continue to be poor, even though they had a world-class asset.” In November 2005, with Somare’s blessing, and the support of Costa Rica, Conrad submitted an 11-page proposal to the UN’s climate change summit, which had gathered in Montreal. The timing, and the character, of Conrad’s idea could not have been more potent. Calculating the financial implications of climate change, and devising market-based mechanisms to address the problem, was precisely where the smart thinking was at. In 2006, the Stern Review on the Economics of Climate Change identified tackling deforestation as a “highly cost-effective way” to curb greenhouse gas emissions. Soon after, REDD got its acronym, and began to gain traction in the UNFCCC. The World Bank got involved. In 2008, a British government review into the future of the world’s forests, conducted by Johan Eliasch, a Swedish businessman and environmentalist, predicted that a well-designed REDD system could cut global deforestation by up to 75% by 2030. There was a political edge to REDD, as well, that made it stand out in the schismed world of the climate change talks. The main reason why the UNFCCC has been stuck all these years is because the world’s developing countries accuse industrialised nations of wrecking the planet, and they want hundreds of billions of dollars in compensation. The rich countries, for their part, observe that almost two-thirds of greenhouse gasses now come from the developing world, and that they are not going to make any deep cuts, and certainly not part with any money, until everyone agrees to reduce their emissions. REDD ignored this standoff. From day one, the idea was that poor countries such as Papua New Guinea would be happy to curb their emissions by preserving their forests in return for money. (Around 70% of Papua New Guinea’s carbon emissions come from logging.) “That was game-changing,” Conrad said. The commercial straightforwardness of REDD threatened the deadlock that suited major players at the talks. “The US didn’t want it. The US wanted the status quo, which was that they wanted to do nothing.” Conrad himself personified the dynamic, ideologically versatile, nature of what he was proposing. He was hard to pin down, exactly: based in New York, but representing Papua New Guinea; good looking, comfortable in the spotlight, fluent in the language of markets and technology and “paradigm shifts”, while able to tell stories of his humble childhood in the Sepik. In 2007, he made news around the world when he shamed the Bush administration for blocking progress at the final plenary session of the Bali climate change summit. “If you’re not willing to lead,” said Conrad, addressing thousands of delegates, “then get out of the way.” The sight of tiny Papua New Guinea facing down the United States made him something of a hero at the negotiations. I first met Conrad around this time. It was during a week of tense, soporific talks in Bonn in the run-up to the disastrous Copenhagen summit of 2009, and he stuck out a mile. He was like a Hollywood actor playing the part of UN climate change negotiator. He talked about how the sea had risen to submerge a tree in Wewak, where he used to make out with his girlfriend, and boasted about how he and his allies – by this point Conrad was leading a group known as the Coalition for Rainforest Nations – were running circles around their enemies at the talks. “That’s because we actually know how to get something done,” he said. In the wreckage of Copenhagen, REDD was one of the few elements of the UN process to emerge with its momentum intact. In 2010, Norway and Indonesia signed the world’s first major REDD deal. It was worth $1bn. Back in Papua New Guinea, however, things had not gone exactly to plan. Since the first visits of white traders in the 19th century, and a fevered gold rush in the 1930s, the sheer difficulty of the country – its ravines, jungles, and history of cannibalism – has acted as a magnet to adventurers and unlikely schemes. It is as if the country’s somewhat virgin, somewhat violent quality is a guarantee that riches must lie there somewhere, and between 2008 and 2009 as many as 90 foreign “carbon developers” descended, determined to unlock the value waiting in its trees. The international publicity courted by Somare and Conrad created a demand that Papua New Guinea could not meet. An Office of Climate Change & Carbon Trade was set up and promptly overwhelmed by proposals for REDD schemes that it had no way to administer. The idea existed on paper, that was all. On flights to the capital, Port Moresby, Conrad would find himself surrounded. “I would have six or seven different groups come to me on the plane, pitching me,” he said. Out in the bush, encounters between the carbon developers and forest clans took on an ugly, exploitative aspect. Papua New Guinea’s constitution gives communities strong land rights, but around a third of the population is illiterate. Fanciful notions of the carbon craze caught on among many Papua New Guineans, who had no way to conceptualise the trading of a gas said to be stored in their trees. People talked of huge ships, with great bulbous tanks, lining up along the coast to suck the air from the forests inland. Markets started selling plastic bags, to go and collect carbon. Villagers spoke of “sky money” and worried that Papua New Guinea might run out of oxygen. In early 2009, the director of the new climate change department, a schoolfriend of Conrad’s named Theo Yasause, was suspended for allegedly printing his own carbon credits. He was later imprisoned for shooting a man outside a nightclub. “The mood got out of control,” Conrad admitted. Papua New Guinea was not the only place where early REDD experiments went wrong. In the Amazon, there were reports of “carbon cowboys” displacing communities from ancestral lands to make way for schemes being paid for by powerful corporations to offset their emissions. In southern Brazil, for example, villagers living next to the Guaraqueçaba Climate Action Project – an $18m scheme funded by General Motors, Chevron and American Electric Power – found themselves blocked from hunting, fishing or tending their forest gardens by local environmental police, known as the Green Force. NGOs and governments reported these horror stories to the UN climate talks. Forest campaigners accustomed to working with indigenous landowners were not surprised. When money and trees mix, it is normally local people who get screwed. To its critics, the early troubles of REDD illustrated two fundamental problems in its design. The first was that Conrad’s central insight was an abstraction. The idea that developing countries should be paid for the emissions that would have been caused if they had cut down their trees was a hypothetical. How do you measure, and price, something that did not happen? The concept was mind-bending enough in international meetings of forests experts, let alone in parts of the world with weak governments, disputed land tenure and uncertain notions of what is going on in their forests in the first place. When money and trees mix, it is normally local people who get screwed Second, and more profoundly, REDD came across as a distraction. It was something that sounded impressive, and would involve a huge amount of time, money and effort but it was, essentially, a glorified carbon offset scheme that would allow rich countries to continue to pollute, as long as they could afford to pay poor people not to cut down their trees. “Through REDD you can give the impression that not only are you solving deforestation, you are addressing climate change, without doing the difficult thing of actually leaving fossil fuels in the ground,” said Lang, the blogger. “If we don’t stop climate change, the forests are all going to burn down anyway.” In December 2010, REDD was rebranded as “REDD+”. It lost its earlier, single-minded focus on reducing emissions and carbon markets and was expanded take a more holistic view of the value of forests and the lives of the people who dwell in them. Activities that could now be funded under the programme came to include “non-carbon benefits” such as “opportunities for wealth creation and wellbeing”. Conrad found himself increasingly marginalised on the international stage. His earlier dynamism now read as high-handedness and arrogance. And while REDD+ retains his core idea of paying nations to preserve their trees, he resents its gradual diffusion over the years. “It’s all about getting everybody to hold hands in the forest and sing Kumbaya,” he told me. “It has been frustrating.” The carbon craze in Papua New Guinea damaged him too. In 2012, Conrad was fired as the country’s climate change ambassador. Since then, he has been representing Panama in the talks. At home on the Sepik, Frank Nolwo did not know about any of this. After the meeting in Wewak, he discussed selling carbon with the people of Kagiru, and then more broadly across his district. In 2011, the clans signed up, authorising Hooper, the Australian developer, to sell carbon credits on their behalf. After the chaos of a few years earlier, the government in Papua New Guinea had authorised five official pilot projects in the country, of which Hooper’s planned scheme in the Sepik – known as April Salumei – was the most advanced. With the inclusion of Nolwo’s district, the project came to cover an area of 6,000 square kilometres, an area larger than Norfolk. A scientist flew in from New Zealand to calculate the amount of carbon in the trees. At first Nolwo thought someone would arrive with containers and take the stuff away. But he soon learned it would just happen on a market somewhere. “I knew that when carbon was traded we would start to receive the money,” he told me. “My understanding was that it would take some time.” He began to wait, and hope. And that is more or less where the rest of the world has got to with REDD+: waiting, hoping, wondering if this bewitching idea can possibly work. Before I travelled to Papua New Guinea last month to see how the programme is unfolding in the land of its birth, David Nussbaum, the chief executive of WWF in the UK, reminded me of the promise that remains, glinting, in Conrad’s idea. “The prize is that we preserve an indefinite carbon sink, that we help mitigate climate change, that we help secure livelihoods that are constructive and positive for very large numbers of people,” he said. “There is an awful lot of people who stand to win if we can get this right.” On the other hand, there are such things as ideas that are impossible to realise, and they do not help anyone at all. I landed in Port Moresby at dawn on a Friday morning. There was a drift of smoke curling among the iron rooftops of a small settlement across the highway from the guesthouse where I was staying. There had been a fight the night before. A highlander had been shortchanged at the local market, and someone was stabbed with an umbrella. Things had escalated, and a few houses got burned down. I listened to this, a little stunned and jet-lagged, and found myself staring at a pair of hills rising in the distance. Port Moresby is a scatter of neighbourhoods, rather than a continuous city. Unfinished apartment blocks stand among bare, brown slopes. These are stripped clean of anything that might possibly resemble a tree. That’s because Papua New Guineans consume about 1.8 cubic metres of firewood a year – about the same as Europeans did, before we started burning coal. One of the easiest things to forget, living in a deforested nation, is that people cut down trees to improve their lives. “To convert millions of acres of wildwood into farmland was unquestionably the greatest achievement of any of our ancestors,” wrote Oliver Rackham in his history of the British countryside in 1986. And he was not talking about the Romans, or the Saxons or the Industrial Revolution. More than half of Britain’s original woodland, stumps and all, was probably gone by 500BC. Wild forests are magnificent, but they are also incompatible with lots of things that human societies like to do. In the 1990s, a Scottish geographer, Alexander Mather, coined the phrase “forest transition” to describe – roughly speaking – how nations cut down their trees, realise they have cut down their trees, and start, eventually, haltingly, to plant trees again. One of the easiest things to forget, living in a deforested nation, is that people cut down trees to improve their lives Papua New Guinea has not gone through its forest transition yet. According to the Center for International Forestry Research, it is probably at stage two, known as “frontier conditions”, where things really start to speed up. According to the government, some 15m of its 37m remaining hectares of forest are currently earmarked for timber production. But as of now, all is not lost. Recent satellite data shows that 80% of the country has trees growing on it. From the windows of a plane, the landscape looks, most of the time, as if it has had a chunky, woolly green rug thrown over it. On a good day, this is what makes the country appear to be the perfect test case for REDD+, and for the UN’s broader vision of “green economies”, in which developing countries manage to avoid the same fossil-fuel burning, tree-cutting path that the rest of us have followed. “If it is going to work anywhere it has to work in Papua New Guinea,” the UN’s resident coordinator, Roy Trivedy, told me. “Papua New Guinea is one of a very, very small number of countries in the world that has a really big choice to make about a development model that is different to the normal one.” The rest of us have a stake in that decision too, of course. If Papua New Guinea manages to save the largest rainforest in the Pacific, then the planet will benefit. But what sacrifices will it have to make along the way? Some 85% of Papua New Guineans still live in rural areas. Small-scale farming to feed a growing population is one of the major drivers of deforestation. The place is crying out for modern agriculture and decent roads. A big conceptual problem with REDD+ and “green economies” in general is imagining how, exactly, a country can ever become prosperous and industrious if it is constrained from clearing and draining its land. Even environmental activists struggle with this. “When I feel nationalistic, any opportunities to develop – [even] if it means chopping some trees down – you have to do it,” Thomas Paka, the chairman of the Eco-Forestry Forum, the country’s leading umbrella group for forest NGOs, told me. This historic trade off between deforestation and economic development is REDD+’s biggest obstacle. The international logging industry knows this, and its opposition to the programme has made it an unusual bedfellow – to put it mildly – with forest campaigners who also hate the scheme. Bob Tate, a wiry Australian, runs the Papua New Guinea Forest Industries Association, which represents the country’s Malaysian-controlled timber companies. He warned me about defamation when I turned on my tape recorder and then said: “Kevin Conrad is the biggest con spiv merchant this country has ever seen.” Tate described REDD+ as a “never ending donor project” that would prevent Papua New Guinea from ever realising its economic potential. “All you natives can get back in the bush and live in poverty and we’ll give you a bit of pocket money,” he said. “That is how the UN run it.” It is hard to exaggerate just how bad the reputation of the logging industry is in Papua New Guinea, and yet it still exercises the hopes of many isolated communities as the only way to obtain a road, a bridge, a school and a smattering of income from royalty payments. Indeed, a central reason why Stephen Hooper was able to launch his REDD+ project in the Sepik river in the first place – and the source of its avoided emissions – was that most of the communities had agreed to have the area logged in 1996. Talking to government officials in Papua New Guinea, I often sensed that they saw a hazy, undesirable connection between deforestation and progress. Logging is ugly, but at least it is real. And there are kickbacks all along the way. Late one afternoon, I ended up at the headquarters of Papua New Guinea’s forest authority, which has 800 officers, short on vehicles and petrol, to monitor the entire country. “Everyone hates the logging companies,” a senior official told me. “But what is the alternative?” He paused. “And besides, our ministers, they like Malaysians.” This is the development dilemma, more or less, for which Kevin Conrad dreamed up REDD. A decade later, he remains adamant that the only way it will ever work is if carbon schemes can actually put as much money in people’s pockets as raw logs. Well, how much carbon is out there in the trees? And what could it be possibly be worth? Early one morning, I flew to Madang, another town on the country’s northern coast, to find out. George Weiblen, a botanist from the University of Minnesota, met me at the airport. Weiblen, who is 46, has been studying Papua New Guinea’s trees since he first visited the country as an amazed and terrified graduate student in the early 1990s. He and his research partner, a Czech entomologist named Vojtech Novotny, were besieged by business offers during the carbon craze just over five years ago. They steered clear, and have largely stayed out of the sensitive politics of REDD+ ever since. But they happen to possess some of the most detailed data ever compiled about Papua New Guinea’s trees, including how much carbon they contain. In 2010, Weiblen and Novotny established a 50-hectare rainforest research plot about 100km west of Madang, as part of a network of international sites administered by the Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute in Panama. Over the next three years, researchers – mostly local villagers – proceeded to count, measure, and record the stem of every tree in the plot more than 1cm wide. They found a total of 288,204 stems and just over 500 tree species inside the 5km x 1km plot – around 10 times the number of tree species native to Britain. “The amount of data was sort of beyond my comprehension,” said Weiblen. Last month, Weiblen was driving out to inspect the site. Operating in Papua New Guinea means spending a lot of time, and money, worrying about life’s essential components: food, fuel, water, security. (Earlier this year, three men attacked Weiblen’s car with a home-made catapult). We ran errands in Madang for an hour or two, picking up rice, sunscreen and spicy food for camp. At one point we parked up at the town’s main betel nut market, the mild stimulant that is ubiquitous in Papua New Guinea, which was the location of a cholera outbreak a few years ago. I asked Weiblen if many students from Minnesota volunteered to come out and work on his projects. “The ones whose eyes light up,” he said, “I am particularly suspicious of.” The drive took us out to the west. It wasn’t long before we left the tarmac, and were on sand roads cut since the 1970s by logging companies as they have penetrated deeper and deeper into the forest frontier. Weiblen, a tall, bookish figure who has a habit of cackling suddenly, normally about some mishap or another, told me about a Polish graduate student who nearly fell out of a balloon in a crazy scheme to study the tops of trees. As we neared the research site, we entered an active logging concession and saw stacks of trunks of dull red kwila – Papua New Guinea’s most valuable tropical hardwood – lined up by the side of the road. “That’s the good stuff,” said Weiblen. The timber in a single mature kwila tree is worth around $10,000. We spent the night in Wanang, the nearest village to the research plot, and continued the journey on foot the following day. Dressed in shorts and the green singlet of one of Papua New Guinea’s rugby league teams, Weiblen walked fast among the roots and draped vines that hung down from the trees above. Since the summer, Papua New Guinea has been experiencing its worst El Niño drought since 1997, and Weiblen was taken aback by the lack of moisture in the air, and the sunlight piercing through the canopy. Dry leaves fell from the sky. “This is just weird,” he said. Every few minutes he would stop to point out one rainforest curiosity or another: the great buttressed trunks of 30-metre high mon trees, or the recent scar of a landslide, covered in a fresh bed of clematis. Huge butterflies floated by. Weiblen stepped over a stream. “We have the oddest leeches,” he said. “They basically feed on your eyes.” Huge butterflies floated by. “We have the oddest leeches. They basically feed on your eyes' Getting a snapshot of the amount of carbon in the trees, it turns out, is one of the simpler things to measure in a rainforest. All you really need is a respectable sample of tree trunk widths, taken at 130cm from the ground – a measurement known as DBH (diameter at breast height) in the forestry trade. Once you have the DBH, you enter it into an allometric equation, a formula devised by biologists to calculate the size of the rest of a living organism, along with the wood density of each species. In the case of kwila (Intsia bijuga), a mature tree with a girth of around 50cm will have what botanists call an “above ground living biomass” of just under two tonnes. Half of that is deemed to be carbon, which works out at one tonne per tree. Using the data from the research plot, Weiblen’s team came up with a figure of 105 tonnes of carbon per hectare in Papua New Guinea’s lowland rainforest, closely agreeing – to within 5 tonnes – with other studies. The complicated part, when it comes to REDD+, is extrapolating samples like this over larger areas and time. Research in Wanang has shown that the amount of carbon in the trees can vary from between 50 to 175 tonnes per hectare within the space of a few kilometres – creating an incentive for carbon developers to try and game the figures in their particular stretch of forest. Even less is known about how trees retain and release their carbon over the course of years and decades. Papua New Guinea’s rainforests, for example, are unstable. Because of earthquakes, floods and landslides, their trees have mortality rates twice as high as other parts of the world. While this may increase the biodiversity of the forests, it means that they also hold less carbon. Based on biomass studies, Papua New Guinea’s lowland rainforests might contain as little as half the carbon per hectare of their equivalents in Africa and Asia. Does that make them less valuable? Less worth saving? One morning, in the research plot with Weiblen, I got tangled up in these questions. On the one hand, the science of measuring the carbon content of trees appeared not very complicated at all. Laborious, but totally achievable. Around me, the trunk of every tree I could see was looped with aluminium wire, with a numbered dogtag hanging from it. On the other hand, monitoring and monetising the actual carbon cycle over time in these places – the fungi were breathing, the leaves were rotting, the trees were breathing, vines were photosynthesising, every conceivable surface was covered in ants, also breathing – seemed almost beyond reason. Because of the drought, the air tasted subtly of smoke. A thousand fires were burning in the forest, releasing untold tonnes of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. Would someone pay for that? I tried to interest Weiblen in these matters, but he looked at me, unblinking. “I don’t care,” he said. For people who work, live and research day to day in forests, the abstractions and ambitions of REDD+ can seem terribly remote. (Weiblen, for instance, is busy trying to get his research site formally protected by the provincial government and to raise funding for his next tree census). And that is a problem. How many years will it take to figure this stuff out? Trivedy, the UN resident coordinator, admitted that REDD+ was taking too long to bring to fruition in Papua New Guinea. “I think it’s fair to say there is growing impatience,” he said. Important things are happening: next year the country will begin its first ever national forest inventory. But it will be a decade or more, Trivedy predicted, before the country has a fully working REDD+ system. “The theory is right,” he insisted. “But we’ve got to try and get some quicker benefits to people so they can see, OK, that is the incentive, I’m going to choose to keep my trees.” One of the difficulties with REDD+ at the moment is convincing people to be patient, and to show faith. In the long run, the vision is that countries will achieve large, official nationwide emissions savings, and they will trade these, most likely on a massive government-to-government basis. In the meantime, however, entrepreneurs and communities who have set up REDD+ pilot projects in the last few years want to sell carbon credits now, on voluntary markets, and to wait for a global architecture to emerge. In Papua New Guinea any talk of individual schemes raises uneasy memories of the carbon craze. But that has not stopped one man, and one project from going ahead anyway. Stephen Hooper, the Australian carbon developer who established the Sepik river REDD+ project, which Frank Nolwo joined, sold his first carbon credits in 2013. The project, known as April Salumei, has been certified to avoid 23m tonnes of carbon emissions over the next 38 years. At $5 a tonne, the UN’s current notional price for REDD+ transactions, that could work out at $115m. So far, Hooper has sold around 200,000 tonnes to companies voluntarily offsetting their emissions and received about $300,000 in return. Under his “benefit sharing” agreement with the landowners, Hooper’s company receives 30% of that, while 60% goes to the community and 10% to the national government. The first thing the landowners wanted were boats. Hooper bought five. The next thing the district chairmen asked for was 20,000 Papua New Guinea kina each (about £4,500) to spend on health and education projects in their communities. That disappeared without trace. “We’re not perfect,” Hooper told me. On a recent Tuesday evening, Hooper was back at the In Wewak Boutique hotel giving out mobile phones. The latest sales of the carbon credits from the Sepik have been to Qantas, Australia National Bank and Rema 1000, a supermarket chain in Norway. Hooper wanted people in the five districts involved in the project to take pictures of their daily lives, which he could then share with their customers. “Maybe someone finds a big snake?” Hooper prompted. The chairmen nodded and looked at their phones. Nolwo was not there. He was out in his district, preparing to welcome Hooper and the rest of the chairmen the following day, when one of his villages was due to receive a shipment of solar lights paid for by the project. Hooper has been pretty much ever present alongside REDD+ in Papua New Guinea. At first he came for the money. By 2010, he had remortgaged his family house outside Perth, sold his car, boat, and the last stock options in Quest Minerals, the mining company he used to run. “It was probably around that time that I realised there was no pot of gold,” he said. Since then, Hooper has become a vaguely controversial figure in Papua New Guinea, simply for refusing to give up. When I was there, Hooper seemed to be everywhere, lobbying ministers, cajoling officials, trying to get a target of 2m hectares for REDD+ projects into the country’s paperwork for the Paris summit. That evening in Wewak, when we sat down for dinner, I asked one of the five chairmen of the April Salumei project, Philip Wablasu, to explain carbon trading to me and he smiled confidentially. “Steve knows,” he said. The next morning, in the dark, we set off for Binomo, Nolwo’s district. We reached the river at noon and boarded two of the project’s new speedboats. The water in the Sepik was low, because of the drought, and the air – as everywhere – was blurred with the haze of distant fires. “Carbon dioxide,” said Nelson Garabi, one of the chairmen. The solar lights were being delivered to Igai, one of the villages in Binomo which, like all the rest, had no electricity. When we arrived, Nolwo was standing in front of a makeshift arch, fashioned from a palm leaf, next to a handwritten sign that said: “Welcome! Welcome! To the land of ‘untouchable virgin forest’ the land of fresh oxygen (O2) the purifier of green house gases” (sic). A sing-sing – a ceremonial celebration – was under way. The men and women of Igai wore feathers, and had bright turquoise and yellow dots painted on their faces. Nolwo led the procession up to the centre of Igai, away from the river. According to Papua New Guinean custom, the men gathered in the main village hall, known as a haus, while women, children and teenagers stood or sat on the ground. After five years of hearing about carbon trading, this was the first time that many of them had seen anything arrive as a result. There were speeches. “The forest is your home,” exhorted Anton Pakawi, a former schoolteacher who handles the day-to-day administration of the project. “The forest is your sister. The forest is your brother.” Nolwo said a few words, but spent most of the time looking quietly amazed. “I just sit where I am and the money comes,” he said. “It is kind of like a miracle thing happening.” Then it was time to turn on the lights. The first four went up in the village church, a skeletal structure that was more of a suggestion than a building. The idea was that children would be able to use the lights to do homework by night for the first time in Igai’s history. It was still early afternoon, though, and at first there was nothing to see. People drifted away. A man climbed a tree to bring down coconuts. But then darkness came, as it does in Papua New Guinea, with the speed and confidence of something quite permanent. And on the hill, out of the alchemy of the money and the trees, four lights shone, hard against the night.

"Climate change presents a serious threat to nutrition and food security.  Earlier this year, the World Food Programme made bleak predictions underlining the connection between the two issues. With climate change increasing the risk and intensity of climate disasters such as floods and drought, unless huge efforts are made to increase climate resilience, the risk of hunger and malnutrition could increase by 20% by 2050.   It is also a two-way relationship. An estimated 25% of the world’s greenhouse gases are produced from global food systems, of which half comes from food production and the other from transportation, packaging, processing and land use for agriculture.

"Two-thirds of the world’s population are expected to be city-dwellers in 2050, compared with half in 2008. But while cities have many economic and social advantages, they can damage residents’ health if the right infrastructure is not in place. “You have to get water and food in, sewage and waste out,” says Dr Harry Rutter, senior clinical research fellow at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine. Cities such as London have built this infrastructure over centuries, but those expanding now have to do so in much less time, and often with little money: more than 90% of urbanisation between now and 2050 will take place in low and middle-income countries, according to the World Health Organisation. Alex Ross, director of the WHO Centre for Human Development in Kobe, Japan, says the number of slum dwellers is projected to double from 1 billion to 2 billion by 2050. “That presents a huge set of issues,” he says, including poor access to water supplies, sanitation and good-quality shelter.  Growing slums and the high levels of inequality they encapsulate can also make cities more prone to violence. In Latin and Central America, violence is a major urban health risk, with Caracas in Venezuela, Guatemala City, Belize City and Tegucigalpa, Honduras seeing more than one murder for every 1,000 citizens each year. Climate change is likely to have a major impact on cities, particularly coastal ones. A World Bank report in 2013 put Guangzhou in China, Miami, New York and New Orleans in the US and Mumbai in India as the cities at greatest risk in terms of cost of damage. It estimated that global flood damage costs for large coastal cities could reach $1trn (£650bn) a year without adaptation. Rutter says climate change will go beyond flooding, with other impacts including other severe weather, reduced water supplies, damage to crops and fisheries, changes to patterns of disease and increased migration. “It will have different effects depending on topography, climate and resilience,” he says. City residents suffer from the local effects of burning fuel as well as the global ones, with 90% of people in urban areas breathing air that is not safe for their health, with impacts including premature births, chronic bronchitis, lung cancer and heart disease. South Asian cities suffer the worst problems, with Delhi, Patna, Gwalior and Raipur in India and Karachi in Pakistan having the highest levels of PM2.5 particulates caused by vehicle emissions, forest fires and metal processing. As well as deaths and injuries from accidents, vehicles also contribute to city dwellers taking too little exercise. This and poor diets are leading to increased obesity in cities around the world, including in Mexico and the US. “Feeding large concentrations of people healthy, decent food provides a challenge,” says Rutter, as it needs to be brought in from rural areas. Meanwhile, unhealthy food tends is better-suited to cities: “It has a long shelf life and is less likely to spoil.”  Cities can damage their inhabitants’ health, but they can be changed to help improve it. José Gabriel Siri, research fellow in urban health at the UN University International Institute for Global Health, says urban air pollution issues are not new: “London in the 1950s had the same kinds of problem. We know how to deal with them.” Parliament passed the Clean Air Act in 1956, and Britain has continued to use legislation to improve urban air quality, more recently with London’s congestion charge and low emission zone banning heavy diesel vehicles. Other cities have imposed bans on all motorised vehicles, not just heavily-polluting ones. Since 1974, the Ciclovía programme in Bogota in Colombia has restricted 76 miles of streets to cyclists, pedestrians and skaters for part of every Sunday and public holiday, an idea that has been adopted by other cities. “It’s been shown to have health benefits,” says Amit Prasad, technical officer for urban health at the WHO’s Centre for Human Development. Oslo in Norway is planning to go further and ban all private cars from the city centre by 2019. Since 2007, Paris has run its Vélib’ public bicycle-hire scheme, after earlier ones in smaller French cities including Rennes and Lyon, again an idea that has been copied around the globe. “It shows cities can take action to reduce pollution,” says Prasad, with the useful side-effect of improving participants’ health. Cities with strong political powers are using similar combinations of regulation and promotion to tackle smoking, which is growing in much of the developing world. Dr Jo Ivey Boufford, president of the New York Academy of Medicine, says the city has cut rates of smoking, which is responsible for one in three of its preventable deaths, from 21.7% in 2002 to 15.5% in 2012. During this period, former mayor Michael Bloomberg repeatedly increased taxes on cigarettes, doubling the price of a pack to an average of $11.20 in 2013. The city also banned smoking from workplaces, public parks and beaches (pdf) and provided smokers with help to stop. New York City has also promoted better food choices, through its Green Cart programme offering 1,000 permits to mobile fruit and vegetable sellers in areas lacking access to fresh food. Bloomberg’s attempt to ban large helpings of sweetened fizzy drinks was overturned by a court, but the former mayor helped Mexico introduce a “soda tax” on such drinks in January 2014.  Other cities are working to support their elderly residents, whose numbers will grow greatly over the next few decades, particularly in developed countries. Alex Ross points to Age-Friendly Manchester, a programme started in 2003, and Yokohama’s FutureCity project, which includes support for a “super-ageing society”. José Gabriel Siri mentions Toronto’s work in setting up shared social spaces for assisted living schemes and a huge outdoor escalator in Medellín in Colombia – the latter opening access to Comuna Trece, a steep slum – as innovative ways to help older people. Siri adds that cities will need to work harder to tackle isolation and mental health issues, both among older people and residents such as migrants who have moved away from their friends and families. A long-established part of the urban environment – the park – can be part of the cure: “There is evidence that green space in cities contributes to better outcomes,” he says. Mentioning Vienna in Austria, which is more than 50% green space, he adds that such areas also provide places for physical exercise, help reduce air pollution and cool the city’s microclimate. It is an example of how urban health can be improved through the planning of cities: “We need to think of health beyond the health sector. We need to think about design and decision-making.”  Join our network to read more pieces like this. And follow us on Twitter (@GdnHealthcare) to keep up with the latest healthcare news and views.

"Businesses can add another item to their corporate bucket lists: taking the lead in tackling climate change where governments have fallen short. In a survey of sustainability experts released Thursday, 90% of respondents said that companies would need to play as big of a role as national governments in combating climate change to prevent environmental disaster.  The 2015 Climate Survey, by research consultancy GlobeScan and thinktank SustainAbility, asked 624 sustainability experts from 69 countries about their expectations ahead of the United Nations’ Climate Change Conference (COP21) taking place in Paris in December.  “Businesses are expected to lead on climate because they are seen to be able to deliver results,” said Eric Whan, sustainability director at GlobeScan. “Traditional institutions like governments and multilaterals have failed to do so, and more and more, experts are calling for collaborative solutions.”  The survey reflected a lack of confidence in governments’ abilities to devise effective solutions to complex problems.  While more than 90% of respondents said they expected COP21 would result in a global agreement, only a third believed it would have binding powers to implement any substantive changes on a wide scale.  Moreover, only 4% of respondents expected the agreement would be sufficient to contain global warming below 2C (36F), which is the temperature level that scientists and world leaders have agreed will help to avoid environmental catastrophes like super droughts and volcanic eruptions.  Respondents also revealed the businesses they saw as leaders in the fight to curb climate change, with 20% picking Unilever as the company that’s achieved the most real, substantial advances. The survey lauded the consumer goods company – which has committed to achieving zero net deforestation by 2020 – for its Sustainable Living campaign, the “bold statements and actions” made by its CEO, and its commitment to published targets.  Electric car manufacturer Tesla came in second, while Swedish furniture maker Ikea, technology giant Google and consumer appliances conglomerate General Electric tied for third place. Walmart, Toyota, Siemens, Apple and solar-energy installer SolarCity rounded out the leaders list.  The survey results represent a notable shift from the last climate survey ranking, which was conducted in 2009 ahead of the UN climate change conference in Copenhagen. Back then, oil and gas giants Shell and BP made the list, during a time when large industrial companies were applauded for their commitments to reducing pollution and waste.  Their more recent performances haven’t lived up to expectations, most starkly illustrated by several high profile environmental disasters such as the BP Deepwater Horizon oil spill in 2010, which led to a drop in public sentiment for petroleum companies.  Large consumer and technology companies have since pulled ahead with ambitious sustainability agendas that extend across their value chains.  “The fossil fuel sector is widely seen as having failed to shift its business model to address climate change concerns and recently suffered huge losses to its reputation,” said Aiste Brackley, research manager at SustainAbility. “The new leaders such as Unilever, Tesla and Ikea are setting a high bar for corporate leadership.”  Only three companies – General Electric, Walmart and Toyota – that were included in the 2009 ranking made it onto this year’s list. For companies that want to boost their reputations, reducing their carbon emissions, increasing their use of renewable energy like solar and hydropower, and clamping down on deforestation are the best ways to act on climate change and prove their commitment to combating it, Brackley said.  • This article was amended on 12 November 2015. An earlier version referred to Ikea as Swiss, rather than Swedish."

"The UK’s new energy policy, sketched out on Wednesday by Amber Rudd, will keep the lights on. That’s the good news. But it makes meeting the UK’s carbon emissions targets harder and will cost energy bill payers more.  This is the result of the many contradictions it contains. Energy bills must be “as low as possible”, Rudd says, but the government is turning its back on the cheapest clean options: energy efficiency, onshore wind and solar power. Coal must be phased out but only to be replaced by gas, another fossil fuel which itself must be largely phased out within 15 years. All energy technologies must compete in a market - unless it is nuclear power. No one could say energy policy was easy and it’s a relief to have a plan at all. Uncertainty is kryptonite to investors, and without new power plants, a dark future awaits. Since May, the UK’s energy policy has consisted solely of a concerted attack on renewable energy and green measures and huge subsidies for a new nuclear power station at Hinkley Point. The headline today is that the UK plans to close all coal power stations by 2025. The UK is the first major economy to set such a deadline and should be applauded. Politically, it is well timed to bolster the UK’s position at the crunch UN climate change talks in Paris in December, which was being undermined by moves against renewables.  But while coal provides 25% of the UK’s electricity today, it was already set to fall to almost nothing by 2025. Rudd’s announcement also contained a worrying caveat: “Let me be clear, we’ll only proceed if we’re confident that the shift to new gas can be achieved.” The new dash for gas reprises the push from chancellor George Osborne in 2012, which the industry almost completely ignored. Just one gas plant is being built, at Carrington (no relation). A subsidy called the capacity mechanism - payment for guaranteeing supply - was meant to entice gas plants. Instead, dirty coal and diesel generators cashed in.  So, despite Rudd’s repeated insistence that competition is vital, she is set to rig future capacity auctions for gas: “After this year’s auction we will take stock and ensure it delivers the gas we need.” Gas is half as polluting as coal and some call it a “bridge fuel” to the zero emissions world which is needed to halt climate change. But Rudd’s policy is a bridge with no exit in sight. What is to stop gas plants operating for years after 2030, when UK electricity must be virtually carbon-free to meet climate targets? Not carbon capture and storage, if the single fleeting mention of CCS in Rudd’s speed is any guide.  The billions of pounds in subsidies for the North Sea - the UK is the only G7 nation increasing fossil fuel subsidies - and strong backing for fracking suggests the dash for gas could become a marathon. The UK is not on track for its EU targets of 15% of renewable energy by 2020 and 50% carbon cuts by 2025, but Rudd insists the government is committed to meeting them. “Paris must deliver a clear signal that the future is low carbon,” she said. US president Barack Obama, also speaking on Wednesday, agreed but talked of going “all-in on renewable energy technologies”. For renewables, Rudd said, competition is key: “We need to work towards a market where success is driven by your ability to compete in a market, not by your ability to lobby government.”  I asked her if the same applied to nuclear power? “We must be frank that nuclear provides the essential baseload that allows us to back renewables. At the moment renewables can’t be relied on, they are intermittent, and we need to have an absolutely secure supply of electricity for homes and businesses.” That is, in my view, a long way of saying no. Rudd said energy security “has to be the number one priority” and, despite nuclear power’s faultless track record of rising costs and long delays, she is convinced it is both vital and viable: “We don’t just want one nuclear power station, we want more and would expect those costs to come down.” Rudd also said: “Our intervention has to be limited to where we can really make a difference – where the technology has the potential to scale up and to compete in a global market without subsidy.” But again this doesn’t apply to nuclear power, which has never been built without subsidy despite half a century of trying, but to offshore wind power. Here, there was good news. Offshore wind is currently expensive but its cost has fallen by 20% in two years. By 2020, there will be 10GW of wind farms around the UK coast, providing about 10% of all electricity. Rudd said the government would support a further 10GW to be built if costs comes down further, to equal that given to new nuclear (£92.50/MWh). Renewables have to compete with nuclear, if not vice versa. There were also positive moves on making a smart grid a reality, including changing regulations that restrict people from being offered cheaper power at off-peak times, which cuts overall demand. But perhaps the most worrying aspect of the new energy policy is its apparent abandonment of the cheapest energy measure of all - efficiency. From 2010 to 2015, 4.5m homes benefited from government-backed energy efficiency measures and therefore lower bills. Rudd’s commitment for 2015-20 is 1.2m, almost 80% lower. Worse, unlike low-carbon heating, there was no promise of future announcements. There is another way, a system dominated by renewables and efficiency, and Rudd herself set it out: “Some argue we should adapt our traditional model dominated by large power stations and go for a new, decentralised, flexible approach. Locally-generated energy supported by storage, interconnection and demand response, offers the possibility of a radically different model.” Then she said: “It is not necessarily the job of government to choose one of these models.” But by backing nuclear at any price and a dash for gas, she has already chosen. Just days before the Paris climate summit aims to accelerate towards the clean energy system of the next century, the UK is harking back to the energy system of the last."

"A compromise struck by the United States, Japan and several other major nations will restrict export financing to build coal power plants overseas, but not eliminate it completely. The agreement reached on Tuesday is an important step forward that sends a strong political message ahead of upcoming international climate change negotiations in Paris, an American official and environmentalists said. Japan and the United States were long at odds on this issue.   The Obama administration announced in 2013 that it would end US financing for overseas coal power plants, and has been pressuring others to join. Japan was among those opposed to the move, arguing that its high-efficiency power plant technology is the best option for developing countries that need affordable energy.  Under the agreement, which takes effect in 2017, financing would still be allowed for the most advanced “ultra-supercritical” plants, and for some other plants in the very poorest countries. It was worked out by members of the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development, a Paris-based group of 34 countries including most of Europe and other key economies.  “It’s been a very hard-fought compromise,” a senior Obama administration official told reporters on a conference call. “We regard it as a major step forward coming just less than two weeks before the start of the (climate talks) in Paris on 30 November.”  A Japan-based network of groups involved in fighting climate change welcomed the agreement, but said it was only a first step. “Even the highest-efficiency coal power plants emit a lot of CO2,” said Kimiko Hirata, the international director of the Kiko Network. Kiko means climate in Japanese."

"Since the late 1970s humanity has been on a self-constructed economic treadmill. We have believed that our economies must grow because we think this is progress. If the economic motor slows, economists, politicians and business leaders tell us, the consequences will be dire. Jobs will be lost and factories forced to close. Inequalities will widen further. Investment will slow and house prices will fall. The 2008 financial crisis saw countries adopt extreme measures to keep the economic wheels turning, for example by reducing interest rates to record lows, pumping billions into the system through quantitative easing in the US, Japan, the UK and the euro-area, and striking trade deals to open markets further. These are not just western phenomena, as China injecting billions to fuel consumption and protect stock market investors demonstrates.    None of this is wise. Growth needs natural resources, the extraction, processing and burning of which creates the pollution that causes climate change. The more we grow, the more this cycle of production, pollution and warming spins ever faster. This is why CO2 emissions are at record levels. To get off this treadmill, there are six hurdles we must overcome. Rather than underpinning our economies, much of what the finance sector does ends up serving the needs of big-money. A successful transition to a fairer economic system requires us to shrink the finance sector. Among many changes, this means breaking up big banks, ensuring only governments can create credit and gradually unwinding the casino  that investment banking has become through initiatives such as a Tobin – or financial transaction – tax, which adds a small cost to each financial transaction, putting an end to the majority of flash trading. We can also protect normal banks by separating them from investment banks. Given time and care, all this is possible. The second big barrier to a better economic world is the wave of robotisation that is predicted to make millions of us unemployed. Carl Benedikt Frey and Michael Osborne’s paper on the future of employment shows that 47% of US jobs are at risk of redundancy in the next 20 years. Such automation has the potential to unleash calls for even faster growth.    The rise in unemployment which will be caused by the wave of robotisation can also be overcome. For example, by restricting trade through tariffs (such as taxes on imported goods) and non-tariff barriers (such as setting standards that make it impossible for foreign firms to compete), countries determined to protect jobs are able to compete against those aiming to produce at a lower cost using machines. This may seem like madness to those who have been schooled to believe that free trade is good. But in many countries, and for years, governments have frequently protected jobs at the expense of true free trade. Today Japanese rice farmers are protected, as are many US farmers. China protects sections of its economy too. In many business sectors – for example online shopping, coffee shops, steel production, the auto industry – only a handful of firms dominate. They have become adept at evading their social responsibilities, for example by not paying taxes where revenues are earned, or by hiring people on zero-hours contracts as interns or as consultants to avoid paying social security costs, pensions and healthcare.  Fixing this requires international coordination. Government influence on corporate boards needs to rise, as does unionisation; tax evasion has to end and monopolies need to be broken up.  The fourth hurdle is more difficult to clamber over. It is the notion, held by so many, that economic growth is good. It is the idea that individual freedom is paramount, that open markets are good, and that small government is essential.  These ideas are toxic. What we need are fulfilled individuals, managed markets, sufficient trade and effective government. That will all take time, perhaps a generation, for most people to understand. We need to change the way we teach economics so people learn that the neoliberal free market system is only one of many systems. We need to open a debate in society about what economic growth is for and about how externalities are being dumped on the environment, the sick, the poor and future generations.  We also need organisations such as political parties, NGOs and faith groups to extend a discussion about the point of our existence so that people see the damage and divisions we are creating in thinking that economic growth is a useful goal. This is already happening at a grassroots level, with projects such as the New Economy Coalition, the Donella Meadows Institute, the Transition Network and the Mondragon Corporation. Solving the problem of climate change is vital if we are to get off the growth treadmill. We need to stop global temperatures rising and this means a huge transition away from a carbon-based economy. Only then can we avoid the 2C increase in average global temperatures. The transition is technically possible but time is very tight.  Finally, we need to find a way to transform global food production while the population continues to rise. This problem can be resolved, not with GM crops, land clearance and bigger industrial farms but with smallholders using land sustainably according to local needs, as well as a reduction in global meat consumption and food waste.  These are not idle dreams. Without radical change much of humanity faces decades of decline because the hunt for more growth can only mean that today’s social, environmental and climate change problems will worsen. To get off the treadmill requires a wholly different way of thinking. It also requires a different sort of politics and a new sort of politician, because our challenges are the result of political failure. Climate change, inequality and today’s migration problems illustrate how ineffective our political systems have become. It is such systems that need to change first.  "

"One of the most complex problems of man-made climate change is what our activities are doing to the clouds and rainfall. Certain generalities apply – the warmer it gets, for example, the more energy and moisture there are in the atmosphere and the weather gets more violent. Another factor is pollution. Traffic, factories and forest fires pump vast quantities of particles into the sky that would otherwise not be there. Around these particles droplets of water form, become clouds and eventually rain falls.  This combination helps to explain why rain in Britain comes down in heavier bursts than it used to, increasing the incidence of flash flooding. More hard surfaces feed water to drains built for Victorian drizzle. But what is actually going on in the clouds? Where do the tiny particles that become the raindrops come from and what does that mean for the weather in Britain and elsewhere? Attempting to answer these questions, scientists are flying through clouds in a plane based at Cranfield University in Bedfordshire. It is packed with four tons of sophisticated scientific instruments. Travelling at 100 metres per second, the scientists collect air samples and get instant readings. In some clouds there is a cocktail of car exhausts, factory emissions, forest fire particles and natural aerosols that all act as condensation nuclei, meaning that somewhere below is soon going to get very wet. In the short term, the data can help to warn the Met Office that a serious rainstorm is on the way, but in the longer term it tells us what we are doing to our climate."
"Most of Britain’s major cities will be run entirely on green energy by 2050, after the leaders of more than 50 Labour-run councils made pledges to eradicate carbon emissions in their areas. In a highly significant move, council leaders in Edinburgh, Manchester, Newcastle, Liverpool, Leeds, Nottingham, Glasgow and many others signed up to the promise ahead of the crucial international climate talks that will take place next month in Paris. Labour said this would cut the UK’s carbon footprint by 10%.   The pledge, coordinated by Lisa Nandy, the shadow energy and climate change secretary, will mean green transport, an end to gas heating and a programme of mass insulation of homes in cities across the UK. The move will also pile pressure on the London mayoral candidates to make a similar pledge for the capital, with some Labour-led London boroughs, including Southwark, Lambeth and Greenwich, having already signed the promise. Ahead of the crucial Paris talks, similar pledges have been made by the leaders of other towns and cities around the world, including Copenhagen, New York, Sydney, Malmö and Munich. Hillary Clinton, the US Democratic presidential candidate, has also backed 100% clean energy as a goal, saying: “We should do nothing that interferes with or undermines efforts to reach that goal as soon as it is possible.” Nandy said the move showed the impact that Labour could have locally when it comes to green energy, at a time when the government has slashed subsidies for renewable energy sources such as solar and onshore wind. “Where Labour is in power we will push for a clean energy boom even if the government will not,” she said. “Ministers say they support devolution to our towns and cities so they should back these council leaders by ending their attack on the schemes that can help to make this safer, cleaner future a reality.” Sir Richard Leese, the leader of Manchester city council, said the transition would happen “through acts of leadership by the many, not the few”.  “We are taking action to show a completely clean energy future is both viable and within reach within the course of a generation,” he said. The pledge says: “We have the ambition of making all our towns and cities across the UK 100% clean before 2050, in line with the commitments made nationally and internationally at the Paris summit. “We hope other towns and cities across the globe will join us to demonstrate that this transition will happen through acts of leadership by the many, not the few, and that a transition to a clean energy future is both viable and already beginning to happen in many towns and cities today. Our UK towns and cities are committed to making a better future for all.” It comes after Ed Miliband, the former Labour leader, called on the UK to become the first country in the world to enshrine in law a target of reducing carbon emissions to zero. Miliband, who was energy secretary under Gordon Brown, said Britain should show leadership and send a clear signal to businesses by building on its existing target of cutting emissions by 80% by 2050 under the Climate Change Act."
"The EU has warned the Obama administration that a global climate deal at the Paris summit must be legally binding, after the US secretary of state John Kerry said that it “definitively” would not be a treaty.  “The Paris agreement must be an international legally binding agreement,” a spokeswoman for the EU’s climate commissioner, Miguel Arias Cañete, told the Guardian. “The title of the agreement is yet to be decided but it will not affect its legally binding form.”    Earlier today, the French foreign minister, Laurent Fabius, had said it was obvious that any agreement in Paris would contain lawful elements, and suggested that Kerry was “confused” about the point.  Kerry told the Financial Times on Wednesday that any agreement in Paris, where world leaders meet in three weeks’ time, is “definitively not going to be a treaty” and there were “not going to be legally binding reduction targets like Kyoto”, in a reference to the world’s only previous binding climate treaty.  But the nature of the agreement’s elements is being fiercely contested in talks that officials publicly say have reached a very sensitive point. Privately, they say that countries are keeping their powder dry for the frantic last days of negotiations in which a pact is expected to be thrashed out.   “The political-level talks in Paris start on 7 December so we still have some time to sort this out,” Cañete’s spokeswoman said. “What still needs to be negotiated is what provisions within the Paris agreement would be legally binding.”   The EU would like to see a five-yearly multilateral review process or “facilitative regime” that can enforce emissions commitments, with the threat of withholding climate aid being used as a stick against developing countries that renege on their promises.   Whether the deal will be formalised as a treaty or protocol, however, remains up in the air. The Kyoto protocol was criticised by states such as the US, which withdrew from it under the George W Bush presidency, arguing that it exempted developing countries and would damage the US economy.   While keen to clinch a deal in Paris, the Obama administration is worried that a Republican-dominated US Senate could demand a deciding say over any treaty with legally binding obligations.   Some influential countries seem willing to extend Obama the benefit of the doubt. “We don’t need a treaty in Paris,” the Moroccan environment minister Hakima el Haite told a UN climate conference in Rabat last month. “We need a universal agreement in which everyone agrees and commits – and is engaged to respect commitments and contributions. That is what we are working for.”   Bob Ward, the policy director at the Grantham Research Institute on Climate Change and the Environment said that the Paris agreement was always intended as a complement to emissions pledges, rather than a body of statute.  “John Kerry, the US secretary of state, has simply restated what has been understood for a long time,” he said. “It was agreed at the United Nations climate change summit in Durban in 2011 that countries would seek a new and universal greenhouse gas reduction protocol, legal instrument or other outcome with legal force. The Paris agreement will fulfil this.”  But it remains unclear what sanctions could be imposed against developed countries that flout their obligations, or how the review process would ramp up inadequate climate pledges. Countries putting forward their climate plans in recent days include Bosnia, which anticipates a 70% increase in emissions by 2030 compared to 2010 levels, and oil-rich Saudi Arabia."

"There is huge variation in fuel efficiency between transatlantic airlines, with British Airways and Lufthansa emitting 51% more carbon dioxide than the cleanest flyers, according to a report by the organisation that revealed the VW test-rigging scandal. Pollution from a non-stop transatlantic round trip averages around one tonne of CO2 per passenger, the International Council on Clean Transportation (ICCT) research found – the same as would be clocked up in a year by commuting 22 miles to work daily in a Toyota Prius.  Separately, a leaked European parliament study seen by the Guardian has forecast that the aviation and shipping industries will make up 39% of global CO2 emissions by 2050, based on present trends.  The ICCT report said a typical passenger on Norwegian Air Shuttle travelled 40km per litre of fuel, while flyers on British Airways and Lufthansa travelled only 27km. Dan Rutherford, an author of the report, said: “Eighty per cent of the difference can be explained by two factors: seating configurations – how much premium, business and first-class seating you have – and the fuel burn of an aircraft, or how efficient it is. Norwegian Air Shuttle has invested more in newer, more fuel-efficient planes, while BA is using older, predominantly 747 aircraft.” First-class and business passengers accounted for a disproportionate amount of the pollution. Premium passengers were responsible for 14% of available seat kilometres flown on transatlantic routes, but they accounted for around one-third of total carbon emissions, the paper found. Other poor performers in the study included United Airlines, Virgin Atlantic and American Airlines, who scored barely above BA and Lufthansa. At the other end of the table, Air Berlin, KLM and Aer Lingus averaged 36km per litre of fuel. Rutherford said the results, which will be filed with the International Civil Aviation Organisation (Icao), showed a deterioration from last year’s rankings, which revealed a 25% difference between best and worst performers. “There is a large and underestimated potential for in-sector CO2 emission reductions,” the report states. “This highlights the role for additional policies to limit aviation emissions, notably the CO2 standard being developed by the Icao and a global market-based measure to price aviation carbon.” International airlines and shipping companies are not currently obliged to cut their CO2 output. An attempt to include aviation in the EU’s emissions trading system was defeated two years ago. Icao says it will try for carbon neutral growth after 2020, but expects no new policies before an assembly in November 2016. The projections in the leaked European parliament study suggest that aviation and shipping will continue to increase their share of global emissions. It predicts that by 2050 aviation will account for 22% of the total, and shipping 17%.  “Clearly this would derail the efforts in Paris to stay within two degrees’ warming,” said Sotiris Raptis, a shipping policy officer at Transport & Environment. “Any deal in Paris must lead to an emissions reduction target for aviation and shipping, like all other sectors of the global economy.” Airline emissions are currently responsible for an estimated 5% of global warming, and the shipping industry around half that, and both figures are growing fast. Globally, aircraft emitted about 700m metric tonnes of CO2 in 2013, and without policy intervention that figure is expected to triple by 2050.  The issue will be discussed at the Paris climate summit, after an attempt to remove it from the draft text was blocked. "

"Science, ethics and economics are intersecting to form a clear market signal: in the lead-up to the COP21 climate talks, responsible investors should divest from fossil fuels (Report, 13 November). At a time when the fossil fuel industry should be shifting its businesses to focus on renewable energy, it is doing the opposite, doubling down on coal, oil and gas. Capital continues to flow into the exploration and future extraction of dirty energy. Long-term investment decisions must take into account the externalities of a business model at odds with physical realities. In the lead-up to the COP21 climate talks, the financial community has a vital role to play in the transition to a new energy economy – one where fossil fuels must be left in the ground. From a fiduciary perspective, there are a number of indicators that fossil fuel investments contain significant levels of risk. The energy sector steadily shifted from high-return, low-cost conventional projects, to high-cost, capital-intensive, complex projects. Meanwhile, clean, carbon-free energy is rapidly becoming cost-competitive with dirty energy.  Within the investor community, the early adopters have already begun a substantial movement to divest from fossil fuels, a movement representing $2.6tn in assets under management. The world’s largest institutional investors, including the Norwegian Sovereign Wealth and Rockefeller Brothers funds, have all expressed their concern for carbon-related investment risk and are adjusting their portfolios accordingly by moving out of fossil fuel holdings. Divestment also models the kind of commitments we are expecting to be taken from governments. We call on national governments to take effective commitments to end all form of subsidies to fossil fuels at the forthcoming G20.Thomas PikettyParis School of EconomicsTim JacksonUniversity of Surrey • Join the debate – email guardian.letters@theguardian.com"
"The UK is reversing its policies on climate change “without offering credible alternatives”, according to an alliance of Britain’s doctors, nurses and other health professionals. Writing in the British Medical Journal (BMJ), they say that natural disasters, food and water insecurity, the spread of infectious diseases and forced migration “are already affecting human health and provide a glimpse of the near future”.  But they say that while globally there is progress on tackling climate change – with countries committing to curbing their emissions, religious leaders, such as the Pope, urging action and organisations committing to divesting from fossil fuels – the UK is bucking the positive trend. Since being elected in May, the Conservative government has cut energy efficiency policies, closed or cut subsidy schemes for wind and solar power, and put a carbon tax on carbon-free renewable energy. The alliance behind the article – published less than a fortnight before international climate talks in Paris – represent the trade body for UK doctors and medical students, the British Medical Association, plus eight Royal Colleges, the BMJ itself and leading health journal The Lancet.    They call for the UK government to end the use of unabated coal by 2023 to “improve air quality, protect the health of our population, and reclaim the UK’s leadership position in tackling climate change”. Dr Robin Stott, co-author and co-chair of the Climate and Health Council, welcomed the government’s commitment to end the use of coal within 10 years, announced by energy and climate change secretary Amber Rudd on Wednesday.  “We’re delighted about the coal – it’s extremely useful to have coal removed from the source of power generation – but you have to contextualise it and for the government to reduce subsidies on renewables at the same time as having enormous subsidies for nuclear and pretty substantial subsides for other fossil fuels is completely crazy in my opinion.” The article reads: “Substantial commitments to reduce carbon emissions from the US and China, Europe, and a host of high income countries form the basis of negotiations. Ten global cities representing 58 million people have drawn up ambitious plans to tackle climate change...  “Religious leaders, notably the Pope and the Dalai Lama, have called for urgent action, and the divestment movement has pledges from 400 organisations to move ... from fossil fuels to low carbon investment. The United Kingdom is bucking these positive trends, reversing and undoing many of its policies and programmes without offering credible alternatives.” Stott added that the new alliance, UK Health Professionals Alliance to Combat Climate Change, represented “the first time significant numbers of senior health professionals in colleges representing large numbers of their members have come together to engage on climate change”. The organisation aims to take action on air pollution, transport, nutrition and the environmental footprint of the UK healthcare industry. A spokesperson from the Department of Energy and Climate Change said: “Britain is fully committed to taking coal off the energy mix. We will be launching a consultation in the spring on when to close all unabated coal-fired power stations. “We want a strong global deal in Paris and believe that the shift to a clean economy will bring benefits to populations in health and well-being, and security from averting the worst impacts of climate change.”"
"  The Labour mayoral candidate, Sadiq Khan, has pledged to put London on course to be run entirely on clean energy by 2050 if he is elected next May, amid criticism that the capital is falling behind its emissions targets.   The promise puts the capital on an equal footing with promises made in Britain’s other major cities, after the leaders of 50 Labour-run councils – including those in Edinburgh, Manchester, Newcastle, Liverpool, Leeds, Nottingham and Glasgow – also made a 100% clean energy pledge on Monday.  Khan was speaking at the Royal Institute of British Architects in London on Monday at the launch of the 100% London campaign, based on a report by the thinktank IPPR, which shows that the capital is behind schedule to meet its carbon reduction targets while other cities around the world are “racing ahead”.  The Conservative candidate, Zac Goldsmith, who has become known for taking a stand on green issues, did not attend the event or publicly make the pledge but said he “welcomed” the campaign.  Khan said: “Yes to 100% London. If it’s good enough for Sydney and Copenhagen and New York, why not London? We’ve fallen behind in our 2025 target … I want to be the greenest mayor London’s ever had.” The Green party candidate, Sian Berry, committed to the 100% target while Liberal Democrat Caroline Pidgeon said she welcomed the campaign.  Goldsmith said: “100% London is 100% necessary. I welcome the 100% London campaign and will look closely at IPPR’s zero carbon plan to see what we need to do to make sure that we in London take on the challenge of climate change.” The report by IPPR argues that City Hall is not on course to meet its target to reduce carbon emissions by 60% by 2025 from 1990 levels. In order to do so, it says, the mayor must put London on course to produce a quarter of its own energy within 10 years, create 1.4m extra jobs in public transport and retrofit 1m homes per term in office with energy efficiency measures such as insulation. Even more ambitious action is needed if the capital is to reach a 100% renewable energy target by 2050, said Jimmy Aldridge, senior research fellow at IPPR. “London has some good low-carbon programmes and targets in place, but momentum has dropped off”, Aldridge said. “Delivery is far lower than the UK average. If the UK is to meet its national climate objectives then the capital must start leading by example.  “The next mayor should draw on the spirit that delivered the first tube network, Bazalgette’s sewerage systemand the hugely successful 2012 Olympics by setting the city on a path to 100% clean energy by 2050 … if any city can rise to the challenge, it’s London.” The report comes one week before the doors of crunch UN climate change talks open in Paris, where leaders from more than 190 countries will meet to thrash out a new deal on reducing greenhouse gas emissions post-2020. Pledges by countries to reduce their emissions would currently take the world well beyond the “safe” target agreed at previous climate change talks, but research suggests that actions taken at the local level could significantly help to make up the difference.

"“Do you believe in infrastructure?” asks Norman Foster, with challenge in his voice. He does. Infrastructure, he says, is about “investing not to solve the problems of today but to anticipate the issues of future generations”. He cites his hero, Joseph Bazalgette, who, in solving Victorian London’s sewage problems, “thought holistically to integrate drains with below-ground public transportation and above-ground civic virtue”. Foster is delighted that Britain now has an infrastructure commission, chaired by Andrew Adonis, which he says gives the opportunity to plan in 30-year cycles and remove the politics from infrastructure. He will expound these views this week at the Urban Age 10th anniversary Global Debates, Urban Age being the LSE’s Deutsche Bank-sponsored series of conferences in which high-powered and highly powerful people travel the world exchanging views on city building.  Statistics spin out of him about sustainability. “If you take the carbon footprint of London, that’s one seventh of that of Atlanta, so there’s a relationship between density and emissions. The whole climate change issue, which many would argue is about the survival of the species, comes down to urbanism. “When I was in Harvard recently, I said that each of us in this room, the energy that we consume in one year would equal the energy consumed by two Japanese, 13 Chinese, 31 Indians and 370 Ethiopians. So you start to take the relationship between energy consumed by a society and infant mortality, life expectancy, sexual freedom, academic freedom, freedom from violence. So those societies that consume more energy have more of those desirable qualities, so all those issues are inseparable from the nature of the infrastructure.” The connections between these points are not always clear, but the argument seems to be that better use of energy through better infrastructure will enable more people to live better. Of his own work, Foster says that many of the most important projects are not what are normally considered buildings, but things such as the Millennium Bridge, the pedestrianisation of Trafalgar Square in London, the Millau viaduct in southern France and the remaking of the Marseille waterfront. More statistics: “Millau cut out five-hour traffic jams, which meant that the saving in CO2 from the 10% of traffic that is heavy good vehicles had an effect equivalent to a forest of 40,000 trees.” He has campaigned vigorously for the Thames Hub, a new airport in the Thames estuary with an associated network of huge ambition: an orbital railway around London, a flood barrier, tidal energy generation. He is profoundly disappointed that his plan is likely to be rejected in favour of an expanded Heathrow: “The reality of a hub airport is that you can never ever do that at Heathrow. If you do that at Heathrow now you can absolutely guarantee that we will still be pedalling furiously to stand still. You can never accommodate long-term needs there.” But given what he just said about sustainability, should we be expanding airports at all? “Do you eat meat?” he asks scathingly. “You’re probably going to have your hamburger in spite of the fact that you’re going to make a much greater impact than any travel.” Air travel, he says, “compares well statistically with the amount of methane produced by cows and the amount of energy and water needed to produce a hamburger”. “The reality is that all society is embedded in mobility. You’re going to take that flight. You’d be better to take the flight out of an airport that is driven by tidal power and which uses natural light, and which anticipates the day when air travel will be more sustainable.” He talks of solar-powered flight and planes made of lightweight composite materials. It could also be asked what is the role of the architect in what is generally the province of engineers, planners and politicians. Around us is evidence of his practice’s apparent potency – towers in China and India, a model of the giant circle, one mile in circumference, which will be Apple’s new headquarters, images of a concept for habitats on Mars – but Foster says: “I have no power as an architect, none whatsoever. I can’t even go on to a building site and tell people what to do.” Advocacy, he says, is the only power an architect ever has. To write about Foster presents a particular challenge to an architecture critic. The scale of his achievement is immense and he has created many outstanding buildings. A wise man recently pointed out that if Foster had only built his 20 or 30 best works, critical admiration would be virtually unqualified. It is largely because his practice has designed many more projects than this that he sometimes gets a bad press. But would it really have been better if he had confined himself to a boutique practice in order to preserve his architectural purity? It can seem peevish and petty to question his work, but it is not beyond criticism. In particular, it can become weaker the more it makes contact with realities outside itself. If you look upwards in the Great Court he designed in the British Museum, you will see an impressive structure of steel and glass, but at your own level it becomes bland and sometimes clumsy. The Gherkin is a memorable presence on the London skyline, but awkward at pavement level. The Millennium Bridge, even with the modifications necessary to stop it wobbling, is confident and elegant except at its landing, where the overhang of its cantilever creates spaces that are plain nasty. In the context of infrastructure, the question is also whether it adapts to the political, social and physical conditions that surround it. In answer to Foster’s question, yes, I do believe in infrastructure. Or, rather, I’d compare it to water: essential to existence, life-enhancing and sometimes beautiful, but with the power to damage and destroy if misused. All this makes a new drone-port project in Rwanda one of Foster and Partners’ most intriguing. Conceived with Jonathan Ledgard, the director of Afrotech, who describes himself as a thinker on the future of Africa, it is a plan to create a network of cargo drones that can bring medical supplies and blood, plus spare parts, electronics and e-commerce, to hard-to-access parts of Africa. The drones have ports – shelters where they can safely land and unload, but which also serve as “a health clinic, a digital fabrication shop, a post and courier room, and an e-commerce trading hub, allowing it to become part of local community life”. Because of their inaccessible locations, they have to be built using materials close to hand, so techniques have been developed for efficiently making local earth into bricks and stones into foundations. It is impossible at this point and at this distance to know if the drone-port project will achieve what it hopes, but its ambition to adapt to local conditions seems absolutely to the point. The interesting question is then how to bring the same thinking to infrastructure in a developed country, such as Britain. What is the right infrastructure for the society and culture of this country, at this point? Has it changed since Foster’s Victorian heroes, such as Bazalgette, did their work? Can we import the large-scale thinking of modern China and, if so, with what modification? These are good questions for an architect to address.

"Within minutes of meeting the mayor of Europe’s self-proclaimed greenest city, it is clear where he draws much of his inspiration from.  It’s not just the fact that 61-year-old Bo Frank is wearing a black Beatles T-shirt and has a Beatles badge pinned to the lapel of his jacket. When he shows me into his office on the ground floor of Växjö city hall, Fab Four memorabilia is everywhere you look – along with photos of Sweden’s king and queen, Barack Obama, and a black-and-white sketch of himself with long hair and a flowered shirt from when he was first elected to Växjö (pronounced Veck-Ruh) city council 41 years ago.  The flowing locks are long gone, but Frank has lost none of his Beatles-era idealism as he steers this small southern Swedish city (population 89,000) to becoming fossil-fuel free by 2030 – a target the council, led by Frank, agreed as long ago as 1991, becoming the first city in the world to do so. Frank signs off his emails with the final lyric from The End on 1969’s Abbey Road: “The love you take is equal to the love you make” – and the line also appears on some of the council’s green bumpf. “Each citizen must contribute,” he says by way of explanation. “You can’t just blame others and expect them to do something. You have to start with yourself: the way you purchase, the way you live, the way you drive, the way you use transport, heat and electricity. Demand is very important to making change.” And the change so far has been impressive. CO2 emissions per resident were 2.4 tonnes last year, among the lowest in Europe – a 48% drop from when city started measuring its emissions in 1993. And it has done so without sacrificing growth: between 1993 and 2012, GDP per capita increased by 90%. A BBC documentary in 2007 labelled Växjö the “greenest city in Europe”, and the city has clearly worked hard to live up to the accolade – although there is no official way to compare cities’ “greenness”. The Danish capital, Copenhagen, with CO2 emissions of 2.8 tonnes per resident, is now aiming to steal a march on Växjö and become fossil-fuel free by 2025 – but for the moment is further behind in its energy transition. Frank puts his city’s success down to the fact that in Sweden, income tax revenues go directly to municipal councils which have huge discretion over how they are spent – and the eight political parties, which span the political spectrum, have over the years been united about the green agenda. “We don’t even debate it at a local level. You could say there are eight green parties.” When it comes to heat and electricity, Växjö is close to being fossil-fuel free already. The city lies in the middle of pine forests and lakes in southern Sweden, and waste wood from the forests provides 90% of its heat and a quarter of its electricity via a giant combined cooling, heat and power plant. The rest of Växjö’s electricity comes from locally produced small hydro, wind, biogas and solar plus imports from Sweden’s grid, which is mostly powered by hydro and nuclear. Touring the city-owned power plant, Veab, with Åsa Karlsson Björkmarker, Växjö’s youthful deputy mayor, a local variation on another Beatles lyric comes to mind as we watch giant articulated lorries tip out their dual payloads of woodchip: “Isn’t it good, Swedish wood?” It’s been a mild autumn in Sweden, but in winter, when temperatures plumb -10C (14F), three of these lorries will be needed an hour to keep Växjö warm, explains Marianne Mattila, Veab’s customer service manager. But unlike biomass power units in the UK, such as at Drax, which get wood from as far off as Canada, in Växjö, lorries come from within a 80-100 km radius of the city. I have always had niggling doubts about the sustainability of biomass – shouldn’t trees be left to absorb CO2, rather than releasing it when chopped down and burned for energy? Mattila explains that Veab uses only the branches and tops of the trees that are sent to local paper mills or to Ikea to be turned into furniture (nearby Älmhult is the birthplace and headquarters of the retail giant). Otherwise that biomass might be left to rot, generating methane, a much more potent greenhouse gas than CO2, says Mattila. Instead, ash from burnt wood is returned to the forest to fertilise the soil. Jan Johansson, Växjö’s energy manager, who has joined us on the tour, says the economics also stack up: “One of the advantages is biomass is a much cheaper fuel than fossil fuels.” Wood is also clean-burning, with no sulfur dioxide emissions and minimal particulate matter, he says. And Veab, which this year commissioned a new boiler, expects to see its nitrous oxide emissions drop to zero as well. As in most Scandinavian cities, the system of centrally generated heating is highly energy-efficient, delivered to Växjö’s homes and businesses through 400 km of underground pipes. When selling land to developers, the city stipulates that they hook up to the district heating system – only last week, it won a crucial victory when the courts turned down a challenge by the Swedish Competition Authority, which had argued that it was uncompetitive to lock 500 house buyers of a new development into one energy supplier. Later, over dinner at a cosy organic food restaurant, Björkmarker explains the importance of the city winning this battle. Växjö is growing fast, adding 1,100 people a year and providing temporary accommodation for hundreds of asylum-seekers from the likes of Syria and Afghanistan. Expanding the district heating network to meet any new demand is critical to meeting its climate targets: “There is no other heating alternative that can ever, ever compete [for low CO2 emissions].” The expanding population is also impeding the city’s struggle to rein in transport emissions, the biggest challenge by far to its fossil-fuel free ambition. Of the 2.4 tonnes of CO2 Växjö’s residents emitted in 2014, more than two tonnes was on transport. Björkmarker explains that the city is spread over a 30km area, and attracts workers who live as far as an hour’s drive away. All municipal buses run on biogas from its food waste, but the city’s focus is on increasing the uptake of cycling by expanding its already extensive cycle routes, pedestrianising streets, cutting down on vehicle use, and promoting electric bicycles and electric cars. Driving me around in one of the city’s green-fuel fleet the next day, Frank returns to Veab to show me the electric car refuelling station, powered by the biomass plant, where taxi driver Lars Göranson is filling up his newly delivered Tesla. “I am so proud of this because it is locally produced, environmental energy,” Frank says. Next stop is a city-run nursery school in a new suburb called Vikaholm, where most buildings are made entirely of wood and many to passive house standards – so energy-efficient that their occupants’ body heat is enough to keep them warm, even in the depths of a Swedish winter. The nursery school is where Växjö begins grooming its green citizens of the future. From the age of one, they learn how to sort their waste, teacher Lena Rydell says, and how to value nature during frequent outings in the nearby forest. It is lunchtime, and as Frank shows me the weekly menu, he explains that 40% of all food in city-run institutions such as nurseries and the hospital is organic, and vegetarian at least once a week. “I’m hoping to introduce meat-free Mondays,” he adds. “Paul McCartney said if all slaughterhouses had glass walls then everyone would be vegetarian.” I’m not sure that the pint-sized patrons of Vikaholm nursery are with him on this point. Every Wednesday the children get to vote for their own meals and they are tucking into pasta and meat sauce, their favourite. Chef Nathalie Johansson says vegetarian options are mainly Quorn-based, masquerading as chicken. There are other hints of resistance to Växjö’s centrally planned green revolution during my 24 hours in the city. One young resident of a passive house apartment grumbles about having to open windows to cool it down at times: “We have a thermostat but it doesn’t seem to matter what I put it on.”  But in general, Frank believes Växjö’s residents are proud of their city’s green reputation, and is planning to promote it further at next month’s UN climate conference in Paris with the launch of the “Växjö Declaration”, which will call on all European local authorities to become fossil-fuel free. Växjö was a founding member of the Covenant of Mayors, a group of 6,612 European cities that have pledged to go further than the EU on climate protection. Frank has fond memories of the Beatles era and the radicalism of the 1970s – but he is even more excited about the coming environmental battle, which he believes cities must lead. “During the 70s I was so pessimistic. I didn’t even feel there was life after 1984 [George Orwell’s dystopic book],” he says. “But I am quite optimistic today. We have the knowledge of what to do and we have the techniques to do it. It’s all about politicians being brave enough to take decisions – and mayors are doing a better job than national governments on climate protection, because they are closer to the people.”  This article was updated on 28 November because the town of Älmhult is not, in fact, the A in Ikea.

"In the week after European and African leaders met in Malta to discuss the impact of the migration and refugee crisis, it is worth underlining the fundamental importance of long-term development to alleviate such crises and make them less likely to recur. In September, world leaders agreed on new sustainable development goals that aim for a future of peace, prosperity and dignity for all. The new global development agenda sets out how, working together, we can realise citizens’ aspirations, protect their wellbeing and preserve our planet. Poverty eradication and significant reduction of inequality are among the top goals of our common agenda.  Two months on, the prospect of achieving these goals is under threat. Proposals are being made by some major development partners in northern Europe to cut their aid budgets and to use development assistance spent in the poorest parts of the world to cover costs related to receiving refugees at home. This is in accordance with rules set at a time when costs connected to refugees were negligible, but doing it at scale is unwise. The impact of such moves can be devastating. Disasters, conflict and climate change are serious threats to human life and our planet. Over the past two decades, we have made huge progress in reducing poverty and are on track to eradicate extreme poverty by 2030, but success is still elusive. Aid plays a vital role in helping the most vulnerable countries and people manage and mitigate the risks and impacts of shocks, and in taking the steps necessary to provide a life of dignity for all.  In the poorest countries, especially in Africa, development assistance is essential for supporting health, education, and the creation of livelihoods – without which human development and an end to poverty cannot be achieved. Aid supports poor countries’ own plans and paths to development. Tax and private investment are crucial, but cannot replace aid. Without funding, peoples’ hopes for development are imperiled. It is indeed a cruel irony that just as the hard work begins to implement the historic SDGs, the resources needed for that work are under threat. We understand that the refugee crisis in Europe is having a profound effect on many of international development’s strongest and most stalwart partners, nations which have been in the forefront of supporting a UN-led global order and in fighting poverty. Some of these nations are proposing to reduce aid or to divert funding from Africa and from the UN to provide support for the desperate people arriving at their borders. The consequences would be dire for international development cooperation – and, on current proposals, for the UN development system, too.  Caring for refugees and asylum seekers in Europe should not weaken support for international development cooperation; on the contrary, it underlines the urgency for alleviating poverty. The crisis can never be resolved if international development cooperation erodes. Indeed, crises are likely to worsen if humanitarian and development support is inadequate in countries mired in conflict and in their neighbours, who, in the case of the Syrian crisis, are hosting many more refugees than the numbers currently entering Europe. While the arrival of large numbers of refugees undoubtedly requires more funding to be allocated to meet their needs, the longstanding partnerships between traditional donors and developing countries, multilateral partners, and civil society must be nurtured if poverty eradication and sustainable development overall are to be achieved.  Multilateral development and humanitarian actors and the donor community must continue to work closely together, and that work must be adequately resourced. We must aim to meet the collective promise of the sustainable development goals: to leave no one behind.  • Helen Clark is chair of the UN Development Group (UNDG) and UN Development Programme administrator.

"Developing countries will have to pay $270bn extra each year to adapt to the impacts of climate change if global pledges to cut greenhouse gas emissions do not increase, according to a new report by Oxfam.  Plans submitted by more than 170 countries ahead of crunch UN climate change talks in Paris next week are likely to lead global temperatures to rise by 2.7-3C above pre-industrial times.  According to the aid agency’s report, it would cost developing countries $790bn every year to adapt to this scenario, 50% more than the $520bn it would cost them to adapt to a 2C world, the target for avoiding catastrophic climate change agreed at previous UN conferences.  If these adaptation costs are not met, in a 3C world the economies of developing countries are likely to shrink by $1.7tn every year, equivalent to 1.3% of their GDP, the report says.  Tim Gore, Oxfam’s head of food and climate policy, told the Guardian that developing countries are “stuck between a rock and a hard place” unless pledges become more ambitious.  Although the pledges, known as Intended Nationally Determined Contributions,, have already been submitted to the UN, many parties including the US, China and the EU want to see a review mechanism built into any deal at Paris to increase the pledges in the future. Gore said: “[Paris] is not our one single shot at solving the climate crisis. We need to make sure there is a strong requirement for countries to revisit and strengthen their emissions cuts urgently and periodically – or we’re locking in a 3C world.” At Copenhagen climate summit six years ago, developing countries were promised $100bn a year to help mitigate climate change and adapt to its consequences. Around two-thirds of this money has already been paid.  But last year just 16% of the climate aid money was used to help the world’s poorest countries adapt to impacts such as flooding, drought and other severe weather events.  Instead most climate finance already processed has been spent on preventative measures – such as investments in renewable energy – to help rein in climate change.  Oxfam estimates that if the total sum given for adaptation to date was divided among all small-holder farmers in developing countries, each individual would receive $3, equivalent to the price of a cup of coffee."

"If you drive north from the Somaliland village of Gargara – where women speak of their heartache at losing goats in this year’s drought – and ford the fractured beds of dry rivers, passing the sun-bleached bones of dead animals, you eventually arrive in Lughaya, where open-mouthed fish lie on the white sands by the Red Sea after a wave “like a mountain” smashed into the coast this month. This is what a changing climate looks like.   Somaliland, which broke away from Somalia in 1991 but is not recognised internationally, could be considered the canary in the mine of a world that is getting hotter, and where extreme weather is becoming more common. Across this relatively peaceful corner of the Horn of Africa, where black-headed sheep scamper among the thorn bushes, dainty gerenuk balance on their hind legs to nibble from hardy shrubs, and skinny camels wearing rough-hewn bells lumber over rocky slopes, people long accustomed to a harsh environment find they cannot cope after years of below-average rainfall. These pastoralists, who trek across rock and sand with their herds each day, have a vital stake in the UN climate talks taking place in Paris, which begin next week. For them, the changing climate is an immediate life-or-death challenge that has pushed their already tenuous existence to the very edge. Droughts are common in this region of Africa, and famines not unknown – the last major famine to hit was in 2011. But Mohamed Ali Ismail, a 70-year-old from the village of Bildhaaley, about three hours’ drive on bumpy tracks from the capital, Hargeisa, says things are steadily getting worse. “I have lived here all my life. We were wealthy, and had lots of livestock. There were wild fruits on the trees, thick forests, good livestock and wild animals. We were not worrying about our life. But things got harder because the rain has failed, or is less frequent … In my 70 years, I have never seen an ostrich die without water, never seen a deer die without water, so when I see these wild animals dying, unlike at any time before, I don’t see the climate getting better … It is a critical situation.” Ali Ismail does not know what to tell young villagers who wonder what the future holds. “That’s the most crucial question. They become mature and they say, ‘We cannot live’ … They don’t know what to do so they cross the sea to seek a better life in Europe. We don’t have an answer.” The drought is just one part of the climate puzzle in Somaliland. In Lughaya, Hassan Barre Gas raises his hand to the sky as he describes the wave that crashed into his home on 5 November. This was the tail end of Cyclone Chapala, which battered nearby Yemen, killing 11 people on the island of Socotra. Yemen was hit by another cyclone just days later: the UN spoke of  “unprecedented back-to-back tropical cyclones”.  On Somaliland’s coast, the first wave came at 8pm, and a second at 2am. Around 100 homes were destroyed, mostly in villages east of Lughaya. Many people lost their livestock, utensils, blankets and clothes, and the government sent rice, sugar and plastic sheeting to those in need.  “We heard a huge noise, and when we came out of our houses, we saw the sea rising up like mountains. Then as we were looking, it came to us,” says Barre Gas, 65, speaking through a translator. “I’ve never seen the sea reach the size of hills or mountains. The house is gone. The camels, sheep and goats ran away. My two fishing nets are gone,” he says.  Barre Gas, his three wives and 12 children are also victims of the drought. The grey-bearded pastoralist had 200 head of livestock three years ago; now he has just 30 animals. “Our livestock couldn’t move and were very thin. We were feeding the animals paper and cardboard, anything they could eat. The camels and small shoats [sheep and goats] sat close to the sea to feel cool … this is the first time I have experienced this rising sea, and the drought being so continuous, and the rains being so poor.” More than 240,000 people do not have enough food in Somaliland because of this acute drought caused by poor Gu rains (the region’s main rainy season) from April to June this year, and in 2014. Save the Children, which takes water to vulnerable people, provides chlorination, and builds wells and berkads, or reservoirs, says malnutrition rates – especially for children under five – are alarming and likely to increase. This region has also been hit by the El Niño phenomenon, which is expected to last until early 2016. The UN has said that food insecurity will worsen, with the number of people needing aid rising to around 32 million by early next year. Ethiopia is particularly vulnerable, while floods in southern Somalia have displaced tens of thousands.  According to the ND-Gain Country Index, which summarises a country’s vulnerability to climate change and its readiness to improve resilience, Somalia is among the world’s most vulnerable nations. Ibrahim Osman, Save the Children’s emergency officer, who is from Somaliland, recalls the horror of July, when desperate pastoralists – who make up around 55% of the population – trekked through the thorn-studded sand with their herds, seeking water and pasture. “Because of the drought, there has been no rain coming down from the mountains to the coastal areas … [In recent weeks] rain has come but it’s not that much. The people know how the rain should be and they say it was not as good as had been expected.” Outside the village of Kalawleh, the remains of a donkey and several goats lie together, not far from the borehole that supplies water – a cream tower that acted as a magnet for water-starved pastoralists from as far away as the border with Djibouti.  “We buried thousands [of animals] just two weeks ago,” Osman says, pointing to fresh mounds in the sand. Experts say that between 35-40% of livestock have died – a devastating loss in a country where livestock account for around 40% of gross domestic product and around 80% of foreign earnings. “If you had seen the people – they could not even walk 20 metres without sitting down. It was a disaster,” says Osman. He recalls the day he received a call from Ali Ismail, the elder from Bildhaaley. “I was drinking water when he called and said, ‘I am dying.’ I wanted to do something. That night I didn’t sleep. My children have adequate water for showering and playing. It was painful,” said Osman.  Ali Ismail was among more than 19,000 people who received water since May from Save the Children – one of the many organisations in the action/2015 coalition campaigning for a deal at the Paris talks. “When we were calling, we were crying,” Ali Ismail says, sitting on a low stone under a tree in Bildhaaley. “We were looking for any organisation to help us,” he said, pointing to a nearby mound that he said was the grave of a man who died at that time, after becoming dehydrated while herding his sheep.  Some rain fell a few weeks ago but the crisis is not over because the animals are still thin and underfed. “The problem is you cannot slaughter to eat, you cannot get enough milk, and you cannot send the animals to market,” he said. He had 500 to 600 sheep, goats and camels before the drought began but now he has just 100.  In the village of Cabdi Geedi, Annab Ahmed Mohumed talks of how worried she was for her seven children during the drought. Her herd of 40 has now been whittled down to just four goats. “I used to feed my children rice. I was worried when I couldn’t buy rice. They miss meat, butter and milk. They got weaker and stopped playing. I used to feed them a few times a day, then I only fed them once,” she said. As she talks, her two-year-old daughter clings to her skirt, while Ibrahim, five, sits on a low stool, carefully writing out his name with a green pencil in a dog-eared copy book.  “When they would say, ‘Mother, why can’t we eat?’, I used to say, ‘It’s because of the drought. I cannot feed you. God will feed you,’” she says. She had to take four of her children out of school because she could not pay the fees.  Hawa Ahmed Yoonis, 40, moved to the village of Gargara five years ago because it had water and her village did not. Her elderly husband is sick, and curled up on a thin mattress on the dirt floor of a dark hut. Yoonis once had 250 goats and sheep and 10 camels. She now has 10 goats. Three of her children have gone to Djibouti. She has not heard from them since. “I am no longer thinking of being a pastoralist. Livestock are not useful. They die, so there is no point,” she says, rubbing her hands together. “I feel so much sadness and sorrow for how my life turned out. I was hoping it would be better.”"

"At the end of the month, world governments will convene at the UN COP21 conference in Paris for the next round of binding emission commitments aimed at restricting global warming to no more than two degrees by the end of the century. When it comes to agreeing potentially tougher targets, both policymakers and members of the public will now be armed with the COP21 climate change calculator, developed by the Climate-KIC, the EU’s main climate innovation research centre, in collaboration with Imperial College, London and FT.com.   Using data on the emission reduction pledges made to date and scientific forecasts on future warming, it aims to inform the public and policymakers on the impact a variety of choices by individual countries would have on overall global warming. Users can track the progress of current pledges until 2030 and then see what other action is needed by sliding countries’ individual emissions up and down to see the overall impact on the two degree target.  The project was led by Jeremy Woods, co-director of the Centre for Energy Policy and Technology at Imperial College London, which also developed the Global Calculator from open data made available by the International Energy Agency and the Department of Energy and Climate Change. It allows users to change emissions from different contributors, such as transport and land use, to see how changes in behaviour, across the globe could impact climate change. “The calculators shows that it’s still possible to hit two degrees warming but the big take out is [that] though it’s not too late, we need some major commitments from the biggest emitters, they’ve got to lead the way,” he says. “The beauty of the open data and scientific forecasts we’ve put in to the calculators is it empowers people to have a go for themselves and see how individual changes can add up to make an overall change. It means the policymakers and the public can be well informed with free, simple-to-use tools.” At the European Environment Agency the emphasis is on taking the data on pollution levels EU countries must supply to the Copenhagen-based organisation and combining them with other sources of open data, such as population statistics, held by Eurostat. This information can be cross-referenced with freely available satellite imagery which shows land use and soil conditions. This end result are fascinating maps where multiple layers of data can be added or taken away by any member of the public, as well as policymakers, to answer all manner of environmental enquiries. Typical areas of investigation include the level of soil permeability, which is useful for flood risk evaluation, to temperature variations in cities which could lead to health issues, as Birgit Georgi, EEA project manager, explains. “We don’t make decisions or predictions, we put the data in the hands of the public and policymakers,” she says. “We have maps which show where the surface can absorb less water and also where there is likely to be a scarcity of water, both now and predicted in the future. We are also working on showing how urbanisation can mean towns and cities have so much built up areas without green spaces to let them cool down. “Our maps show the cities which are 10 degrees warmer than the surrounding rural areas at night. It’s important because in 2003 there was a heatwave across Europe which was linked to thousands of premature deaths. When cities can’t cool down at night, citizens’ bodies don’t have a chance to rest and it risks the health of vulnerable people.” The EEA also produces pollution maps which track, in near real time, levels of ozone, sulphur dioxide, carbon monoxide and nitrous oxide in addition to any airborne particles that are smaller than 10 micrometres in size. According to Alberto González Ortiz, project manager for air quality data and policy assessment, the maps can show citizens, as well as policymakers, where areas change colour to reveal levels at which governments are legally obliged to take remedial action. “Most of the EU countries provide near real time information so we can show the latest situation for each pollutant with a sliding scale for the past week, so you can see how levels have built up or gone down,” he says.  “Nitrous oxide is a very important one because it comes from traffic pollution and there are levels, which we show, that member states can only exceed for 18 hours in a year or, at the top level, they are obliged to take immediate action. The information we are supplied from monitoring stations was undoubtedly part of the decision for Paris to recently ban cars from the city for a day and to make public transport free. The authorities would have had the data internally but we make it publicly available for free.” The good news for open data and the environmentally-minded is that over the next couple of years the European Space Agency’s ongoing Copernicus project will make imagery from a new family of six earth observation satellites freely available. Two are already launched and four more are expected to follow by 2021. They will allow more detailed research with imagery updated far quicker than ever before as gaps between satellite “footprints” get smaller, according to Karin Viergever, an analyst specialising in land use at environmental software company Ecometrica, which provides environmental services for governments, NGOs and corporates.  She predicts that ESA’s commitment to open data, which follows in the footsteps of NASA’s imagery having been free for many years, will greatly increase our understanding of the links between land use and the environment with the bonus of also providing data on marine conditions. In the meantime, when the global governments meet in Paris at the end of the month, they will find that not only are they better informed on climate change than ever before, so too are citizens, thanks to researchers combining multiple streams of open data and making them freely available and available to explore online by an ever-curious public.

"While Europe is on high alert against another murderous terrorist attack, it will be hard for Paris to look beyond the next 24 hours. But soon delegates start arriving in the French capital for preliminary meetings ahead of COP21, the United Nations climate change summit which will be launched on 30 November with all the grandeur attendant on a gathering of global leaders. There is a certain symmetry to the two events that goes beyond the nightmare task facing France’s overstretched security forces. As the UK foreign secretary Philip Hammond pointed out in an important speech in the US only days before the Paris attacks last Friday: “Unchecked climate change … could have catastrophic consequences – a rise in global temperatures … leading in turn to rising sea levels and huge movements of people fuelling conflict and instability.” There are reasons to be optimistic about a useful outcome from these negotiations, not least the determination of President Barack Obama’s team to deliver a deal with some kind of legal force. But any deal will mark the start rather than the end of the process.  The world has learned from previous failures. The innovation of asking every country for its own intended nationally determined contributions in advance of COP21 is that they reduce the wriggle room, at least for the time being. Wednesday’sbig speech from the UK energy secretary Amber Rudd, setting a cut-off date of 2025 for coal-fired power stations, will underline that sense of commitment and should help to build some momentum ahead of the talks, even though it is only a small advance on the policies she inherited. It is also a necessary reaffirmation of the Conservatives’ pledge to green the electricity supply which had begun to seem questionable after its widely criticised decision to end subsidies to wind and solar power unexpectedly early. Ms Rudd said she was resetting UK energy policy and if she didn’t quite do that, she did make a more or less coherent pattern from the fragments that have emerged since the election in May. It is a plan. Yet with its contradictions and conditional undertakings, it did not quite add up to a clear path through the so-called energy trilemma: the balance to be struck between security, sustainability and affordability. Take the commitment to phase out coal over the next 10 years: it came with the caveat that it would not happen unless there was a clear and reliable alternative. Given the continuing uncertainty over new nuclear (which, in the Rudd plan, is what stands between decarbonisation of electricity supply and the lights going off), that means new gas-fired power stations – less dirty than coal, but still a finite fossil fuel. The plan will also entail exploiting shale gas, which is so far entirely untested in the UK and already politically neuralgic. And if gas is to be the core of energy supply beyond 2030, when electricity is supposed to become carbon free, then serious money needs to go into developing carbon capture and storage. CCS merited just one mention in Ms Rudd’s speech. As for the decision to phase out subsidies for renewables, it was defended as part of a necessary move towards making green energy competitive with other fuels, even though that is something nuclear power will not be for the foreseeable future. However, there was a little good news for renewables: there will be subsidy for new offshore wind, when it can compete with the cost of new nuclear. The bad news is that although off-shore generation costs have fallen by a fifth in two years, there is still a distance to travel. Decarbonising power supply is proving hard enough. But it poses a lesser challenge than weaning the nation off its gas-fired heating, and luring it out of its diesel- and petrol-powered cars. That puts the greatest burden of reducing carbon emissions on electricity generation. The cheapest way to get there, the way that would make most difference to consumers and shrink their energy bills by the greatest amount, is to increase energy efficiency. Ms Rudd seems to have left that part of her plan in her pending tray. Britain does have a positive message to deliver in Paris, and that can only be good news. But the world has not yet come up with a way of holding global warming below the critical 2C. The serious negotiation in Paris will be about monitoring and enforcing compliance and setting a formula to ratchet up commitments into the future. For the UK, the Rudd plan, heavy on gas and light on efficiency, will make the next step in carbon emission cuts harder than it needs to be."
"Malcolm Turnbull has touched down in Berlin for a day of meetings with the German chancellor Angela Merkel ahead of the G20 summit in Turkey.  The Australian prime minister is scheduled to have a private meeting with Merkel, followed by lunch, and a joint press conference. Given the proximity of the UN climate talks in Paris, and Germany’s ongoing commitments to managing the flow of asylum seekers across Europe from the Syrian conflict, it is anticipated that both issues will be canvassed during the bilateral discussion Friday night Australian time. The Berlin stop will also see the release of a report paving the way for more business links between Australia and Germany, including specific recommendations allowing more opportunities for collaborative innovation. Friday’s meetings in Berlin follow the prime minister’s visit on Thursday to Jakarta, which was an attempt to reset one of Australia’s most important foreign policy relationships after a period of diplomatic turbulence. Turnbull met the Indonesia president Joko Widodo at the presidential palace and later went on a walk through a Jakarta textile market, where he was jostled by a huge crowd. Turnbull will go on from Berlin to the G20 summit in Turkey, the Apec summit in Manila, and the East Asia summit in Kuala Lumpur before returning to Australia on Monday 23 November."
"Fossil fuel companies risk wasting up to $2tn (£1.3tn) of investors’ money in the next decade on projects left worthless by global action on climate change and the surge in clean energy, according to a new report. The world’s nations aim to seal a UN deal in Paris in December to keep global warming below the danger limit of 2C. The heavy cuts in carbon emissions needed to achieve this would mean no new coal mines at all are needed and oil demand peaking in 2020, according to the influential thinktank Carbon Tracker. It found $2.2tn of projects at risk of stranding, ie being left valueless as the market for fossil fuels shrinks.   The report found the US has the greatest risk exposure, with $412bn of projects that could be stranded, followed by Canada ($220bn), China ($179bn) and Australia ($103bn). The UK’s £30bn North Sea oil and gas projects are at risk, the report says, despite government efforts to prop up the sector. Shell, ExxonMobil and Pemex are the companies with the greatest sums potentially at risk, with over $70bn each. The failure of the fossil fuel industry to address climate change is laid out in a second report on Wednesday, in which senior industry figures state there is “a significant disconnect between the changes needed to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to the [2C] level and efforts currently underway”. Lord John Browne, former BP boss, Sir Mark Moody-Stuart, former Shell and Anglo American chair and others say there must be “fundamental reassessment of the fossil fuel industry’s business models” and that companies should seize commercial opportunities in low-carbon energy. The Carbon Tracker report looked at existing and future projects being considered by coal, oil and gas companies up to 2025 and determined which could proceed if carbon emissions are cut to give a 50% chance of keeping climate change under 2C. Many high-cost projects, including Arctic and deepwater drilling, tar sands and shale oil are unneeded and therefore uneconomic in the 2C scenario, the report found, although some are required to replace fields that are already depleting. “Business history is littered with examples of incumbents – like Kodak and Blockbuster – who fail to see a transition coming,” said Anthony Hobley, chief executive of Carbon Tracker. “Our report offers these companies a warning [about] avoiding significant value destruction.” For coal, the report found “it is the end of the road for expansion of the sector”, with no new coal mines required anywhere in the world if dangerous climate change is to be avoided. “In the [2C] scenario, oil demand peaks around 2020,” found the report. “This means the oil sector does not need to continue to grow, which is inconsistent with the narrative of many companies.”  Spending of $1.3tn on new oil projects and $124bn on existing projects is unneeded, it concluded. For gas, demand in a 2C scenario is significantly lower than companies forecast, with $459bn of new projects and $73bn of existing projects surplus to requirements. The second report is produced by Critical Resource, a firm that advises fossil fuel companies, and involved senior industry and climate figures, including former European climate commissioner Connie Hedegaard. The report said “meeting [a 2C] target will result inevitably in steep declines in fossil fuel production over the coming decades” but that the “industry has so far generally been locked in defensive mode”. It added: “While most companies recognise the importance of climate change to their businesses, there is little evidence that most are altering their strategic plans.” However, it concluded: “Companies [should] urgently develop strategic plans to identify how they can compete commercially in a [2C] world. The aim is to unleash the industry’s creativity and innovation in finding profitable solutions.” “There is a very big gap between what the industry needs to do to compete in a 2C world and what they are doing,” said Daniel Litvin, MD of Critical Resources. “It may be the case that the most effective use of shareholder funds is to pay out more dividends and invest less.” But he said fossil fuel companies’ expertise in managing large projects across the world and long-term relationships with governments could give them an advantage in low-carbon projects. Litvin said the fossil fuel industry has been too slow in developing carbon capture and storage technology, which could bury emissions but has yet to be proven at commercial scale. “CCS is critically important,” he said. “It is the only way gas or coal will have a long-term future. Companies have waited for governments to move, but governments largely haven’t, yet the industry is facing an existential threat.”  There are signs of structural shifts towards low-carbon energy in the utility sector, following moves from Enel and E.On, and Litvin said such a shift could happen in the fossil fuel sector with ambitious leadership and the right signals from the Paris climate summit.  “The critical mass point could be as soon as a couple of years down the road, which is pretty soon for an industry that has been around for 100 years,” he said."

"In the midst of dire headlines and global horror, sometimes the greatest, most devastating terror strikes you right in your home, right in your bedroom, in the middle of the night. I was awoken the other night by an unpleasant itch on the bridge of my nose. In my dizzy half-consciousness, I brought my hand up to investigate and was jerked into a state of alarm by the all-too familiar whining hum of mosquito wings cruising past my ear.  “Ahhh!” I shouted and shot up and turned on my bed-stand light, waking my wife. I could feel the swelling already as the miniscule monster’s poison spread beneath my skin. Right at the top of my nose, right between the eyes. My wife knew what to do. She sat up, groggy, and clicked on her own lamp. I got out of bed and went to turn on the overheads. We’ve become used to the routine these past two weeks. At some point every night, one of us wakes to that psychosis-inducing hum, then the other. We turn on the lights, count up the bites, arm ourselves with rolled-up newspaper, and start the hunt. Because once we know that there’s a mosquito in the room, the prospects for sound sleep are hopeless.  We found it and killed it, exploding a dime-sized spot of blood on the wall, just as we had most of the past 10 or so nights. But we were still bereft. Ten nights of this, 10 nights of sleep interrupted at ungodly hours (sometimes more than once a night!), the panic, the itching, the maddening frustration of fruitless search, had left us in a bleary fugue state. We looked at each other in disbelief. We weren’t thinking straight. I was at the end of my rope. “This is worse than the Holocaust,” I said. I’m glad my ancestors who perished in Hitler’s gas chambers were not around to hear me. I am guilty of hyperbole of the worst kind, to be sure. And of a self-centeredness that betrays serious moral failings. But the problem is this: it’s November. Mid-November, 2015. The fact that my wife and I are being woken up every night by mosquitoes in our bedroom in New York City is legitimately a sign of apocalypse. I grew up in the New Jersey, went to college in Connecticut, moved to New York upon graduation. I’ve spent 44 years living in the tri-state area. Autumn is very different, these past few years, than it used to be. To my mind, mosquitos in October are an anomaly. When I was a kid, we’d surely have had two nights of frost by this time of year, and the mosquitos would have died or gone into hibernation for winter. It was 74F in Central Park last week. In November. So, climate change. We’re setting new record temperatures every year now, and we’re already seeing plenty of negative effects. (Any climate change-denying politician is hereby invited to spend a night in my bedroom to experience firsthand the nightmare future he or she is helping to ensure for our planet.)  We’re well into what biologists are calling our sixth “mass extinction event”, eras when lots of the world’s species die off in short order. This is the first mass extinction event that’s being caused by a single one of those species, though. But while lots of species languish and die, changing conditions allow others to thrive. Mosquitos, for example. They love warm weather. Mosquitos are thriving. And with them, the deadly diseases they carry and infect us with. Did you know that mosquitos, via malaria, are responsible for one half of all human deaths since the Stone Age? That statistic always blows my mind when I think about it. And we worry about sharks. So yes, it’s worse than me and my wife being pushed beyond sanity by the buzzing and the biting. Although, I’m telling you, in the heat of the moment, it seems like nothing could possibly be worse. Right on my nose! Right between my eyes! Things look very grim for humanity on this planet. In lots of ways, by many metrics, it’s worse than the Holocaust, and we’re just as responsible for the fact that it’s happening. Adding insult to injury, this month also brings news that terraforming Mars into a habitable home for the future of mankind is looking less and less like a possibility. Such a bummer. I took my kid to see The Martian last week. We marveled at Matt Damon planting food up there in his space station. Such fortitude, such ingenuity – we loved it. It was enough to provide a little hope, even. Sigh. Nope."
"Major marches which had been planned to coincide with the COP21 international climate talks in Paris will not be authorised for security reasons, the French government has said. Environmental activists – who had expected attract hundreds of thousands people on 29 November and 12 December – said that they accepted Wednesday’s decision with regret, but were now considering “new and imaginative” ways of making their voices heard. Following the recent terror attacks in Paris, French authorities said a statement that all demonstrations organised in closed spaces or in places where security can easily be ensured could go ahead.  “However, in order to avoid additional risks, the government has decided not to authorise climate marches planned in public places in Paris and other French cities,” it said.  Environmental activists had hoped the marches would attract large numbers to put pressure on governments to cut greenhouse gas emissions. A range of groups have been involved in planning actions during the summit and the position of every one of them was not immediately clear on Wednesday. Some of those involved say though that more than 2,000 protests in around 150 countries during the talks have taken on a greater significance. They include the campaign group Avaaz, which released a promotional video for the marches it is involved in organising around the world. Emma Ruby-Sachs, deputy director of Avaaz, said: “The police have just informed us that the tragic attacks in Paris have made the march there impossible. “Now it’s even more important for people everywhere to march on the weekend of 29 November on behalf of those who can’t, and show that we are more determined than ever to meet the challenges facing humanity with hope, not fear.” Jean-François Juilliard, Greenpeace France executive director, said that it was a source of huge regret that the French authorities said that they cannot guarantee safety the safety of marchers but the decision must be respected. He added: “Huge numbers were expected in Paris, but those people will not be silenced. We will find new, imaginative ways to ensure our voices are heard in the UN conference centre and beyond. “In hundreds of towns and cities across the world people will still march for the climate, for Paris and for our shared humanity. We stand for a vision of human cooperation that the murderers sought to extinguish. They will not succeed.” Talks between the French foreign minister, Laurent Fabius, and campaigners over the fate of a huge march before the forthcoming Paris climate summit ended without agreement earlier this week. Fabius expressed fears on Tuesday about the risk of another terror attack and of the sort of crowd panic seen in Paris’s Place de République on 15 November, when hundreds of people fled a solidarity vigil after firecrackers were let off. As well as the marches, other protest actions which had been planned include a “people’s summit”, a “climate action zone” involving schools and community groups and a day of civil disobedience at the summit’s end. Coalition Climat 21, an alliance of civil society groups that had been centrally involved in the Paris protests, had pledged earlier this week to try to continue with public demonstrations within the city in close consultation with the police. It said in a statement on Wednesday that it would try to find an “alternative form of citizen mobilisation” to demonstrate that COP21 would not just be left to the negotiators. The organisation said that the climate summit, which was due to be held on 5 and 6 December in the eastern suburb of Montreuil and another event from 7 to 11 December in the centre of Paris should be maintained.

"“The deal’s dead.” These were the words of my chief negotiator, approximately six years ago, in the middle of the night in the final hours of the sleep-deprived Copenhagen summit. I was standing in my bedroom as I took his call, about to go to bed for the first time in 36 hours. Thanks to the efforts of a number of countries into the night and the next day, it turned out the deal wasn’t quite dead, and something did survive.  But in truth, it is what has happened in the years after Copenhagen that made it not quite the disaster it appeared at the time. Slowly, steadily, the unwieldy, spatchcock UN process has rumbled on. Lessons have been learned from that chaotic episode. The idea that we should build an agreement bottom-up with countries making individual pledges, first conceived at Copenhagen, has become more serious, and every big emitter has put one forward. And now we approach next week’s Paris climate talks, the most important summit since Copenhagen, in a significantly better place than we feared back in 2009. However, we are not where we need to be. The science is even more unequivocal than it was six years ago. Just to take one example, 2015 looks like being the hottest year on record by some distance. We sometimes talk about the need to avoid dangerous warming of the planet as if it is a theoretical idea, but its effects are already here, with approaching 1 degree of warming so far. On the other side of the ledger, technology has thrown us a lifeline. The costs of wind and solar energy have come down far quicker than anyone dreamed of. The constructive side of human ingenuity is holding its own in the fight against its destructive side. And it is now demonstrably the case that the fight against climate change can be job-creating, not destroying, according to the Confederation of British Industry and many others. And what about political will? Climate change seems less politically fashionable as an issue. But China and the United States have moved forward a long way from where they were at Copenhagen. We have moved from a world where everyone said it was someone else’s problem, to one where everyone knows this can be only be solved collectively. We are not in a world of business as usual. That’s the good news. And in many senses the Paris summit looks set to represent success: every major country taking real action to reduce emissions, a substantially different path from where we would be without that action. Paris will also repeat the international commitment made at Copenhagen to limit warming to 2 degrees. But the bad news is that the pledges will still be short of what is needed. In reality, the commitments for 2030 would take us towards something like a 3-degree world. That would mean higher temperatures than at any time in the last three million years, with potentially dramatic effects of intense heatwaves, flooding and climate refugees across the world. So what can be done? Just like at Copenhagen, what matters as much as Paris is what happens afterwards. That is why countries are rightly seeking to build an upwards ratchet mechanism into the agreement. If these pledges are the start, not the final word – a prelude to greater ambition – then we can still avoid the most dangerous effects of global warming. What does this mean for Britain? The last Labour government introduced the Climate Change Act, with all-party support for an 80% reduction in emissions by 2050 – the first country in the world to legislate for such deep, long-term cuts. It is essential we remain on track for this goal, including making the right decisions about the period to 2030 which will face the government in the coming months. But what the science now tells us is that we will need to go further and see a complete end to the accumulation of additional greenhouse gases in our atmosphere. The world will need to move to zero emissions at some time in the second half of the century, as President Obama and the other G7 leaders, including David Cameron, have rightly acknowledged. A point will come when the total carbon budget for the world will simply be used up. And here is the relevance as far as Paris is concerned: every excess tonne of carbon we emit between now and 2030 brings the date when we need to get to “net zero” emissions forward – the point at which any remaining emissions are balanced out by the capturing of carbon. Is zero emissions even practical, and can it be done without closing down our economy? The answer to both questions is a strong yes. Indeed, top business leaders such as Ratan Tata as well as Paul Polman of Unilever have recently called on world leaders to adopt a zero emissions goal in Paris. So how can it be done in the UK? It is about a 100% clean energy supply. It is about making our energy system more efficient and productive. It is about the right infrastructure. And, to cancel out residual emissions from agriculture and industry, it is about capturing carbon from the atmosphere, for example through reforestation and by the use of carbon capture and storage technology. Already cities and companies are adopting the zero emissions goal. The right step now would be for Britain to become the first major country to enshrine net zero emissions in law, with the date determined by advice from the independent Committee on Climate Change. This would be consistent with the government’s support for zero emissions at G7 level and would show our determination to face up to this existential challenge. It will provide an essential framework for business and government so that we make the right decisions now on key energy and infrastructure issues. And it will inspire the inventors, engineers and businesses that can deliver on this challenge. From my conversations with people across the House of Commons, including the Liberal Democrats, the SNP, Caroline Lucas of the Greens and Conservatives such as Nick Hurd and Graham Stuart (chair of Globe, the international parliamentarians group on climate change), it is clear there is cross-party support. Paris must be the start of a journey of the whole world towards this goal. And far from this commitment holding Britain back, we can be a leader again on climate change. Leadership which does not mean harm to our economy, but will put us ahead in the race for the new jobs, businesses and advantages of this new world. I hope the government will support this initiative. We can build an alliance, put aside our party differences as we have before, and seize this moment."
"Over the past 15 years – and contrary to popular belief – the world has made tremendous progress in reducing global poverty. One billion fewer people live in extreme poverty today than in 2000. This year, the rate of extreme global poverty is expected to fall below 10%, dropping into single digits for the first time in history. Inclusive economic growth, especially in China and India, has driven this success. This kind of economic growth, which increases the income of the poorest 40%, is critical to reaching our global goal of ending poverty by 2030.  We are the first generation in history that can end poverty, but we will lose this opportunity if we do not tackle climate change, which will affect all of our lives and could devastate the poorest. It may push more than 100 million people into poverty in the next 15 years, according to a new World Bank Group report. Extreme weather conditions are already wreaking havoc across the world. This year’s El Niño is expected to be one of the strongest yet, affecting billions of people in South and North America, Africa, Asia and the Pacific. Orange farmers in Florida, coffee growers in Indonesia, and tea harvesters in Kenya are among those who could see their crops damaged. The last time El Niño was this severe, in 1997-98, floods, fires, droughts and other disasters killed 30,000 people, displaced at least 24 million in China, India, Honduras and the Dominican Republic, and caused an estimated $100bn (£66bn) in damage. Changing weather patterns will also increase the spread of disease carriers and infectious diseases like malaria, which is projected to strike about 214 million people in 2015. Almost 90% of these cases will be in sub-Saharan Africa. Rising global temperatures could put 150 million more people at risk and have a significant impact on productivity, undermining inclusive growth. The poor will suffer the most. They often live, farm or hold assets in areas more exposed to droughts and floods, which puts their homes, crops and livestock at greater risk. Most have little access to bank accounts or social safety nets like health insurance, so they pay more than 50% of their health costs out of pocket. Without secure savings or public support, they often cannot recover from disasters or obtain treatment when sick. Climate change is also expected to threaten our food security, potentially causing global crop losses of up to 5% by 2030. This could force food prices higher, especially in sub-Saharan Africa and south Asia, where the majority of the world’s extreme poor live. Such a scenario would make access to food more difficult and, by 2030, could leave another 7.5 million children facing nutritional and cognitive difficulties. December’s global climate change conference in Paris presents a critical opportunity to stop climate change from reversing global gains against poverty. An ambitious agreement backed by strong political will can accelerate our transition to inclusive growth that reduces greenhouse gas emissions using renewable energy, efficiency upgrades and other steps. This would limit the future effects of climate change, create jobs and raise incomes. The World Bank Group has made its own ambitious commitment to this cause. Last month, the group pledged to use its resources to increase support for developing countries’ response to climate change by up to $29bn annually by 2020. This is an important step, opening up a credible path to the $100bn in annual climate finance that is integral to reaching a climate change agreement.  After Paris, we will help countries to use this support to insulate the poor and others from the effects of climate change based on their national plans. Together, we can expand safety nets and financial access, and strengthen health systems. We can increase the use of heat-resistant crops and other climate-smart agricultural practices, eliminate fuel subsidies in ways that minimise the impact on the poor, and use urban design to reduce cities’ carbon emissions and make them more resilient. The benefits can be immediate. In 2013, when Cyclone Phailin hit near Gopalpur, India, it killed fewer than 100 people, even though nearly 10,000 had died when a similar storm hit the area in 1999. The difference: early warning systems and evacuation plans introduced in the interim. In 2011, Ethiopia helped replace income that 3 million people lost to drought through a safety net programme that provides cash transfers for vulnerable households at times of crisis. The programme also pays communities to work on making their land more resistant to drought in the future, through building terraced fields to reduce soil erosion, for example, and it continues to shield Ethiopians from falling into poverty due to extreme weather. International action on climate change must reflect our new understanding of what is at stake: the fate of hundreds of millions of people who live in extreme poverty today and the wellbeing of more than 100 million more who could be pushed into it. By doing the right thing, we will also push forward the cause of justice – we can preserve the planet for future generations and end extreme poverty. The two together will be humankind’s greatest achievement."

" It was planned as a wake-up call to one crisis, but it is sailing towards the heart of another. A mass of ice harvested from Greenland is currently on its way to Paris, where it is due to be installed on Place de la République on 29 November to mark the UN climate change conference COP 21. “The blocks are in freezer containers normally used to ship shrimps from Greenland,” says Olafur Eliasson, the Danish-Icelandic artist behind Ice Watch Paris. He imagined the work as a way of making the fragility and decay of the Arctic visible, not to mention tangible: “You stand in front of the ice, and then you can touch it.” Now, it also feels like a strange and unexpected homage to Paris itself.   If Ice Watch Paris does go ahead (Eliasson hopes to know in the next few days), it will inevitably become about the survival of culture as well as the peril of nature.  “Isis has been blowing up anything remotely resembling cultural identity,” says the artist renowned for bringing the sun indoors at the Tate’s Turbine Hall. “To express your voice in a free space becomes ever more important.”  Public art is one of the most powerful expressions of a great city, from Palmyra (whose beauties have been destroyed by Isis) to Paris, where many people have been gathering since the weekend on the very square that Eliasson hopes to illuminate with 12 blocks of what he calls the “magic glass” that is Arctic ice.  “What we see now in Place de la République is people going and placing flowers,” he says. “The public space actually holds your emotional need. I went to put down flowers: I became part of a community.”  Paris has a unique history as a city of squares and crowds. Place de la République was created by Baron Haussmann in the 19th century in a tradition of grand open gathering places that goes back to the French Revolution. Eliasson contrasts the great civic spaces of Paris with those of London, which are by contrast shaped by royalty and “heirarchy”. “France being a republic, the public really means something else,” he explains. “Paris is really the city of cities in civic terms. It is the city of the people.” Like the flowers on Place de la République, he hopes his ice will provide a “quiet and contemplative” collective experience. “The ice has this very strong poetic quality. It gives you that space to reconsider, somehow. I think there is something very touching about it. It’s incredibly beautiful. And the physical impact this big piece of ice has on your body is really intense. You’ll see children hugging it, even tasting it …”  Ice Watch Paris is intended as a memorial to the Arctic. “The ice we are going to put in Paris is a tenth of what melts in a second in the Greenland summer.” It is a way to make the data real, to make the facts emotionally potent.  And yet, this silent, sombre hunk of ice would surely resonate with the numbed feelings of a city in shock. If it goes ahead, it will be both a call to action on the climate and a gathering place, a shared moment, for a wounded city. “Does what you’re looking at accept you and reflect your emotional need?” asks Eliasson. “I am feeling afraid. Does it reflect my fear? If it’s a great work of art, it hosts people.” If there’s any artist whose work seems appropriate to Paris right now it is Eliasson. His awe-inspiring installations are not afraid to play on our psychological connection with the natural world. His extraordinary creation of a sun inside Tate Modern appealed to our ancient impulse to worship our mother star. It created a community of contemplation, a natural wonder in the city. Nature becomes culture in his work, and its marvels are brought into urban settings where we can hold and share and be moved by them. Perhaps in some unplanned way, the presence of such a spectacle on Place de la République will be consoling as well as challenging. For the ability to wonder at nature is itself a defining quality of civilisation. Eliasson is waiting with “respect” to hear if Ice Watch Paris can go ahead.  “My artwork is on its way, as we speak,” he says. “I hope by the time it reaches harbour, it will know where to go.”"

I believe there’s change, and I believe it goes up and it goes down, and it goes up again. And it changes depending on years and centuries, but I am not a believer, and we have much bigger problems.” Said in May 2014: “Our climate is always changing. And what they have chosen to do is take a handful of decades of research and say that this is now evidence of a longer-term trend that’s directly and almost solely attributable to manmade activity. I do not agree with that.” Said in September 2015: “We’re not going to make America a harder place to create jobs in order to pursue policies that will do absolutely nothing, nothing to change our climate.

It was true when I said it before, and it remains true today. Perhaps what has made this hoax so effective is that we hear over and over that the science is settled and there is a consensus that, unless we fundamentally change our way of life by limiting greenhouse gas emissions, we will cause catastrophic global warming. This is simply a false statement.” Said in February 2015, while holding a snowball he took to the floor of the Senate: “It’s very, very cold out. Very unseasonable.”"
"Ed Miliband has called on the UK to become the first country in the world to enshrine in law a target of reducing carbon emissions to zero. The former Labour leader and energy secretary said Britain should show leadership and send a clear signal to businesses by building on its existing target of cutting emissions by 80% by 2050 under the Climate Change Act.   The intervention, in a comment article for the Guardian, comes a week before world leaders including David Cameron and Barack Obama meet for a landmark climate change summit in Paris. Nearly 200 countries are due to attend the negotiations to thrash out a deal for emissions cuts beyond 2020 and financing for poorer countries to cope with global warming. “When we did the Climate Change Act [in 2008] it did send a message around the world, and then people did follow. It was Britain saying we’re going to do these big reductions and put it in law. I think there is the prospect of that happening again,” Miliband said. The Labour MP said he did not want to put a date on when the zero emissions target should be achieved, because that decision should be taken by the government’s statutory advisers. To avoid dangerous global warming, the UN’s intergovernmental panel on climate change has said emissions must be cut to near zero by the end of the century. Nicholas Stern, the economist commissioned by the then chancellor Gordon Brown to assess the costs of inaction on climate change, said he supported a target of reducing emissions to zero but would not go so far as to say it should be written into law.  Sir David King, the foreign secretary’s special representative on climate change, said Miliband’s call was important and timely. “It stresses the importance of maintaining all-party political agreement on the commitments of the UK to act on climate change. This has already created the certainty on investments in the new low carbon sector that means this is now the fastest growing sector in the British economy, now employing over 450,000 people in Britain.” Miliband said the UK’s emissions cuts needed to go from 80% to 100% because it would be required eventually, and would send an important signal to businesses. “We now know we will get to the point where the carbon budget is exhausted. It just makes logical sense for the backstop to be zero, not simply 80%. The 80% target is fine but in the end we are going to have to get to zero, and we might as well start to look at the questions of when and how.” This summer the government’s statutory climate advisers warned that the UK’s existing carbon budgets could be missed. The group’s chairman John Gummer took the unusual step of singling out Conservative policy changes such as scrapping a target for all new homes to be zero carbon. But Miliband said he was not interested in political point-scoring in his call for a zero emissions target, which he said was backed by Tory, Liberal Democrat, SNP and Green party MPs. “I’m not in the business of trying to have a go at the government. Paris is too important. I genuinely hope they will look upon this as a sensible cross-party initiative which they can support,” he said. French authorities have said the Paris summit will still go ahead despite the recent terror attacks, although authorities have forbidden a planned march that was expected to attract hundreds of thousands of people. Miliband, who attended the last major climate summit, in Copenhagen in 2009, said he was hopeful of a “decent” deal at Paris. “The stakes are high … it’s very, very important that Paris is a success. By a success, I mean serious commitments from the major emitters, which we have. But crucially with this so-called ratchet mechanism for the ambition to be greater.” Countries representing nearly 90% of emissions have put forward their climate pledges before the summit, but a UN analysis found they would still lead to temperature rises of 2.7-3C – more than the 2C limit to which leaders have agreed. The EU, China and the US, among others, have called for a five-yearly review mechanism to ratchet up those pledges to meet 2C. “It’s very important we embed that in the agreement,” Miliband said. He admitted that while the Copenhagen summit had been a setback in some senses, it had also laid some of the groundwork – such as a promise of $100bn a year in climate aid for poorer countries – for any deal agreed in Paris. The Paris conference opens on 30 November and runs until 11 December."
"The UK will close all coal-fired power plants by 2025, the first major country to do so, but will fill the capacity gap largely with new gas and nuclear plants rather than cleaner alternatives. The announcement came in a speech by the energy secretary, Amber Rudd, which she described as a “reset” of Britain’s energy policy on Wednesday.   Rudd said she wanted policy to focus on making energy affordable and secure. The government wanted a “consumer-led, competition-focused energy system that has energy security at the heart of it”, she said, adding that the balance had swung too far in favour of climate change policies at the expense of keeping energy affordable. “We are tackling a legacy of underinvestment and ageing power stations, which we need to replace with alternatives that are reliable, good value for money, and help to reduce our emissions. It cannot be satisfactory for an advanced economy like the UK to be relying on polluting, carbon-intensive 50-year-old coal-fired power stations. Let me be clear: this is not the future,” she said. Green campaigners offered a cautious welcome to Rudd’s pledge to restrict coal-fired power by 2023 and eradicate it in a decade, although they have been critical of government moves to abandon support for renewable energy. “With this announcement, the UK is demonstrating the type of leadership that nations around the world must take in order to craft a successful agreement in Paris and solve the climate crisis,” said former US vice-president Al Gore. “The UK has become the first major economy to set a clear date to phase out coal, and I am hopeful that others will follow suit as we repower the global economy with the clean energy we need for a sustainable future.”  But the veteran green campaigner added that he was “confused” by the government’s cuts to support for clean technology such as solar and wind power. David Nussbaum, the chief executive of the charity WWF, expressed mixed views on the speech, saying he welcomed the phasing out of coal but questioned the strategy on renewables. “As the government will highlight, decarbonising our economy will involve a mix of technologies,” he said. “But the way to develop a climate resilient economy and to be fair to bill payers is to pursue renewables ambitiously and to do so now. “Other countries are taking advantage of the fact that around half the global energy infrastructure being built today is renewable. And as renewables prices tumble the global market booms. Is Britain happy to be left behind?” Coal provides about 30% of the UK’s electricity but it is the most carbon intensive of fossil fuels and environmentalists have long been pushing the Department for Energy and Climate Change to set a date for phasing it out, preferably by 2023. To meet this goal, the UK will have to put a huge effort into getting enough gas-fired power stations built to meet demand. Burning gas emits about half as much carbon as coal and is considered by some to be a “bridging” fuel, as countries work towards a zero-carbon future. Rudd acknowledged that gas and nuclear power generation would in effect need a government subsidy for building power plants, but insisted they were the most secure energy sources for the future. Rudd’s critics are likely to call the government’s focus on gas and nuclear power short-sighted as she has cut so many subsidies for renewables and energy efficiency schemes.  The energy secretary claims many of these grew too expensive under the coalition, in which the energy brief was held by a Liberal Democrat, Ed Davey. A Whitehall source said: “It is about moving away from short-term expensive subsidies and schemes that didn’t work.”  However, several analysts, campaigners and the affected industries argue that slashing support for renewables is a backwards step when it comes to tackling climate change, growing green industry and saving consumers money in the longer term. Davey published a series of questions for Rudd on Tuesday night, including asking how the UK would meet its legal obligations under the Climate Change Act under her new policies.  This month Rudd was accused of having misled the public after a leaked letter revealed that the UK was predicted to fall short of its EU obligations to get 15% of its energy from renewables by 2020. Pressed on the shortfall, the energy secretary was forced to admit the UK did not have the right policies to meet its decarbonisation targets and argued that the government should maintain support for renewable heat at the spending review. Davey claimed the Conservatives opposed ending coal-fired power under the coalition and challenged Rudd to guarantee the lights would stay on with her strategy of “gas, and more gas”.  Last week National Grid for the first time had to use “last resort” powers to tell companies to reduce their electricity usage in an effort to reduce the risk of blackouts.   Green MP Caroline Lucas said: “This switch from coal to gas is like trying to go dry by switching from vodka to super-strength cider – it entirely fails to seriously address the real challenge at hand. Investing in renewables and energy conservation would be far more effective economically, environmentally and in terms of energy security. We must begin weaning ourselves off gas as quickly as possible.” A Whitehall source said Rudd remained focused on the energy trilemma, a recognition of the need to balance energy security, affordability and climate change."
"Taxing meat to simultaneously tackle climate change and improve global health would be far less unpalatable than governments think, according to new research.  Meat production produces 15% of all greenhouse gases – more than all cars, trains, planes and ships combined – and halting global warming appears near impossible unless the world’s fast growing appetite for meat is addressed.   The new analysis says this could be done through taxes, increasing vegetarian food in schools, hospitals and the armed forces and cutting subsidies to livestock farmers, all supported by public information campaigns. The research, from the international affairs thinktank Chatham House and Glasgow University, involved surveys and focus groups in 12 countries and found that even measures restricting peoples’ behaviour could be accepted if seen as in the public interest, as was seen with smoking bans.  “Governments are ignoring what should be a hugely appealing, win-win policy,” said lead author Laura Wellesley, at Chatham House.  “The idea that interventions like this are too politically sensitive and too difficult to implement is unjustified. Our focus groups show people expect governments to lead action on issues that are for the global good. Our research indicates any backlash to unpopular policies would likely be short-lived as long as the rationale for action was strong.” Increasing appetite for meat and population growth in developing countries mean global meat consumption is on track to increase 75% by 2050, which would make it virtually impossible to keep global warming below the internationally-agreed limit of 2C.  Meat consumption is already well above healthy levels in developed nations and growing fast in other countries, and is linked to rising rates of heart disease and cancer. To get to healthy levels, US citizens would need to cut the meat they eat by two-thirds, those in the UK by a half and those in China by a third. If the world’s population cuts to healthy levels of meat consumption – about 70g per day – it would reduce carbon emissions by an amount equivalent to annual output of the US, the world’s second biggest polluter. The UN climate change summit begins in Paris on 30 November, where the world’s nations aim to seal a deal to tackle climate change. Most countries have already submitted pledges to cut their emissions, but they are not enough to keep warming below dangerous levels. Cutting meat eating to healthy levels would make up a quarter of that shortfall and is very low cost way of curbing emissions, according to the report, but action to achieve this is non-existent.  Previous calls to cut meat consumption, from the chief of the UN’s climate science panel and the economist Lord Stern, or to tax it, have been both rare and controversial. “We are not in any way advocating for global vegetarianism,” said Wellesley. “We can see massive changes [to emissions] from just converging around healthy levels of meat eating.” She said raising awareness of the impact on the climate from meat production was the first step, but was unlikely to shift diets by itself. “The level of awareness is very low, indeed in China it is almost non-existent,” said Catherine Happer, at Glasgow University. She said people in the 36 focus groups viewed meat taxes as the most effective, if unpopular, but that cutting subsidies for meat production was seen as both effective and popular. “An awful lot of people were surprised that there were subsidies at all,” she said. “They felt, particularly in the US, that governments had propped up a very unhealthy food market.” Livestock subsidies in the 34 OECD nations alone were $53bn in 2013, including an average of $190 per cow. People also said any government action must avoid disadvantaging poorer citizens. Prof Greg Philo, also at Glasgow University, said the key was “creating a new public understanding that industrial production of meat is not only dangerous to your own health but to human ecology as a whole.”  Clare Oxborrow, a campaigner at Friends of the Earth, said: “Meat consumption can no longer be ignored in the climate debate – shifting diets to less meat and more plant proteins will be crucial. The government must stop using consumer backlash as an excuse for inaction”. The reductions mapped out by the report would not reduce the size of the global meat industry, the researchers said, because rising population is pushing up demand, but it would significantly slow its growth.  They also said efforts to make meat production greener could cut emissions by up to a third, but that this would be swamped by growing demand if action was not taken. Meat eating has plateaued in recent years in richer nations, but is growing fast in developing countries. Previous studies have calculated that, on current trends, agricultural emissions will take up the entire world’s carbon budget by 2050, meaning every other sector, including energy, industry and transport, would have to be zero carbon, a scenario described as “impossible”. Meat production produces greenhouse gases via the methane emitted by livestock, the cutting down of forests for pasture, the production of fertiliser for feed crops and the energy and transport used by farmers. Beef is responsible for far higher emissions than chicken or pork. None of the report’s authors are vegetarians, but Rob Bailey, from Chatham House, said: “Having worked on this project, I have drastically reduced my meat consumption – I now eat it once a month.”"

"A march expected to attract 200,000 people onto the streets of Paris ahead of crunch UN climate change talks was forbidden by the French government on Wednesday in light of last Friday’s terror attacks. But organisers have said it is now even more important for people around the world to come out onto the streets for “the biggest global climate march in history” to protest “on behalf of those who can’t”. There are 2,173 events organised in more than 150 countries around the world on 28 and 29 November. You can find your nearest event here:  The events are designed to put pressure on the leaders from almost 200 countries who will meet in Paris to thrash out a new deal on limiting greenhouse gas emissions post-2020. The conference is considered the most significant since the talks in Copenhagen in 2009, which were widely considered a failure by environmentalists. Emma Ruby-Sachs, deputy director of Avaaz, which has organised the march said: “The tragic attacks in Paris have made the march there impossible. Now it’s even more important for people everywhere to march on the weekend of 29 November on behalf of those who can’t, and show that we are more determined than ever to meet the challenges facing humanity with hope, not fear.” From Kazakhstan to Chile, people are expected to gather across six continents with organisers hoping the numbers will still top the People’s Climate March last year when nearly 700,000 people took to the streets around the world, although they say that numbers will be weather dependent.  The largest march is expected to take place in London, where designer Vivienne Westwood, actor Vanessa Redgrave and musicians Charlotte Church, Peter Gabriel and Kate Tempest have pledged to turn out. Demonstrations are expected across Europe, including a colourful parade in Amsterdam and marches in Madrid and Berlin where protesters will call for the end of coal.  In Alaska in the US, protesters will hike up to a wind turbine on a local mountain while in Melbourne, Australia, people will gather outside the state library, joined by a choir. In Tanzania, 1,000 Maasai are expected to gather and march in Loliondo on the border of the Serengeti national park. The focus of activity in India will be in New Delhi, but other events featuring yoga, bicycles and walking will take place in seven other cities. Demonstrations led by celebrities and local leaders will end with a concert in Kampala, Uganda’s capital, while in Brazil people will march down Paulista Avenue in central São Paulo. The world’s scientists have warned that rising emissions created by humans are causing temperatures to rise around the globe. World leaders have agreed it is essential to limit warming to a 2C rise above pre-industrial levels to avoid triggering potentially catastrophic and irreversible impacts, but on current trends the world is likely to warm by twice that amount by the end of the century.  Leaders have expressed hope for progress at Paris after the majority of countries around the world submitted voluntary pledges and measures to reduce their own emissions ahead of this year’s talks, as opposed to the UN imposing top-down targets. But many others have signalled that the fate of the talks will rest on the relationship between developed and developing countries, which have been promised a $100bn-a-year package by 2020 to support them to make the transition to a clean economy.

"Barack Obama has moved to ensure that the Paris attacks do not sabotage a crucial climate change summit in the city next week, urging his fellow leaders to attend and strike a new deal on global warming. The US president spoke out amid concerns that security fears in Paris coupled with an understandable deflection of French attention away from the imminent two-week summit might undermine chances for a historic agreement to rein in greenhouse gas emissions.  “I think it’s absolutely vital for every country, every leader, to send a signal that the viciousness of a handful of killers does not stop the world from doing vital business,” Obama said. He added that world leaders had to show the murderous adversaries who killed at least 130 people “that we’re not afraid”. And the first chance to do that is next Monday, when the Paris climate change talks, known as COP21, start. The Paris attacks have cast a deep shadow over COP21 – demonstrations have been banned and security has been stepped up – though none of the 130-plus heads of state and government due to attend has yet pulled out. France has made a huge play of preparing for the summit, which is supposed to achieve a new global deal to curb emissions from 2020 and prevent the planet from catastrophic overheating. But in the wake of the 13 November attacks, there have been concerns that the French political leadership, and president François Hollande in particular, might have other things on their mind. Privately, French officials insist they are determined not to let their agenda be set by terrorists. And some observers are hoping that the threat might galvanisethe talks to greater solidarity and urgency. Lord Stern, author of the landmark 2006 study finding that climate change could be dealt with more cheaply if action is taken swiftly, said: “World leaders are more likely to come, and I don’t think there will be any grandstanding [as seen at previous meetings]. It should be much more collaborative.” Leaders will only be present for the start of the talks, not for the hard negotiations. But they will set the tone, and have the power to instruct their ministers and officials to come to an agreement, which has proved elusive in the past. “Negotiators will feel that they have to get it done,” said Stern. “It’s remarkable how people have been coming together, sharing a recognition of this problem. Paris could be a turning point [in negotiations over global warming]. This is about our common humanity.” Andrew Steer, chief executive of the World Resources Institute thinktank in the US, said: “We’re struck by the resolve [to get a deal]. And one can intuitively see why. There is a degree of solidarity internationally over this issue, that is not exactly unprecedented, but since 9/11, we probably haven’t seen anything quite like that. If anything, it stiffens the spine in terms of determination to really solve what is the greatest collective action problem in history.” Craig Bennett, chief executive of Friends of the Earth in the UK, hoped that countries would be more willing to come to a deal, but that he feared this pressure might lead to a weaker accord.  “They will want to give Hollande a deal at the end of the day. But the deal may not be as good as it might have been. Countries turning up in Paris will be reluctant for Paris to be seen as a failure, but we have a deal on the table that is not enough – we would have liked to see a stronger deal, and maybe we are less likely to get that now.” Nick Mabey, chief executive at the environmental lobby group E3G, said the terrorist attacks would “not have a huge impact on the outcome, but they will have a huge impact on the tone”.  Previous rounds of negotiations from the Copenhagen conference in 2009 – when the talks dissolved into chaos and public recrimination – have been marked by emotional outpourings, threats and public displays unusual in other forms of diplomacy. This year, such shows would be less welcome, said Nick Mabey, chief executive at the environmental lobby group E3G. “The tone will be more serious, and less festive. Activists will have to find more creative ways to show the world the impact of climate change. There will be less grandstanding, and more focus.” He said the attacks on France would give Hollande more “moral authority”, and that delegates would feel a greater duty to show “the ability of people to cooperate and bring peace and work together. That is the core message, and it’s really important that this message gets through.” The Paris meeting is the result of five years of hard negotiations, aimed at healing the profound differences between developed and developing countries in addressing the threat of global warming. Without a Paris agreement, global warming is set to reach as much as 5C (9F) above pre-industrial levels. Scientists estimate that warming above 2C (4F) will result in catastrophic and irreversible changes to the weather, including droughts, floods, heatwaves, fiercer storms and sea level rises. The difference between today’s average global temperature and the last ice age is about 5C, showing what a great effect such a temperature rise could have. If pledges currently on the table for a potential Paris agreement are followed, then warming is likely to be limited to 2.7C or 3C by the end of this century - still not enough to meet scientific advice, but with mechanisms such as a five-yearly review, advocated as part of a Paris pact, the difference could be made up. • This article was amended on 23 November 2015to correct the conversion of temperature changes from celsius to fahrenheit"

"Increasingly long fire seasons will require more firefighters and could place greater demands on firefighting equipment shared between countries, according to a report from the Climate Council. The report is a review of recent research into climate change and weather associated with bushfires. One key study cited is a 2015 paper which found that the length of fire seasons has increased by 18.7% globally from 1979 to 2013. The same study found a general increase in fire season length for all continents except Australia, where there was no continent-wide trend. There was however local variation in areas within Australia, with longer fire seasons becoming more frequent in large parts of eastern Australia, and less frequent in parts of western Australia: An older study which we’ve written about previously, also cited in the Climate Council report, looked specifically at changes in the McArthur Forest Fire Danger Index (FFDI) for 38 locations in Australia from 1973 to 2010. The FFDI combines temperature, wind speed, relative humidity and the “drought factor”, which represents the effect of recent temperatures and rainfall on fuel availability. It’s used to determine those bushfire danger ratings you see on the side of the road. The study found that the annual, cumulative FFDI (the sum of all daily FFDI values over five-year intervals) had significantly increased at 16 out of 38 locations, and no locations had decreased. There was a particularly large increase in south-east Australia: The research also looked at seasonal increases, with the largest changes happened in spring, representing a lengthening of the bushfire season in south-east Australia. The authors are however careful to point out that increases in the FFDI may not necessarily always equate to an increased chance of bushfires, and while the trends are consistent with climate change, they are unable to separate climate change from other long-term weather variations without additional work. According to the IPCC, climate change is expected to increase the number of days with very high and extreme fire weather. The Climate Council report suggests this lengthening of fire seasons means fire seasons in the US and Australia will increasingly overlap, with potential consequences for equipment and personnel sharing arrangements between the two countries. When asked if lengthening fire seasons would affect how they approach such arrangements, a spokesman for the NSW Rural Fire Service (RFS) said they were aware of “research suggesting climate change could result in longer bushfire seasons and increased demands on resources, including firefighters”. “As the lead agency for bush firefighting and management in NSW, the NSW RFS continues to consider the potential for increased fire activity and how it may impact the prevention, mitigation and suppression of bush fires in NSW,” he said. “Irrespective of the cause, the NSW RFS always assesses conditions and prepares based on the prevailing forecast.” The RFS spokesman said they were continuing to investigate new methods and equipment for firefighting, citing ongoing trials of air tankers and dirt bikes."
"In many poor countries, environmental destruction is the tipping point that pushes vulnerable families into slavery. Unseasonal droughts, encroaching deserts, extreme flooding, the death of livestock, or illegal deforestation have a devastating impact on families already living on the brink. As their fragile livelihoods become unsustainable, such families may start to gamble with their liberty. Desperate parents accept offers from unscrupulous “recruiters” to employ their daughters in hotels, often suspecting that the offers are too good to be true, but hoping against hope that their daughters won’t end up in the sex trade, or that sons who are offered “light work” and access to schooling won’t be forced to work double shifts in embroidery factories or road building. Sadly, and all too often, however, that is the outcome.   In India, Nepal and Pakistan, entire families forced off the land end up working as bonded labourers in brick kilns or stone quarries after they are coerced with fraudulent loans into years – and often decades – of servitude. Slave labour is also deployed in work that destroys the environment – thereby perpetuating the cycle of devastation and exploitation. In Thailand, desperate migrants from Myanmar and Cambodia are enslaved on fishing boats to strip the oceans of fish, damaging the marine environment. Or in Brazil, gangs of young men are trapped by debt in work illegally logging the Amazon forest (pdf), endangering the livelihoods of indigenous groups. Brick kilns in India, operated by bonded labourers, are fuelled with old tyres and used motor oil, spewing carcinogens and other pollutants into the air. Slave labour is used for such work because destroying the environment for profit is often difficult, dirty and dangerous. The criminal gangs perpetrating these abuses are not willing to pay the wages required to attract and retain workers for this difficult and unpleasant work. Instead, they deceive and coerce vulnerable men, women and children into servitude so that they can extract maximum profit from their exploitation.  More often than not, the destruction is also illegal so perpetrators have an incentive to use illegal, forced labour – thereby avoiding the scrutiny of authorities.  So what should done to end these abuses? Clearly, there are no easy answers to such complex and deep-rooted problems. But just as clearly, groups fighting modern-day slavery and those striving to protect the environment will make much more effective progress if they collaborate more closely on their mutual goals – and their shared objective of increasing the resilience of vulnerable communities and their environment.  In his recent address to the US Congress, Pope Francis referred to this kind of collaboration, saying: “Cooperation is a powerful resource in the battle to eliminate new global forms of slavery, born of grave injustices which can be overcome only through new policies and new forms of social consensus.” Many conditions are in place for this collaboration. Environmental defenders are often already working in communities that are vulnerable to human trafficking, creating a strong opportunity to collaborate and deploy basic resources to mitigate the risk of modern slavery. Likewise, those working to prevent servitude can benefit from conservation efforts, which retain local natural resources that provide economic benefits. Furthermore, the development of shared resources – such as maps of affected areas or training resources on risk indicators – can equip a new army of frontline workers to protect the most vulnerable people and conserve fragile ecosystems. This is certainly the approach of the organisation I lead, the Freedom Fund, in its efforts to combat slavery in the Thai seafood industry and end the use of forced labour to illegally deforest the Amazon in Brazil.

By tackling slavery – one of the world’s great evils – we’ll also significantly reduce destruction of the environment. Those are outcomes we can all agree on. • Nick Grono is CEO of the Freedom Fund"

"Talks between the French foreign minister, Laurent Fabius, and campaigners over the fate of a huge march before the forthcoming Paris climate summit have ended without agreement. In the wake of attacks in Paris last Friday, the French government proposed scaling down the protest from a march on 29 November – which organisers had hoped would draw hundreds of thousands of people – to a stationary rally.  One activist source said organisers would respond flexibly to Fabius’s suggestions, but that a “kettled” rally of 5,000 people held in the Paris suburbs “would not be acceptable”. The crucial UN climate conference, which has been in planning since 2011, will go ahead with heightened security, President François Hollande has said. But French security forces are understood to favour a blanket ban on public demonstrations around it. Fabius expressed fears on Tuesday about the risk of another terror attack and of the sort of crowd panic seen in Paris’s Place de République on 15 November, when hundreds of people fled a solidarity vigil after firecrackers were let off. “His [Fabius’s] message was very clear,” said Alix Mazounie, a Climate Action Network France campaigner who was in the meeting. “It was ‘I want to ensure that there is a form of public expression but that we need to potentially revise the format of these mobilisations’. His concern was for safety in open public spaces.” Campaigners argue that suspending civil society norms would play into the terrorists’ agenda. “We can think of few better responses to violence and terror than this movement’s push for peace and hope. No matter the final plans for the march in Paris, we urge people join other global climate marches around the world to show their solidarity and support,” said Alice Jay, of the campaign group Avaaz. “This is not time to step back,” Mazounie said. “We are in a country of free expression – that has always been the source of our power. This will be about unity, solidarity and peace, as well as climate change.  “We reaffirmed [to Fabius] our commitment to mobilisations across both weeks of the COP [the conference of the parties, the UN climate summit that opens on 30 November and runs for a fortnight].” Several protests are planned in this period, including a march on 29 November, a “People’s Summit” on 5 and 6 December, a “climate action zone” involving schools and community groups, and a day of civil disobedience at the summit’s end. More meetings are expected between the campaigners and French government officials over the coming days. A final decision is expected to be taken by the French prime minister, Manuel Valls. The Paris protests are being organised by Coalition Climat 21, an alliance of civil society groups, which has pledged to try to continue with public demonstrations in Paris, though in close consultation with the police. The issue has been a fraught one for many campaigners and organisers, not least because several were caught up in the horror of the Paris attacks. “We have friends who died,” said John Jordan, a prominent activist involved in plans for civil disobedience at the summit’s end. “One of my closest friends, an organiser, was in the middle of it all. But we can’t afford to let this derail our movement.” He added: “One idea is to decentralise the whole thing and tell people: ‘Now is the time to really take disobedience into your own cities.’ That was always part of the plan but maybe it needs to be ramped up.” However, French campaigners report that many organisations are no longer prepared to mobilise on the street ahead of the summit in the fearful atmosphere engulfing the French capital. At its opening, heads of state and government are expected to be in attendance, with heightened security for them. Barack Obama, Xi Jinping, Narendra Modi, Angela Merkel and David Cameron are all expected to attend. None of the more than 80 leaders who had confirmed have publicly pulled out of the conference, and US officials have said Obama will still attend despite the attacks.  The UN is also stepping up its security at the conference. Security within the venue and at exits and entrances is controlled by UN uniformed armed guards, but outside the Le Bourget complex and in the surrounding area the French security forces will be in command.

"It’s been 10 years since Lee Scott, the then-CEO of Walmart, publicly set the giant retailer on a path towards sustainability. In an influential speech, “Twenty-First Century Leadership”, Scott pledged that the company someday would be supplied entirely by renewable energy, that it would eliminate waste and that it would sell products that sustain people and the environment. Walmart’s not there yet. But on Tuesday, the company held a global milestone meeting to mark its progress after a decade, and no fair-minded person who attended could fail to be impressed with the company’s accomplishments. Walmart, already famously efficient by the mid-2000s, has become more so, driving efficiency and sustainable practices deeper into its supply chain so that food is grown with less fertilizer, stuff arrives with less packaging, trucks use less fuel and fisheries are better managed. But the 90-minute milestone meeting – a tedious, scripted and self-congratulatory affair – also painted a one-sided, relentlessly upbeat picture of Walmart and the planet. Rainbows and unicorns were the order of the day, as leaders of several of America’s biggest environmental groups paid obeisance to the powerful Bentonville retailer. There was nary a discouraging word about rising global temperatures or species loss. Here are some highlights and some issues that were notably absent from the script. In 2010, Walmart promised to eliminate 20m metric tons of greenhouse gas emissions from its global supply chain by the end of 2015. The company announced that it has exceeded this commitment early by eliminating 28.2m metric tons to date, the equivalent of taking more than 5.9m cars off the road for a year. Much of this came by asking suppliers in the food industry to work with farmers.  “Fertilizer use on farms was a big opportunity, perhaps the biggest in the entire supply chain,” said Elizabeth Sturcken of the Environmental Defense Fund, a key partner in the effort. Through such initiatives as Field to Market, an agricultural industry alliance that shares best practices, this initiative will spread far beyond Walmart. The company has doubled the efficiency of its fleet since 2005. It has improved the way it loads, routes and drives its trucks, and worked with tractor and trailer manufacturers on designs that, again, will spread widely. The company says it will save $1bn a year as a result. Walmart has been justly criticized for contributing to suburban sprawl by building vast stores surrounded by massive parking lots. But the company aims to permanently conserve at least one acre of priority wildlife habitat for every developed acre of the company’s current and future footprint.  In the last 10 years, Walmart, working with the National Fish and Wildlife Foundation, has helped preserve and restore more than 1m acres of wildlife habitat through 61 projects in 33 states through the Acres for America program. It’s the biggest corporate conservation program ever according to Jeff Trandahl, CEO of the foundation.  The company also showcased its efforts to improve the lives of people in its supply chain, through its support of the Alliance for Bangladesh Worker Safety and a new effort to combat human trafficking in the seafood industry. On climate change, arguably the most important environmental issue of the day, Walmart has made some progress – but not enough. After nearly a decade of rising greenhouse gas emissions, Walmart’s emissions from its stores and fleet peaked in 2012. They’ve declined slightly since then. That’s a major feat given the company continues to grow. Holding emissions steady, or driving them down, while adding stores is hard to do. But Walmart has failed to set science-based targets for its climate emissions. Put another way, its goals are not ambitious enough to align with the global effort to keep warming below the level that scientists say is needed to prevent some of the most severe impacts of climate change. Walmart is falling short on the climate issue in part because its progress towards the goal of buying 100% renewable energy has been slow. Globally, about 26% of its energy comes from renewable sources; in the US, it’s about 13%, and that includes electricity from the grid that happens to come from renewable sources. Walmart ranks number 17 on EPA’s latest list of green power users. Because Walmart is so focused on controlling costs – its mantra is: “We save people money so they can live better” – the company won’t spend more for energy than it needs to. Kathleen McLaughlin, Walmart’s chief sustainability officer, told me by phone that the company buys wind or solar power “where the economics work for us”. That’s why Walmart buys more of its renewable energy in California, Texas, New Jersey, Arizona and Hawaii, where policies favor solar or wind and electricity costs. What Walmart hasn’t done yet is become a strong voice for clean energy policies, by throwing its support behind the Obama administration’s Clean Power Plan, which regulates utilities, or an economy-wide carbon price. “We’re not economists,” McLaughlin said, when asked why. “We’re not experts on other industries.” That may be true, but Lee Scott also wasn’t an expert on sustainability when he summoned the courage to publicly commit Walmart to achieving big, challenging environmental goals. Doug McMillon, who is now Walmart’s CEO, and Rob Walton, the company’s longtime chairman of the board, encouraged him to speak up and step out. They can now take the company to the next level, if they choose to do so."
"They are humanity’s hope for tomorrow, but each faces a future that looks increasing bleak and uncertain. Born in four different parts of the globe, these children came into the world in the weeks leading up to the Copenhagen climate conference in December 2009. At the time, the Observer described the lives of these young people as their families struggled to cope with the impact of climate change.  Now, before the Paris climate summit at the end of the month, we have returned to meet those children and show how they have lived with the consequences of the 2009 Copenhagen summit’s failure to reach a deal to limit nations’ outputs of greenhouse gases. Global warming has continued and droughts have spread. At the same time, sea levels are still rising and ice caps are shrinking while food is becoming increasingly scarce for many people. The world is again at a crossroads. In Paris, our leaders will be asked to agree to another deal that could limit carbon emissions from factories and vehicles that burn fossil fuels. Each nation will be asked to put forward proposals to cut their output of carbon dioxide so that it will be possible to have an even chance of limiting global warming to a 2C increase over temperatures that were experienced in pre-industrial times. If they succeed, then the hopes for the next generation – those whose lives are described in these reports, gathered by the Catholic charity Cafod – will receive a welcome boost. If our leaders fail again, however, then the bleak lives outlined on these pages are destined to become even grimmer. The baby girl born to Elisa da Silva just before the Copenhagen climate summit in 2009 had not yet been named when our first report was published. Today, six-year-old Denislania da Silva attends school, plays with her five brothers and sisters and hopes one day to become a teacher. However, life among the indigenous Macuxi people is still hard – though there has been one recent cause for hope that the Macuxi will be able to survive in their threatened homelands around Barro, in north Roraima, close to the border with Venezuela. In 2009, Brazil’s supreme court ruled in favour of the Macuxi in their battle against farmers who wanted to turn the region’s marshlands – where local men hunt and fish – into rice plantations. The indigenous land there should remain as a single, continuous territory, it was decreed, while unlawful land occupiers were also ordered to leave the region. “The white people used to occupy our land and wouldn’t let us fish or walk in the fields because everywhere was fenced off,” Elisa recalls. “Today it is open to us.” The development is encouraging, though the Macuxi still face an uncertain future as the area is now being ravaged by the effects of climate change. “I have six children at home and worry a lot about not having enough food for them, especially when I wake up in the morning with nothing,” she says. “I say, ‘Oh dear God, I have nothing to give the children’, but then someone invites me to work and then I can go and buy food and give it to them.” While Elisa works, her husband Denanson hunts and fishes with the other men of the community. Compared to the past, there have been many improvements, she adds. “There was no transport in my day. Today we have buses. Nor did we have taps to fill our water bottles to put in the fridge. My hand used to be scratched from grating cassava. Today there is an electric mill and I no longer get tired from using a tipiti [a kind of grater]. I was always reminding the children of this.” But other developments are not nearly so welcome. Roraima borders the Amazon region of Brazil, one of the world’s most environmentally sensitive regions. Almost 40% of the world’s remaining tropical forests grow here – though the threat of deforestation, caused by rising temperatures and the spread of farming, remains a serious worry. “The weather has changed a lot,” says Elisa. “It is getting drier and there no longer seems to be a distinct winter or summer: the weather has become constantly dry. It isn’t like before, when there was a rainy season and then a summer. The seasons have clearly changed. Today our water system is drying up and we have to struggle to maintain it. “Our river used to be abundant but it’s suddenly dried up. The fish that we used to catch have disappeared. Even when there is only rotten old fish, people will buy it. Our wildlife is also leaving – all because of the drought. I sometimes wonder if God is making us die from drought.” In 2009, the Mutonka family had just celebrated the birth of their son Olomaina. Then, they were fearful of the future: droughts were increasing in severity and their cattle were dying. Those fears have since been justified. Of the 284 cattle that they have owned over the past six years, they have lost 271. The area has had no rain in the last year and the family regularly goes to bed without eating. Olomaina’s mother, Noomirisho Mutonka, now fears the worst. “If the drought continues all our animals will die and we will be left with nothing. We will have no money to pay our children’s school fees. This will lead to our children dropping out. Yet they are the future of this family. They are the ones we will rely on. If they get education, they will get employment and will become breadwinners. And they love school. They are very bright.” Noomirisho belongs to the Masai people and lives near the town of Kajiado, south of Nairobi. Droughts in this part of Kenya used to occur every three years but in the past few decades their frequency and duration have increased. More than 80% of the Masai in the Magadi area of south Kenya have lost cattle as a result of these increasing droughts. By 2020 it is expected that more than 75 million people will suffer from water stress in east Africa as global warming takes its inexorable grip. The amount of land that can support the growing of crops will also be halved as a result, according to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. “In the past, it rained from April to June and then again in December so our dams were never dry,” says Noomirisho. “Nowadays, we can go two years without rain. During that time our animals become emaciated and die.” Noomirisho wakes around 5am to prepare breakfast for her children before she takes her cattle and goats to graze. She makes the six-hour round trip for water every second day, travelling with a donkey that carries 30 litres in two jerry cans. “On the day, I go to fetch water, I cannot go to graze the cattle because I travel for six hours to the water point and back. When I do take the animals to graze I often have to travel far because of the dry conditions.” The main source is an abandoned quarry that contains very salty water. “It is all we have now. The Olkejuado river dried up a long time ago and so we have nowhere else to fetch water from. That is what we have to drink.” Six years ago, Joana and Armando de Oliveira, who live in the village of Au-Hun on the north coast of Timor-Leste, were celebrating the birth of their daughter Fretelina. She was the couple’s third child. Life was hard at the time but has only worsened as the climate has deteriorated, leaving the couple fearful for their offspring. “My preoccupation is that now I am getting old, if I die, who will look after my children and sustain them?” says Armando. In 2009, the island was afflicted by periodic droughts and wells sometimes ran dry. Maize production was badly hit on several occasions. Unfortunately conditions have hardened since then. “The community here talks about climate change,” says Armando, who work as a security guard at the nearby Technique School. “Six years ago the climate was better, normal and not as hot as it is now. It’s so very hot and this heat is having an impact on our lives, particularly with my children who cannot get a good sleep.” The family depend on Joana’s parents for shelter. “I started building my own house but I do not have enough money to continue,” Armando says. “In reality, sometimes my family and I do not have breakfast or lunch, we just eat dinner.” In the dry season, life is bearable. However, things change in the rainy season, which lasts from November to May. “We are discontented because the roof leaks and water sinks in. The wall is made from woven fibre and if it rains we find it very difficult to find food.” The community around Au-Hun relies on subsistence with local people growing all their own food, managing livestock and securing water. This is not easy. Both water and electricity supplies are erratic, for a start. “And now the government is charging us for clean water and electricity and we are not able to pay,” says Armando. Poor yields affects a family’s resistance to disease, cuts livelihoods and, in the end, reduces access to basic service such as education and healthcare. Of Armando’s three children, only Fretelina now goes to school. “I hope my children will have a better future and go to school,” he says. According to climate scientists, temperatures are expected to rise between 0.88C and 3.68C by 2070. At the same time, rain patterns will be disrupted and droughts will be far more frequent. It is a grim forecast, though Armando remains hopeful that his community will ultimately prevail. “Life in my community involves helping others. Sometimes there is a conflict in family life but as in community problems between youngsters, we can resolve issues.” Tayab Mallik has been a rickshaw puller in Bangladesh for 30 years and the strain of this life is beginning to tell. “I’m getting old and I am losing my strength,” he says. “I have breathing problems. It troubles me in the summer mostly due to the rising temperatures. But being rickshaw puller you have to be very strong. If you are not strong enough, then you will fail to earn money.” Married with five daughters and a son, including Maria, who was born in 2009, Mallik’s main fears are for his family. “I want them to be literate. I want to see them going to universities and doing well-paid jobs. I don’t want them to pull rickshaws. But if something happens to me, who is going to feed them or pay their tuition fees? I know no one. Life is brutal.” Mallik earns £2 to £3 a day. “It’s really hard to feed a family of seven with this income,” he says. “I cannot remember when I bought meat for my family and I feel bad when I cannot buy fruit for my children. I know that they need it.” Tayab and his wife, Majeda Begum, live with the children in Mostortona in Bangladesh’s Barguna district, which is suffering desperately from rising sea levels caused by global warming. High levels of salinity affect soil productivity, agriculture and vegetation. Drinking water is polluted. At the same time, the area has been devastated by increasingly vicious cyclones that bring tidal surges and destroy homes. More and more people are migrating to cities as land is lost to erosion. In 2009, the situation was serious and it has only worsened over the years. “Everyone in our community now knows that climate change is now a big threat. Everyone is tired of speaking about it. We are poor so there is no way out. “The river Pyra is about two miles from my home and due to climate change the water level is rising every year. You never know when you have to swim at night rather than sleep in your bed,” Mallik says. “Increasing temperatures are another threat that cannot be denied. All in all, my life is full of threats. I don’t know what is going to be next.” This stress is shared by his children, he believes. “I think it is hampering the natural flow of their lives and their education. At their age, I used to play all day long in the field. But my children are spending their time thinking about how to cope with a changing climate. This is not a proper childhood.”"
"Textbooks in California public schools are misleading students on climate change, with material that expresses doubt over whether it is real and promotes the view that increasing temperatures may be beneficial, according to a Stanford University study. An analysis of four key science texts given to sixth-grade students in California showed that the books “framed climate change as uncertain in the scientific community – both about whether it is occurring as well as about its human-causation”.  Researchers studied 2,770 words used in the books, which are given to students as their first introduction to climate science, and found that the widely accepted opinion that the climate is changing and that humans are the main cause wasn’t represented in the books. Whereas California science textbooks on other subjects list facts, the books focused on climate change use conditional words like “could”, “might” or “may” throughout. Three of the textbooks are called Focus on Earth Science, published separately by Prentice Hall, Glencoe-McGraw-Hill and CPO Science. The fourth is called Earth Science, published by Holt, Rinehart & Winston. The Prentice Hall book, first published in 2008, states: “Not all scientists agree about the causes of global warming. Some scientists think that the 0.7C degree rise in global temperatures over the past 120 years may be due in part to natural variations in climate.” The same book stresses that climate change “could have some positive effects”. “Farmers in some areas that are now cool could plant two crops a year instead of one,” it reads. “Places that are too cold for farming today could become farmland. However, many effects of global warming are likely to be less positive.” Meanwhile, Earth Science has a passage that reads: “Until recently, climatic changes were connected only to natural causes. However, studies indicate that human activities may have an influence on climate change.”  The Stanford University study concludes that the language used in the textbooks is likely to promote doubt over the science of climate change and dampen any sense of urgency in dealing with the issue.  “Instead of saying climate change is happening, it’s: ‘Climate change may be happening,’ which isn’t what is generally known and understood,” said KC Busch, of Stanford Graduate School of Education. Busch conducted the work with assistant professor Diego Roman, a linguist at Southern Methodist University in Dallas.  “The inference throughout these books is to create doubt,” Busch said. “Perhaps the textbook companies are making them palatable in a politically charged environment in order to get published. I think they are softening the language. I’m shocked that California has allowed them, to be honest.”   Busch said textbooks shouldn’t be prescriptive works that “scare the wits” out of sixth graders, but should accurately represent the science.  “There is an ideology in these books. They use the same kind of language seen on climate change denier blogs,” she said. “These books should present accurate information and then let students explore the issues further. Saying that ‘if temperatures go up, climate change could occur’ is completely misleading. We don’t want children to be brainwashed; we just need to be clear about what scientists know and what they are uncertain of. We know temperatures are going up, that humans are the main cause that this is causing climate change.”  Busch said that uncertainty over climate science propagated by textbooks only adds to confusion over the issue. Recent research by Yale University found that only 57% of US teenagers understood that global warming was fueled by human activity such as burning fossil fuels. This is, however, still slightly higher than the 50% of US adults who accept the science. The California State Board of Education produces a list of recommended textbooks that school districts can choose from, though they are not mandatory. The board said on Monday that a new round of textbooks was currently in development and would be introduced in 2018. Three of the publishing companies did not respond by Monday evening to requests for comment from the Guardian. A spokeswoman for Pearson, the company that owns Prentice Hall, said: “Pearson curriculum is developed by expert author teams and is reviewed by independent, academic reviewers.  “We always are committed to presenting balanced, unbiased, and accurate material, and welcome the opportunity to meet with parents and educators to listen to their concerns about textbook content.” Scientists have known for more than a century that certain gases, like carbon dioxide, trap heat. Last year, more than 32bn tonnes of these greenhouse gases were pumped into the atmosphere by human activity, including power plants, agriculture and transport. These emissions have helped push the world’s average temperature up by around 1C over the past century, fuelling sea level rises and extreme weather events.  Representatives from nearly 200 countries will gather in Paris next week for highly anticipated talks on how to reduce emissions and stay within an internationally agreed target of ensuring the world doesn’t breach 2C of warming. Analysis has shown that emissions cuts already announced by emitters – including the US – will still take temperatures to around 2.7C above the pre-industrial average, leading to extreme heatwaves, coastal erosion and food insecurity for many countries.

"The past, present and long term future of the Antarctic ice sheet and its surrounding ice shelves have been news over the past few months. I’m part of a team with a new study published in Nature predicting its future. You might think: what’s new? Our understanding of Antarctica is changing at an ever faster rate. For most of the time since discovering the continent we’ve thought of the ice sheet at the end of the world as a sleeping giant, stretching herself out over long ice ages but unmoved on fluttering human time scales. So when scientists began to predict the effects of global warming in the late 1970s most thought Antarctica, imperious, would take thousands of years to respond.  But a few saw instead a profound vulnerability. US glaciologists Hughes, Weertman and Mercer were among those to predict that the parts of the ice sheet lying on bedrock below sea level might be so sensitive to ocean warming or damage to their surrounding ice shelves that they would recede, retreat, disintegrate…collapse. They warned that, if true, their hypothesis of self-sustaining ice losses – ‘Marine Ice Sheet Instability’ – would mean serious consequences for sea level rise. Four decades later, recent studies have suggested part of the West Antarctic ice sheet is indeed unstable, triggered by warm water flowing onto the continental shelf for at least a few decades. We don’t yet know if humans have made this more likely, and until now we also haven’t had confidence in predictions of how much sea level rise could result from this region and others that could become unstable from climate change. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change decided in 2013 there was insufficient evidence to make an assessment any more precise than “it would not exceed several tenths of a metre” this century. We predict Antarctic ice sheet instability will most likely contribute 10cm sea level rise by the end of the century but is extremely unlikely to contribute more than 30 cm. So ‘several’, for us, is ‘about three’. We’re not the first to predict the consequences of Antarctic instability. So what’s new? We are the first to use all three elements I think are essential for climate predictions: physics, observations, and statistics. First, we need physical laws – which we calculate with computer models – to give us the bounds of plausible behaviour (such as how fast ice can flow) and to account for how the future is different from the past (such as new drivers of change, or new parts of the planet responding). Of course we can’t make perfect computer models, because our knowledge and computing power are limited, so they have simplifications. We need observations of the real world to test these physical laws and how we calculate and simplify them in models. Finally, we need statistics to combine the information from models and observations (using, in fact, the same method as a spam filter) and predict probabilities of sea level rise: in other words, to put a number on our uncertainty about the future. Previous studies had only one or two of these. For example, they used a computer model of Antarctica (or part of it), but didn’t test it with observations or estimate its uncertainty. Or they were based on extrapolation of past observations into the future, without using much physical theory of how things might behave differently. Some were surveys of expert opinion. We used a computer model to simulate the Antarctic ice sheet from the recent past up to the year 2200: not just once, but 3000 times. Each version was slightly different to account for ‘known unknowns’ in the physical laws and simplifications describing how ice flows and slides, the map of the bedrock beneath the ice sheet, and when instability might be triggered in each region under the mid-high climate scenario called A1B. This gave us a range of model predictions for sea level rise: three thousand possible futures fanning out from today. We compared the simulations of the recent past with observations from the region we think is already unstable, and gave each a score from best to worst. We used the scores to give greater weight to the model versions that were most realistic: those with the most successful simplifications of the physical laws. Testing our model with observations means we are more confident in its predictions, and the statistics mean we can quantify how confident. Crucially, that means we could put a probability on any possible value of sea level rise from Antarctic instability. We predict there is a 1 in 20 chance it will be more than 30 cm by the end of the century, a 1 in 6 chance it will exceed 21 cm, a 50:50 chance of exceeding 12 cm, and so on. What does this mean for sea level rise? Think of two kinds of prediction we might be interested in: the most likely and worst case outcomes. Our predictions for the first are similar to the IPCC – just a few centimetres higher – so they don’t much change their assessment that global sea level rise from all sources will likely be 42 to 80 cm by the end of the century for A1B. But for the upper limit, the IPCC made their quite vague statement because they judged the available predictions were not solid enough evidence. Those predictions reached up to one metre from Antarctic instability alone. If correct, these would hugely increase the upper limit of total sea level rise. It’s this wild card, pessimistic outcome – the 1 in 20 bit of bad luck – that we have predicted with more thorough methods than before. And our results are much lower. We find even half a metre is outside the bounds of physical plausibility in our model, requiring rates of ice loss that violate theoretical limits or the whole ice sheet becoming immediately unstable. Does this mean climate sceptics should be dancing in the aisles, because our study rules out these very high contributions? Not at all. When combined with other contributions, our predictions represent a significant challenge for adapting to sea level rise. Climate sceptics and lukewarmers like to focus on the most optimistic predictions, the best possible outcomes. So here they are, just for them: we predict there is a 1 in 20 chance Antarctic instability will contribute less than 5 cm by 2100. But it’s clear we should look at the entire range of predictions if we want to make informed decisions about climate risks. Uncertainty in climate science is not a bad thing. Neither is revising the range of our predictions. That’s what science is: a process of improving our understanding in the light of new observations and theory. If you’re interested in doing a PhD in uncertainty about Antarctic instability, we have a project for you. It uses one of a new generation of ice sheet models that calculates more of the physics and needs fewer simplifications. I look forward to the next generation of studies – and scientists – improving on our predictions. Tamsin Edwards is a lecturer in environmental sciences at the Open University.

"When politicians meet in Paris next week to negotiate a global climate deal, their commitments will have far-reaching consequences. Pastoralist communities in Somaliland are among those who have a vital stake in the talks, as a changing climate continues to have a devastating impact. Clár Ní Chonghaile visited Somaliland and met people reeling from drought and cyclones in a region that “could be considered the canary in the mine of a world that is getting hotter, and where extreme weather is becoming more common”. Meanwhile in Kenya, climate funds have been mobilised to create programmes to help farmers become more resilient in the face of changing weather patterns. Read about the projects helping women regenerate trees, harvest rainwater and grow more diverse crops.  To mark universal children’s day, 14-year-old Oscar writes about fleeing his war-ravaged home in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and his hope for other children living in conflict areas. “I am desperate to help these children and to help make a world where children can have a happy childhood, a place where they can feel comfortable, have a safe home, access to education, and enjoy a life that is taken for granted around much of the world,” he writes. And on the refugee crisis, Helen Clark, UN Development Programme administrator, and Erik Solheim, chairman of the OECD development assistance committee, argue that spending aid money on taking in refugees poses a threat to long-term development. They write that investing in the sustainable development goals will help to alleviate such crises and reduce the likelihood of them occurring again.

I use the word killer’: Maasai speak out One in three women worldwide faces violence in her lifetime. To mark the final day of this year’s 16 days of activism to end violence against women, Guardian Global development is hosting an event organised by ActionAid to discuss what needs to be done to ensure global commitments to end violence are upheld. Among the speakers is Rashida Manjoo, former UN special rapporteur on violence against women. The event will be held from 10am to 1pm on Thursday 10 December 2015 at the Guardian, Kings Place, 90 York Way, London N1 9GU.

"Power generators would be forced to pay for the closure of a competitor’s dirty brown-coal fired plant under a radical plan that could help Australia slow the continued increase in electricity sector greenhouse emissions without a carbon price or expensive government subsidies. The idea – from Australian National University academics Frank Jotzo and Salim Mazouz – offers the government hope of meeting the long-term emission reduction targets it will promise in Paris and provides the energy sector with a solution to the problem of oversupply that has forced the mothballing or under-use of less polluting types of generation. Old high-polluting brown coal-fired plants, particularly in Victoria’s La Trobe Valley, were the biggest winners after the carbon price was abolished with coal generation hitting a three-year high of 75.6% of the east coast market in October, a trend that makes it almost impossible for Australia to meet its promises of long-term cuts in greenhouse emissions even with increased renewable generation from the renewable energy target. Under the plan the big brown-coal generators, near the end of their operational life, would submit bids for how much money they would need to receive in order to shut straight away. The cost of the winning bid would not be paid by the government but would be spread across all the other generators, in proportion to their own carbon dioxide emissions. The generators that continued to operate would benefit from an increased electricity price and the prospect of running their other plants closer to capacity, and the government would finally have a way to reduce emissions from Australia’s electricity sector, a task too expensive for its $2.5bn emissions reduction fund.  The increase in the retail electricity price would be small – somewhere between 1% and 2% according to rough calculations based on a one-off payment for closure of between $400m and $1billion, shared between the remaining power generators. And the reduction in greenhouse emissions from closing a big brown-coal-fired plant would be between 2m and 7m tonnes of carbon dioxide a year, even taking into account that some of the generation would move to black-coal-fired stations. Origin Energy, which owns Australia’s largest power station, Eraring, has proposed a progressive phase-out of brown coal generation in response to a Victorian government review of climate policy. It says it will shut the black-coal-fired Eraring at the end of its technical life. AGL, which owns Loy Yang, Bayswater and Liddell power stations and is Australia’s single largest greenhouse gas emitter, has also called on the government to regulate that brown-coal-fired power stations close when they reach their scheduled shelf life, about 50 years. It says it will shut its plants at that point. And the Hong Kong-listed CLP Group, which owns Energy Australia – the company that holds Yallourn power station – has demanded a government policy to solve the “chronic oversupply” in Australia’s wholesale electricity market. But each suggestion hits the problem that the current policy gives individual companies an incentive to keep their plants going, because whoever closes first gives their competitors the advantage of a reduction in supply and consequent increase in the wholesale price, and does not provide any incentive for them to shut sooner. By regulating the order of closure, or trying to bring it forward, governments would be picking winners and losers. Jotzo, associate professor at the Crawford school of public policy, says the idea could be refined after detailed modelling.  In an article explaining their plan, Jotzo and Mazouz write that “without a carbon price in place, the running costs of brown-coal-fired plants are extremely low: they sit right next to open-cut coalmines and there is no alternative use for the brown coal, so the fuel cost is minimal”.  “... So there is the risk that the next large power station to shut down is one that produces electricity with much less carbon output than the brown-coal plants, and that the high-emitting brown-coal plants stay put.” They say it would “not be politically acceptable for the government to pay large amounts of taxpayers’ dollars to the owners of an old high-polluting plant” but singling out one or more plans and forcing them to close “would similarly be politically unacceptable”. “Under our approach, government regulates that one or more plants need to exit the electricity market, but leaves it to a competitive bidding process to determine which plant will close and at what payment level. Plants bid competitively over the payment they require for closure, the regulator chooses the most cost effective bid. The plants remaining in operation then make financial transfers to the plant that exits, in line with their emissions.  “Such a mechanism can provide emissions savings from plant closure at least cost, avoid budgetary costs by sourcing the payments for closure from the plants remaining in production, and provide some incentives to adjust the power mix to reduce emissions,” they argue. Both the Gillard government and the original version of the coalition’s “Direct Action” policy produced from opposition envisaged payments-for-closure for brown-coal fired plants, but in both cases the idea was abandoned."
"George Monbiot (There’s a population crisis all right. But probably not the one you’re thinking of, 20 November) is right to point out the devastating impacts of expanding livestock operations around the world. Yet, in dismissing the relationship between human population and climate, he contravenes the IPCC’s November 2014 report for policymakers, which states “Anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions have increased since the pre-industrial era, driven largely by economic and population growth, and are now higher than ever.” Monbiot presents an outdated “either-or” approach to sustainability, where wiser dietary choices must supersede slowing down and stopping rapid human population growth as an environmental priority. This is a needless and false choice. Meat production is intricately tied to global population – in fact, the industry’s justification for increasing the number of livestock on the planet is to feed the growing number of people. To avoid catastrophic climate change, we need a “both-and” approach, where intergenerational and sustained efforts to progressively slow down global population trajectories occur alongside efforts to promote diets with more plant-based foods and drastically reduce meat production. Human-rights-enhancing efforts to ensure women have reproductive autonomy and gender equity, and committed activism to healthier, sustainable food systems, are not in moral conflict.Joe BishDirector of issue advocacy, Population Media CenterStephanie FeldsteinPopulation and sustainability director, Center for Biological Diversity • As someone who has been interested in population issues for over 40 years – yes it is not just something involving “post-reproductive white men” – I found George Monbiot’s article both annoying and patronising. Like many greens who do not get the population issue, he seeks to suggest that those who do are only interested in stopping “brown people reproducing” by introducing one-child or similar draconian policies. In a way these greens are worse than climate change deniers. At least the latter do not trust an interpretation of complex scientific issues. The effects of population increase are all around us in the rising cost of housing, increasingly difficult commuting to work, and a lack of school places, not to mention the wider-world issues of mass migration from areas of high population growth because of the resulting food shortages and wars. None of this is going to be sorted out by eating fewer animals. Sooner or later we have to abandon the human Ponzi scheme of population growth, whatever the short-term difficulties.Nigel LongKeynsham, Somerset • Join the debate – email guardian.letters@theguardian.com  • The first letter above was amended 23 November 2015.
