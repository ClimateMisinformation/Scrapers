"Can organic agriculture mitigate climate change? If you were to simply Google the question – which, being a millennial I have done – you would be led to believe that it does. I love a good underdog story and, like The Little Engine That Could, I think a lot of things are possible through optimism and hard work. But advocates of organic farming, like the United Nations Food and Drug Administration, think that it can mitigate climate change without the hard work necessary to truly make it happen.  A recent study by the Rodale Institute found that, if all conventional agricultural land started using organic farming practices, such as mulch tilling and seasonal crop rotations, agriculture could – in theory – capture 100% of annual carbon emissions. The study also found that organic farms have lower greenhouse emissions than conventional farms due to avoidance of synthetic fertilizers, which are compounded with nitrogen and require fossil fuels to produce. However, some studies have argued that it conclusion is premature as lower emissions depend on the amount fertilizers used on organic and conventional farms and the amount of food that can be produced per acre of land.   In a research article I published in 2014, regarding the ability of organic farming to reduce greenhouse gas emission in the Agriculture and Human Values, I argued that recent patterns in the organic market in the United States limit the ability of organic farming to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. In the course of my research, I wasn’t all too surprised when I found that for every acre increase in certified organic farmland there wan an increase in greenhouse gas emissions from agricultural production in the United States. That’s not because I didn’t believe what advocates like the USDA, Rodale institute and United Nations say it can be, but because of all the economic factors influencing the organic market.  The process of carbon sequestration, which allows atmospheric carbon dioxide to be absorbed by plants through photosynthesis and stored as carbon in biomass and soils, relies on strict organic management practices, such as crop rotations and mulch tilling. If you look at the USDA standards for organically produced goods, you will find that the soil management practices necessary to promote carbon sequestration are encouraged, but not required. Instead, the USDA uses its seal to create a ceiling and a floor for organic practices, allowing organic to be a profitable industry. It no longer matters, at least within conventional grocery markets, if one farmer’s organic standards result in higher green house gas emissions than another because, in the eyes of the consumer at, say, Whole Foods, they are the same. But the Earth’s climate will definitely know the difference.  To top it all off, a big organic farm is going to make much more money than a small one because their practices allow them to produce more high-in-demand goods. And all that machinery necessary to maintain big organic farms – necessitated by the choice to refrain from using synthetic chemicals – essentially cancel out any reduction in carbon emissions that any farm would normally obtain from relying strictly on organic fertilizers and pesticides.  My research therefore showed no significant reduction in greenhouse gas emissions from agriculture over time as organic farming grew. It makes economic sense to have big mono-cropping farms that use a lot of machines if you can afford them: the problem is those practices don’t really help at reducing greenhouse gas emissions.  Until we address the problem of many organic farms being all too similar to their conventional counterparts, organic farming will never be that little farming movement that could. Instead, the organic farming that we have in the United States will be the movement that thinks it can – but really can’t."
"The leader of Canada’s biggest province has escalated her feud with the country’s prime minister, accusing Stephen Harper of obstructing efforts to fight climate change and calling on Canadians to make global warming a decisive issue in the coming elections. In an interview with the Guardian, Kathleen Wynne, the Liberal premier of Ontario, brought long-simmering tensions with Harper over energy and economic policy to a rollicking boil, repeatedly calling out the Conservative prime minister for blocking efforts to cut carbon pollution.  When it came to fighting climate change, Harper was an obstruction rather than a help, she said. “There isn’t a collaborative process around any of this, and that is a real problem because it means that we are not supporting each other and we are not pushing each other in a constructive way. It is very confrontational,” she said. “We are taking action in spite of [the federal government], quite frankly,” Wynne said. “The federal government at this point is just not helpful.” Despite her strong language, Wynne opposes a ban on new projects and pipelines in the Alberta tar sands – the fastest-growing source of Canada’s greenhouse gas emissions, and the reason Canada is the only industrialised country to fall short of its emissions targets. The Ontario premier reached an agreement with other provincial leaders on Friday that campaigners said would expand tar sands pipelines without sufficient protections for the environment. The new national energy strategy does not include targets for reducing greenhouse gas emissions.  In his nine years as prime minister, Harper has vigorously promoted the tar sands, presiding over an expansion of production and lobbying for more exports and pipelines to build up Canada into his vision of an energy superpower. But Harper’s vision for Canada ran into growing international criticism of the country’s rising greenhouse gas emissions, and exposed the economy to the volatility of global oil prices. In the run-up to the 19 October election, opinion polls show Harper trailing or tied with the leftwing New Democratic party, and Wynne’s Liberal party – which is led at federal level by Justin Trudeau – coming in third in a tight race. Speaking on the sidelines of the Climate Summit of the Americas in Toronto last week, Wynne added to growing criticism of Harper’s economic and environmental policies, saying that the prime minister was not a partner in the fight against climate change. “I think there is a lot more that he can do. I think the position that the federal government has taken has not been helpful,” Wynne said. “That’s not news to anyone, because the fact that I have been calling for a partner, and the fact that we have been saying we need the federal government to be working with us and to be doing more, that’s public knowledge,” she went on. “That call is born out of my disappointment at what the federal government has been doing.” She noted that Harper had failed to either attend the regional climate meeting or to send Leona Aglukkaq, the environment minister. Harper also stayed away from the premiers’ meeting on Friday.  Wynne called on Canadians to vote on climate change in the October elections. “I hope that climate change and taking action on climate change is an election issue,” she said. As premier, Wynne has championed the efforts of Ontario and other provinces to deal with climate change. Last week’s meeting of 22 states, provinces and territories called for setting a price on carbon. Ontario won positive attention when it phased out the use of coal in its power plants last year.  But the environmental commissioner said on 7 July that the province would have to do much more to meet its 2020 target for cutting greenhouse gas emissions.  Wynne’s advisers said she hoped to cut carbon pollution from transport by investing in public transit and easing congestion. Climate change looms even larger over Harper, who faces increasing criticism at home and abroad tying Canada’s economic future to the development of the tar sands. At international climate conferences, the Harper government now is routinely handed out mock “fossil” awards for its failure to deal with climate change. Campaigners have accused Harper of treading on the rights of government scientists.  The expansion of Alberta’s tar sands production on Harper’s watch has turned Canada into the world’s biggest carbon polluter on a per capita basis, according to the World Resources Institute, a respected environmental thinktank.  Wynne said Canada should have put forward a more ambitious climate pledge ahead of the UN negotiations in Paris. Canada will not meet its 2020 target for cutting emissions because of the tar sands, and it has retreated still further from those earlier promises in its pledge ahead of the Paris climate talks. Economists and energy experts have said that Canada cannot hope to meet its climate commitments without tackling the tar sands. But Wynne – although she acknowledged findings by scientists that the majority of those deposits needs to stay in the ground to avoid catastrophic climate change – rejected the idea of a ban on new production. “I don’t think we can pretend that making some kind of unilateral federal government decision around Alberta’s economy at this point would be a) that it’s possible or b) that it would be helpful,” she said. Campaigners needed to recognise that “fossil fuels will be with us for some time”, she said."

"  Ice in the Arctic staged a surprise revival in 2013, bucking the long-term trend of decline, according to the first analysis of the entire ice cap’s volume. The revival was the result of cooler temperatures that year and suggests that, if global warming was curbed, the Arctic might recover more rapidly than previously thought.  The shrinking Arctic ice cap is one of the best known impacts of climate change. The indication that it could be reversible is rare good news for a region where climate change has driven up temperatures far faster than the global average. The extent of Arctic ice has shrunk by 40% since the late 1970s, when satellite measurements began. But getting comprehensive data on the thickness of the ice, rather than just its area, was difficult until the European Space Agency launched the Cryosat satellite in 2010. The satellite’s 88 million measurements, analysed in Nature Geoscience, show that from 2010-12 the Arctic ice volume fell by 14%, in step with the warming trend of the last few decades. But in 2013, the ice volume jumped up by 41%. “It’s fair to say that none of us were really expecting that,” said Rachel Tilling, at University College London and who led the study. But she dismissed the idea of a wider recovery of the ice cap, saying that climate change is still driving average temperatures up, despite significant variation from one year to the next. “It was a cold year – that happens.”  In fact, while colder than recent years, the temperature in 2013 would have been regarded as normal as recently as the late 1990s. “This allowed thick sea ice to persist northwest of Greenland because there were fewer days when it could melt,” said Tilling. The research is significant as it shows the Arctic ice cap may be more resilient than expected. Tilling said: “You see Arctic sea ice as dwindling and in decline, but then there is a cold year and you get some of the ice back. It shows there is hope for Arctic sea ice, if you can turn the clock back to colder temperatures, which would need huge reductions in carbon emissions.” In 2014, the melting trend continued with a fall of 6% in volume compared to 2013. The latest data on the extent of Arctic ice, from the US National Snow and Ice Data Center, shows that the cap in June was the third smallest recorded by satellite measurements. The NSIDC warned that: “Persistently warm conditions and increased melting late in June may have set the stage for rapid ice loss in the coming weeks.” Scientists usually consider a few decades of data is required to assess climate trends. “You can’t look at the long term trend with only five years of data, which is why we can’t talk about an Arctic recovery,” said Tilling. She is concerned that Cryosat-2 data collection is set to stop after just seven years: “We need Arctic-wide thickness measurements of the ice, but Cryosat is only commissioned until 2017.”  Co-author Professor Andy Shepherd, also at UCL said: “Understanding what controls the amount of Arctic sea ice takes us one step closer to making reliable predictions of how long it will last, which is important because it is a key component of Earth’s climate system.”"
"In America and Australia there are government health warnings to parents about the danger of their children getting burned on playground equipment that has been heated up in the summer sun. The sun can be so hot that even plastic coatings and other materials that replace traditional metal surfaces can be enough to burn a toddler’s skin, according to the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission.  Part of the problem is that young skin burns more easily and the child does not immediately recognise the danger. To avoid the problem slides in America are placed in the shade or facing away from the sun. This has not been considered a hazard in England but it is now. Last week the burns sustained by a one-year-old boy in Leighton Buzzard in Bedfordshire made the headlines in the local paper. In a temperature of 26C he climbed up a sheet metal ramp in the children’s recreation ground and seriously burned a leg and hand. Large blisters developed. These had to be pierced and his wounds dressed in the accident and emergency department of the local hospital. There is now a great deal of discussion between the local council, insurers and RoSPA, the accident prevention experts, on how to proceed now that the increasingly hot British sun is seen as a safety hazard on children’s play equipment. According to the Americans even in temperatures as low 23C (74F) the sun can heat up equipment enough to burn. At slightly higher temperatures metal can reach 50C (140F) – a serious hazard for a child."

"The past 15 years have yielded unprecedented gains in the fight against extreme poverty and hunger, with emerging economies heralding record economic growth.  The number of people living in extreme poverty is half of what it was in 1990, as is the proportion of people without access to safe drinking water. More than 3m deaths from malaria have been averted since 2000. Women’s labor force participation has jumped significantly. And technological innovations – led by the increasingly ubiquitous mobile phone – have brought dramatic economic, social and financial opportunities to remote parts of the world.  Yet the progress achieved is not nearly enough. Poverty – including extreme poverty – is pervasive. One in seven people in the world still survive on $1.25 a day or less. Dramatic levels of inequality persist, impairing growth in some countries. And there is no guarantee that the gains made in recent years will be permanent. Climate change, civil unrest and terrorism can rapidly undo hard-earned progress even as demands increase: people around the world rightly want more than access to basic services – they want an equal shot at opportunities to thrive, not merely to survive. This week, we will convene with other ministers, the private sector and civil society in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, for the Third International Conference on Financing for Development. This year’s conference represents a unique opportunity to protect, enhance and even accelerate the gains of the last 15 years. We are determined to seize the opportunity. Reducing the risks of climate change, promoting resilient infrastructure and boosting productivity will help us to protect these gains, as will empowering and including every citizen in order to contribute productively to economic growth, and tackling inequality and unemployment to offer hope and opportunities to both women and youth. Ensuring that everyone can share in the benefits of economic growth will help us to enhance those gains. And making critical investments in science, technology and innovation can help accelerate them. All the while, it is vital that there be improved transparency, a sounder business climate and an end to corruption. Together, those goals represent the key to sustainable development.  The First International Conference on Financing for Development in Monterrey, Mexico, in 2002 set this foundation. The Monterrey Consensus – the outcome of that first meeting – emphasized that every nation has primary responsibility for its own economic and social development. This year’s conference presents the next chapter, providing a platform from which to implement the United Nations Post-2015 Sustainable Development Goals, that will be agreed upon in September, setting an ambitious new stage following the Millennium Development Goals.  The new chapter of Financing for Development goes much further. It moves away from merely managing poverty and toward spurring transformation. That requires three primary sources of development finance: donor assistance, domestic resources and private investment.  Donor assistance plays a critical role, particularly in the most vulnerable countries, helping to disseminate knowledge and best practices and reaching sectors often shut off from other sources of finance. But it must be used as a catalyst for attracting other financial flows to support economic growth, including domestic resources and private investment. Increasing domestic public resources is vital for governments’ ownership of their own development while private investment is critical to job creation and infrastructure development. To maximize the impact of money spent on development, we also must do more to incorporate key enablers of development – including making better use of science, technology and innovation. Data, for example, is key to generating new development solutions and driving evidence-based policy making. Similarly, we must recognize that climate change impacts all aspects of development – social, economic and environmental. Together, we must redouble our efforts to build a low-carbon, climate-resilient world.  We are committed to working together and urge others to join us in seeking to revitalize a partnership for sustainable development – a partnership that, for the first time, can be built on a shared and universal agenda for change. We live in an increasingly interconnected world where our prosperity, peace and security are linked. That is why Financing for Development holds such promise as we work to translate this exciting new vision into concrete actions and commitments for years and decades to come."
"Can a museum help to save the planet? Is it possible to promote solutions to the human-caused warming of global climates through interactive displays, 3D movies, a gift shop and all the other methods of the modern museum?  That’s what the Climate Museum Launch Project hopes. This week, the Board of Regents of New York State gave it a five-year provisional charter to create a climate museum in New York City. Soon, tourists could be supplementing trips to Central Park and the Metropolitan Museum with a troubling, or perhaps inspiring, visit to a museum full of climate-related exhibits. The plan is to focus on “solutions”, reports the New York Times. A design for the building has even been proposed by Danish artist Olafur Eliasson.   It sounds like a welcome new way to look at the most pressing issue of our time – of any time? – but it is also an immense challenge. How can a museum deal with this topic in a way that is genuinely informative, intelligent, honest and accessible without being patronising? The Science Museum in London has notably failed to do so. Its Atmosphere gallery manages to patronise visitors of all ages. Poorly conceived interactive displays turn climate issues into a bad computer game.  Anyone who is still a sceptic about the overwhelming evidence of long-term damage to our climate is ignoring the facts and spurning reason. The problem for the majority, who do accept that dangerous climate change is happening, is to make us focus on this reality instead of trying to forget it. That means thinking about solutions, which the Climate Museum project rightly proposes to do.  To act, people need hope. The problem with apocalyptic scenarios or claims that capitalism itself must be destroyed in order to save the planet is that they produce, in most people, a paralysing despair instead of the strength to act or even think. But a visit to a museum can’t just be a motivational session; it needs to be genuinely educational. And this means that to really work, a museum about climate needs to reinvent the science museum itself. In an episode of The Simpsons, the family visit a science museum in which the joke is that it’s just a giant playground. It is spot-on satire. All over the world, museums of science have abandoned “boring” displays of scientific instruments to entertain visitors with fun and games. In theory, the games are educational, but in practice the amount of scientific knowledge some museums share is incredibly slight.  It is no coincidence that the Science Museum in London deals badly with climate change. The sad truth is that the Science Museum contains very little science, and it projects deep confusion about its own purpose. It has several galleries that are effectively indoor playgrounds (including one for all ages). There are flight simulators, too. Do all these kinds of entertainment teach through play? A bit, perhaps. But there is not enough information to balance the fun.  I am convinced it is possible to spend a day at the Science Museum and leave still thinking the sun orbits the Earth. By contrast, it is impossible to spend much time in the superb Natural History Museum next door without being exposed to the theory of evolution. As for the realities of climate change, visit its current exhibition about coral reefs that shows how much will be lost if they disappear. If we don’t grasp how nature works, how can we comprehend the challenges of climate change and the meaning of global warming? Before museums can teach people about the future of the polar ice caps they need to explain what a pole is, what water is and what a climate is. New York’s Climate Museum is a commendable venture. But it’s a huge challenge and time is running out. Above all, science museums need to teach basic science better – for only a scientifically literate public will ever be ready to face the facts about climate change."
"A recent study led by Georgina Mace, ecosystem professor at University College London, indicated that governments across the world have failed to grasp the risk that population booms in coastal cities pose as climate change continues to cause rises in sea levels and extreme weather events. Mace is director of the UCL Centre for Biodiversity and Environment Research.  Mace says population growth in coastal areas can lead to big increases in exposure to extreme weather. The biggest direct effect of projected climate change is heat waves. The number of people dying from extreme heat could increase twelvefold by the end of this century, as a result of global warming combined with increasing numbers living in affected areas. “People are increasingly living in the wrong places, and the demographic shift in China is enormous. China has a lot of old people who are vulnerable to extreme weather,” says Mace. A report from China’s National Bureau of Statistics showed South China’s Guangdong province was the most popular immigration destination, with more than 20 million people from other provinces residing there in 2010, and central China’s inland province of Henan had the biggest population migration, with more than 10 million people from there living in other regions in 2010. According to the statistics bureau in Shanghai, the city had more than 24 million residents in 2014, with about 10 million having migrated from other provinces. A report released in July by the municipal government showed 28.8% of Shanghai residents are over age 60. Jiang Rui, vice-director of Shanghai’s civil administration, says in the report that Shanghai is now facing a the problem of a rapidly ageing society. By the end of last year, more than 200 million Chinese citizens, 15.5% of the total population, were older than 60, according to a report from the national health and family planning commission. The commission also released a report in July indicating that by 2030, China will have 230 million rural residents who have relocated to urban areas and the urbanisation rate will reach 70%. Increased urbanisation will also exacerbate the effects of climate change, particularly among elderly citizens who are more vulnerable to extreme weather, Mace said recently at the release of the latest climate change report commissioned by the UK Foreign and Commonwealth Office. The report, drawn up by experts from UK, the United States, China and India, demonstrated risks triggered by climate change, including extreme weather and social instability, and also stressed the potential impact on coastal areas caused by rising sea levels “The reason we chose to work with China is very much because of the population factor. The eastern coastal region is highly populated, and the sea level is rising. That could be a big challenge,” says David King, the UK foreign secretary’s special representative for climate change, who led the project. Mace and her research group recommended that big engineering projects, including sea walls to prevent flooding or wells in areas prone to drought, should be combined with natural ecosystem-based approaches such as re-establishing flood plains, planting vegetation and protecting coastlines with mangrove forests. “It is just about getting the right infrastructure,” says Mace. “It needs advance planning to build the coastal cities more hazard-proof. The increased mortality from heat waves in Russia and France was because people were living in houses that are poorly designed.”"

"Arnold Schwarzenegger has been chosen by the French government to join Nobel prizewinners, philosophers, UN secretary generals, spiritual leaders and theologians to make the moral case for the world to act urgently on climate change. Talking at the world’s first summit of conscience for the climate on Tuesday – ahead of the crucial UN climate change meeting in the city in December – the Terminator star and former California governor declared the science debate over, saying planetary catastrophe could only be avoided with ethical action: “I’ve starred in a lot of science fiction movies and, let me tell you something, climate change is not science fiction, this is a battle in the real world, it is impacting us right now.  “I believe the science is in. The debate is over and the time for action is now,” he told an invited audience of intellectuals and spiritual leaders from all faiths. “This is bigger than any movie, this is the challenge of our time. And it is our responsibility to leave this world a better place than we found it, but right now we are failing future generations.” “This year alone we will dump 40bn tonnes of carbon emissions into our atmosphere. The World Health Organization says that air pollution causes over 7 million premature deaths every year and all over the world we can see flooding, monster storms, droughts and wild-fires that are completely out of control.” The meeting, called by French president François Hollande ahead of the Paris political summit, was intended to put pressure on governments to act by mobilising millions of people to declare publicly that they “cared” for earth. Former UN secretary general Kofi Annan, chair of the Elders group of former world leaders, echoed a phrase attributed to Soviet premier Nikita Khrushchev talking about nuclear war in 1979, saying “climate change would leave the living envying the dead”. “If action is not taken immediately my grandson will live in a world suffering heat waves, severe droughts and floods. Cities like new York and Venice will drown. We are on the brink of catastrophe but the solution to the climate crisis cannot be left to governments alone ... People are taking the lead and demanding change. We must not fail them.” Irish president Michael Higgins called for moral courage. “Our current malaise is grounded in a cynicism we must confront. We need to confront the cult of the individual and insatiable consumption and replace it with a new thinking. We must reconcile science with ethics.” Cardinal Peter Turkson, Ghanaian president of the Vatican’s Pontifical council for justice and peace, who helped Pope Francis write the encyclical on human ecology published last month, said that the climate is a common good. “It is a global common meant for all but the costs are being borne by those who have least contributed to it. “At stake now is the wellbeing of the earth, our common hope. What we need is care. When we care for something it is with passion and commitment of the heart. That’s why Pope Francis called for care of the earth. A sense of passion is needed.” Muslim theologians, Christians and Hindus said they saw climate change both as an existential threat and as an opportunity for renewal. Sheikh Bentounes, leader of the Sufi brotherhood Alawiya, urged mankind to carry “a hope of a future”. “The prophet Mohammed called on man to plant and sow seeds. He said ‘Even at the end of times continue to plant and sow.’ We have responsibility to carry this hope to the end. This tiny vessel in infinite space that we call earth is unique.” Daoists, Confucians, shamans, Jesuits, Bhuddists and others called for politicians to act on behalf of humankind at Paris. Patriarch Bartholomew, leader of 300 million Orthodox Christians, despaired at humanity’s blindness, but quoted writer Fyodor Dostoevsky saying that “beauty would save the earth”.  “Scientists and theologians agree that humanity depends on nature. We must accept the moral imperative for action. Religion must also be involved in the crucial question of climate change”, said Bartholomew.  David Rosen, director of inter-religious affairs at the American Jewish Committee, said: “Climate change takes place where there is unbridled avarice. It is a symptom of the disease and cry for us to respond. It is the opportunity for humans to rediscover the higher values than materialism and indulgence.” Hindu leader Nandita Krishna, who has restored 50 sacred forests, feared that insatiable greed had gripped everyone on earth and this had led to climate change. “We cannot replicate the environment or create it. Unless we see the divine in creation we will not understand our role and duty as humans,” she said.   Nobel prizewinning economist Mohemed Yunus, founder of the Grameen bank in Bangladesh, said technology could help achieve zero poverty and zero carbon emissions . “[But] technology today is in the hands of the money makers and the war-makers. They are not directing it to solve the problems of the world.” It was left to 86-year-old Benin writer and politician Albert Teveodjré to represent the views of secular thinkers. “Nature was loaned to us as a place to live. I witness a world of profit at all costs which will ruin the envronment and devastate everything. I am very worried. I think I will leave the world with many worries.”"
"Private investors stand to lose $4.2tn (£2.7tn) on the value of their holdings from the impact of climate change by 2100 even if global warming is held at plus 2C, a report from the Economist Intelligence Unit (EIU) has warned. If firm action is not taken at the forthcoming climate change talks in Paris and the Earth’s temperature warms by a further 5C then investors are facing losses of almost $7tn at today’s prices, new research shows.  This is more than the total current market capitalisation of the London Stock Exchange with impacts on company holdings that will come not just through extreme weather damage but also through lower economic growth. The report argued that financial regulators should properly recognise “systematic environmental risk”. It also called for a proper carbon price to be established as well as a tough new climate change treaty to be agreed in Paris. The latest assessments of the rising risks posed to the global financial system lends enormous new weight to those who are already arguing that companies must be made to disclose their carbon emissions. “Investors currently face a stark choice. Either they will experience impairments to their holdings in fossil fuel companies should robust regulatory action on climate change take place, or they will face substantial losses across the entire portfolio of manageable assets should little mitigation be forthcoming,” said Brian Gardner, the editor of an EIU report, entitled The cost of inaction: recognising the value at risk from climate change. The $4.2tn figure is roughly the equivalent to the value of the world’s publicly listed oil and gas companies or the annual gross domestic product of Japan, the world’s third largest economy.  Nick Robins, co-director of the Inquiry into the Design of a Sustainable Financial System at the UN Environment Programme said that financial markets are not treating the threat posed by climate change seriously enough. “We wouldn’t get on a plane if there was a 5% chance of the plane crashing,” he said. “But we’re treating the climate with that same level of risk in a very offhand, complacent way.” The EIU concludes that there are widespread opportunities for investors to reduce their exposure to environmental risk – one way is to invest in projects that finance a transition to a lower carbon economy. But it also believes that climate change is likely to represent “an obstacle” for many asset owners and managers to fulfil their fiduciary duties to act in the best interests of those who lend their cash to invest. According to estimates by the Asset Owners Disclosure Project, only 7% of asset owners calculate the carbon footprint of their investment portfolios and only 1.4% have an explicit target to reduce it. The EIU follows warnings from the Bank of England about the financial risks posed to fossil fuel companies if global climate action renders their reserves of oil, coal and gas worthless. On Thursday, a report from the London assembly warned that the city was particularly vulnerable to financial risks posed by climate change because its economy is particularly well-connected globally."
"ExxonMobil gave more than $2.3m to members of Congress and a corporate lobbying group that deny climate change and block efforts to fight climate change – eight years after pledging to stop its funding of climate denial, the Guardian has learned. Climate denial – from Republicans in Congress and lobby groups operating at the state level – is seen as a major obstacle to US and global efforts to fight climate change, closing off the possibility of federal and state regulations cutting greenhouse gas emissions and the ability to plan for a future of sea-level rise and extreme weather. Exxon channeled about $30m to researchers and activist groups promoting disinformation about global warming over the years, according to a tally kept by the campaign group Greenpeace. But the oil company pledged to stop such funding in 2007, in response to pressure from shareholder activists.  “In 2008 we will discontinue contributions to several public policy groups whose position on climate change could divert attention from the important discussion on how the world will secure energy required for economic growth in an environmentally responsible manner,” Exxon said in its 2007 Corporate Citizenship report. But since 2007, the oil company has given $1.87m to Republicans in Congress who deny climate change and an additional $454,000 to the American Legislative Exchange Council (Alec), according to financial and tax records. In a statement to the Guardian this week, Exxon spokesman Richard Keil reiterated: “ExxonMobil does not fund climate denial.” Alec, an ultra-conservative lobby group, has hosted seminars promoting the long-discredited idea that rising carbon dioxide emissions are the “elixir of life”, and was behind legislation banning state planners in North Carolina from considering future sea-level rise. Campaigners said Exxon’s support for members of Congress and lobby groups that deny climate change was at odds with the company’s public position that it is committed to acting on the threat posed by global warming. “If they are going to be serious about what they say about believing in the science of climate change, they should actually take action and show they are genuine,” said David Turnbull, campaign director of Oil Change International, which compiled the data on Exxon contributions to members of Congress at the Guardian’s request. A majority of Republicans in the House of Representatives and the Senate deny climate change or oppose action to fight climate change, according to the Center for American Progress. Exxon’s beneficiaries in Congress include the Oklahoma senator Jim Inhofe, who called global warming a hoax, and who has received $20,500 since 2007, according to the Dirty Energy Money database maintained by Oil Change International. Exxon funded the Mississippi senator Roger Wicker, who cast the single no vote earlier this year against a symbolic “sense of the Senate” resolution that climate change was real and not a hoax. The resolution passed 98-1. Wicker, who received $14,000 from Exxon, voted no. Exxon also gave a total of $868,150 to Republican senators who voted against another symbolic resolution that human activity was a significant driver of climate change. Each of the 49 Republican senators who voted no received at least $5,000 from Exxon, according to Oil Change figures. Exxon has also continued to fund Alec, which works to block climate legislation in state legislatures, according to figures compiled by the Climate Investigations Center from the oil company’s own disclosures in its annual Worldwide Giving Reports and foundation tax filings. Alec has for decades worked to block action on climate change, by drafting bills for state legislatures aimed at dismantling environmental regulations. The lobby group hosted a summit last December featuring a speaker who called carbon dioxide emissions “the elixir of life”. “The ongoing rise in atmospheric carbon dioxide should be welcomed with opened arms,” Craig Idso, founder of the Center for the Study of Carbon Dioxide and Global Change, told about 100 state legislators and corporate executives at the summit, according to InsideClimate News. Such claims have been dismissed in their entirety by scientists. The ultra-conservative Alec claims to support “free market environmentalism” and on its website accuses campaign groups of conflating this with climate denial. However, the website refers to climate change as a “historical phenomenon”, and states – contrary to fact – that its causes are a matter of continued debate. When asked directly, an Alec spokesman declined to say whether the lobby group saw climate change as a threat, and declined to say whether it stood by Idso’s views. “Alec is a forum for the exchange of ideas and continuing education of state legislators. All viewpoints are welcome. Indeed,” Wilhelm Meierling, an Alec spokesman, said in an email. “Today, legislators want to learn from as many viewpoints as possible in order to make the best possible decision for the people they represent.” He said Exxon did not underwrite the “continuing education workshop” with Idso. Alec suffered a string of defections over its position on climate change during the last year, with companies such as Rupert Murdoch’s News Corp, BP America, Microsoft, Facebook and Yahoo resigning their memberships. Google accused the lobbying group of lying about climate change.  Exxon would not discuss its membership in Alec. However, the company said it was serious about confronting climate change and does not fund climate denial. In 2007, the oil company committed to ending its support for a network of think tanks and activist groups that deny the science underlying climate change or have worked to block action against climate change.  Keil, the Exxon spokesman, said in an email: “We are taking action in a range of ways – by reducing greenhouse gas emissions in our operations, helping consumers reduce their emissions, and by supporting research at leading US universities into both increased emissions reduction capability and research into alternative energy sources.” Keil did not respond to specific questions about Exxon’s financial support for members of Congress who deny climate change, about its support for Alec, or about funding of the Idso seminar. “I don’t believe we underwrite specific Alec functions, and, as should be abundantly clear from my past statements to you, we believe climate change is real and warrants action, we’re taking steps to address it, which I’ve also provided you voluminous detail on, and we don’t embrace the views of those who deny climate change or think it isn’t a serious matter,” Keil wrote in an email. He went on: “Because The Guardian has abandoned objective journalism and has a clear agenda regarding climate change, it can no longer be trusted to do the job its readers have a right to expect, which is to provide accurate and unbiased coverage on this important topic.” Corporate funding of climate denial is seen as a major barrier to US action on climate change – and dividing the US from Europe in addressing global warming. “If Exxon was very clear about this, it would be a big help,” said Jeff Sachs, president of the Earth Institute and an adviser to the United Nations on climate change. “If this is what they believe, they ought to make it known and they ought to make it known very publicly because we have the entire Republican party in denial and fighting tooth and nail every step of the way against reasonable action. Exxon could make a very big difference.”"

"The author of the $60bn price tag for Bill Shorten’s new renewable energy goal – cited by Tony Abbott as proof the scheme is unaffordable – says an emissions trading scheme like the one the Coalition abolished would be more cost-effective than either the coalition’s “Direct Action” plan or Labor’s new goal. ACIL Allen Consulting chief executive, Paul Hyslop, told Guardian Australia his $60bn cost estimate of Labor’s goal to have 50% of Australia’s electricity generated by renewables by 2030 was based on a quick calculation of how much extra renewable capacity would be required, and the cost to deliver it though wind power.  He said a carbon price would be much more cost effective than either a specific electricity sector goal, or the government’s own “Direct Action” plan. “It would be much more sensible to have an economy-wide carbon price to meet a new emissions reduction target rather than just focus on the electricity sector,” he said. “The reason an ETS is so powerful is that everyone faces a cost … the problem with Direct Action is that it doesn’t curb the behaviour of the people who aren’t involved in it.” Labor has promised some kind of emissions reduction scheme as one of the policies to meet its new emission reduction targets. It says the renewables goal is an “aspiration”, which would not be met only by the current mandated subsidies, nor primarily by wind power.  ACIL Allen Consulting’s Owen Kelp told Sky News it was impossible to say whether Direct Action would cost more or less to achieve the same emissions reductions than Labor’s plan and Hyslop said Direct Action could be “pretty expensive” depending on its final design. Climate policy is shaping as a central battleground in the federal election due next year and Labor’s new goals come as US Democratic presidential hopeful Hillary Clinton committed to the US generating enough renewable energy to power every home in the country within 10 years of taking office. Shorten is vowing to stare down a Coalition “scare campaign” and Abbott is again ramping up his attack on Labor’s renewables promise and its pledge to re-introduce an emissions trading scheme. The Labor leader concedes some of his policies to meet the long term renewable goal – including an increase in the mandatory, legislated renewable energy target – could require a Coalition change of heart. “What we recognise is that when it comes to the large-scale program in terms of renewable energy, we can only increase that by bipartisanship. We’ve given ourselves 15 years and one thing I know is that sooner or later, the once great Liberal party of Menzies and Malcolm Fraser … who believe in action on climate, will restore and become far less extreme rightwing and come back to the mainstream when Abbott is no longer their leader,” Shorten said, emerging from a meeting with former US vice-president Al Gore in Melbourne. Tony Abbott claimed on Monday Labor’s ETS would be an “electricity tax scam” and has insisted it is a tax, even though Labor insists it is not because it does not begin with a fixed price. But Liberal frontbencher Malcolm Turnbull – who lost the party leadership over his support for an ETS – pointed out that all policies to push low-emission electricity generation come at a cost to households, including the ones the government supports, and that the cost of renewables is falling. Turnbull said there was usually a distinction drawn between an ETS and a tax. But he said every policy to push low-emissions generation came at a cost – which might in generic terms be called a tax – even the renewable energy target which the government itself supports. “There has been a distinction drawn in the debate … between a fixed-price cost on carbon which people particularly called a carbon tax and one that is floating because it is related to the purchase of permits and that, of course, the price of the permits depends on supply and demand and that’s an ETS. And so in a lot of the literature and discussion you’ve talked about the virtues of a tax versus the virtues of an ETS,” he said. “But either way they are both a cost. So, yes, you can call them both generically a tax but equally the renewable energy target is a cost. So all of these measures, there is no such thing as a cost-free way of reducing carbon emissions. That is to say, as long as emissions-intensive forms of generating energy are cheaper than the low-emission forms and, of course, that is starting to change, the technological developments with solar in particular. “But as long as that is the case, whether it’s a regulation, whether it’s a renewable energy target, whether it’s an ETS, whether it is a carbon tax, a fixed price, all of those can be seen on as a cost on the business of generating energy, therefore a cost on house holders purchasing energy and therefore in that sense a tax.” The government recently persuaded Labor to agree to a reduced renewable energy target of around 23% of electricity generation by 2020. Abbott said Labor’s goal to achieve 50% renewables by 2030 was “bizarre”. “Frankly at 23% that is more than enough, one of the truly bizarre decisions coming out of the Labor conference at the weekend was this move to increase the proportion of renewables in our system to some 50%. This constitutes a massive, absolutely massive, hit on consumers and jobs, because to move to 50% … by 2030 will mean a massive bill, perhaps $60bn or more … this massive and unnecessary commitment to renewables which will cause a massive overbuild of wind farms, all of which has to be paid for by consumers,” Abbott said. In 2009, Turnbull also wrote that any suggestions emissions could be cut without imposing a cost was “bullshit”. “You cannot cut emissions without a cost … any suggestion that you can dramatically cut emissions without any cost is, to use a favourite term of Mr Abbott, “bullshit.” Moreover he knows it. The whole argument for an emissions trading scheme as opposed to cutting emissions via a carbon tax or simply by regulation is that it is cheaper – in other words, electricity prices will rise by less to achieve the same level of emission reductions,” he said at the time."

"Global warming may already be taking its toll of air miles. As jet planes burn fuel and release carbon dioxide, the atmosphere warms and causes head winds to build up. Tail winds do too, but round trip journey times are nevertheless creeping up − and so are fuel costs. A team of US scientists say the cumulative effect of the longer flight times that they think may have resulted from climate variation would have added millions of dollars to airlines’ costs, and perhaps a billion gallons of extra fuel.  Kristopher Karnauskas, an associate scientist in geology and geophysics at Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution (WHOI) in the US, and colleagues report in Nature Climate Change that they analysed flight times and daily wind speeds at cruising altitudes for four airlines on three routes over the past 20 years. They then used 34 different climate models to identify how the winds, and flight times, might have responded to climate variation, and how the response might continue. The flight paths chosen were between Honolulu and the three west coast airports of Los Angeles, San Francisco and Seattle. The team found that, in general, eastbound flights were faster than westbound for all carriers, and that climate change had made a difference of about a minute per round trip, with a small extra cost in fuel on each flight. This showed that the eastbound trip might be 10 minutes shorter, the westbound trip was 11 minutes longer, and most of this difference could be accounted for by natural cycles based on changes in ocean temperatures. The cycles include El Niño, that periodic bubble of heat that appears at intervals in the Pacific, to upset climate patterns, bring drought and fire to the Indonesian rainforests, floods to California, and upset the fisheries off the coast of Peru. During the 20 years studied, the four airlines made 250,000 flights on those three routes, so the tiny differences began to add up to substantial costs in time and fuel. The oceanographers then looked ahead to the wind speed predictions of the climate models, and found that this could add an additional 5.5 hours per round trip, per carrier, per comparable route. This in turn would extrapolate to an additional 480,000 US gallons of jet fuel consumed, and an additional 4.6 million kilograms of carbon dioxide emitted, each year. This is small in terms of the overall emissions figures for the airline industry, but the researchers’ sample was of just a tiny proportion of all global flights. In 2014, commercial airlines made 102,470 flights a day on 49,871 routes. If each plane spent just one extra minute on each round trip flight, that would mean that commercial jets would spend 300,000 hours longer in the air, burn an additional billion gallons of jet fuel, and emit an extra 10,000 million kilograms of CO2 per year. Global warming already costs the airlines increasing airtime and wear and tear becauseatmospheric turbulence seems to be on the increase. However, the oceanographers’ study began not because of a bumpy ride, but because of an unexpectedly smooth one. One co-author of the report, Hannah Barkley, a graduate student at WHOI, had noticed that a direct flight back from Honolulu to the east coast of the US took far less time than expected, and asked Dr Karnauskas why he thought that might be. In fact, the jet stream that day was exceptionally fast – and the research started from that point. The scientists found, by looking at 20 years of data, that for every 10mph speedup of the prevailing wind, there was a difference of perhaps a couple of minutes in flight time. They called the there-and-back difference “the residual”. “The wind really fluctuates by about 40mph, so multiply those couple of minutes by each flight per day, by each carrier, by each route, and that residual adds up quickly,” Dr Karnauskas says. “We’re talking millions of dollars in changes in fuel costs.”"
"The federal government has held talks with Flinders University over the possibility of establishing a research centre headed by controversial academic Bjørn Lomborg. Flinders University said it had asked the department of education for information about Lomborg’s consensus centre but insisted it had not made a firm decision over whether it wanted to host the academic’s work.  The federal education minister, Christopher Pyne, has vowed to find another university to take on Lomborg’s centre after the University of Western Australia decided in May to hand back $4m in federal government funding for it. The UWA opted to take the funding for the centre, only to reverse course following a backlash from its academics. Pyne said the university had shouted down Lomborg, with the Danish academic complaining that the issue had become a political football. Lomborg’s venture would be linked to his Copenhagen consensus centre, with a focus on aid spending and international development. Lomborg is a controversial figure among academics, particularly in the field of climate science due to his contrarian stance on the issue. While he accepts that the world’s climate is changing, he has argued that these changes can be dealt with by technological improvements and that other issues are of more pressing concern. It’s understood that Flinders University is gauging the opinion of its staff before committing itself to the centre, in an attempt to avoid the UWA’s situation. Academics are thought to be split on the merits of hosting Lomborg. A spokeswoman for the university said: “Discussions have been held among groups of Flinders academics regarding the possibility of any future collaboration with the Copenhagen Consensus Centre in addressing a number of major research questions of our time. “Similar discussions have most likely occurred in other universities around the country.  “Flinders University has approached the department of education for information but the university has yet to form a position on the matter.” Despite the offer of federal funding for the centre, many leading universities have been reluctant to put themselves forward due to the controversy over the initiative. Labor has attacked the government for providing a $4m grant for the centre, and actively attempting to find a university to accept it, at a time when universities were facing funding cuts. Greens senator Senator Lee Rhiannon, the party’s higher education spokesman, said it would be “extraordinary” if Flinders hosted Lomborg.“Chancellor Stephen Gerlach, a former chairman of oil company Santos, would be wise to take note of the successful community campaign run by students, staff and the community in Western Australia and reject the Bjørn Lomborg vanity project,” she said. “With the Abbott government still offering $4m to host Mr Lomborg, it’s clear their budget emergency doesn’t apply to their climate sceptic mates.”"
"The government’s sweeping review of how to improve productivity across a range of areas, including planning and higher education, has been criticised by campaigners as the death knell for zero-carbon homes. Energy conservationists are angry at announcements in the productivity paper released on Friday, which drops plans for higher on-site energy efficiency, as well as a separate target for zero-carbon emissions for non-domestic buildings by 2019.   The productivity paper is the product of two months of thinking by the new business secretary, Sajid Javid, and represents a sharp change of course from the industrial strategy of the previous business secretary, Vince Cable. Javid said boosting UK productivity was “the economic challenge of our age”. Julie Hirigoyen, chief executive of the UK Green Building Council, condemned the sudden announcement on low-carbon homes smuggled into a wider package designed to boost housebuilding by relaxing planning laws. She said: “Let us be in no doubt this announcement is the death knell for zero-carbon homes. “It is short-sighted, unnecessary, retrograde and damaging to the housebuilding industry, which has invested heavily in delivering energy-efficient homes. Britain needs more housing, but there is no justification for building homes with a permanent legacy of high energy bills.”  Philip Sellwood, chief executive of the Energy Saving Trust, said: “A highly energy-efficient housing stock needs be central to the government’s vision of the UK’s infrastructure, looking to 2050 and beyond. We are very disappointed with this decision.  “This decision is not in the interest of UK productivity. Under the Climate Change Act, we have to achieve at least an 80% reduction in the carbon emissions from our homes by 2050. We need to be building homes now that are 2050-ready. It’s hardly the productive choice to be building less efficient homes now and then refurbishing them with insulation and renewable energy systems in 10 or 15 years’ time.”  Initial interest in the productivity plan, entitled Fixing the Foundations, focused on proposals to short-circuit housing planning controls on brownfield sites, and whether this represented abandonment of the old Conservative commitment to localism in planning.  Javid indicated that local councils would lose some powers, and said: “If a council fails to produce a new housing plan, we will have it done for them.” He said automatic planning permission would be granted in some brownfield areas designed for housing.  In an attempt to increase housing density in London, Javid will allow homeowners to build as many as two extra storeys without needing normal planning permission, as long as local residents do not object. The London mayor will have powers to call in housing plans with more than 50 homes.  Figures from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) on Friday showed that the number of new housing starts in the UK had slowed at its fastest pace for four years. The figures showed a 5.8% fall in new building, the biggest drop since October 2011, helping drag the wider construction sector to a 1.3% contraction. In a sign that George Osborne is not going to abandon the past five years’ efforts to push through faster infrastructure investment. He said a national infrastructure plan covering key areas – transport, energy, flood defences, water, waste, communications and science – would be published annually. A business tax roadmap will be published by the autumn to reassure business about the pace of further reforms. Osborne has asked large institutional investors to give new commitments to support companies investing for long-term growth and challenge those that are compromising long-term competitiveness and productivity. Some of the country’s most senior business leaders, convened by Sir Charlie Mayfield, chairman of the John Lewis Partnership, have agreed to head a business-led action group for productivity. The group will report to the government by the end of the year. Osborne has embraced plans submitted by economist Prof Alison Wolf to reverse a trend of employer underinvestment in training by imposing a compulsory training levy on employers. The report says: “There has been a rapid decline in the amount and quality of training undertaken by employees over the last 20 years, in part due to employer concerns that if they invest in training their employees, competing firms will free-ride on their investment. This needs to change.” The report says an unspecified levy will be imposed to fund training, as already in place in Germany, France, Denmark and more than 50 other countries. “The levy will apply to large employers and will support all post-16 apprenticeships. In England, any firm will be able get back more than it puts in by training sufficient apprentices. The government will put control of the funding in the hands of employers via the digital voucher scheme, to ensure that it delivers the training they need,” the report says. Details will be published in the autumn. Osborne and Javid lay out plans to open up the universities sector by allowing “new providers” to compete on a level playing field with established universities. The government will introduce a clearer and faster route to degree-awarding powers for those assessed to offer the best quality education. “The government will explore options to allow the best providers to offer degrees independently of existing institutions before they obtain degree-awarding powers, the report says. The government will free up student number controls for the best alternative providers by introducing a performance pool of places from 2016/17, which will allocate additional student places. On housing, the government says it will publish league tables, setting out local authorities’ progress on providing a plan for the jobs and homes needed locally. Where they are not doing so, ministers will intervene to arrange for local plans to be written. Any council that fails to complete 50% of planning permission applications on time will have its responsibilities removed. Councils say government cuts have left planning departments struggling for resources and talented staff. In line with proposals set out by the Labour party, the government will impose a duty on local authorities to co-operate on big housing and planning decisions to ensure housing growth occurs.  The government has already committed to legislating statutory registers of brownfield land suitable for housing in England, and ministers will now legislate to grant automatic permission in principle on brownfield sites identified on those registers.  The report contains details of some further welfare changes, including new sanctions on younger claimants and a new obligation on 18- to 21-year-olds receiving universal credit. The strategy paper says, in the context of the extensive childcare support offered to parents of three- and four-year-olds, that the conditions for parents claiming out-of-work benefits should be tightened. From April 2017, parents claiming universal credit will be expected to look for work from when their youngest child turns three, and to prepare for work when their youngest child turns two.  "
"It might be one of the world’s smallest countries but the Marshall Islands has set an ambitious target to cut its greenhouse gas emissions – and it wants Australia to do the same. In a submission to the United Nations climate change negotiations, the tiny Pacific Island nation has vowed to cut its emissions by 32% from 2010 levels by 2025.  The Climate Institute says if the Marshalls’ target was replicated by Australia it would translate to a 35% cut to emissions from 2005 levels by 2025. That is higher than the spread of post-2020 targets the Abbott government is reportedly considering for its UN submission, which is expected to emerge in August ahead of the major conference in Paris late this year, at which it is hoped a new global climate deal will be signed. The Marshalls, which has a population of just 70,000 people spread across 34 coral atolls and islands, is one of the most vulnerable countries to climate change and has suffered devastating storm surges and drought in recent years. Marshall Islands foreign minister Tony de Brum told Fairfax Media damage from climate extremes was already lashing his nation and crippling its ability to otherwise develop. He said the Marshalls wanted to “practise what we preach” on halting climate change and would seek to reduce methane emissions from waste, cut diesel use and embrace more solar to meet its goals. De Brum said he hoped Australia would follow suit and take leadership in the international climate change debate. With world-leading emissions on a per person basis, de Brum said Australia was critical to the global effort to halt the problem. “It is important that Australian people understand we are not just playing footsie politics with the leaders of our big neighbour to the south.”  “We are really serious about its need to contribute to our safety and future security.” Australian foreign minister Julie Bishop said Australia’s post-2020 target would be “strong, credible, responsible and consistent with continued economic growth, jobs growth and development.” “We expect all nations to set responsible and achievable targets,” she said. In releasing its targets the Marshall Islands’ government said it was the first small island state to set out post-2020 emissions goals, and the first developing country to pledge an economy-wide cut to emissions. It also said it wanted countries to set target for 2025, not 2030, to avoid locking in long-term “insufficient ambition”. The Marshall Islands government also says it will go on to aim for a 45% cut to emissions by 2030 as part its long-term vision to be emissions-free by 2050. Bishop said Australia was currently considering its target year along with its overall target. She said: “The majority of nations are aiming for a 2030 target.” The Marshalls’ target is not much more than symbolic in the context of global emissions. Data on Marshall Island’s emissions is patchy, but the World Bank has reported that in 2010 the nation released 103,000 tonnes of of carbon dioxide, which is the most prevalent, but only one, greenhouse gas. On the same data, and by comparison, China released 8.2bn tonnes of CO2, while Australia released 368m tonnes. Research from the University of New England this month found 98% of Marshall Island’s built infrastructure is within 500 metres of the coast line, making it highly vulnerable to existing and future climate threats."
"The EU is celebrating 10 years of the world’s largest carbon trading system this year by looking at new reforms to keep it on track. The emissions trading scheme (ETS), which covers half of Europe’s CO2 emissions by limiting the number of carbon permits available to energy generators and industry, has been dogged by low prices and oversupply of allowances.  The problems are largely ones of success – carbon emissions are lower than anticipated. But much of the oversupply was caused by the recession in Europe, so has the trading system been a waste of time or has it changed business attitudes and operations?  To answer these questions the Prince of Wales’ Corporate Leaders Group commissioned a report, 10 years of Carbon Pricing in Europe – a business perspective, which was released last week. The report is based on interviews with a small number of companies from a variety of sectors that are mandated into the ETS to see what impact it has had on them. For some, the responses were pretty much to be expected. EDF and Shell have long been advocates of the carbon market and higher prices. Energy companies need the price to justify the right investment decisions at the right time – and many of them are able to pass on the cost of carbon allowances to their consumers – so they would be in favour of a high carbon price. Although they profess the importance of the carbon market, it is clear that other policies, such as those promoting renewables or nuclear energy, have had more impact. But then there are the energy intensives. Often vulnerable to international competition and with limited options to reduce their CO2 emissions, these industries generally have not been enthusiastic advocates of the carbon price. But here the European carbon market does seem to have had a genuine impact. Steel company ArcelorMittel acknowledged the importance of monitoring and reporting emissions to manage them.  Tata Steel Europe said that even in the depths of the recession some of its facilities were taking steps that would have previously been unacceptable or impossible in order to stay afloat, because reducing emissions is synonymous with efficiency. To the same effect, cement company Italcementi uses CO2 intensity as an indicator of efficiency as it “combines most of the key levers to industrial excellence”. It seems unlikely these companies would have got this far without the ETS. Next, we should consider the industries that are within the ETS but for which energy is not such a significant cost or where there are other options. What is interesting here is how the most advanced companies have moved beyond compliance to more interesting and creative ways of cutting emissions.  There are plenty of examples of companies using their waste heat or buying heat from their neighbours, thus going the extra mile to improve efficiency. The bottling company O-I Group uses waste heat to pre-heat raw materials and to heat the floor in their plant. Others have created new business models that have provided a lucrative income stream from offering consultancy advice to others. Here the ETS has provided a valuable focus on carbon and underwritten the improvements made. Finally, there are those companies that probably would not have gone beyond compliance if they had not had leaders with vision. Where senior managers decide to take carbon seriously there can be huge benefits, even where energy is a small proportion of total costs.  Jaguar Land Rover and GlaxoSmithKline have directed new resources to cutting carbon with astonishing success. This has been crowned by a reduced carbon liability. Clearly in these companies the ETS alone has not driven this transformation, but the senior management teams would not have had this on the agenda without the carbon price being discussed at board level. It is noteworthy that these businesses instigated action in 2007 and 2008 when the allowance price was relatively stable in the €20-€25 range. What needs to happen next? Europe is embarking on reform of the ETS now. Clearly getting prices back up to the lofty levels of 2007 would help but, ironically, the companies that have focused on carbon have found the low hanging fruit of cheap emissions reductions to be almost limitless, which will make it a bigger struggle to raise the price. Do we need a higher price then? Yes. To tackle the challenging industries that will need technological breakthroughs we will need higher carbon prices to incentivise more reductions and to fund innovation."

"The world’s largest steel producer is planning to spend €87m to use a microbe originally found in a rabbit’s gut to turn a waste gas that contributes to global warming into fuel. Bioengineering company LanzaTech’s technology will be installed at ArcelorMittal’s steel mill in Ghent, Belgium, with the customised Clostridium microbe capturing carbon monoxide and converting it into ethanol.  It is anticipated that the Ghent plant will eventually produce 47,000 tonnes of ethanol a year, which can be sold as a byproduct of the steel-making process and used to run cars and aeroplanes.  Although carbon monoxide is not considered a direct greenhouse gas, it can lead to greater ozone concentrations in the the lowest layer of the atmosphere, contributing to climate change. In a steel plant it is burned, releasing CO2, the main manmade greenhouse gas. “What we are talking about is turning an environmental liability into a financial opportunity,” said Jennifer Holmgren, chief executive of LanzaTech, which is based in Chicago. Factories using LanzaTech’s technology are also being built in China and Taiwan. Whichever comes online earliest will be a world first although the system to be built at the factory in Ghent is about 30 times larger than the one in China. Construction of ArcelorMittal’s pilot should start later this year with bioethanol production beginning in 2017. If the commercial viability of the project is proven the technology would be rolled out across the company’s mills globally: it has factories in 19 countries and produced 93.1m tonnes of steel in 2014. “This partnership is an example of how we are looking at all potential opportunities to reduce CO2 emissions and support a transition to a lower carbon economy,” said Carl Mare, ArcelorMittal’s vice president of innovation.  “Steel is produced through a chemical process that results in high levels of waste gases being emitted. This new technology will enable us to convert some of these waste gases into fuels that deliver significant environmental impacts.” Holmgren said: “Today’s announcement is a very big deal for us as ArcelorMittal is the biggest steel producer in the world: it makes twice as much as its nearest competitor. So this is a serious commitment to a future in which more and more power comes from renewables.”"

"Australians perceive Islamic State (Isis) as being the greatest threat to global security ahead of climate change and economic instability, according to a survey from a major independent thinktank in the US. Between March and May, the Pew Research Center surveyed 45,435 people aged 18 and above from 40 countries, including 1,004 Australians.   Participants were asked to respond yes or no to whether they were “very concerned”, “somewhat concerned”, “not too concerned” or “not at all concerned” by a list of six issues; climate change, global economic instability, Isis, Iran’s nuclear program, cyber-attacks, tensions with Russia, and territorial disputes with China. Analysed together, climate change emerged as the greatest concern overall, with 19 of those in the countries surveyed citing it as their biggest worry.  But this was not the case in Australia, where a majority (69%) said they were “very concerned” by Isis, followed by Iran’s nuclear weapons program (38%, though this may change given the historic deal just struck by world leaders  with Iran). Climate change ranked equal third with cyber attacks, at 37%.  These results were echoed in the Asia-Pacific generally, with Isis emerging as the greatest concern in the region (45%) followed by Iran (44%). Anxiety about climate change was highest in Latin America (61%) and Africa (59%), while Europe, the Middle East and the US shared Australia’s perception of Isis being the greater global threat. Unsurprisingly, concern about Isis was highest in countries neighbouring Iraq and Syria. Dr Denis Dragovic, an international development expert who has researched conflict in the Middle East and Isis, said he was not surprised by the Australian results. “The challenge that we face in addressing Islamic State is that it has not shown any interest in abiding with an international system of conventions, and it has an ideology that is intent on killing people without any concerns for the sanctity of life. “The difference between Islamic State and past authoritarian regimes, like Hitler, Stalin and others, is that it doesn’t have access to resources as yet. But it is not beyond belief that they may gain access to these resources.” Those countries that listed Isis as a stronger threat were also those whose governments had taken some action against them, either through military involvement, additional humanitarian assistance, or increased financial sanctions, he said.  “It’s hard to say in the context of this survey whether the threat felt by the people drove politicians to act or the actions subsequently mobilised people’s fears,” Dragovic said."

"Malcolm Turnbull has cut through the slogans and semantics dominating the climate policy debate – pointing out that all policies to push low-emission electricity generation come at a cost to households, including the ones the government supports, and that the cost of renewables is falling. Tony Abbott on Monday unveiled a new three-word slogan to attack Labor’s promised emissions trading scheme – saying it was an “electricity tax scam”. The prime minister also labelled Labor’s promise to source 50% of electricity from renewables by 2030 “bizarre” and “unnecessary”, said it would cause “a massive overbuild in windfarms” and claimed it could cost “$60bn or more”.  At his party’s national conference over the weekend, Labor leader Bill Shorten said Labor’s promised ETS was not a tax because it would have a floating price and would not begin with the fixed price like the former government’s scheme. “Let me say this to our opponents, in words of one syllable: an ETS is not a tax,” he said. The government has insisted that an ETS – whether it has a fixed or floating price – is a tax. The environment minister, Greg Hunt, has said “an emissions trading scheme is just a carbon tax with a different name” and “only the Coalition will combat climate change without hurting Australia’s standard of living”. Asked about this debate on Monday, Turnbull – who lost the Liberal leadership over his support for an emissions trading scheme – said there was usually a distinction drawn between an ETS and a tax. But he said every policy to push low-emissions generation came at a cost – which might in generic terms be called a tax – even the renewable energy target which the government itself supports.  “There has been a distinction drawn in the debate ... between a fixed-price cost on carbon which people particularly called a carbon tax and one that is floating because it is related to the purchase of permits and that, of course, the price of the permits depends on supply and demand and that’s an ETS. And so in a lot of the literature and discussion you’ve talked about the virtues of a tax versus the virtues of an ETS,” he said. “But either way they are both a cost. So, yes, you can call them both generically a tax but equally the renewable energy target is a cost. So all of these measures, there is no such thing as a cost-free way of reducing carbon emissions. That is to say, as long as emissions-intensive forms of generating energy are cheaper than the low-emission forms and, of course, that is starting to change, the technological developments with solar in particular.  “But as long as that is the case, whether it’s a regulation, whether it’s a renewable energy target, whether it’s an ETS, whether it is a carbon tax, a fixed price, all of those can be seen on as a cost on the business of generating energy, therefore a cost on householders purchasing energy and therefore in that sense a tax.” The government recently persuaded Labor to agree to a reduced renewable energy target of around 23% of electricity generation by 2020. Abbott said Labor’s goal to achieve 50% renewables by 2030 was “bizarre”. “Frankly at 23% that is more than enough, one of the truly bizarre decisions coming out of the Labor conference at the weekend was this move to increase the proportion of renewables in our system to some 50%. This constitutes a massive, absolutely massive, hit on consumers and jobs, because to move to 50% ... by 2030 will mean a massive bill, perhaps $60bn or more ... this massive and unnecessary commitment to renewables which will cause a massive overbuild of windfarms, all of which has to be paid for by consumers,” Abbott said. Labor has not costed its renewables goal, but says it will be achieved through a suite of policies. The $60bn estimate appears to be based on the assumption that it would be reached through the current mandatory renewables market, but Labor says this is not the case. It is also highly unlikely to be delivered primarily through windfarms."

"Pope Francis said he had “great hopes” that a fundamental agreement to tackle climate change would be reached in Paris later this year and he believed the United Nations needed to play a central role in the fight against global warming. “The UN really needs to take a very strong position on this issue, particularly the trafficking of human beings … [a problem] that has been created by climate change,” the pope said.  The remarks followed a day-long meeting of mayors from around the world that was hosted by the Vatican to discuss environmental challenges and how disruptions in climate were contributing to a humanitarian crisis in migration and modern slavery. Speakers included Bill de Blasio of New York, George Ferguson of Bristol and Gustavo Petro of Bogotá, among dozens of others. The conference began by hearing harrowing testimony from two Mexican women who were victims of modern-day slavery. “It’s not possible that it still exists, that we remain blind” to the issue of modern slavery, said Ana Laura Pérez Jaimes, who spent five years chained up and forced to work 20 hours a day in Mexico. She showed the mayors photographs of some of the 600 scars she suffered as an indentured servant, forced to iron for hours a day without food or water. She said she had to urinate in a plastic bag. A fellow Mexican, Karla Jacinto, described how she was physically and sexually abused by her family and forced into prostitution between the ages of 12 and 17. She was forced to have sex with more than 42,000 clients before she was rescued. “I didn’t think I was worth anything. I thought I was just an object that was used and thrown away,” she told the hushed conference hall. The 22-year-old mother of two now campaigns on behalf of trafficking victims. The meeting came about one month after the popular Argentinian pontiff released an encyclical – or church teaching – on the environment that called for the phasing-out of fossil fuels and for action to combat climate change and immoral consumption, which he said was putting humanity at risk. Francis said in remarks, which seemed to be impromptu and were not from a prepared text, that his was not a “green” encyclical, but rather a “social” one, which reflected an “attitude of human ecology”. “We cannot separate man from everything else. There is a relationship which has a huge impact, both on the person in the way they treat the environment and the rebound effect against man when the environment is mistreated.” He spoke of the “uncurtailed growth of cities”, a global phenomenon that was giving rise to “shanty towns and slums” on the periphery of big cities because there was not enough economic opportunity to sustain poor people in rural areas. “This needs to be denounced,” Francis said. He criticised the rise in youth unemployment – which in countries such as Italy has reached rates of more than 40% – and lamented that the plight of the young and poor was leading to “meaningless lives”. “If we project this to the future ... what kind of horizon can they look towards,” he asked. “Some turn to guerrilla activities, to find some meaning in life and also their health is jeopardised.” He criticised the growth of black market labour and no-contract work, which he said ensured that people could not earn living wages and led to forms of “addiction”. He emphasised the importance that the local mayors, who were gathered before him, had in shaping environmental debates at home, saying that true reform had to emerge from the periphery to be effective, and could not be imposed from above."

"Scott Walker has vowed to unravel Barack Obama’s legacy, starting with the Iran nuclear deal, should he become president.  The Wisconsin governor said on Thursday he would cancel the deal “on day one” in the White House and pick apart other Obama achievements, including healthcare reform. Walker laid out an ambitious conservative agenda in a keynote address to the annual meeting of the American Legislative Exchange Council (Alec) , one of the nation’s most controversial and powerful lobbying networks, in San Diego. He promised to curb organised labour, slash taxes and regulations, and inject Ronald Reagan-style “steel” into US foreign policy, saying Islamic extremism, not climate change, was the leading security threat. “We fight to win,” he said. “The rest of the world must know there is no greater friend and no worse enemy than the United States of America.” The governor, a leading contender in a crowded GOP field, made numerous references to his religious faith and boasted of defunding Planned Parenthood, drawing cheers from the audience of legislators and lobbyists. Walker, who has close ties to the lobbying network, also won applause vowing to dismantle the administration’s Iran deal – a deal secretary of state John Kerry and other senior officials were concurrently trying to sell on Capitol Hill. The radical regime that took US embassy staff hostage in Tehran in 1979 remained a foe, said Walker: “Iran has not changed much since then. I will terminate the deal with Iran on my very first day.” In a shot at Hillary Clinton, the Democratic frontrunner, he said an “Obama-Clinton doctrine” had let Russia, China and terrorists threaten US security. “I’m for true safety,” Walker said. “The commander in chief has a sacred duty to protect the American people.”  In one of four references to Reagan, he promised to “go back” to an era of strong American values and peace. The governor mocked Obama’s focus on climate change as a security threat, eliciting guffaws from the audience. “The greatest threat is radical Islam,” he said. “I’d rather take the fight to them rather than wait for them to bring the fight to us.” With Mexico just 20 miles away, Walker cited a “need to secure our borders”. But he otherwise steered clear of immigration, a fraught topic for Republicans which Donald Trump was due to stir anew on Thursday on a visit to the Texas border. Walker did not mention Trump or any of the 14 other GOP hopefuls. San Diego is far from Wisconsin but Alec’s conference was home ground for Walker. He has maintained close ties with the group, and promoted its policy positions, since taking public office in 1993 as a state legislator. Many of his most contentious actions – a tough-on-crime bill that sent incarceration rates soaring, stand-your-ground gun laws, protection of corporate interests, attacks on union rights and many more – have borne the Alec seal of approval. As governor since 2011, Walker no longer officially belongs to Alec but according to the Center for Media and Democracy (CMD), in his first year as governor he signed into law 19 bills that reflected, to some degree, Alec thinking. The CMD, which monitors the lobbying group, has speculated Walker could become the “first Alec president”.  The network matches state legislators – overwhelmingly Republican – with major US corporations, facilitating meetings behind closed doors and drafting business-friendly bills which often become law. Hundreds of protestors marched on Wednesday to the Manchester Grand Hyatt hotel in San Diego, where the three-day conference was being held. The mix of labour groups, Democrats and environmentalists chanted slogans and brandished banners against corruption and corporate money in US politics. “They want to destroy labour unions,” Dolores Huerta, a veteran labour leader, told the Guardian. “If you don’t have labour unions you don’t have redistribution of wealth, and then you don’t have a middle class. And without a middle class you don’t have democracy.”  Huerta assailed Walker, saying he would roll back social progress.  “He’s a disaster for the country,” she said. Jim Mickelson, 46, a firefighter and union leader, brought his wife and three daughters to the protest.  “We’re here to let them know they’re not welcome,” he said. Addressing a packed ballroom, Walker joked that the protest was a mere “warm-up act” compared to the huge, raucous backlash he faced in Wisconsin after dismantling the collective bargaining rights of public sector workers. He said he had faced down death threats.  “We took on the unions and won,” he said. “They believed they could win by intimidating local officials.” He talked up his controversial record in Wisconsin, saying “big, bold reforms” lowered taxes by $2bn and improved education standards.  “We can hire and fire based on merit,” he said.  Critics accuse him of wrecking the budget and gutting educational institutions. Walker vowed to repeal Obamacare, saying the path to a greater America was transferring power from Washington to state level, moving people from welfare to work and slashing federal regulations, which he said were “out of control”.  He said the US should build the Keystone pipeline, and use the energy “abundance God has given us”."
"The United States, Russia and other Arctic nations signed an agreement on Thursday to bar their fishing fleets from fast-thawing seas around the north pole. The accord, also signed in Oslo by the ambassadors of Canada, Norway and Denmark, is a response to global warming, which is melting sea ice in the central Arctic Ocean, an area the size of the Mediterranean. The deal had been delayed by more than a year by tensions over Ukraine.  The central Arctic probably has no commercial fish stocks now, experts say, but melting sea ice may draw fish such as cod farther north. Forty percent of the area was briefly open water when summer sea ice shrank to a record low in 2012.  The deal “will prevent a problem from arising ahead of time,” said David Balton, US deputy assistant secretary of state for oceans and fisheries. “Very little is known about this area of the ocean.”  “Climate change is affecting the migration patterns of fish stocks,” Norwegian foreign minister Boerge Brende said in a statement. He said Arctic states had a responsibility to protect the international waters, starting 200 nautical miles (230 miles) from their coasts.  Thursday’s accord was negotiated in outline in Greenland in February 2014, to be signed in June 2014. But Russian president Vladimir Putin annexed Ukraine’s Crimea region in March 2014, and in protest, both the United States and Canada boycotted one meeting of the Arctic Council last year in Moscow.  That protest “was the exception to the rule” of cooperation in the Arctic, Balton said. Many other Arctic activities have remained on track with Russia, such as exercises linked to search and rescue and oil spills.  The Arctic states also want other major fishing nations – such as China, Vietnam, South Korea and all European Union states – to agree not to venture into the central Arctic Ocean.  “It’s a new ocean emerging,” said Scott Highleyman, director of international Arctic affairs at the Pew Charitable Trusts environmental group. “It’s hugely encouraging – it’s hard to get governments’ attention for problems that haven’t occurred yet.”  Greenpeace Arctic campaigner, Sophie Allain said that the agreement should have gone further: “With this agreement the Arctic States have recognised that the Arctic Ocean is an extraordinary environment which requires far better scientific understanding. But sadly they have missed the chance to deliver the permanent protection this area desperately needs ... This region should be declared a marine sanctuary, where all extractive practices, including oil production, are banned.” Thursday’s agreement also called for more research into the Arctic marine resources.  The first fish likely to thrive are Arctic cod, also known as polar cod, which have a natural anti-freeze in their blood, said Alf Haakon Hoen, research director at the Norwegian Institute for Marine Research.  But authorities should be wary of allowing trawlers into the area, because of the threat to other species, such as polar bears, whales, seals and seabirds, he said.  The Arctic thaw is also opening the region to more oil and gas exploration and shipping. The United States, the current chair of the eight-nation Arctic Council that includes Russia, plans to host an oil spill exercise in 2016. "

"For years, London’s red doubledecker buses have dominated the capital, where nearly 1,000 routes are operated by 8,700 buses, many of them doubledeckers. Although there has been a gradual move to hybrid vehicles, many are still diesel-powered. This will all change in October, when the world’s first pure electric zero-emission doubledecker bus, designed and built by Chinese automotive manufacturer BYD, will enter service in London.  The electric doubledecker bus represents a technology breakthrough in public transportation, said Isbrand Ho, managing director of BYD Auto Europe.  “In the past, electric vehicle manufacturers have produced electric buses with three batteries – at the vehicle’s front, back and top – but this design would not work with the doubledecker bus. BYD’s advanced technology is able to make the batteries more compact, so the battery on top of the bus is no longer required,” he said. “London has the most dense population in Europe and has the highest visibility of doubledecker buses. London is replacing 700 to 800 doubledecker buses every year, so there is a big market.” According to Ho, the inspiration to supply doubledecker buses to London came about two years ago when Wang Chuanfu, chairman of BYD, met with London mayor Boris Johnson. “Boris Johnson said to our chairman, ‘If you can make it, I will buy it’. “Actually, electric cars came before gasoline cars, but because of the weakness of the batteries, gasoline cars became more successful. But now is the time for electric cars to take over gasoline cars,” Ho said, explaining that the environmental benefit and the fuel cost savings of electric vehicles give them a distinct advantage. Denis Naberezhnykh, the head of ultra-low emission vehicle and intelligent transportation system technology at the UK’s Transport Research Laboratory, praised BYD’s achievement. “Until now, fully electric doubledecker buses have been considered unfeasible. This is mainly due to the competing requirements for battery space and passenger capacity,” Naberezhnykh said. He says unlike their single-decker counterparts, doubledecker buses in London typically cannot accommodate batteries on the roof due to the height limits of the vehicle. “A purely electric doubledecker bus not only provides further options for the electrification of London’s bus fleet, but with growing pressure to improve air quality in cities and the impending introduction of the ultra low emission zone in London, it provides another way of reducing emissions,” Naberezhnykh said. The zone is set to launch by 2020. “Over the next few years, we can expect to see a growing shift toward the electrification of public transport vehicles, as we seek to reduce air pollutants in urban centres and improve local air quality. Ensuring that these vehicles are able to operate the demanding duty cycles without excessive charging time requirements will be a vital factor in accelerating this shift.” London has already introduced hybrid buses in a bid to reduce the environmental impact of public transport. The latest development is the New Routemaster bus, designed by English designer Thomas Heatherwick, which is 15% more fuel efficient than the existing hybrid buses and 40% more efficient than conventional diesel doubledeckers. The first New Routemaster vehicles, nicknamed “Boris buses” after the mayor of London, began service on a limited number of routes in 2012, and it is planned that more than 600 of the buses will enter passenger service by 2016. BYD chose London for the launch of the all-electric doubledecker bus because of the vehicle’s iconic significance, but the same technology can be applied to many other markets, including European markets such as Germany and Asian markets such as Hong Kong, Malaysia and Singapore. Many of these markets would require localisation of design to suit customer needs, for example, with regards to wheelchair access, but the core technology of battery, control system and electric drivetrain would all be the same, according to Ho. The first batch of BYD doubledecker buses will consist of five vehicles, all manufactured in China. Ho says BYD will explore the possibility of local manufacturing if the quantity supplied increases. BYD won’t disclose the cost of the buses, explaining that it is highly dependent on customer specifications and volume, but says the electric buses can help save about 70% of the costs of fuel, producing long-term savings. The latest New Routemaster costs £325,000 each, compared with £200,000 for an existing hybrid vehicle, according to the mayor’s office. “For a bus, the largest part of the cost is actually the fuel, so over the long term electric vehicles can give a big cost saving effect,” Ho says. The main challenge for electric buses is the lack of charging points, as is the case with other electric vehicles, because the technology is still relatively new, he says. His team is working with Metroline, the London bus operator, to install charging infrastructure at bus depots, and is providing guidance on how to install the charging points, where to install them, what type of power requirements are needed. The company has invited Metroline engineers to China to see similar facilities. Two years ago, BYD supplied two single-decker buses to the London bus operator Go-Ahead, which are still in use. BYD also helped Go-Ahead with installing the charging points. The charging points are installed at bus depots, where the buses are parked at night, so the way the buses operate during the day is not affected. Most bus routes can be serviced for a full day on a single charge, needing only four hours to recharge during the night, using cheaper off-peak electricity, he says. Founded in Shenzhen in 2003, BYD is already a leader in electric vehicles in both its domestic and international markets. Ho says in Europe the company hopes to focus on the commercial vehicle market first, producing buses and taxis, because these vehicles can reach a wider user base and help BYD to build up a brand in Europe. BYD has supplied vehicles to many countries, including Sweden, the Netherlands, Denmark, Belgium, the UK and Spain. Its European headquarters is in the Netherlands. Looking ahead, Ho is optimistic about growth in the use of electric vehicles in Europe, because cities are becoming increasingly densely populated with many people preferring to live in the city, creating a big demand on public transport. Meanwhile, the environmental credentials of the electric vehicles is also a big contributor to this trend, as European cities move increasingly to reduce pollution, he says. According to China’s ministry of industry and information technology, some 19,000 plug-in electric cars, buses and trucks were produced in China in May. The International Energy Agency says China ranks third on the list of countries using pure electric cars, with 80,000 sold since 2008."

"One of the world’s leading Arctic sea ice experts has responded strongly to a Times newspaper story claiming that he thought assassins may have murdered three leading British scientists in 2013. Professor Peter Wadhams, Cambridge professor of ocean physics, has complained to the Independent Press Standards Organissation (Ipso) that his scientific reputation had been damaged by Times environment editor Ben Webster and that he had been inaccurately quoted. The Times said it had a recording of Wadhams’ comments and stood by the story. The Times report centred on the deaths within a few months in 2013 of three leading sea ice scientists, two of them from University College London, and a narrow escape for Wadhams after a driver of an unmarked lorry reportedly tried to push his car off the M25.  According to Wadmams: “Webster ... asked for further details. I asked that this be completely off the record because of (a) the sensibilities of relatives of the deceased (b) my own scientific reputation (I did not want to be made out to be a crazy person), (c) the fact that these deaths were investigated and were very clearly simply an extraordinary coincidence.  “He [Webster] raised the question of whether they were murdered. I agreed that for a short time I thought that they were, since I had had the experience of being run off the road at the same time by a lorry, but that it was very clear afterwards that the three deaths were individually explainable accidents.” He further claimed that a promise of confidentiality was breached. “I did not make any of the statements enclosed in quotation marks by the reporter. Webster promised that this was in confidence and that if he wanted to use it he would contact me first.” A spokesperson for The Times said: “We have a recording of Professor Wadhams making these statements. Another newspaper [the Telegraph] subsequently reported that he had made similar comments to their journalist. We stand by the story.”  Profesor Wadhams, who is head of the Polar ocean physics group in the department of applied mathematics and theoretical physics, is a controversial figure in international science, going further than more cautious colleagues in predicting the final collapse of Arctic sea ice in summer months within a few years.  In an email to the Guardian in 2012, Wadhams said: “I have been predicting [the collapse of sea ice in summer months] for many years. The main cause is simply global warming: as the climate has warmed there has been less ice growth during the winter and more ice melt during the summer. “Climate change is no longer something we can aim to do something about in a few decades’ time, and that we must not only urgently reduce CO2 emissions but must urgently examine other ways of slowing global warming, such as the various geoengineering ideas that have been put forward.” "

"Some zombie myths just won’t die. In fact, I debunked this one two years ago right here at The Guardian.  To sum up, a number of scientific studies have asked the question, ‘if the sun were to enter another extended quiet phase (a grand solar minimum), how would that impact global surface temperatures?’. Every study agrees, it would cause no more than 0.3°C cooling, which would only be enough to temporarily offset about a decade’s worth of human-caused global warming.  Solar activity is actually quite stable. That’s a good thing for us on Earth, because without big swings in the amount of energy reaching the planet from the sun, our climate is likewise generally quite stable. That’s allowed us to build big immobile cities and farms, with the confidence that the climate and weather will be pretty consistent in those areas. It’s allowed human civilization to develop over the past 10,000 years. Though with human-caused global warming in the process of destabilizing the climate, we’re putting that civilization under serious stress. Recently there’s been a flood of media stories claiming that the sun may be headed towards a quiet phase (a possibility), which could send the Earth into a “deep freeze” (a virtual impossibility). These stories appear to have originated in the biased conservative media (like the Daily Mail and Telegraph) and seeped into other media outlets (like CNN). Some media outlets, like the Washington Post, did a good job researching the story and discovering its flaws before publishing. The stories stemmed from a presentation at the Royal Astronomical Society’s National Astronomy Meeting in Wales by mathematician Valentina Zharkova. Her research (not yet published) suggests the sun could be headed for a quiet phase like the one that coincided with a period known as the “Little Ice Age,” but doesn’t say anything about how this solar minimum would impact the Earth’s climate. Some of the fault for raising this zombie myth from the dead lies with the Royal Astronomical Society’s press release, which mentioned the previous mini ice age without making it clear that it was solar activity but not the Earth’s climate that was the subject of the study. Some of the fault lies with Zharkova, who made comments ‘skeptical’ of human-caused global warming that were not supported by her research.  And much of the fault lies with media oulets like the Daily Mail and Telegraph, which ran rather sensationalist stories about an impending mini ice age apparently without consulting a single climate scientist. It’s not a coincidence that the media outlets that didn’t contact climate scientists spread this myth, while the media outlets that did contact climate scientists debunked it. This ‘impending mini ice age’ myth is incredibly easy to debunk. In fact it just takes asking one simple question – if the sun is such a key driver of the Earth’s climate, then why has the entire planet (air, oceans, land, and ice) warmed rapidly over the past 60 years while solar activity has declined? That simple question is sufficient on its own to debunk the notion that the sun is the main driver of global temperatures. Research has clearly shown, it’s carbon dioxide that’s the temperature’s main control knob. Second, research has suggested that the solar minimum around the year 1650 played a relatively small role in the cool temperatures during the Little Ice Age. Instead, heightened volcanic activity (pumping ash into the atmosphere that blocks sunlight) and a drop in atmospheric carbon levels were the main contributors to the cooling during that time. Third, the Little Ice Age wasn’t even that cold, globally. The following chart shows the most comprehensive global surface temperature reconstruction to date, from the PAGES 2k Consortium. In just the past few decades the planet has warmed more than it cooled during the entire Little Ice Age. There was significant regional cooling during the mini ice age, particularly in parts of Europe and North America, but globally it was indeed quite little. Fourth, a grand solar minimum would be a temporary phase. Any cooling it caused would only last a few decades until the end of the event, at which point the increase in solar activity would contribute to global warming. In summary, the difference between the Little Ice Age and current warming period comes down to volcanoes, carbon dioxide, and magnitude. The previous cool period was quite small, likely caused mostly by volcanic activity. And of course, humans weren’t pumping over 30 billion tons of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere every year in the 17th century, as we are now. The bottom line: even the grandest solar minimum would have a minor impact on global temperatures compared to the rapid warming stemming from human carbon pollution."
"For the Inupiat villagers who have made their homes on this finger of land in the Chukchi Sea for generations, nothing is more important than the bowhead whale. The calendar revolves around seasons for hunting, fishing and gathering. It’s a lifestyle Alaskans call “subsistence”, which is as much cultural tradition as economic necessity in one of the state’s most northern villages.  About 900 people live in Point Hope. The village store prices are double what people pay 700 miles south in Anchorage. A gallon of milk might be $12. Two pounds of hamburger patties: $23. In most homes, wild and foraged foods make up at least half of the menu. The village has two stores, a school, several churches and a restaurant that serves pizza, Chinese food and hamburgers. Alcohol can’t be legally possessed, sold or imported. All year, the village looks forward to spring whaling, when crews of men thread through leads in the sea ice, quietly paddling in seal-skin boats, looking for smooth black shapes rising out of the water.  The few massive bowheads taken by villagers each year supply thousands of pounds of dense protein. Beyond that, whale meat is considered an Alaska Native soul food. Hunting, butchering and distributing the animal, village leaders say, is how elders teach young people the culture. “Without the whale,” said Steve Oomittuk, the former mayor of the city and former vice-president of the tribe, “we wouldn’t be who we are.” In recent years, however, the much-anticipated whale hunt has run up against a warming Arctic. A bowhead can be 60 feet long and weigh 75 tons. Successful whaling crews have always hauled the massive animals on to the ice using a block and tackle. The last few seasons, the ice has been more unstable than elders in the village have ever seen.  “It’s getting harder and harder, the ice is thinner,” Oomittuk said. “We can’t pull up the whale.” Alaska had the hottest year on record in 2014, and this summer’s temperatures have been above normal across the state. In the Point Hope region, spring and summer temperatures have been on a warming trend since the 1980s. What are now average summer temperatures would have been close to record-high temperatures in the mid-20th century, according to Rick Thoman, climate science and services manager for the National Weather Service in Alaska. The experience of hunters in Point Hope is part of larger story being told by Alaska Natives in villages that rely on subsistence foods. Animal behavior is changing as the climate warms, and the windows of opportunity for certain types of hunting and fishing are shrinking.  Lack of snow last winter grounded hunters for weeks because they couldn’t travel by snowmobile. Changing ice conditions have complicated the walrus hunt so deeply, they’ve caused food shortages in some areas. Water has been creeping into ice cellars carved generations ago in what used to be permanently frozen ground, causing meat stored there to go bad. Meat and fish drying outside have been spoiled by rain. “It’s about more than just meat,” said Nicole Braem, who studies subsistence activities in the region for the state of Alaska. “Traditional culture, language, all that stuff is at its strongest point with subsistence.” Alaska Native cultures have adapted plenty over time and will continue to adapt, but climate change has become a formidable challenge to how people are used to getting their food in parts of Alaska, she said. “The 24-hour daylight was a chance for us to hunt and gather all the different foods that migrate up north before the winter comes,” Oomittuk said. “We see animals coming earlier, we see animals coming later, we see animals not coming at all. It has changed very fast.” Point Hope took three whales this year. In June at the annual feast to celebrate the harvest, elders sipped coffee and ate homemade donuts. Ron Oviok Sr, 72, sat under a skin boat turned sideways to block the wind, going over the times he’d helped bring in a whale. “Today the ice conditions are pretty bad because of climate change,” he said. He can taste that whale meat kept in ice cellars is not staying as cold as it once did. Would grandchildren be able to continue the whale hunt as it had always been? Would great-grandchildren still have a taste for the meat? These questions, he couldn’t answer. “We try to keep the culture going as best we can,” he said. “I’m glad hunters never give up.” Point Hope’s people remain faithful to many long-held traditions. The town is still separated into two clans, each with its own whaling crews. Whaling feast activities happen at the same time every year, in two spots on either edge of town, each place designated for a different clan.  When a whaling captain is successful, he distributes meat to his family, the families of the whaling crews and the community right after the hunt and during feast time. Whale is also shared community-wide at Thanksgiving, Christmas and when the sea ice first forms – a date that seems to grow later each year. On the first day of the three-day feast, four-wheelers buzzed villagers to the locations on the edges of town. On one side, Clark Lane, a whaling captain, his crew members and family rose in front of a crowd to offer prayers of thanks. Women handed out pink-frosted cupcakes and dished mikigaq (barrel-fermented whale meat) by the double-handful to people with outstretched Ziplocs.  Fermented whale, a delicacy, is inky black, shiny and gelatinous in texture. Its taste is herbal, marine and sour. Bowheads have been the center of life in Point Hope for more than 2,000 years. Before Christian missionaries came, bodies of dead whaling captains were laid out above ground on whalebone scaffolds.  Whale bones, along with lumber washed ashore from commercial whaling shipwrecks, braced the sod houses where many elders were born. Whale liver membrane is stretched across drums that are used for songs and dances. Curved bowhead jawbones, tall as trees, now mark the graves of whaling captains and encircle the town cemetery. The school mascots are the Harpooners and the Harpoonerettes.  During feast time, women related to a whaling captain’s crew work nearly around the clock preparing whale and other traditional foods to share.  On the first evening of the festivities, Clark Lane’s home was crowded with women and children. As an episode of Barefoot Contessa played on the big-screen TV, women pulled big metal bowls of melted caribou fat from the oven and set them on the floor. As soon as the liquid fat cooled enough to be touched, they began to whip air into it with their hands, making akutuq – Eskimo ice cream. When the fat took on the texture of whipped butter, they drizzled in seal oil, added meat or berries and then chilled it. It would be sliced and served on the second day, while men cut and distributed whale flipper. Jana Koenig, Lane’s daughter, a mother of six in her 30s, has been making akutuq for the last few years, having been trained by her aunt.  Young people don’t respect traditions around whaling as they once did, she said.  It used to be, for example, that the village listened for the sound of the church bell during hunting time, a signal everyone should go down to the beach to help bring in the meat. Now, some crew members post on Facebook before the bell. “I don’t agree with that,” she said. Her husband is an emergency responder in the village and his job pays decently, she said. Still, they rely on gull eggs, seal oil, berries, caribou and whale, among other foods, to feed their family. Clark Lane, a captain of one of the whaling crews, is also the vice-president of the Point Hope village corporation, called Tikigaq. He began helping a whaling crew as a boy, he said. In those days, the crew would spend weeks out on the ice. His first job was as a “boyer”, an errand boy, tasked with small jobs like keeping the fire going and getting seal oil for the lamp. He worked his way up to the boat over time.  He never wanted to become a captain, but four years ago his mother chose him to do it. “This crew is yours, you’re taking it over no matter what,” she told him. He leads a crew of 27. During the whaling season, which usually begins in April and lasts until June, 10 of them will hunt at a time, paddling a skin boat. When they see a whale surfacing to breathe, they will chase it if they are close enough. Otherwise they follow it, careful not to give themselves away by hitting the boat with their paddles. Harpooning requires practice. They must be within 10 feet of the animal to throw a harpoon. When it strikes the whale, a core filled with explosive powder detonates, usually killing the animal instantly. After that, the crew will haul the carcass on to the ice and slice the meat into pieces that can be taken to shore. “It takes about day and a half to get it all sorted out,” Lane said. Meat is then distributed, and some is stored in ice cellars for community gatherings. Lane is responsible for keeping his crew fed during the hunt. If he didn’t have subsistence foods to share with them during that time, it would be too expensive to maintain. “Sure I go to the store and buy processed food, but I love my Inupiat food. I love the whale, beluga. I love the caribou. I love the walrus. I love the birds, all the birds. I love to pick their eggs,” he said. He, too, has noticed big changes in the seasons and the ice, but he sees it as part of a long natural cycle. He says he’s seen warm winters and short seasons before. “I don’t believe in climate change,” he said. “I really don’t.” A more realistic worry for whaling would be an oil spill from an offshore Arctic drilling rig, he said. Shell drilling in the Chukchi Sea, conditionally approved this spring by the Obama administration, appears imminent. He wasn’t against drilling, he said. It was progress. Inevitable. Just like motorized boats, cable TV, cellphones, indoor plumbing. He just hoped it would be done responsibly. “I don’t want to live the way I did long time ago. I had no running water. I had to haul it every day,” he said. “A lot of people say they could turn back, I don’t think so. I could make it, but not a lot of people, not my kids.” The third day of the feast was for giving thanks and games. Men drank coffee, ate and talked. Women worked in a large outdoor kitchen, cutting meat from bearded seal, whale and birds with sharp round ulu blades. Whale meat and entrails boiled over open fires. In the afternoon, children lined up for races across the grass. Clark’s son Jacob Lane, 22, watched the children run. He went out in the whaling boat for the first time as a senior in high school, he said. Before that, he thought whaling was boring and preferred playing Call of Duty on his Xbox. He remembered the exact moment he changed his mind on that first run. “We were breaking thin sheets of ice while paddling,” he said. “It was really hard, but it was really fun. You get sore. Damn sore.” The biggest threat to the whaling tradition he sees is the distraction caused by technology like video games and the internet. It is the same technology that allowed him to see how Inupiat whaling culture has been misunderstood by the outside world. It isn’t like commercial whaling or sport hunting, he said. “They think we’re just killing them to kill them,” he said. “We’re feeding a whole village.”  Reporting for this story was supported by a grant from the Pulitzer Center for Crisis Reporting"

"The Arctic is warming at a rate almost twice the global average, making climate change’s effects there far more intense and rapid than any other ecosystem in the world. While nature photographs of polar bears and melting ice dominate media narratives, the top of the world is home to 4m people who face an uncertain future.  Coastal erosion, forest fires and storm surges are threatening the physical and economic safety of settlements across the Arctic Ocean shoreline. Further inland, thawing permafrost is compromising the stability of transportation, sanitation and public service infrastructure built upon once-sturdy foundations. In Alaska alone, 31 villages face imminent threat of destruction from erosion and flooding. Many of these villages have 10 to 20 years of livability before their streets, schools and homes become uninhabitable. At least 12 have decided to relocate – in part or entirely – to safer ground to avoid total collapse. This week, the United States approaches the First Hundred Days mark of its leadership of the Arctic Council, a high-level governmental forum for the world’s eight Arctic nations to act on circumpolar challenges. Leadership gives the US a two-year opportunity to lead the international community in confronting climate change there. Though the US, led by Secretary of State John Kerry, has seen some successful polar initiatives implemented in the past few months, there is much more work to be done. In early 2015, President Obama proposed $50.4m in federal spending to help Native American communities adapt public infrastructure to the effects of climate change. That is less than half of what the US Army Corps of Engineers estimates to be needed to relocate just one Alaskan town. Moving an entire community to a safer location mere miles away can cost anywhere from $80m to upwards of $250m. Currently, federal programs for disaster assistance are limited and mostly unavailable to villages that require relocation. Relief programs focus on sudden natural disasters like Hurricane Sandy at the expense of financially supporting the adaptation and relocation of towns facing dangers from gradual natural processes. Because of this, communities in Alaska must rely on ad hoc federal and state grants to build single buildings, in hopes of relocating in full before an emergency evacuation is needed. To truly lead in meeting today’s most pressing Arctic issue and help safeguard the wellbeing of northerners, Secretary Kerry must take seriously the issue of climate relocation. This means working towards the creation of a legal and financial structure that can adequately respond to communities in need today. Defining a new governance structure and making the necessary financial resources available to deal with climate relocation will take hard work and a determined commitment by Secretary Kerry and his Arctic team. The structure must be built through engagement at all levels of government, which is largely lacking in America’s current national Arctic framework. That means not only being inclusive of tribal, local and state stakeholders in Alaska, but also engaging the many federal agencies involved in relocation activities, from the Federal Emergency Management Agency to the newly formed Senate Arctic Caucus. A first step towards this ambition is simple: convene a relocation policy meeting in DC with vital local, state and federal policymakers and stakeholders within the year to draft a strategic plan. The plan’s components must be actionable, with further steps to be taken over the US’s two-year chairmanship transparent and deliverable. Debate over who will fund relocation and which agency will lend technical assistance during the meeting will be intense. But the meeting, debates and eventual outcomes are essential for protecting the lives of our northernmost citizens. Secretary Kerry concluded his first Arctic Council meeting in April by stressing the importance of acting quickly. “We all know the clock is ticking, and we actually don’t have a lot of time to waste.” This is most evident today in the Arctic, but the clock is also ticking for communities in New Jersey, Louisiana, California and other coastal states. Alaskan villages may be the first to be forced into climate-induced relocation, but they certainty won’t be the last. Creating a framework for relocation can establish an important structure for vulnerable towns across America to use in the decades to come. To make America’s next hundred days leading the council more impactful than the first, Secretary Kerry must inaugurate the process to build a deliverable policy to help not only Alaskans, but citizens on all American shorelines, before times runs out for us all."

"Cherry-picking is one of the five telltale techniques of climate change denial. By focusing on short-term blips in noisy data, those who want to maintain the status quo can distract from the long-term threats posed by climate change. Climate contrarians most frequently deploy this strategy using global temperature and Arctic sea ice data. A recent study in Nature Geoscience concluded that, not surprisingly, there is a strong relationship between the summer temperatures in the Arctic (specifically the number of “melting degree days”), and the amount of sea ice that melts in a given year. 2013 happened to be a relatively cool year in the Arctic – the coolest since 2004. As a result, there was relatively little ice melt in 2013. The annual minimum Arctic sea ice extent and volume were their largest since at least 2009, or perhaps as far back as 2005, according to the data used in this new study.  The following figure from the paper is as clear as ice – while there was a short-term increase from 2012 to 2013, the Arctic has lost more than half its sea ice over the past three decades. The following video by programmer Andy Lee Robinson also illustrates the dramatic rate of sea ice decline over the past 35 years. Lead author Rachel Tilling was quite clear and explicit that while her study is good news in that Arctic sea ice could potentially recover if the planet eventually cools, the short-term blip is not indicative of such a recovery. We do not want to suggest that this is a recovery in the long term. If you look at the long-term temperature trend in the Arctic, it’s upward, and if you look at the long-term volume trend, it’s downward. If temperatures continue to rise, volume is going to continue to decrease. Indeed, the Arctic is the fastest-warming region on Earth precisely because of the sea ice “feedback.” Melting ice decreases the reflectivity of the Arctic surface, causing it to absorb more sunlight, warm faster, and melt more ice, which causes yet further warming in a vicious cycle. There are short-term natural variability wiggles on top of the trend, but the long-term Arctic sea ice decline is indisputable. Although the Daily Mail news coverage of this paper was reasonably accurate, its editorial opinion piece about it was anything but. The opinion piece initially claimed the study showed “the northern ice-cap INCREASED by a staggering 41% in 2013 and, despite a modest shortage last year, is bigger than at any time for decades.” Think someone got the wrong end of the stick here http://t.co/hp0ifAQbqu That last statement was flat-out wrong. As noted above, the Arctic may have had more ice in 2009 than 2013, and certainly did in 2005, and every year before that. In short, the Daily Mail editorial staff tried to figure out the science and math by themselves, got it badly wrong, and eventually corrected the text after many, including Tilling, pointed out the error. Now, although it doesn’t note the correction, the Mail editorial piece says that sea ice “is bigger than at any time for years” instead of decades. This statement was true in 2013, but is hardly notable. The rest of the piece rants against efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, and was not changed after the Mail corrected its error. Writing for the Telegraph on the same study, Christopher Booker made even more mistakes than the Daily Mail. There are too many to address here, but in two particular egregious examples Booker claims, Polar bear numbers are rising, not falling. Temperatures in Greenland have shown no increase for decades. I debunked the polar bears myth in the Denial101x lecture video below (which also discusses Arctic sea ice). Greenland has warmed incredibly rapidly, at a rate of 0.36C per decade since 1960, and a whopping 1.1C per decade since 1990. The latter period represents a warming rate in Greenland more than six times faster than the global average. This is far from the first time the Daily Mail and Telegraph have gotten Arctic climate science wrong. In fact, in 2013, both ran similar articles focusing on the short-term noise and ignoring the long-term trend. David Rose, who wrote the 2013 Mail piece, was in the Spectator last week advocating against climate policies because Republican politicians in the USA and anti-climate policy advocates in the UK don’t want to accept that the temporary global surface warming slowdown is now over. Similarly, the Mail and Telegraph got the science wrong in articles about solar science research the previous week. On both the solar and Arctic research, they seem to have written articles without talking to any climate scientists.  It appears that these conservative media outlets have a particular message to get out (that we shouldn’t take action to curb global warming), and they try to make the science fit that political message. Ideally it should be science that informs policy, not policy preferences that bias beliefs about science.  When ideology is allowed to trump scientific realities, that’s bad journalism."
"As I have said many times on this blog, if you want to know how much “global warming” is happening, you really have to be able to measure “ocean warming”. That is because more than 90% of the excess energy coming to the Earth from greenhouse gases goes into the ocean waters. My colleagues and I have a new publication, which better characterizes this heating and also compares climate model predictions with actual measurements. It turns out models have under-predicted ocean warming over the past few decades.  But how would you measure the ocean? How would you make consistent, long-term measurements that would allow people to compare ocean heat from decades ago to today? How would you make enough measurements throughout the ocean so that we have a true global picture?  This is one of the most challenging problems in climate science, and one that my colleagues and I are working hard on. We look throughout measurement history; first measurements were made with canvas buckets, then insulated buckets, and other more progressively complex devices. Many measurements were made along ocean passageways as ships transported goods across the planet.  As more ship travel occurred, and more measurements were made, the coverage of temperature measurements across the globe increased. So, over time, we say the temporal and spatial resolution increased. As these changes occurred, you have to be careful that any trend you see isn’t just an artifact of the resolution or the instrument accuracy.  We also pay attention on one particularly important measurement device called the eXpendable BathyThermograph (XBT). This device, originally designed to make crude measurements for navies, has been used for years by climate scientists. There is systematic bias in XBT data, which creates spurious “ocean warm decades” from 1970s to early 1980s as reported in the IPCC Fourth Assessment Report. What my colleagues determined was that we could reduce past errors in the ocean heat content (OHC) record by correcting systematic measurement biases, filling in gaps where no information is available, and by choosing a proper comparison climate. This new paper doesn’t solve all of the OHC issues, but it makes a great stride in clearing up past questions. Lead author, Dr. Lijing Cheng (who works for the International Center for Climate and Environment Sciences in China) applied four separate improvements to data. He focused his attention on the heating in the upper 700 meters of ocean waters because that depth has the best measurements and it also is the region where much of the global warming heat goes.  Going back to 1970, we find that the upper 700-meter water layer temperature has increased approximately 0.3°C (approximately 0.55°F). While that may not sound like a lot, we have to remember this is a huge amount of water and consequently it requires an enormous amount of energy. We separated the world’s oceans into the Atlantic, Pacific, and Indian. All three of these oceans are warming with the Atlantic warming the most. We also calculated the ocean heating by using 40 state-of-the-art climate models. Over the period from 1970, the climate models have under-predicted the warming by 15%.  A remarkably close match that gives us a lot of confidence in the models. On the other hand, the models were not able to predict shorter-term fluctuations in ocean heating contained within the observed time period.  My colleague Dr. Cheng summarized the work by saying,  Ocean heat content change is an important metric for the ongoing global warming. But ocean subsurface temperature data are very sparse in time and space, and they contain systematic biases for some instruments. Those problems make previous OHC estimates with large uncertainties, which have been referred as ‘pre-mature’ data. That’s why our group in IAP/ICCES keeps working on investigating and quantifying the error sources and providing our estimate on historical OHC change. In this study, we summarized our previous research and provided a new OHC estimate. We will make more efforts to provide more and more accurate OHC estimates in the future."
"A study of an Alaska polar bear population in summer concludes the bear’s biology will not help stave off starvation in the face of global warming.   The study of southern Beaufort Sea polar bears by university, federal and private researchers over three years concludes they have no special ability to minimise energy loss during increasing periods of fasting brought on by climate warming, less sea ice and fewer hunting days.   The research rejects the idea that polar bears can avoid harmful declines in body condition in a sort of “walking hibernation,” as suggested by 1970s research.  Co-author, Steve Amstrup, a retired US Geological Survey polar bear researcher now affiliated with Montana-based Polar Bears International, said the “walking hibernation” theory arose with observations of bears at Canada’s Hudson Bay.   The paper published on Thursday in the journal Science instead concludes that polar bears have no such ability to conserve energy and react like all other mammals when faced with limited food.  “We haven’t known until now whether bears really reduce their metabolism in summer, which, if they did, may have offered a limited buffer from some of the negative effects of ice loss,” said lead author John Whiteman of the University of Wyoming.  Fasting is a way of life for many animals. For polar bears, fasting can last eight months. Their main prey is ringed seals. Hunting is most successful from April to July when seals use sea ice for rearing pups and molting.   In months following, ringed seals spend most of their time in water. Some polar bears retreat to land, where feeding opportunities are limited, or stay on sea ice that in recent years has retreated far north of the shallow, biologically abundant outer continental shelf.  Using helicopters launched from a Coast Guard icebreaker, researchers sampled bears on summer sea ice.  “This paper gives us the first solid understanding of polar bear metabolism in summer, especially out on the sea ice over deep water far from shore, where bears have never been sampled before,” Whiteman said.  The study found that activity and temperature patterns recorded for polar bears in summer were not comparable to patterns for hibernating bears in winter dens. The patterns were typical of food-deprived mammals rather than hibernating mammals, Amstrup said.  Karyn Rode, US Geological Survey research wildlife biologist in Anchorage who was part of a polar bear fasting study published in 2012, said the new study confirms that “walking hibernation” does not accurately describe polar bears’ energetic status in the summer.  “It’s definitely a different line of evidence that further supports that they can’t conserve energy when they’re fasting,” Rode said. Additional studies are coming out, but scientists say it is already clear what needs to be done.  “We already know the answer to the question, ‘What do we need to do to save polar bears from extinction?” Amstrup said. “All of the studies in the world won’t help us there. If we don’t deal with greenhouse gas emissions, those of us who have been studying polar bears for our whole lives will be nothing more than polar bear historians.” "
"Asia’s largest Catholic country has mobilised after the pope’s warning to tackle climate change, promising to gather 10m signatures for a petition that will be handed to world leaders at a Paris climate summit in November. The Catholic climate petition aims to pressure countries to drastically cut carbon emissions to keep the global temperature rise below the dangerous 1.5°C threshold, and to help the world’s poorest to cope with climate change. “We’re getting signatures as a representation of the Catholic’s voice on the issue of climate change, especially in pushing global leaders to urgently act,” said Lou Arsenio, in Manila, the local coordinator for the Global Catholic Climate Movement (GCCM), a coalition of more than 140 Catholic groups. Pope Francis’s June encyclical on the environment said the world must act on climate change and that a failure to do so presents an undeniable risk to a “common home” that is beginning to resemble a “pile of filth”. The Philippines, a country of 100 million, aims to deliver half of the 20m signatures targeted by GCCM and its partners. Its 76 million Catholics, who follow papal edicts closely, are aware of the disasters wrought by climate change on the archipelagic country. Typhoon Haiyan, the strongest typhoon known to ever hit land, flattened communities and killed at least 6,000 people in central Philippines in 2013. It is a tragedy that compelled the pope to visit in January to console the survivors. About a third of Filipinos see environmental problems as the greatest in the world. Flash floods and landslides plague Manila as the monsoon season starts. Arsenio, who is also the ecology ministry coordinator of the Manila archdiocese, cites growing cases of food poisoning, which she blames on rising temperatures. The Philippine Catholic church, established by Spanish colonialists in the 16th century, has already been at the forefront of environmental battles, particularly against large-scale mining operations and coal-fired power plants. The pope’s encyclical provides a “clear and unequivocal” mandate from the church, which has electrified Catholic Filipino environmentalists, said Father Edwin Gariguez. “When you see 300 priests in Lipa, for example, going out to protest against the coal-fired power plant, I’m sure they are more than inspired by the pope’s encyclical to take on this stand,” Gariguez told the Guardian. Gariguez was recognised by the Goldman environmental prize for leading a grassroots movement against illegal nickel mining in Mindoro island, an area recognised as one of the world’s most biodiversity-rich marine environments. The encyclical was an affirmation of what the Philippine Catholic church had long been a witness to: the link between the environment and poverty. “Pope Francis was able to contextualise the discourse on a much wider framework to point out the interconnectedness of everything. It is now easy to realise that the ‘cry of the Earth is the cry of the poor’, ” he said. Gariguez, who is also the executive director of the church’s nationwide social action group the national secretariat for social action (Nassa), said the church would continue to take concrete initiatives and interventions to address climate change and its impact on poverty. “We have an ongoing program for the rehabilitation of the nine Haiyan-affected provinces. We are now in the second year of implementing our rehabilitation program, costing around eight million euros,” said Gariguez. Nassa also promotes sustainable farming. “We believe that by using existing sustainable farming techniques, we can increase progressively soil organic matter by 60 tonnes per hectare over the next 50 years. In the process we would have captured more than two-thirds of the current excess of CO2 in the atmosphere,” he said. The commitment is repeated in church organisations around the country, such as Singles for Christ (SFC), a nationwide organisation of young Catholics which has launched a “love for nature” campaign. “We always see flooding in the news. That is not God-made,” said Joanne Rentutar, SFC’s advocacy head. “It is caused by garbage, which is man-made. We have to make the SFC members understand the issue so they can be catalysts of change.” "

"Australians’ biggest fear in tackling climate change is that they are doing the “lifting” while other countries do the “leaning”, the former head of the United Nations agency tasked with leading the global response to climate change has said. Yvo de Boer, who headed the UN framework convention on climate change (UNFCCC), told Guardian Australia that the country’s political leaders must help people understand that all countries are doing what they can to cut emissions.  “[Leaders must] give people confidence that we’re all lifters, but that we must respect that each shoulder is not able to shoulder the same amount,” de Boer said, referring to former prime minister Robert Menzies’s description of “lifters and leaners”, often cited by current prime minister Tony Abbott. “It is essential to give people confidence that everyone is doing their fair share,” de Boer said. De Boer, who now heads up the Global Green Growth Institute (GGGI), said developing countries will “leapfrog” richer nations when it comes to the use of renewable energy. He points to countries like India which are addressing shortfalls in energy infrastructure in poorer communities by providing self-sufficient green energy like rooftop solar panels. That is in contrast to Abbott’s statements last year that coal is “good for humanity” because it is “vital for the energy needs of the world”. De Boer said: “It is very important to think about the demands of the future and not the demands of the past.” “You can say that windmills are ugly, but at the end of the day, it is the validity of that argument that wins people,” he said, referring to Australian frontbenchers saying turbines are an eyesore. “I’m not sure that it really changes people’s minds.” De Boer has warned that constantly changing domestic policies on clean energy makes it difficult for the clean energy industry to flourish. “The biggest barrier around the world is inconsistency in government policy,” he said. “It makes it very difficult for an investor to assess risk properly.” That risk is posing an “uphill struggle” for renewable energy projects to get funding in the current marketplace, a problem that the GGGI hopes to help redress through a focus on getting bankable green energy projects up and running in developing nations. De Boer’s comments come just ahead of an expected announcement by opposition leader Bill Shorten that Labor will increase the target for renewable energy to 50%, setting up a point of difference with the government, which insists increased renewables will drive up consumers’ energy costs. De Boer said that arguments that renewables are expensive and fossil fuels are cheap are false because they fail to take into account the health costs of burning fossil fuels, and the cost of maintaining ageing infrastructure. The use of renewables in cutting carbon emissions is likely to be a hot topic at the Paris climate conference later this year. Australia has yet to announce what post-202o commitment it will put forward at the high-profile UN meeting. De Boer was executive secretary of the UNFCCC for nearly four years until 2010, but resigned shortly after the 2009 Copenhagen climate conference, an event heavily criticised for its failure to set strong targets."

"Bill Shorten has signalled Australia’s post-2020 emissions reduction target may not win bipartisan support if Tony Abbott forces Australia into “the path of lowest common denominator” in Paris later this year. The opposition leader told reporters on Tuesday bipartisanship was important on emissions reduction targets, but not at any cost.  The signal from Shorten comes as the Abbott governmentmoves to formal consideration of the post-2020 emissions reduction target it will take to United Nations-led climate talks in Paris, which start on 30 November. The expectation, ahead of a final cabinet decision, is that Australia will ultimately adopt a similar position to the one adopted by Canada in the global process, which is a cut of 30% on 2005 levels by 2030. The Australian reported on Tuesday that the Abbott government is considering adopting emissions reductions of between 15% and 25% on 2005 levels by 2030. Government sources said on Tuesday a decision had not yet been made but Australia’s final position would likely be in that ballpark. While that target certainly won’t win praise from climate groups, the prime minister is already on notice from backbenchers that the government’s post-2020 targets in Paris will be the subject of robust internal debate when the party room considers the issue in August. The government was expected to unveil its position for Paris either this week or next but the prime minister said on Monday the policy would need to be cleared by both cabinet and the Coalition party room, which doesn’t meet until August. Australia’s current emissions reduction target to 2020 is a bipartisan position. But the Labor leadership is currently under pressure from the ALP membership to immediately sign on to post-2020 emissions reduction targets recently recommended by the Climate Change Authority. The Climate Change Authority says Australia should reduce emissions by 30% by 2025 on 2000 levels, and aim to reduce carbon pollution by 40% to 60% by 2030 – which is a significantly more ambitious position than the one being contemplated by the Abbott government. Shorten will face a motion at the looming ALP national conference attempting to lock the parliamentary party in behind that stance. Asked on Tuesday whether he would seek a bipartisan position with the government on the new 2030 target, Shorten told reporters: “There’s no doubt that it’s important to have emissions reduction targets being bipartisan, but it is also important therefore that Mr Abbott doesn’t force Australia into the path of lowest common denominator.” “Mr Abbott loves to talk about bipartisanship so long as it’s agreeing with him; the issue here is that we need to have renewable energy as part of our energy mix in the future,” the Labor leader said. The Climate Institute meanwhile blasted any target for Australia that would involve a 15 to 25% cut. It says a cut of that order would put Australia in the worst position of any developing nation in the current UN process. “Both a 15 or a 25% target would be big fail on both climate action and competiveness grounds,” said Climate Institute deputy chief executive, Erwin Jackson. “These targets would leave Australia languishing at the back of the pack at best, and, at worst, the most pollution intensive developed economy,” he said. “While other countries are taking serious steps to limit pollution and modernise and clean up their economies, Australia would continue to loss its competitive position in a world moving to zero carbon economy.”"

"In the not too distant past Tony Abbott hopped on his bike and set off for a ride around Rottnest Island. His path took him right under the West Australian island’s sole wind turbine, and according to the prime minister this helped him form the view that windfarms were visually awful, noisy and potentially a health risk. It must have been a particularly offensive turbine. Because in recent times Abbott has launched a number of verbal and policy assaults on wind energy.  But to his detractors this is only part of the picture. His government, they argue, has sought to undermine the entire A$20bn (£9.4bn) Australian renewable energy industry. “It is quite extraordinary to see a government deliberately and systematically attacking a particular industry,” says Kobad Bhavnagri, the Australian head of Bloomberg New Energy Finance. There is a broad national architecture to encourage more renewable energy in Australia. On its back, alongside numerous state-based schemes, the industry had grown at a steady rate from modest beginnings. Under the Gillard government the $2.5bn Australian Renewable Energy Agency (Arena) was established, as was the $7bn Clean Energy Finance Corporation (CEFC).  The national renewable energy target was set-up by the Howard government in 2001 and later expanded by the Rudd government, with bipartisan support, to ensure at least 20% of Australia’s power comes from renewable sources by 2020. Australia now has more than 1,800 wind turbines installed. 1.4m rooftop solar systems are on homes and businesses. And 12,590 people are employed in the industry full-time. But the overall share of renewable energy in Australia’s electricity mix remains modest. In 2014 it was just 13.5% of the total power supply, with almost half of that coming from decades-old hydro electricity schemes. Australia is still largely powered by coal. “We have a clapped out old energy fleet that belongs in the Eastern Bloc, not in a sophisticated and clever country such as ours,” Kane Thornton, chief executive of the Clean Energy Council, said last week in a speech. “With over half of our existing coal fleet beyond its operating life, and with one of the most carbon-intensive energy systems in the world, it is time to clean-up and modernise our power system,” he declared. Since coming to power the Abbott government has cut the renewable energy target. It tried, so far unsuccessfully, to axe both Arena and the CEFC. It scrapped an election commitment to rollout out another one million rooftop solar systems. It has launched a parliamentary inquiry into wind turbines and agreed to establish a windfarm commissioner. The government has arguments for each decision, some reasonable. But for the industry the collective upheaval has crippled it for close to two years. “Frustrating, is the word that comes to mind,” said Danny Nielsen, managing director of the Asia-Pacific arm of wind energy giant Vestas. “We have a little internal joke at the moment that there is less sovereign risk in Pakistan than there is in Australia.” (Before you scoff, Nielsen says energy-hungry Pakistan is increasingly looking at renewables to meet its growing power demand). In Sydney last week an air of gloom hung over the annual Clean Energy Summit. Attendee numbers were down 20% on last year, but one senior industry figure pointed to a more glaring omission among the empty seats and vacant tables near the back of the summit’s gala awards dinner. “Where are the bankers?” he said. If the bankers aren’t out in force to schmooze potential clients it indicates their appetite for deals will be satiated elsewhere – despite almost $14bn in new investments still needed to meet Australia’s renewable energy target. In the year up to the end of March 2015 investment in large-scale renewables had collapsed to $259m, according to data from Bloomberg New Energy Finance. In the corresponding 12 months previous it had been $2.5bn. And over the last two years more than 2,000 jobs have been shed in the industry on Australian Bureau of Statistics estimates. Thornton told the summit that in the last 18 months Australian renewables investment has fallen behind countries like Honduras and Myanmar. Meanwhile global renewable energy investment has boomed. It reached $310bn last year, up 16 per cent on 2013. China, the United States and Japan led the way. The local industry lays the blame for the Australian drought on the uncertainty created by the government. Renewable energy is an industry hostage to politics. The latest salvo was a directive last week from treasurer Joe Hockey and finance minister Mathias Cormann that the Clean Energy Finance Corporation not invest in windfarms and rooftop solar. The CEFC was established to increase the flow of funds into clean energy and energy efficiency projects. It is effectively a green investment bank, there to help finance clean technology projects where commercial lenders are hesitant. Since its inception it has made $1.4bn in commitments to 89 projects. That has sparked a further $2.2bn in investments from private lenders, including the big four banks. Its expected rate of return is 6%, almost double the average the government gets from bonds. It is making a profit and paying dividends. When SunEdison, the world’s largest renewable energy developer, was first looking to come to Australia it struggled to find the finance it needed among commercial investors. The US-based company is aiming to claim a slice of the Australia’s rooftop solar market by installing panels for free on homes and then selling the generated power at a reduced rate to residents. It is a common model overseas, but not yet in Australia. The Clean Energy Finance Corporation provided the $70m in financing it needed. Jeremy Rich, managing director of SunEdison Australia, said without the CEFC the company would not be here, nor would its equity and jobs. “The constant bombardment of changes, and what appears to be an attack against the industry, creates a lot of confusion for the Australian community and consumers as well as people employed in the industry,” Rich said. The Coalition’s broad argument for axing the CEFC is that it is an unnecessary government intervention in private finance markets. Ministers point to the corporation’s deals to refinancing already built windfarms to emphasise this point. With its attempts to close the CEFC frustrated by the Senate, the government has tinkered in other ways. Earlier this year Hockey and Cormann sent an investment mandate to the corporation insisting it had to achieve higher returns from its investment but without taking on more risk in the projects it backs. This sparked alarm inside the green bank. CEFC chair and senior businesswoman, Jillian Broadbent, wrote back saying: “achieving such increased returns without increasing risk is highly challenging, and in my experience, outside the scope of normal market practice.” The second order for a halt to wind and rooftop solar investments – a result of a deal with anti-wind crossbench Senators – has left the CEFC seeking legal advice about whether this directive complies with its act and what exact technologies it would not be allowed to back. The government’s view was that the renewable energy target would support new windfarms and rooftop solar and the corporation’s focus should instead be on “emerging technologies” in particular large-scale solar. Or as Abbott explained it last week: “As long as it exists, it might as well be as useful as possible and … invest in new and emerging technologies, the things that might not otherwise get finance.” Those wanting the corporation left untouched say this is counter to the objectives set out in the CEFC’s legislation. And they point to Arena – a separate agency that provides conditional grants to renewable energy projects – as the body best placed to back emerging technologies. In opposition the Coalition vowed to retain Arena. But in power it first cut its budget, then moved to axe the body altogether. Again it has been blocked by the Senate. Ivor Frischknecht, Arena’s chief executive, said uncertainty about the agency’s future had left some potential industry partners unclear about its priorities and even its existence. Arena is working hard to let people know it is still around. “We have been in the same state, the state in which the government has a policy to abolish us but is not actually doing so, for over a year,” Frischknecht said. “Strange as that sounds I think confidence is now increasing.”  To date Arena has invested $1.1bn in 230 projects across the country. Last week it released a blueprint for its future priorities, including helping build 200 megawatts of new large-scale solar.  While rooftop solar has boomed, Frischknecht pointed out that Australia is lagging well behind even countries like Romania and Chile on utility scale. Frischknect puts this down to a lack of strong policy support and low wholesale electricity prices. Some large solar projects are now under construction and Frischknect said it was critical the momentum continued to keep building the supply chain and drive costs down. But if Arena and the CEFC did not exist, he said, then the next wave of projects would have to hope for state government support. While the battle over Arena and the CEFC plays out, the biggest scars for the renewable energy industry came during the protracted battle over the renewable energy target. In opposition the Coalition gave bipartisan support for the target, but also flagged it would launch a review. In government Abbott hand-picked businessman and climate sceptic Dick Warburton to lead it. The review pleased few. It recommended closing the target to new entrants or cutting it back significantly on the basis of yearly reviews. Bhavnagri said the Warburton review was perhaps the most damaging hit to investor confidence. In recommending the scheme be closed, while ultimately not accepted, Bhavnagri said it went to areas western governments were normally hesitant to tread - retrospective policy making. It was a devastating signal to the market. The government instead sought to negotiate a deal with the opposition. Set to achieve 41,000 gigawatt-hours of renewable energy by 2020, the Coalition wanted that brought back to 26,000, while Labor and the industry wanted little change. Over an agonising 16 months – during which investment continued to dry up – the two parties agreed on a new goal of 33,000 gigawatt-hours. The government’s case for cutting the target was that as demand for power had fallen sharply the 20% goal would be overshot significantly. It also doubted the industry could build enough projects to meet the target. If it is reached, the cut back target will still see about 23% share for renewables by 2020 on current forecasts. It is understood it took a hard internal push from environment minister Greg Hunt and a number of backbenchers to get a workable compromise through. But the prime minister would later tell radio broadcaster Alan Jones he had sought to cut the target to stop the spread of windfarms. “Now I would frankly have liked to have reduced the number a lot more,” Mr Abbott said. Mr Abbott also hinted he did not really want the target at all. While the Howard government had introduced the scheme, on reflection Abbott said “I don’t think we would have gone down this path in this way.”  Going so hard at renewable energy is not without political risk for Abbott. While the “carbon tax” was toxic in the broader electorate, and a vote winner for the Coalition, support for renewable energy has remained consistently high in opinion polling. For instance polling by the Liberal party’s pollsters Crosby Textor – commissioned by wind company Pacific Hydro during the debate of the target – found 82% of people viewed solar favourably, while 67% viewed wind in the same good light. The fossil fuel industry on the other hand was seen favourably by only 24% of respondents. And the carbon tax just 21%. Another looming issue for the Abbott government is that it is about to establish a new target to reduce greenhouse gases for next decade, which will have to be larger than the current promised cut to emissions of five per cent from 2000 levels by 2020. It is highly unlikely Australia can meet this new goal without further transition in the power mix towards cleaner sources. But much of the current renewable energy support – even if it survives the chop – is geared to run out around 2020. Of course the government also axed the carbon price. And there remains scepticism its replacement scheme, Direct Action, will be able to meet any deeper goal for 2030 as currently designed. What comes next is still unclear. Energy policy manager at the Grattan Institute, Tony Wood, said whatever was adopted it should be broad and have as much bipartisan support as possible, whether it is a reworking of Direct Action or a carbon price of some sort. Nielsen said whatever is put in place must be a long-term platform because investments in the energy industry are taken with a multi-decade view. “You can’t turn it on and off every 18 months,” he said. In the meantime the renewable energy industry is trying to get off the mat. Since the target was bedded down two new windfarms have reached financial close, but only on the back of extra ACT government support. Nielsen said there were about 8000 megawatts worth of Australian wind energy sites ready to be developed. But he believed companies would likely wait out the year before again looking to sign contracts to build. There remains a wariness of prevailing conditions. “We all know next year is an election year again,” Nielsen said."
"With a growing number of CEOs publicly committing their companies to taking action on climate change, what difference can their pronouncements make? Can they persuade others to follow suit, or encourage governments to legislate? Or is there still too much scepticism about the honesty of business? As Richard Branson has discovered, speaking out but not following through on commitments can bring its own reputational risk. He has been criticised for failing to deliver on a $3bn climate pledge made back in 2006. There may also be justifiable doubts about whether one leader or CEO on his own can change the long-term course of his or her company. A speech, press release or strategy document does not necessarily translate into business behaviour five, ten or twenty years down the line. On Wednesday 5 August, 1-2:30pm BST a group of experts will join us on a live blog page to discuss this theme and what more we can hope or expect business leaders to do on social and environmental issues, including climate change.

"Bill de Blasio, the mayor of New York City, has pledged to reduce his city’s carbon footprint by 40% by 2030 in a speech in which he praised Pope Francis – who he called the “highest moral authority” – for calling on the world to take bold action on climate change. The remarks were presented at a rare Vatican meeting of mayors from around the world, who gathered to discuss the environmental challenges facing their cities and the correlation between global warming and modern slavery.  De Blasio, who arrived at Vatican City a few hours late after his flight from New York was diverted by fog, said it had become “painfully obvious” that political leaders had to set “difficult goals for ourselves” in the fight against global warming.  He emphasised that, even as national leaders waffled on the issue, local mayors had to take matters into their own hands and “jolt our national paradigms”. He praised Pope Francis’s encyclical on the environment, a sweeping, nearly 200-page document that calls for leaders to phase out dependence on fossil fuels and criticises consumerism and consumption that propagates global warming. The encyclical takes aim at the developed countries that have exploited the environment at the expense of the poor. “The encyclical is not a call to arms. It is a call to sanity,” De Blasio said. He began his speech with a bold “Buongiorno” to the gathered guests. De Blasio, who has Italian roots, is something of a local hero in Italy, which he visited last year on a 10-day family vacation. He also gave a warm greeting to Rome’s embattled mayor, Ignazio Marino, who is under pressure to resign because he is seen by some – including members of his own party – as incapable of coming to grips with a huge corruption scandal which has engulfed Rome, dating back to his predecessor, who is now under investigation. De Blasio sent a tweet in support of Marino last month. .@IgnazioMarino’s record of cleaning up a corrupt system is commendable—we must continue to stand up for leaders who stand up to corruption. New York’s mayor is a founding member of a group of local leaders who have said they would reduce carbon emissions by 80% by 2050, but De Blasio used the Vatican conference to issue an interim goal: a reduction of 40% by 2030. He also highlighted the role December’s climate summit in Paris would play. “We look ahead to the Paris summit, just months away. We need to see it as a finish line to a sprint,” he said. “Paris may constitute our last best hope.” When asked if Wall Street was a good partner in New York’s fight against global warming, the mayor said the city was just beginning to engage the business community to reach its goals. “I’ve said to the business community that we would love to meet these goals together, but if there is any hesitation on the part of the real estate community, business community, we will mandate action ... It is about survival,” he said. “My message is clear. We come in peace; we would like to do this cooperatively. If we see a lack of commitment, we will mandate it,” he said. De Blasio said he hoped to spend time with Pope Francis during the pontiff’s September trip to New York City. “This is a leader that we haven’t seen before. He is saying things so clearly and so powerfully. He is moving people on an extraordinary level,” De Blasio said. “He is literally saying we have to reset our assumptions and think more deeply and more morally about our actions because our current sense of practicality is digging our graves,” he said, adding that he hoped the pope’s visit to Washington DC would have a “cleansing effect” on the US Congress. De Blasio was not the only mayor representing a North American city at the Vatican. Others included San Francisco’s Edwin Lee, Seattle’s Ed Murray, Boston’s Martin Walsh and Mitch Landrieu of New Orleans. Vancouver’s mayor, Gregor Robertson, was the only Canadian at the meeting. While each represented a different geographical area and faces unique environmental challenges, they have one thing in common: all are Democrats. While some Republican mayors were invited to attend the function, a person familiar with the organisation of the conference said that none accepted."

"Your paper’s campaigning journalism to tackle the crisis of climate change is much needed. But too many times, as with your article on the bumblebee’s failure to escape warming climates by moving north (10 July), one of the major culprits is omitted from the story. While the article begins with the well-worn causes of “emissions from cars, factories and power plants”, the huge impact of animal agriculture is again missing from the picture. The UN’s 2006 report, Livestock’s Long Shadow, and the World Watch Institute’s 2009 report, and many since, including the fourth report from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, all recognise animal agriculture’s major role – more than all traffic and communications combined. For your reports on climate change to be meaningful and not derisory, animal agriculture should be one of the key industries you investigate and report on, even in passing. Only then can your campaign against this threat of our times have real purchase.Dr Alex LockwoodCentre for Research in Media and Cultural Studies, University of Sunderland "
"I agree with much of your first comment on climate change (Editorial, 23 July). However, I would like to expand upon the observation that “just like fracking and nuclear, greening the energy supply needs intervention”. The question is: what is a reasonably sensible subsidy to provide energy technologies, especially those that generate electricity? You report in the same edition of the Guardian (Government to cut solar power subsidies saving customers 50p per year) that the discontinuation of solar subsides will save customers a trivial amount off their annual energy bills, but will simultaneously devastate a fast-growing, but still young, sustainable energy sector.  This is stupidly shortsighted of the chancellor, George Osborne, whose slash and burn strategy is being implemented by an impotent and reluctant energy and climate change department, which seems to have forgotten its responsibilities. The chancellor’s father in-law, Lord Howell of Guildford, who in 1979, as Margaret Thatcher’s first energy secretary, announced a programme of 10 nuclear reactors, of which only one, Sizewell B, was ever built, said in the debate on the energy bill in the Lords on 22 July: “By far the biggest obligation, or future burden, on consumers and households is the Hinkley Point C nuclear project. I am very pro-nuclear and pro its low-carbon contribution but this must be one of the worst deals ever for British households and British industry. Furthermore, the component suppliers to EDF are in trouble, costs keep rising, no reactor of this kind has ever been completed successfully, those that are being built are years behind and workers at the site have been laid off, so personally I would shed no tears at all if the elephantine Hinkley Point C project were abandoned.” The newly constituted parliamentary energy and climate change select committee should investigate this funding situation as its first priority.Dr David LowrySenior research fellow, Institute for Resource and Security Studies, Cambridge, Mass, USA • Amber Rudd, the energy secretary, sanctimoniously states that the green deal did not provide value for money for the taxpayer (Report, 24 July). I believe she is referring to the bankrolling of the Green Deal Finance Company. This is a private not-for-profit company with such high running costs that it required Amber Rudd’s “hard-working families” to pay interest on loans at 7%, a non-competitive rate compared with mortgages. Workers on the ground, such as myself (running Ecomorph to provide green deal advice), advised at the start that the green deal needed fundamental adjustments. Its monumental bureaucracy inflates the price of installations, with a minimum of nine bodies between the householder and the installer, if you include all the auditing and oversight bodies. The complex loans system required a redefinition of the word “debt” in the Consumer Credit Act to allow houses rather than people to be debtors. Altogether, the cost of most energy-efficiency measures would not be covered by the savings that the measures provided; which is the model for the pay-as-you-save green deal. Why did the government not go for 0% loans administered through local authorities? Local authorities ran just such schemes for community buildings, with revolving money loaned and repaid through Salix funding.Dr Sue RobertsWallingford, Oxfordshire • Removing subsidies from low-carbon energy sources is said to be to keep bills down. If this is the reason, perhaps the government will also remove recent additional subsidies for fracking and nuclear energy, levelling the playing field. Amber Rudd says Decc is not a green NGO. At present her department looks more tar-black, or perhaps mushroom-coloured. Either way, it doesn’t look as if climate change is a consideration.Gill WestcottExeter • Now it is the turn of the solar industry to defend its renewable subsidies, which, its supporters claim, won’t be needed soon. But even if the subsidies were to stop in 10 years, 90% of the industry would probably disappear. The electrical generation of small-scale solar arrays is estimated, and doesn’t account for reduced generation due to faulty installation, snow, dust, shade and panels that don’t face south, so there are undoubtedly homes that receive the full, index-linked subsidy for 20-25 years but generate little or nothing. Amber Rudd is right. Geoff MooreAlness, Ross and Cromarty • Three headlines in the Guardian (24 July): “UK suspends ban on crop spray thought to harm bees”, “Government scraps ‘transformational’ green deal for energy-efficient houses” and “UK ducks investigation into toxic oil waste citing lack of skills and resources”. Says it all, really.Bruce HolmanWaterlooville, Hampshire • Calls for action on climate change from Arnold Schwarzenegger and other luminaries should have been made decades ago (Global warming is not science fiction, warns Schwarzenegger, 22 July) In 1989 I wrote an editorial for the Lancet entitled “Health in the Greenhouse” which concluded as follows: “Any strategy to combat global warming must be conducted on a global scale ... This approach will require a new agenda for world leaders, a new role for the United Nations Environmental Programme, and a new awareness of man’s fundamental reliance on the integrity of world ecosystems.The expense may be considerable, but the cost of doing nothing is incalculable”. Twenty six years on and nothing much has changed except that annual emissions of CO2 worldwide have risen by 60 per cent, whilst renewables account for just 2 per cent of global primary energy production. In the UK, the government is phasing out subsidies for on- shore wind whilst offering tax breaks to fracking companies. Stricter standards for new build have been shelved, energy conservation is being scaled back and feed in tariffs for solar are being cut. George Osborne has said he does not want Britain to be “ahead of the pack on climate change”. He can rest assured that there is absolutely no danger of that.Dr Robin Russell-JonesStoke • We are told that climate change is a threat to future generations and reducing carbon emissions can reduce this threat to an acceptable level. However, the perilous state of Arctic sea ice is ignored. In your report (Arctic sea ice shows surprise revival in cool year, 21 July), Prof Andy Shepherd of UCL makes a point about the sea ice being a key component of the Earth’s climate system. Recent evidence suggests that climate change will accelerate rapidly as the sea ice collapses and Arctic temperatures soar. Despite its revival in 2013, the sea ice could be heading for a new record minimum this September. Recovery of sea ice through emissions reduction, as your article suggests, is out of the question. The Arctic needs to be cooled quickly to save the sea ice and avoid repercussions. Over the past few years, rapid Arctic warming has disrupted the polar jet stream leading to growing extremes of weather at lower latitudes. A rapid demise of sea ice over the next few years would lead to accelerating climate change for us all, with potentially devastating effects on food production leading to famine, economic collapse, migration, and yet more conflict in the world. So can the sea ice be saved? The good news from scientists is that it could be , given enough effort, determination and leadership. This is a golden opportunity for President Obama to make his mark.

"The threat of climate change needs to be assessed in the same comprehensive way as nuclear weapons proliferation, according to a UK foreign minister. Baroness Joyce Anelay, minister of state at the Commonwealth and Foreign Office, said the indirect impacts of global warming, such as deteriorating international security, could be far greater than the direct effects, such as flooding. She issued the warning in a foreword to a new report on the risks of climate change led by the UK’s climate change envoy, Prof Sir David King.  The report, commissioned by the Foreign Office, and written by experts from the UK, US, China and India, is stark in its assessment of the wide-ranging dangers posed by unchecked global warming, including: The world’s nations are preparing for a crunch UN summit in Paris in December, at which they must agree a deal to combat climate change.   Monday’s report states that existing plans to curb carbon emissions would heighten the chances of the climate passing tipping points “beyond which the inconvenient may become intolerable”. In 2004, King, then the government’s chief scientific adviser, warned that climate change is a more serious threat to the world than terrorism. “Assessing the risk around [nuclear weapon proliferation] depends on understanding inter-dependent elements, including: what the science tells us is possible; what our political analysis tells us a country may intend; and what the systemic factors are, such as regional power dynamics,” said Anelay. “The risk of climate change demands a similarly holistic assessment.” The report sets out the direct risks of climate change. “Humans have limited tolerance for heat stress,” it states. “In the current climate, safe climatic conditions for work are already exceeded frequently for short periods in hot countries, and heatwaves already cause fatalities. In future, climatic conditions could exceed potentially lethal limits of heat stress even for individuals resting in the shade.” It notes that “the number of people exposed to extreme water shortage is projected to double, globally, by mid century due to population growth alone. Climate change could increase the risk in some regions.” In the worst case, what is today a once-in-30-year flood could happen every three years in the highly populated river basins of the Yellow, Ganges and Indus rivers, the report said. Without dramatic cuts to carbon emissions, extreme drought affecting farmland could double around the world, with impacts in southern Africa, the US and south Asia. Areas affected by the knock-on or systemic risks of global warming include global security with extreme droughts and competition for farmland causing conflicts. “Migration from some regions may become more a necessity than a choice, and could take place on a historically unprecedented scale,” the report says. “It seems likely that the capacity of the international community for humanitarian assistance would be overwhelmed.” “The risks of state failure could rise significantly, affecting many countries simultaneously, and even threatening those that are currently considered developed and stable,” says the report. “The expansion of ungoverned territories would in turn increase the risks of terrorism.” The report also assesses the systemic risk to global food supply, saying that rising extreme weather events could mean shocks to global food prices previously expected once a century could come every 30 years. “A plausible worst-case scenario could produce unprecedented price spikes on the global market, with a trebling of the prices of the worst-affected grains,” the report concludes. The greatest risks are tipping points, the report finds, where the climate shifts rapidly into a new, dangerous phase state. But the report also states that political leadership, technology and investment patterns can also change abruptly too. The report concludes: “The risks of climate change may be greater than is commonly realised, but so is our capacity to confront them. An honest assessment of risk is no reason for fatalism.”"

"A “worrying” lack of diversity on the boards of major US oil companies increases the risks of “groupthink” and bad investment choices, according to a new report from the University of Oxford. Fossil fuel companies are facing an increase in measures to cut carbon emissions as world leaders move to tackle climate change. A global deal to curb global warming at a crunch UN summit in Paris in December could leave $1tn of oil projects unable to make a return, or stranded, according to analyses.   Some companies, including ExxonMobil, have argued that their businesses will be unaffected because nations will fail to deliver the emissions cuts needed. The new analysis concludes that a lack of different opinions on the company boards increases the risk that they will make poor decisions. “The significance of psychological error increases when companies are faced with new and relatively unknown risks – environment-related risks, like climate change, are a perfect example of this,” said report co-author Ben Caldecott, director of the Stranded Assets Programme at the University of Oxford. The report shows that Chevron has no board members without US citizenship and just two of the 14 are women, while ExxonMobil has just one non-American and just two of its 12 board members are women. Both companies also have a narrow range of ages on the board, with oldest and youngest separated by only 16 years. In contrast, the major European oil companies Total, BP and Shell all have five different nationalities represented on their boards. At Total, five of the 14 board members are women and the age range is 38 years.  “Psychological research finds significantly different attitudes towards risk across nationality and age profiles, [so] the homogeneity of American boards in these respects is worrying, and could serve to increase the propensity for groupthink,” states the report. There has been what Bloomberg called a “schism” between the US and European oil majors in recent weeks, with the European companies calling for the Paris summit to lead to a price being put on carbon emissions. ExxonMobil chief executive Rex Tillerson said he did not intend to “fake it” on climate change. The Oxford report analysed the gender, age, length of tenure, nationality, and degree of experience outside the oil and gas industry of the board members. It found that across these measures the US boards were significantly less diverse, although it noted that “none of the boards examined should be extolled for diversity” given in particular the lack of women.  “Groupthink can be harmful for capital expenditure projects by international oil companies (IOCs) because it tends to mitigate or eliminate dissenting viewpoints,” states the report. “When it comes to weighing up risky outcomes that have not yet occurred, groupthink can cause such remote possibilities to be heavily discounted.” “Board diversity should be a top priority for IOCs,” the report concludes. “We suggest that shareholders make their voices strongly and clearly heard when it comes to demanding that deep consideration be granted to the ways in which boards are constructed.”"

"At the end of this year there will be a critically important international climate change conference in Paris. At this conference, nations will attempt to reach an agreement to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and slow global warming.  Over the past few months there’s been a flood of big climate-related news, most of which will help build support and pressure for a strong agreement to curb global warming at the Paris conference. The political and social climate is shifting, and those in denial about human-caused climate change are struggling to adapt.  John Abraham recently reported on two separate studies published in Nature and Nature Climate Change, both of which found that global warming is intensifying several types of extreme weather. California is in the midst of a drought unprecedented in over a millennium, a heat wave is killing thousands of people in India and Pakistan, another has been baking Europe, and it seems as though half of North America is on fire. One challenge in generating public support for tackling climate change is in the perception that its consequences are distant in time and space. People tend to believe that climate change will impact others in the future, but not themselves, and not now. As we see more examples of extreme weather, and the evidence for a climate connection strengthens, more people may begin to consider climate action a higher priority. More research is warning of climate change causing major threats to ocean ecosystems and consequently to humans as well. A recent study found that we’re headed towards a climate state similar to those that saw sea levels 6 meters higher in the past. Further sea level rise is a foregone conclusion; the questions we now face are how much more of a rise we’ll trigger, and crucially, how fast it will happen. Meanwhile, the oceans are warming faster than predicted, and 2015 is on pace to shatter the global temperature record that was set just last year. At the same time, social science research is showing that most climate ‘skepticism’ actually results not from rigorous scientific skepticism, but rather from conspiratorial thinking. As the opposition to climate science and solutions more clearly boils down to psychology and ideology, fewer people will find the associated arguments convincing. The case for climate action received a big boost when the pope made the moral case for the need for urgent climate action, writing in his encyclical, Leaving an inhabitable planet to future generations is, first and foremost, up to us. The issue is one which dramatically affects us, for it has to do with the ultimate meaning of our earthly sojourn. Support for climate action among faith groups has been gradually building, and the pope’s encyclical is the most influential call for stewardship of the climate to date. The grassroots climate group Citizens’ Climate Lobby used the pope’s message in many of its meetings between 800 of the group’s volunteers and 500 congressional offices last month. Interestingly, while many conservative policymakers are dismissive of the expert consensus on human-caused global warming in public, such behavior was noted in less than 10% of these private meetings. As the executive director of Citizens’ Climate Lobby wrote, In meeting after meeting with Republican offices, the unspoken agreement seemed to be: “Let’s not argue about the science; let’s talk about solutions and where we might find common ground.”  There appears to be some bipartisan support for climate action behind the scenes. The challenge is in translating those private stances to the public positions of conservative lawmakers, but with support from faith and military groups and clearer climate consequences for their constituents, it’s an inevitability, sooner or later. We recently learned that fossil fuel companies have known about the climate impacts of their products for over three decades. For example, Exxon decided against developing a natural gas field in Indonesia in 1981 because of the potentially large carbon dioxide release and associated climate impacts. The company nevertheless spent more than $30m over the next 30 years on think tanks and researchers that promoted climate denial. When asked about this discovery, Exxon spokesman Richard Keil said, We have been factoring the likelihood of some kind of carbon tax into our business planning since 2007. We do not fund or support those who deny the reality of climate change. In the US presidential race, Democratic Party candidates have been racing to establish the most aggressive climate policy platform. With a few exceptions, most Republican Party candidates have shifted away from outright climate denial, instead using the “I’m not a scientist” cop-out. Democrats seem to believe that even that stance is a political liability. We’re a long way from recent elections in which many Democratic candidates were afraid to talk about climate change and denial was the norm among Republican candidates. Four months away from the Paris international climate conference, momentum seems to be building rapidly in support of serious climate action, and climate denial may soon make it onto the endangered species list."

"A United Nations accord to slow global warming should be short, flexible and long-lasting to avoid complex re-negotiations every few years, according to a document prepared by France before a Paris summit in December.  The deal will also have to ensure that governments do not backtrack on promises to cut greenhouse gas emissions despite a likely lack of sanctions, according to a briefing for climate ministers attending preparatory talks in Paris on 20-21 July.   “There is a common understanding that the Paris agreement should be flexible, because it will need to adapt to changing circumstances,” according to the five-page document, seen by Reuters.  “There is also a shared recognition that Parties should not have to negotiate a new agreement every five or ten years, but rather that the Paris agreement will form the basis for the enhanced implementation,” it said.  The new legal core of the deal “should be short and concise“, it said. By contrast, a draft text covering all aspects of the agreement, stretches to almost 90 pages.  UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon last month criticised negotiations, launched almost four years ago in South Africa, as advancing at a “snail’s pace”. About 30 nations will attend the informal Paris talks next week.  The United Nations says national plans for curbing greenhouse gas emissions, submitted as the building blocks of the Paris agreement, will not be enough to limit warming to a UN goal of 2C above pre-industrial times.  That means a need for flexibility to ratchet up ambitions in an accord meant to limit greenhouse gases, blamed by the UN’s panel of climate scientists for causing more heat waves, floods and rising sea levels.  Major emitters led by China and the United States have submitted national plans for cuts in greenhouse gases beyond 2020 to the United Nations, as building blocks for the Paris accord. Japan submitted its plan on Friday.  On Wednesday, a report based on talks with negotiators indicated strong will in nations to reach a climate agreement in 2015. Negotiations failed in 2009 at the last attempt at a summit in Copenhagen.  “Behind the scenes we see a real desire to find common ground,” said Harald Dovland, a former lead negotiator for Norway who co-chaired the report by the Centre for Climate and Energy Solutions, a US-based think-tank.

"Britain became smaller over the weekend, with the redrawing of our coastline to create Europe’s largest man-made nature reserve. Sea banks were breached on Wallasea Island, Essex, as part of an RSPB scheme to restore farmland to its natural state – mud flats, salt marsh and shallow salty lagoons. The coast here is being reconfigured with new sea banks constructed from soil and clay excavated from Crossrail’s tunnels beneath London. The first such “managed realignment” of our shores was in 1991, on the Essex island of Northey, which became famed as a place of retreat exactly 1,000 years earlier when Earl Byrhtnoth (“bright courage” in old English) charitably withdrew to allow 3,000 Vikings on to the mainland to fight his small army. Byrhtnoth’s retreat had disastrous consequences but the redrawing of coastal maps for conservation and sea defence is a more uplifting story. Some farmers have objected to sacrificing agricultural land on Wallasea, which we struggled to reclaim from the sea over 400 years ago, but the scheme does not simply benefit wading birds such as spoonbill and avocet. People will gain access to these marshes, and new sea banks working with natural features such as salt marsh – superb at absorbing wave energy – provide us with a cheaper, more sustainable alternative to concrete barricades. Britain has a longer coastline than India, and it will be impossible to maintain existing sea defences over the next century if the most cautious climate scientists’ predictions of rising seas come true. The government won’t admit this, however. Worse, when its head-in-the-sand attitude causes seaside homes to be destroyed by storms, it will shelter behind an obscure 1949 law that absolves it of any responsibility to compensate residents. This cowardice gives managed realignment schemes a bad name in many coastal communities because the phrase sounds like a euphemism for abandoning sea defences and destroying homes without compensation. So far, realignments such as Wallasea and Medmerry, West Sussex, have not involved many or any homes because it is too controversial to sacrifice them if there is no financial help for residents to relocate or rebuild inland. In this way, a more resilient coastline is being created in wild places but not actually where people live. Byrhtnoth may have been slaughtered by the Vikings but retreats before a greater power need not be ignominious. A government with foresight would deliver creative long-term solutions such as Wallasea: the shape of our nation depends on it. Despite being barely 250 metres from an osprey’s nest, the T in the Park festival went ahead over the weekend on a controversial new site at Strathallan, Perth and Kinross. It’s a criminal offence to disturb nesting osprey, and locals observed both adult birds sitting 100 metres away from the nest while the bands played on – clearly disturbed behaviour, and not something osprey-watchers have seen at the four other osprey nests in the county. Thankfully both chicks were still on the nest, with their parents again, as the festival ended on Monday. “There is no question that these birds must’ve suffered extreme stress,” says local resident Zazie Mackintosh. “The festival shouldn’t be allowed to go ahead at Strathallan again.” Muddy T in the Parkers, who have complained of overcrowding, crushes and traffic chaos at the new site, may agree. Woken late Sunday night by heavy breathing in the garden, I tiptoed on to dewy grass and discovered two hedgehogs. One sat motionless, breathing noisily, while another performed a glassy-eyed trundle around it. Hedgehog ecologist Hugh Warwick enlightens me: this lovely ritual is the hedgehog carousel, an enraptured male slowly wooing a (possibly bored) female. The belief that 40,000 circling hogs working in tandem might be the creators of mysterious crop circles was debunked by the Guardian back in 1991 under perhaps its best-ever headline, “Hedgehogs cleared of corn circle dementia”.

"The government is struggling to pay for new clean energy supplies which could result in a rise in household bills or a major cut in investment in renewable technologies. The Department of Energy and Climate Change (DECC) has already overspent its budget to support renewable energy projects over the next five years by £1.5bn, senior sources said.   Unless ministers increase the budget still further, the UK could struggle to meet legally binding commitments to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.  Under European Union targets, the UK must produce 15% of its energy from renewable sources by 2020 and is one of a small number of big member states to be judged on track to meet all of its energy and climate commitments by the European Environment Agency. A Whitehall source told the Guardian the projected overspend on renewables had become the single most important problem for the ministry as it tried to balance its books. Sorting this out is a number one priority but it is a dilemma. It really is ‘answers on a postcard’ time,” the source said. Under a £7.6bn-a-year scheme set up by the coalition government, households which generate renewable energy are promised a premium on top of market price for electricity they provide. The subsidy is paid for by a levy on household energy bills which was supposed to be capped.  But as the price of oil and gas has declined and the number of renewable installations has grown, civil servants have struggled to keep within the scheme’s budget.  Spending limits on the aggregate amount levied from consumers, known as the levy control framework, have been breached three times in as many years by more than 20%. Separately, the government has been accused of “reckless and wasteful” management of renewable energy subsidies in a report released on Thursday by the right-leaning thinktank Policy Exchange. It has called on ministers to maximise household energy efficiency and to focus carbon-cutting efforts on mature technologies such as onshore wind to tackle climate change. The report claims that “green” policies have added about £60 to the average consumer energy bill in the past five year.  Energy profits have added £70 to rising bills and accounted for about £77 of average household dual fuel costs in 2014, while climate policy costs accounted for £89, it claims.  The report sets out a “greener, cheaper” proposal which would keep targets to cut greenhouse gases but ditch or avoid other “market-distorting” goals including a 2020 renewable target and a 2030 goal to slash power sector emissions.  It calls for a revamp of the government’s flagship “green deal” policy, which aims to improve energy efficiency and reduce bills, as the cheapest way to cut carbon emissions.  The report has been criticised by Lord Turner of Ecchinswell, the former chairman of the Committee on Climate Change: “The government should certainly strive to achieve decarbonisation at the lowest possible cost, but its focus must be on costs over the medium and long term. The Policy Exchange report, by contrast, is in danger of taking too short term an approach.  “Investment cycles in energy are typically many decades in length, making forward-looking policy crucial. Building a robust clean energy system now will insulate people against volatile natural gas prices now and in the future. “The cost of clean energy has already been increased by policy tinkering – so it is somewhat ironic that a report purporting to advocate lower prices should be proposing yet more tinkering.” A DECC spokesman said: “Reducing energy bills for hard-working British families and businesses is this government’s priority. We’ve already announced reforms to remove subsidies for onshore wind and that work to make sure bill payers are getting the best possible deal is going to continue.”"

"A few years ago, a paper published in the Journal of Ecology reported that an orchid that grows wild in the UK and parts of Europe was blooming earlier than it was 150 years prior. In that paper, the authors examined field records of flowering times for the early spider-orchid, Ophrys sphegodes, for two time periods and compared the shift in peak flowering times to historical springtime temperature variations (doi:10.1111/j.1365-2745.2010.01727.x). The first time period extracted relevant data from herbarium specimens collected between 1848 and 1958; and the second time period recorded observed peak flowering times for this orchid species in the field between 1975 and 2006.  The authors found that, for both time periods, the early spider orchid’s peak flowering time shifted identically and precisely in response to changes in the average spring temperature: they found that flowering times occurred six days earlier for every degree Celsius increase in average springtime temperatures.  Now, scientists at the Natural History Museum want to repeat this study for 29 more wild British orchid species to see if all of them are responding similarly to rising temperatures. They recently launched an “Orchid Observers” citizen science project and they need your help. This citizen science project consists of two aspects, either one of which you are invited to help with.  The first aspect of this project involves extracting relevant data from roughly 15,000 orchid specimens housed in the Museum’s British and Irish herbarium. Collected over three centuries, they can tell us about flowering times in the past. Extracting data from so many specimens is a huge task, so they need your help. The second aspect of this project will take you outdoors. As you walk around the meadows, hills and other green spaces throughout the UK, The NHM is asking you to photograph wild orchids and upload those images online along with the date and location. If you enjoy the added challenge, you can either use this free field guide (PDF) or a special online tool to help you identify the orchids in your photographs. The data generated by this project will help scientists construct a picture of how flowering plants and animals are being affected by climate change. This project will address one of the main concerns regarding climate change: how is it affecting the ecological relationships between pollinating insects and flowering plants? In short, if climate change causes plants to flower earlier than when pollinating insects emerge, then those flowers will not be pollinated, and that means fewer and fewer wild flowers for you to enjoy. But more important; this stretched relationship also indicates that our food security is imperilled, at a time when the human population is exploding -- along with our food demands. Ultimately, this will negatively impact our food security. The Natural History Museum is on twitter @NHM_London and Chinacake Productions is there, too: @ChinacakeP  .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. ..

"When the renowned Brazilian photographer Sebastião Salgado took over family land in the state of Minas Gerais, instead of the tropical paradise that he remembered as a child, he found the trees cut down and the wildlife gone. He was devastated.  It was 1994 and he had just returned from a traumatic assignment reporting on the genocide in Rwanda, he told a meeting of religious leaders discussing climate change in Paris last week.  “The land was as sick as I was – everything was destroyed,” said Salgado. “Only about 0.5% of the land was covered in trees. Then my wife had a fabulous idea to replant this forest. And when we began to do that, then all the insects and birds and fish returned and, thanks to this increase of the trees I, too, was reborn – this was the most important moment.”  Salgado and his family set up the Instituto Terra and have now planted more than 2 million trees, transforming the environment. In doing so, he says, he has found one answer to climate change – as well as creative inspiration. “Perhaps we have a solution. There is a single being which can transform CO2 to oxygen, which is the tree. We need to replant the forest. You need forest with native trees, and you need to gather the seeds in the same region you plant them or the serpents and the termites won’t come. And if you plant forests that don’t belong, the animals don’t come there and the forest is silent.  “We need to listen to the words of the people on the land. Nature is the earth and it is other beings and if we don’t have some kind of spiritual return to our planet, I fear that we will be compromised.” In Africa, the link between spiritual development and economic survival is being made by churches in Tanzania and Uganda where two bishops are leading large-scale communal efforts to restore once-forested land. Bishop Fredrick Shoo, dubbed “the tree bishop”, lives in the foothills of Mount Kilimanjaro in Tanzania. The 500,000 mainly small farmers in his Lutheran church diocese have been devastated by steadily declining rainfall, soil degradation and drier rivers – thought to be connected to the shrinking snowfields and glaciers on Africa’s highest mountain and the severely degraded forests that have been felled to grow crops, or to make charcoal.  “I was born there and grew up there. We are now mobilising the community, especially the youth and the church members, to plant as many trees as possible. So far we have managed to revive thousands of acres,” Shoo told the meeting.  “For me, the world is like a huge African hut. But [with] climate change it seems we have invented a game of fire that we call the market. The rule is you must keep growing, keep consuming as much as possible. But it means our hut will burn down. None of us will then be safe. “I care for the environment where I live because I know I have a moral responsibility to take care of our common home, the hut, because I want my children and grandchildren to enjoy the great Mount Kilimanjaro just as I did as a child. The solution to climate change is to live in such a way as to care for other people.” Across the border to the north, Nathan Kyamanywa, an Anglican bishop of Bunyoro Kitara, works in the Hoima, Kibale and Buliisa districts in western Uganda.  “When I grew up in rural Uganda, the winds all had names and there were many creatures like bats and insects and birds. Most of these have long disappeared and as they disappeared the seasons started changing, food security was threatened and community conflict came on. It was not a coincidence. The pastoralists started to fight the agriculturalists, yet these people had lived together for ages without problem,” Kyamanywa told the summit. “We are witnessing a distinct warming of the climate system. The reality of climate change is that it hits the poor and vulnerable the hardest. It leaves them with two choices: survival or development. People have no choice but to cut a tree to put food on the table. A man will say, ‘Let me die tomorrow rather than today.’ That’s why people have grabbed the trees and encroached on wetlands and the rivers.” Kyamanywa started to plant trees to revive the land 10 years ago.  “We organised women and youth and started farming without chemicals. We built eco schools to teach children and planted trees on 25 acres of church land as an example. “Then we persuaded others to join us. One man called Andrew has now planted 600 acres, another 200. People’s eyes have been opened. The initial interest was commercial, but now people can see the impact of planting trees. As the trees come back, the rains improve and when the storms come, they no longer sweep away the villages. The animals and wildlife is returning. People feel better. It’s all spiralling.  What I have learned is that we humans are not indispensable. If we disappear then nature will continue, but if nature disappears then none of us survive.” As well as the meeting in Paris this week, Pope Francis hosted a gathering of mayors from around the world to discuss environmental challenges, migration and modern slavery. This is a critical year for efforts to curb global rising temperatures, with hopes that a new climate deal will be reached at a UN summit in Paris in December.  Last month, Pope Francis released an encyclical – or church teaching – on the environment that called for the phasing out of fossil fuels and for action to combat climate change and immoral consumption, which he said was putting humanity at risk."
"The warming of the oceans due to climate change is now unstoppable after record temperatures last year, bringing additional sea-level rise, and raising the risks of severe storms, US government climate scientists said on Thursday. The annual State of the Climate in 2014 report, based on research from 413 scientists from 58 countries, found record warming on the surface and upper levels of the oceans, especially in the North Pacific, in line with earlier findings of 2014 as the hottest year on record.  Global sea-level also reached a record high, with the expansion of those warming waters, keeping pace with the 3.2 ± 0.4 mm per year trend in sea level growth over the past two decades, the report said. Scientists said the consequences of those warmer ocean temperatures would be felt for centuries to come – even if there were immediate efforts to cut the carbon emissions fuelling changes in the oceans. “I think of it more like a fly wheel or a freight train. It takes a big push to get it going but it is moving now and will contiue to move long after we continue to pushing it,” Greg Johnson, an oceanographer at Noaa’s Pacific Marine Environmental Laboratory, told a conference call with reporters. “Even if we were to freeze greenhouse gases at current levels, the sea would actually continue to warm for centuries and millennia, and as they continue to warm and expand the sea levels will continue to rise,” Johnson said. On the west coast of the US, freakishly warm temperatures in the Pacific – 4 or 5F above normal – were already producing warmer winters, as well as worsening drought conditions by melting the snowpack, he said. The extra heat in the oceans was also contributing to more intense storms, Tom Karl, director of Noaa’s National Centers for Environmental Information, said. The report underlined 2014 as a banner year for the climate, setting record or near record levels for temperature extremes, and loss of glaciers and sea ice, and reinforcing decades-old pattern to changes to the climate system. Four independent data sets confirmed 2014 as the hottest year on record, with much of that heat driven by the warming of the oceans.  Globally 90% of the excess heat caused by the rise in greenhouse gas emissions is absorbed by the oceans. More than 20 countries in Europe set new heat records, with Africa, Asia and Australia also experiencing near-record heat. The east coast of North America was the only region to experience cooler than average conditions. Alaska experienced temperatures 18F warmer than average. Spring break-up came to the Arctic 20-30 days earlier than the 20th century average. “The prognosis is to expect a continuation of what we have seen,” Karl said."
"The Church of England’s governing body has thrown its weight behind efforts to slow climate change by backing the move earlier this year to divest its resources from companies involved in extracting two of the most polluting fossil fuels.  In May, the Church Commissioners, who manage investments worth £6bn, took the decision to divest from tar sands oil and thermal coal – the first time they had ever imposed investment restrictions on environmental grounds. But a series of votes at the General Synod meeting in York on Monday were about more than just rubber stamping that decision. The debate took in potential future divestments, Arctic drilling, energy efficiency of church buildings and even the CO2 emissions connected with the internet.  The Archbishop of Canterbury urged caution on the exploitation of Arctic oil reserves and pushed for disinvestment or engagement with companies in certain areas such as Arctic drilling. However the Synod turned down a motion which would have committed the church to threaten disinvestment from all oil companies if they had not committed to ceasing oil exploration within three years. “We are to be exemplary in what we do ourselves,” Welby told the Synod, adding: “It comes down to the use of our buildings, how we use and invest our finances, and how we heat and light things; the amount we travel.”  He said however that the issue “was too big for most people to get their minds around, including us here. It is an issue for the whole people of God, not just the clergy.” In this spirit, the Bishop of Salisbury, the Rt Rev Nicholas Holtam, had proposed that church member should try to fast on the first day of every month, but this was defeated after Archdeacon Jan MacFarlane pointed out that a “mischievous journalist” might ring round a selection of bishops and synod members after a few months and ask if they were actually observing the fast. Margaret Swinson, a lay member from Liverpool, urged Christians to do their bit by being careful with the use of cloud storage on the internet. The computer centres used for storage by companies like Google , Facebook, and Amazon use huge amounts of electricity, she said, much of it generated by burning coal. “Think twice before uploading onto your cloud storage another 100 photos, 25 of which are not in focus,” she urged. But the hall rang with apocalyptic predictions. The Dean of Kings College, London, Richard Burridge, quoted from the book of Leviticus: “The land will vomit you out because you have defiled it.” Although the Biblical text refers to sexual rather than ecological transgressions, he went on to quote God’s threatened punishments for defiling the land.  “I will bring on you sudden terror, wasting diseases and fever that will destroy your sight and sap your strength. You will plant seed in vain, because your enemies will eat it ... Your strength will be spent in vain, because your soil will not yield its crops, nor will the trees of your land yield their fruit.” These things, he said, he had already seen in this travels in Malawi, where the evil effects of global warming are to be seen already. The bishop of Manchester, the Rt Rev David Walker, praised the work of the Ethical Investment Advisory Group in pushing companies towards more ecologically responsible policies. They had filed shareholder resolutions on climate change at the AGMs of both BP and Shell, which he described as “an unprecedented action by institutional investors. The resolutions set a new, demanding, and ligally binding standard in reporting on climate change strategy for oil and gas majors.” He pointed out that: “Many activists deeply concerned about climate change – including the Guardian newspaper – believe that the ethical investment answer to climate change is … to divest from all companies involved in the extraction of fossil fuels.” However, he argued, along with all the othe senior figures in the debate, that engagement and guiding the investments of energy companies was much more likely to produce the desperately necessary results. The Guardian’s Keep it in the Ground campaign has been highlighting the case for fossil fuel divestment. It has called on the world’s two largest health charities – the Wellcome Trust and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation - to divest their assets from fossil fuels.  • This article was amended on 15 July 2015.

"Climate change is what the world’s population perceives as the top global threat, according to research conducted by the Pew Research Center, with countries in Latin America and Africa particularly concerned about the issue. It is followed by global economic instability and the Islamic State militant group.  The survey, conducted in 40 countries and taking in the views of more than 45,000 respondents, attempts to measure perceptions of global threats. In 19 of the 40 countries polled, climate change was found to be the issue of highest concern. A median average of 61% of Latin Americans said they were very concerned about climate change, the highest share of any region. In Brazil and Peru, 75% of respondents said they were very concerned about the issue. Burkina Faso had the highest share of any country, with 79% expressing the highest level of concern. Isis was viewed as the biggest threat for people in Lebanon with 84% saying they were very concerned – understandable given the region’s close proximity to the group’s activities. However, Isis was also viewed as the top threat a lot further away in the US (68%), Australia (69%) and the UK (66%). Global economic instability is another major worry. It was found to be the top concern in a number of countries, including Venezuela – which has been undergoing a severe financial crisis – as well as Senegal and Tanzania. It was also found to be the second biggest concern in half of all those surveyed. Pew found that major worries about Iran’s nuclear programme were limited to a few nations, with the US, Spain and Israel (the only country to cite Iran as the highest threat) the most concerned.  Tensions between Russia and its neighbours, and territorial disputes between China and surrounding countries, “remain regional concerns”, said Pew – 62% of respondents in Ukraine and 44% in Poland said they were very concerned about tensions with Moscow. However, 44% of US respondents were also very concerned about this issue, closely followed by France (41%), the UK (41%) and Germany (40%). Cyber-attacks are also viewed as a considerable threat in the US, with 59% of Americans saying they were very concerned. The survey was conducted after the hack and leak of Sony Pictures emails, which the US government blamed on North Korea. In South Korea, cyber-attacks were the second highest concern (55%) after Isis (75%).  The report focuses on those who say they are “very concerned” about each issue and surveyed respondents from March 25 to May 27, 2015."

"London’s economy is increasingly vulnerable to climate change because of the city’s status as a global financial centre and the international connections of its businesses, a report by the London assembly has found. It urges more action to prepare the city for climate risks from mayor Boris Johnson. Just over half of the 100 largest businesses listed on the London Stock Exchange have no adaptation strategy in place to prepare for the risks posed by climate change, which include floods, droughts and heatwaves. The effect of such extreme weather conditions is likely to fall most heavily on small and medium-sized businesses, outside the FTSE 100, which are least equipped to bear the brunt. Nearly two-thirds of such businesses have no plan in place to deal with climate change. London’s status as a financial centre means it is vulnerable in other ways to climate-related shocks around the world too. The capital’s financial sector is exposed to risks internationally, the report found, including through its investment in fossil fuels. If controls on carbon dioxide emissions are brought in by governments around the world then reserves held by coal, oil and gas companies risk being rendered worthless. The Bank of England is currently preparing a report on these overvalued assets - the so-called carbon bubble.  Other businesses, which are seemingly far from the effects of climate change, must also take account of it, according to the report’s authors. They cited the floods that afflicted Thailand in 2011, which affected the makers of many computer components, and the damage done resulted in higher prices throughout the IT hardware supply chain, which affected London companies. Food prices are also likely to be affected by climate change, the report found, with knock-on effects throughout the UK. The report from the London assembly, called “Weathering the Storm: The Impact of Climate Change on London’s Economy”, called for more emphasis on climate change policies from the mayor Boris Johnson. His economic development strategy for the capital does not currently feature climate change with any prominence, the report’s authors argued. The group also found that the London Pension Fund Authority, which controls pensions for the assembly, should look at the potential for diversifying its investments, including possibly taking money out of coal. Campaigners have called for the the £4.8bn pension fund to be divested entirely from fossil fuels. The report found that London’s “adaptation sector” was worth about £431m in turnover in 2011 to 2012, employing about 4,000 people, in industries such as construction. Jenny Jones, Green party assembly member and co-author of the report, said: “Too little is being done to understand and prepare for the potential costs of climate change. London faces a great unknown when it comes to how our supply chains and economy will be hit by extreme weather events.” She added: “Detailed work is essential to secure London’s future economic prosperity. We need to diversify London’s economy and further invest in our green economy. That way, our city will be stronger and more resilient whatever the level of future global warming.” Jenny Bates, campaigner at Friends of the Earth, said: “Climate change is not only a massive threat to Londoners through increased droughts, heat waves and flooding - it could devastate our economy too. Tackling climate change should be a top priority for the mayor. London must prepare for the consequences of global warming and do far more to play its part in cutting emissions through, for example, the development of clean energy and transport infrastructure.” She also called for measures to cut greenhouse gas emissions, such as stopping the expansion of airports and road-building, which she said would also help to cut air pollution, and called for financial institutions in the City of London to support low-carbon projects around the world."
"The former US vice-president and climate champion Al Gore has made a rare criticism of Barack Obama as Royal Dutch Shell prepares to drill an exploratory well in the Arctic Ocean, denouncing the venture as “insane” and calling for a ban on all oil and gas activity in the polar region. With Shell planning to begin drilling in the oil-rich Chukchi Sea within days, Gore said in an interview with the Guardian that Obama was wrong to ever allow drilling in the Arctic. It was the only real point of criticism from Gore of Obama’s efforts to fight climate change, at home and through a global deal to be negotiated in Paris at the end of the year. “I think Arctic drilling is insane. I think that countries around the world would be very well advised to put restrictions on drilling for oil in the Arctic ocean,” Gore told the Guardian in Toronto, where he was passing on his techniques for talking about the climate crisis to 500 new recruits from his Climate Reality Project. As conventional fields decline, the Arctic is the last frontier of the oil era, containing more than 20% of the world’s undiscovered, recoverable oil and gas. But after the BP oil disaster five years ago, the risks of offshore oil drilling are all too clear – and Arctic drilling should not go ahead, Gore said. “I think the Deepwater Horizon spill was warning enough. The conditions are so hostile for human activity there. I think it’s a mistake to drill for oil in the Arctic. I think that ought to be banned,” Gore said. It’s now nearly 10 years since Gore turned his old slideshow on climate change into the Oscar-winning Inconvenient Truth, nearly 15 years since he won the popular vote in the 2000 election only to lose the White House to George Bush. What was once a somewhat lonely cause – at least among leaders of Gore’s stature – has been taken up by the current US president and, more recently, the pope. Obama elevated climate change to the top of his second term agenda, and has announced a new event or initiative every week since January. Gore, who has tried very hard to stay out of Obama’s way, now gives him top marks – although he still says the White House has bent over too far to accommodate the oil and gas industry. “I think he is doing essentially a very good job but on the fossil fuel side I would certainly be happier if he was not allowing so much activity like the Arctic drilling permit and the large amounts of coal extracted from public lands,” Gore said. With the critical negotiating round at Paris only five months away, it is the president and the pope who are the most visible campaigners for climate action, not Gore. The “recovering politician”, as Gore once called himself, is so divorced from politics he neglected to offer up the expected plug for a Democrat to win the White House in 2016, when asked about frontrunner Hillary Clinton’s chances. “I think it’s too early to endorse a candidate or predict an outcome,” he said. Instead, Gore remains focused on his two proposed fixes for climate change: raising up campaigners in eight key countries, and improving the business environment for wind and solar and other clean energy sources. Unlike the pope – who used a pastoral letter on climate change to deliver a scathing indictment of the prevailing economic order – Gore believes that “reformed capitalism” will eventually solve the climate campaign. “I think that some form of market capitalism is at the base of every successful economy in the world today,” he said. “I think that reforms including putting a price on pollution to discourage more pollution is definitely a part of the solution.” On one July day, the former vice-president spent the morning in downtown Toronto lauding the efforts of Canadian provincial leaders on climate change – in sharp contrast to the prime minister, Stephen Harper, who has pushed hard to expand oil and gas production. The next day he planned to perform his slide show to the Climate Reality recruits again – only this time the 30-minute version, for those occasions when they only had time for a more abbreviated pitch. After a couple of false starts – Gore disbanded an earlier group, the Alliance for Climate Protection – such training sessions have now morphed into a vast, global undertaking. At the request of the UN secretary general, Ban Ki-Moon, Gore has taken his climate training on the road to eight countries seen as critical to a strong outcome at Paris: the big emitters US, India, Australia, Canada, China, and Brazil and those on the front lines such as South Africa and the Philippines. The 50-person gatherings in Carthage, Tennessee, have given way to audiences of several hundred at a time – 1,200 were at the Chicago session. In the last two years alone, Gore has trained more than 5,000 new Climate Reality recruits in 115 countries, according to the group’s own figures. Only a minority identified as dedicated environmental campaigners, the group said. Really they are scouting for anyone with strong ties to a community – a church, a school – who can tell a convincing story. Over three days, the trainees are inducted into the world of climate activism as described in Gore’s narrative arc: starting with the picture of earth as viewed from space, the latest science on drought and sea-level rise and other consequences of climate change, and then the multi-coloured grids of solar and wind installations. This is where Gore’s excitement really lies. When he talks about, say, solar installations in Costa Rica, his speech gets increasingly folksy – like the clean energy Garrison Keillor – and there are whoops from the hundreds of activists in the ballroom. The sessions are free, although activists have to make their own way to the venue. So far, only one known climate denier has managed to infiltrate one of the trainings. The idea is for trained-up climate activists – directly schooled in the latest science by Gore and other trainers – to use their personal experience and contacts to spread the word. Some may go on to use their connections to lobby in high places. Others may drop off the map, lured to the training by a chance to be in the room with Gore rather than actually do the work. Ken Berlin, Climate Reality’s chief executive, said graduates put on a total of 2,500 speaking events last year. The group claims a Facebook following of 361,000, with about 35% in the US, followed by India, Pakistan and the Philippines. As Paris approaches, and with the pope on his side, Gore said he is the most optimistic he has ever been about finding a solution to the climate crisis. The time is ripe, he said. Like same-sex marriage, like civil rights, he believes public opinion is about to make the massive shift in favour of action. “Climate is now on that matrix,” he said. “The change is inevitable because any great cause that becomes resolved into a binary choice between what’s right’s what and what’s wrong the outcome becomes inevitable.” The question of course is time – how long will it take to mobilise to solve climate change. Gore sees Paris as a first step, but said he is under no illusions about the kind of deal like to emerge. “We are going to see a Paris agreement. I think that’s assured at this point. I think it has been a near certainty since the US-China agreement” to cut emissions, which happened during Obama’s visit to Beijing last November, he said. It’s an open secret of the climate negotiations that there is nothing compelling leaders to take strong climate action. Countries are free to set their own targets for reducing greenhouse gas emissions which ensures that while there will certainly be a deal at Paris, it will not achieve the internationally agreed goal of limiting warming to 2 degrees celsius – even Ban has conceded that. For Gore, however, that’s not the point of Paris. The agreement is just meant as a kind of cattle prod to get countries moving on the systemic transformation of their economies, away for coal, oil and gas and to energy sources that do not rely on fossil fuels. “Even if it falls a little bit short of the 2-degree threshold it will definitely lend a tremendous amount of momentum to an historic transition that is now well underway, away from carbon based energy and towards renewables efficiency, battery storage and sustainable agriculture and forestry,” Gore said. “My optimism is focused on primarily on the larger goal of making this transition and finding a solution for the climate crisis. Where the Paris agreement itself is concerned I think that it is likely to be a success. Whether it actually reaches the number of reductions that are necessary to hold temperature increases below 2 degree celsius, I don’t know.” He went on: “The Paris agreement will be an important milestone but I think we are now seeing development in the marketplace.”"
