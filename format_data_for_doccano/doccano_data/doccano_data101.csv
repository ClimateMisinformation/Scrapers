"I was arrested yesterday for blockading Cuadrilla’s fracking site at Preston New Road in Lancashire for more than 12 hours. It was the first day of fracking after a seven-year delay due to earthquakes, powerful local opposition and legal challenges. As a trained paramedic, I have a good appreciation of emergency situations. Climate change is the biggest emergency of them all. I join more than 350 people who have been arrested for disrupting Cuadrilla’s site in Lancashire over the last two years. People driven to take such action range from local councillors to faith leaders, students to grandparents. In the past fortnight, three people were sentenced to up to 16 months in prison for climbing on top of lorries that carried key fracking equipment. I put my body on the line and risked arrest at the entrance of Cuadrilla’s site because the Conservative government has shown nothing but disdain for local democracy, climate science and communities at the sharp end of climate breakdown. More than 200,000 people have signed a petition against fracking. In June 2015, Lancashire county council unanimously rejected Cuadrilla’s application, only to be overruled by Sajid Javid (then the communities secretary) a few months later. The government is currently seeking to fast-track fracking by rewriting local planning rules to make it as easy to build a fracking rig as it is to put up a garden shed. These are desperate attempts to impose a polluting industry on a public who do not want it. When the government and corporations show such disregard for people and the planet, taking direct action like yesterday’s blockade is a moral obligation. Claire Perry, the minister for clean growth and energy, has announced that this week is Green Great Britain Week. This is the same Claire Perry who granted Cuadrilla the final consent to frack and has been a key driver behind government attempts to open up this new fossil fuel industry. It is unconscionable that Perry is persevering with her zealous support of fracking at a time when climate scientists are imploring political leaders to take urgent and unprecedented action to cut greenhouse gas emissions before 2030. Gas-generated electricity has a carbon footprint 50 times greater than onshore wind, and fracked (shale) gas is even worse. Gas is no “bridge fuel” to a low-carbon economy, as Cuadrilla claims. Locking our economy into extracting and burning more gas will only add to emissions and drive us more rapidly towards dangerous climate impacts. It’s wrong to argue that fracking mitigates the risk of the lights going out. Production of gas-powered electricity fell by 5% in the year to 2017, while wind and solar grew by 20%. This year has seen record heat and a series of extreme weather events. While the impacts of floods, hurricanes, heatwaves, droughts and wildfires are beginning to be experienced more frequently in the UK, these events have long been devastating other communities around the globe. We do not have time to hope in vain for politicians or corporations to catch up with the timeline of climate breakdown. In just 12 years our society must radically decarbonise, whether those profiting from the crisis like it or not. Fossil fuel companies such as Shell and ExxonMobil were able to forecast what their extraction would do to our climate as early as the 1980s. Cuadrilla has no excuse now. While governments, the police and the courts defend such corporations in their reckless pursuit of profit, we have no choice but to turn to direct action to stop new fossil fuel infrastructure. This is by no means the end. We still have our friends, our creativity and the determination to blockade a fracking industry that threatens our shared survival. History teaches us that non-violent civil disobedience has a powerful precedent in radically shifting the narrative and bringing about justice. So we will continue, until we win. • Esme North trained as a paramedic and is working in agroecology"
"The Bank of England has stopped short of forcing financial companies to disclose the potential risks they face from climate change, despite growing calls from campaigners for such action. In a warning to finance firms to vastly improve their planning to safeguard against the financial risks posed by global warming, Threadneedle Street asked companies to “consider the relevance” of disclosing their climate-related risks. The central bank’s prudential regulation authority (PRA), which is tasked with ensuring UK financial sector stability, launched the guidelines for consultation on Monday, in a package of measures designed to coax banks to prepare for the low-carbon economy of the future. The Bank has previously said that only 10% of banks take a long-term view of the risks posed by climate change, while Mark Carney, its governor, has said that failure to adapt would have a “catastrophic impact” on the financial system. The guidelines also come after the UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change warned that failure to limit global warming to within a maximum of 1.5C over the next dozen years would significantly worsen the risks of drought, floods, extreme heat and poverty for hundreds of millions of people. Although opting against mandatory disclosures, the Bank said firms ought to identify a senior manager with responsibility for managing the financial risks posed by climate change, with clear “board-level engagement”. Banks and insurers must also use their existing risk management tools to assess the threat of global warming and should run scenario planning exercises to determine the impact of the climate change financial risks on their overall business strategy. “The PRA will embed these expectations into its existing supervisory framework and expects firms’ responses to be proportionate to the nature, scale and complexity of their respective businesses,” it said. Rob Macquarie, an economist specialising in green central banking at the campaign group Positive Money, said the guidelines were a step in the right direction, although he warned they “don’t really measure up to the scale of the challenge”. “The regulator should be going further in laying the ground for mandatory disclosure of climate-related risk,” he said. Other organisations have called for greater action. The Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures, an industry body led by Michael Bloomberg, the former mayor of New York, has called for firms to publish such risks in their annual public accounts. The House of Commons environmental audit committee told the government earlier this year that reporting climate risks should be made mandatory by 2022, saying that a voluntary approach was unlikely to work over the medium term. Frank van Lerven, of the New Economics Foundation, said: “We need to do much more than simply tinker around the edges with incremental adjustments to finance. “We will need radical disruptive reforms that help reshape finance, so that it can actively help deliver a rapid, sustainable and fair green transition.”"
"From low-emission cows to robotic soil management, the farming industry will have to explore new approaches in the wake of a UN warning that the world needs to cut meat consumption or face worsening climate chaos. That was the message from Guy Smith, vice-president of the National Farmers’ Union (NFU), this week as policymakers began to discuss how Britain can address the challenges posed by the recent global warming report by the UN’s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC).  Farming and land use are set to move to a more central position in the climate debate in the wake of that report, which urged countries to widen their emissions-cutting efforts beyond the energy industry to agriculture and transport. Smith said NFU members were “up for radical thought” because this year’s harvests have been badly hit by the unusually harsh “beast from the east” cold spell in winter and the worst summer drought since 1976. Many British farmers, particularly on the east coast, are working on fields that are already below sea level and dependent on flood defences that are threatened by rising seas. “If consumers want to reduce red meat consumption, farmers will respond accordingly,” Smith told a meeting of politicians and climate experts in parliament on Wednesday, noting that farmers could diversify into other stock and use technology to reduce the carbon footprint of the agricultural sector. Among the possible tech fixes he mentioned were greater uses of satellites and robotics to increase the amount of carbon-absorbing organic matter in the soil and breeding new livestock that emit less methane. Cow farts are a major source of greenhouse gas, but researchers – who collect the gases in bags fitted to cows – have found there is considerable natural variation from animal to animal. If the low-emission cows could be bred with each other, this could bring down these emissions, they say. Researchers in other countries are also looking at changing feed to make cattle less gaseous. British agriculture, which already faces dramatic change as a result of Brexit, is likely to come under greater scrutiny next year when both the IPCC and the UK’s Climate Change Commission (CCC) produce reports on the role of land use in reduce emissions. This touches on several politically fraught issues, including whether to use land for carbon-sink forests, food-producing farms, housing or industry. Smith said he was opposed to any reduction in the productive land of British agriculture. He warned that cuts here could mean an expansion in Argentina or Brazil, where crops and beef are produced in far more environmentally destructive conditions and shipping leads to a much higher carbon footprint. Better, he said, to reduce waste in farms, processing, supermarkets and home. He was supported in this by Ann Jones, a Cumbrian farmer and vice-chair of the National Federation of Women’s Institutes who also opposed changes in tax policy that might accelerate the drive away from meat. “I’d be concerned if we tax red meat,” she said. “It’s food waste that we should be tackling.” Climate scientists said action on meat was important. “The clear message from the IPCC is that diet matters,” said Prof Jim Skea, who chaired one of the working groups on the new UN report. “If we eat healthy meat, we’ll live longer and by the way reduce our carbon footprint.” In light of the IPCC report, Baroness Brown, a member of the CCC, said her group is likely to advise the government to step up its efforts to meet current climate targets, which are currently off course, and to add “an element of more ambition” when it is formally asked for policy recommendations. But she said the committee was unlikely to address fracking, which produces more fossil fuels, or airport expansion, which adds to the carbon footprint of transport. These limitations were criticised by the Green party MP Caroline Lucas. “It’s not good enough for the government to attempt to simply add a green tinge to business as usual,” she said. “This week’s IPCC report couldn’t have been clearer: we need an urgent and complete overhaul of our economic system to avoid disaster – and to create a fairer, healthier, safer society.”"

"Trouble is brewing for the world’s beer drinkers, with climate change set to cause “dramatic” price spikes and supply shortages, according to new research. Extreme heatwaves and droughts will increasingly damage the global barley crop, meaning a common ingredient of the world’s favourite alcoholic beverage will become scarcer. Key brewing nations are forecast to be among the worst hit, including Belgium, the Czech Republic and Ireland. The researchers said that compared with life-threatening impacts of global warming such as the floods and storms faced by millions, a beer shortage may seem relatively unimportant. But they said it would affect the quality of life of many people. “There is little doubt that for millions of people around the world, the climate impacts on beer availability and price will add insult to injury,” said Prof Dabo Guan at the University of East Anglia, one of the research team. “There is something fundamental in the cross-cultural appreciation of beer. “If you still want to still have a couple of pints of beer while you watch the football, then climate change [action] is the only way out. This is the key message.” The research, published in the journal Nature Plants, used climate models to examine the impact of extreme weather on barley yields over the next 80 years. The team then used economic models to estimate the impact on beer supply and price in different nations. If carbon emissions are not curbed, the analysis found that beer consumption will fall by about a third in Ireland, Belgium and the Czech Republic. In the UK, a quarter fewer pints would be sunk, with 14% fewer bottles being opened in the US. In China, now the world’s biggest beer consumer, consumption is forecast to fall by 9%. In Australia, just 7% fewer cold ones would be downed, partly because it is one of few places where climate change may make barley growing easier in some regions. Globally, the cut would be 16%. Even in the best-case climate scenario, with rapid and deep cuts in greenhouse gases, beers drunk in Ireland, Belgium and the Czech Republic would fall between 9% and 13%, with similar drops in Canada and Germany. Looking at the impact on price, the research found that Poland’s beer drinkers would be hardest hit in the worst-case scenario, with the cost rising almost fivefold. In Ireland, Belgium and the Czech Republic, prices would double. These nations would be most affected because they brew and drink a lot of beer and import most of their brewing barley. Only about a sixth of the world barley harvest is used for beer – most is fed to livestock. But the researchers found that the economics of the market mean hungry animals are prioritised when the grain is in short supply. This means disproportionately large decreases in barley for brewing, “ultimately resulting in dramatic regional decreases in beer consumption and increases in beer prices”. “Future climate and pricing conditions could put beer out of reach for hundreds of millions of people around the world,” said Prof Steven Davis, at the University of California, Irvine, and one of the research team. Guan said uncertainties and assumptions made in the study mean the price rises and supply shortages calculated are not intended to be precise predictions but to illustrate the impact of climate change. He said it is clear from the research that global warming will make beer more expensive and less available. Guan suggested beer price spikes and shortages might even affect social stability, noting that the prohibition era in the US saw organised crime supplying illicit liquor. Using other grains such as wheat to brew is unlikely to be an option, as all crops will suffer from extreme weather, said Guan. Nor will what he calls other “luxury essentials” be an alternative source of pleasure: “All these are going to be more expensive – chocolate, coffee and tea – all those crops are going to be suffering.” Prof Richard Ellis at the University of Reading, who was not involved in the research, said: “For beer drinkers, this [research] converts an abstract concept of the future efficiency of cereal production by farmers into the more real future price of beer.” But he said the study might underestimate the consequences of future climate change on barley yields, given significant recent drops in UK yields after only modest temperature rises. He also said the taste of beer could be affected by possible climate change impacts on hop production. One scientist who reviewed the new research before publication told Guan: “I hope Donald Trump loves beer. If he does he may return the US to the Paris agreement.” This, however, may be a forlorn hope: Trump claims to be teetotal."
"We all love trees. We think of woods and forests as green lungs, peaceful spaces, brimming with wildlife. So when Europe’s least forested country, Ireland, sets a target to increase tree cover from 11% to 18% by 2046, we should all applaud, shouldn’t we? Unfortunately the new woodland rising across Ireland is an ecological dead zone. Sitka spruce plantations, hectare upon hectare of them, now cover what was once nature-rich farmland. Dense blocks of these non-native coniferous trees smother the landscape, driving out wonderful and endangered wildlife such as hen harriers and curlews, birds that could be extinct in Ireland within the decade.  The home of these birds is in farmland officially designated “marginal”, exactly what is considered most suitable for swaths of sterile, densely packed conifers. Ireland’s green image, a place for nature, is a mockery. For politicians and financiers, marginal means land that is borderline for modern agriculture. It is “rank”, “boggy”, ‘“acid” or “poor”, all words that have unpleasant undertones. Marginal land doesn’t make money compared to the large, industrial farming units, which are usually in more lowland and fertile areas. It can’t, by its very nature, support high densities of livestock or crops. It does, however, produce flowers, insects and ground-nesting birds in abundance, but none of these are money spinners in a traditional sense. The solutions supported by the government are devastating. The first is to transform the fields into intensively managed farmland that can support cattle and produce a crop of silage at least three times a year. This is done by draining, fertilising and planting fast-growing monocultures such as rye grass. Already much of Ireland has a bright, emerald green sheen that does little for wildlife. If that isn’t possible, then the government offers generous grants to plant fast-growing trees such as Sitka spruce. Sitka plantations guarantee a return within a few decades and they also attract absent investors, often from overseas. Many farmers sell their family farms to these private companies and move out of the area. As the trees move in, silence falls across the land. No birds sing, no bees buzz, no flowers bloom. Those who have hen harriers or curlews nesting on their land can apply for grants to manage the landscape for the birds, but usually only for a few years, making this the least financially attractive choice. For politicians in Dublin, making money from the land is a priority and they are happy to legislate to secure this. The dairy industry’s growth is one of the highest in the EU, 9.4% between January and November 2017 alone. Similarly, the forest sector has boomed mainly to offset carbon emissions from cows. Ireland is failing abysmally to meet its targets set by the EU. It ought to have cut emissions of greenhouse gases to 20% below 2005 levels by 2020, but at current rates, it will have reduced them by less than 1%. The dual pressures to grow the economy through dairy and reduce carbon emissions to meet climate change targets means Sitka spruce is marching across the land. But do plantations of conifers really act as a cure-all for Ireland’s carbon woes? Not necessarily. A lot of carbon is stored in the soils of peatland and marginal grassland. If they are disturbed, however, by ploughing, draining, tree planting and felling, they can release more carbon into the atmosphere than will be sequestered by the trees. So simply planting trees does not equate to a net lowering of carbon in the atmosphere. In addition, agriculture remains the single largest contributor to gas emissions in Ireland, and the figure will rise under the current policy. As forestry accounts for less than 4 million tonnes of carbon sequestration it cannot make up the difference. It would surely be far better to reduce the emissions from the dairy industry than plant Sitka spruce on unsuitable soils. Yet the planting goes on unabated, with dire consequences for protected wildlife. More than half of the six sites designated as special protection areas (SPAs) for hen harriers are now planted in Sitka. Money has trumped wildlife. There are only around 150 pairs of breeding hen harriers left and they require a mosaic of habitats to survive, ranging from grassland, moorland and bog to open forest. But now their home is hemmed in on all sides by Sitka plantations, which form impenetrable boundaries. To stand in one of the few remaining nesting sites is to feel like a character in a Hollywood movie where someone is trapped in a room as the walls slowly move inwards. No light penetrates to the floor and no flowers grow.  As farms disappear beneath these barren forests, villages empty and there is no one left to speak out for the birds, which are forced out too. If their breeding grounds haven’t been covered in trees, the predators that are sheltered by the forests, namely foxes, crows and pine martens, make it nigh impossible for them to raise any young. Ireland’s rich, natural heritage, as treasured as any traditional music or literature, is being swept aside because it is not considered as valuable as fast-buck plantations. The breathtaking sky dance of the male hen harrier in spring and the heart-healing bubbling of the curlew are all but gone, as these birds can’t survive without the insects that feed on wildflowers. Curlews could be extinct as a breeding bird in Ireland in less than 10 years. Kealin Ireland, a farmer from County Leitrim (a county that already has 18% Sitka coverage), is deeply worried. “We had a wonderful year with curlews flying and calling above our flower farm right throughout spring and early summer. But we’re so concerned about future years with vast tracts of lands around us being afforested with Sitka spruce. Where will the curlews nest, and how will they get to their feeding grounds at the lake?” How, indeed? If the Irish government paid farmers on marginal land to protect the natural heritage in perpetuity, instead of planting foreign trees, then it would act as a beacon to the rest of Europe. It could use public money for the public good of planting native, broad-leaved forest in some areas yet managing other lands for endangered birds. Protecting peatland and marginal grassland would also keep carbon locked in the soil. As pressure on governments to act on climate change increases, Ireland could be leading the way in Europe and showing that wildlife is valued and integral to a country’s natural heritage. Instead, its policy on forests and its failure on a massive scale to protect biodiversity is a disgrace. • Mary Colwell is a nature writer and author of Curlew Moon"

"Scientists this week warned that the latest IPCC report on global warming could be underestimating the impact of “tipping points”, such as the loss of polar ice caps, which might lead to “runaway warming”. A tipping point is the point at which nothing is the same again. The idea became famous with Malcolm Gladwell’s 2000 eponymous book, which informed excited readers that the tipping point of fax machine usage was the year 1987. But what exactly is being tipped? If you have in mind the image of something toppling over, you are not wrong. In the 1890s, the tipping point was the point beyond which a listing ship could no longer right itself, or the point at which – in a machine proposed to weigh the water of a flowing stream – a cup being filled with water would tilt and transfer its contents to the next cup down.  The metaphorical usage, though, has an unhappier origin. Dictionaries tell us that in the 1950s the tipping point was the number of African Americans moving into a neighbourhood that caused white people to start moving out. Given the coming mass migrations from regions made uninhabitable, that painful echo might prove unexpectedly apt to global warming, too."

"Films such as A Plastic Ocean, and the huge success of Blue Planet II, have brought ocean plastic pollution firmly into the popular domain. Plastic has become ubiquitous through the world’s oceans, with fragments found in deep ocean trenches and the Arctic ice sheets. Furthermore, pictures of charismatic animals such as whales and turtles consuming or entangled in plastic provide powerful imagery of the problem to the public. There is no doubt plastic is a big issue. A study in the journal Marine Policy suggests plastic pollution might be reaching a planetary boundary, a term used to describe safe operational environmental limits within which the world can continue to function safely.  Yet, for all the attention given to ocean plastic, it is not the biggest threat to the marine environment. Both climate change and biodiversity loss (much of which is caused by the impacts of overfishing of our oceans) were shown to have exceeded their respective planetary boundaries when the term was first introduced, in 2009. More recent studies also flag climate change and biodiversity as the two core planetary boundaries. Excessively exceeding these for a prolonged period could cause rapid and major changes, such as runaway temperature rises or the collapse of important ecosystem functions. The world’s largest living structure, Australia’s Great Barrier Reef, has undergone successive and large-scale bleaching events in the past few years, with an estimated 50% of coral dead due to bleaching in the past two years. These events, along with degradation of other marine habitats such as kelp forests and seagrass beds, are directly attributable to climate change. The latest official report from the UN Food and Agriculture Organisation suggests that 33% of fisheries are overfished and 60% fully exploited, while a controversial new study contends that more than 50% of the area of the oceans is affected by fishing each year. Nor can the effects of plastic on animal populations and their ecosystems be easily determined. Large plastic items break down into smaller microplastics, and many experts think the effects of these may be less than ingestion of larger items, which can cause choking and block digestive systems. Given these facts, we should ask why overfishing and climate change do not get at least as much attention as plastic when considering the marine environment. We propose this is because plastic pollution provides a “convenient truth”, allowing individuals, corporations and politicians to appear environmentally conscious while ignoring the root of all environmental problems, which is overconsumption of resources. Large-scale technological solutions, such as the Ocean Cleanup project, provide optimism from the concerned, documentary-watching public that the plastic problem is being addressed. Eliminating plastic straws, promoting reusable coffee cups or having a plastic-free supermarket aisle are easy PR wins for large companies that will barely affect profits. These same token gestures not only attract environmentally conscious customers, but make customers feel they are contributing to an environmental solution. In truth, much bigger individual behavioural changes need to be made, such as drastically altering our diets to greatly reduce fish and meat, reducing car and aeroplane use and even reducing the number of children we decide to have. To provide some context, if airlines eliminated single-use plastic, this might save about 20 grams of plastic a person on a typical transatlantic flight. However, each passenger on that plane would be responsible for roughly one tonne of carbon dioxide emissions, around half a million times more greenhouses gasses than plastic waste. Governments have the power to enforce change, but are reluctant to do so. The world is not on target to meet the Paris climate agreement targets to keep temperature rises to 2C. One reason for this reluctance is the neoliberal agenda, which is still pervasive in most western countries. Markets will adjust to consumer demand, but this is too little, too late to address the scale and urgency of the environmental threat. In terms of fisheries, the British government has a real opportunity to change fishing practices with Brexit. However, there is an apparent unwillingness to change the status quo significantly. Some foreign boats will probably be allowed into UK waters, either to secure export rights to those countries, or to sell fishing rights. Ultimately, most governments believe in the need for economic growth, beside which environmental concerns will generally be neglected. While token gestures and technological fixes will have some effect in reducing plastic pollution in the marine environment, as a collective public we need to demand change from large corporations and from governments on all environmental policies. We also need to understand the sacrifices necessary to ensure the future of humanity. At an international level, we need policies and legislation to prevent excessive overconsumption by individuals and companies, including the promotion of open source ideas around product reuse to maximise re-use and recycling of all products. It is also vital that we find alternative metrics to wellbeing, beyond our myopic focus on economic growth, if we are to reduce consumption and achieve global targets on climate, food production and even plastic waste.

"The thought of rising sea levels and more intense heatwaves are enough to keep you up at night. But while we all know the situation is getting more serious, most of us are preoccupied with work, doctor’s appointments and paying bills – and these immediate, visceral worries win every time. There isn’t much time left to figure out how to bring global warming closer to the forefront of people’s minds and persuade us to reduce our carbon footprints. In fact, we have just 12 years left to keep global warming to 1.5C, according to last week’s landmark UN report. Anything beyond this will massively worsen the risks of drought, floods, extreme heat and poverty for hundreds of millions of people.  Reducing our meat intake is crucial to avoiding climate breakdown, since food production accounts for about a quarter of all human-related greenhouse gas emissions, and is predicted to rise. In western countries, this means eating 90% less beef and five times as many beans and pulses. Edible insects have been hailed as a solution to both global food shortages and reducing emissions from animal agriculture, but despite the industry’s best efforts, our response when faced with a cockroach is disgust. Even in London edible insects are seen as nothing more than a gimmick, and there are only a handful of restaurants serving them up. But new research from Switzerland and Germany may have found out how to persuade people to eat insects – and it could have a huge impact on lowering human-led carbon emissions. Up until now, retailers and restaurants have marketed edible insects as a more sustainable option and a healthy source of protein. But the researchers explain the problem with getting people to switch to environmentally friendly behaviour is that it often requires foregoing immediate pleasure for distant benefits, and edible insects have been wrongly framed in this way. Before the 180 participants in the study were offered a chocolate truffle filled with mealworms, half of the group were given a flyer saying that eating insects was good for them and the environment, while the other half were told the insects were either delicious or trendy to eat. About 62% of those given health or environmental incentives chose to eat the truffle, compared with 76% who ate the truffle after being told it would taste good or make them trendy. And the latter group rated the truffle as tastier. The researchers concluded that we need to switch the message about saving the planet from altruism to pleasure. They back up their argument with previous studies showing that attitudes based on emotions are more malleable than those grounded in rational claims. The lead researcher, Sebastian Berger, says now that the technology and scale of edible insect farming is improving and increasing prices will start to fall and free up producers to take the study’s findings on board. He cites the food manufacturer Essento Food AG, whichhe says is leading the way in positioning insects as upmarket, delicious food.  He calls this the “sushification” of the mealworm, since raw fish was until 20 years ago also seen by westerners as disgusting to eat.  Veganism, until recently, was viewed as a quirky lifestyle choice or protest, but about 3.5 million people in the UK alone now eat a vegan diet. There are several arguments for swapping meat for plants: health and environmental benefits, and it tastes better. Given the new study, focusing on the taste benefits of plants could be a huge success. Another study found that labelling vegetables with “indulgent” descriptions such as “dynamite chili and tangy lime-seasoned beets” significantly increased the number of people choosing and eating vegetables compared with those given basic or healthy descriptions, such as “lighter-choice beets with no added sugar” or even “high-antioxidant beets”. This is already happening on a small scale, with some vegan restaurants eschewing the “V' word altogether in their marketing and on menus and presenting themselves as equal to meat, not just a healthy alternative, while some are gaining recognition simply for being “tasty”, not “tasty for vegan food”. The US-based vegan soul food restaurant The Land of Kush was voted best restaurant last year by the Baltimore City Paper. As the vegan food industry expands to meet burgeoning demand, millions of pounds’ worth of investment is going into making plant-based burgers taste just as good or even better than the beef burgers we grew up on. But the less said about how our eating habits could potentially save the planet, perhaps the closer we’ll come to actually achieving it. • Jessica Brown is a freelance journalist"
"Leading climate researchers have overwhelmingly rejected the federal government’s claim it is on track to cut greenhouse gas emissions as promised under the 2015 Paris agreement. Guardian Australia asked economists and scientists, including people who have advised the Coalition and Labor, whether Australia was likely to meet the 2030 target of a 26-28% emissions cut below 2005 levels under existing policy settings, as cabinet ministers have claimed.  The prime minister, Scott Morrison, has repeatedly said the target would be met “in a canter”. Nine of the 12 who responded either dismissed Morrison’s statement outright or strongly suggested new policies would be needed. Only one expressed confidence the target would be met if the government did nothing – and he also criticised the Coalition’s stance. The remaining two said the question was impossible to answer definitively, and that it was a red herring given Australia needed to do much more than it promised in Paris if it was to play its part in limiting global warming to 2C or less. Bill Hare, the Perth-based director of global institute Climate Analytics, said scientific assessment of Australia’s policy settings by the Climate Action Tracker showed there was virtually no chance the target would be met without new policies. “There is absolutely no quantitative scientific basis that I am aware of for the government’s repeated claims that it will meet the Paris agreement target. In fact, the reverse is true – its emissions are likely to continue to increase,” he said. Hare said electricity emissions were falling due to the 2020 renewable energy target but the government had promised not to replace it, and emissions from other sectors of the economy – industry, transport, agriculture – would continue to grow in the absence of comprehensive policies. The Grattan Institute’s energy program director, Tony Wood, said the government’s own published numbers showed it was not on track and if Australia did meet its target it would be more due to good luck than good management. Rather than meeting the target in a canter, he said the government needed “a different horse – or at least to get ready to gallop”. Sarah Perkins-Kirkpatrick, a senior research associate with the University of New South Wales climate change research centre, highlighted government data showing national emissions rose by 1.3% last year and Department of Environment and Energy projections suggesting emissions would be only 5% below 2005 levels in 2030. “Given that the national energy guarantee [Neg], which would have reduced emissions from the Australian energy sector, has been dumped, there seems to be very few strategies in place,” she said. On Monday the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change warned in a special report that global warming since pre-industrial times could reach 1.5C by as early as 2030, worsening the risk of drought, floods, extreme heat and poverty. The Australian government has rejected the suggestion it should be doing more, and the IPCC’s finding that coal power would effectively need to be phased out by 2050. Asked on the ABC on Tuesday how the government would meet the 2030 target, the environment minister, Melissa Price, listed the Direct Action emissions reduction fund – which has only $250m left of an initial $2.55bn – the Clean Energy Finance Corporation, the Australian Renewable Energy Agency and the proposed Snowy 2.0 hydro scheme. The managing director of Frontier Economics, Danny Price, a former adviser to the Coalition on climate policy, was the sole respondent who thought current policies would meet the 2030 target. He said the combination of the renewable energy target, separate federal and state schemes to drive clean energy and reduce electricity use at times of high demand, and the increased cost of power would all contribute. But Danny Price ridiculed the government’s shift from supporting emissions cuts under to the Neg to arguing they were not needed to meet the Paris target. “Why did they knife [Malcolm Turnbull] over a scheme that made no difference? Idiots,” he said. Australia’s chief scientist, Alan Finkel, who last year reviewed the national electricity market for the government, only to see one of his central recommendations – the introduction of a clean energy target – rejected, said the transition to a low-emissions economy would take decades, require action in many sectors and would only happen if public policy adapted. His advice called for a whole-of-economy emissions reduction strategy for 2050 to be put in place by 2020. Finkel suggested the government could meet its Paris commitments but it would require policies to develop further. “I am confident that we will comfortably meet the existing targets in the electricity sector and, with an evolving suite of policy measures, it is possible to meet the whole-of-economy targets as well,” he said. Peter Newman, distinguished professor at Curtin University sustainability policy institute and a lead author of an IPCC chapter on the global response to the climate change threat, said Australia was positioned to make a 26% “in a canter” in two sectors of the economy – electricity and the land, where the government had helped to some degree through reforestation programs. But he said Australia had been slow to move on transport emissions and had a problem with its rapidly growing liquid natural gas industry. Frank Jotzo, research director at the Australian National University Crawford school of public policy, said it was possible Australia could meet an even stronger 2030 target if effective and consistent low-emissions policies were introduced across the economy, but not as things stood. Jotzo was one of four respondents who stressed it was wrong to only consider whether Australia would meet the Coalition’s 2030 target, as it fell short of its share of the Paris climate agreement goal to limit global warming to 2C or less. Turnbull and the treasurer, Josh Frydenberg, when environment minister, previously acknowledged Australia would have to adopt more ambitious targets under the Paris deal. Will Steffen, an emeritus professor at ANU’s Fenner school of environment and society and a member of the Climate Council, said the 2030 target was woefully inadequate if Australia was to meet its Paris commitments. “Even meeting that inadequate target – which is not possible under present policy settings – would be consistent with a 3C-plus world, not a 1.5-2C world,” he said. Andy Pitman, director of the Australian Research Council Centre of Excellence for Climate Extremes at UNSW, said asking whether Australia would meet its current 2030 target was a red herring. “An appropriate goal is to decarbonise national economies well before 2050,” he said. Warwick McKibbin, an ANU public policy fellow, senior fellow at the US Brookings Institution and former Reserve Bank of Australia board member, was more cautious than other respondents, warning it was impossible to definitively predict where Australian emissions would go. He said any precise opinion offered in response to the question was more a political statement than rigorous analysis, but added: “What can be said is that a policy with a clear carbon price will make it more likely that Australia will hit its 2030 target.”"
"Economist Jeffrey Sachs has criticised successive Australian governments for “defending a 19th or 20th century industry” rather than taking decisive action on climate change, saying Australia should be “exporting sunshine, not coal”. “Make a plan, make a timeline, tell the world how you’re going to decarbonise, and then we’ll all be happy to hear from Australia that there’s really a plan,” Sachs said on the ABC’s Q&A program on Monday night. “All we see is one PM after another falling over this issue.”  Also on the panel were UK conservative writer James Bartholomew, Victorian Liberal party senator James Paterson, Labor frontbencher Terri Butler and data science teacher Linda McIver. The debate followed the release last week of an alarming report by the UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), which warned that fossil fuels would have to be urgently phased out in order to achieve a global reduction in carbon pollution of 45% by 2030, the level required to ensure the planet only warmed by between 1.5C and 2C. The Australian government has rejected the warning to phase out coal by 2050. Paterson told Q&A the environment was “one of many priorities” for the Morrison government, with another being power prices. About 60% of Australia’s baseload power is currently generated by coal-fired power generators, but the proportion of renewable energy is increasing thanks to energy auctions in Victoria and South Australia, the Tesla battery in South Australia, and reduced cost of renewable technologies. Labor has committed to 50% renewable energy by 2030. Sachs said the IPCC report showed the world was “running out of time” to avoid catastrophic climate change and blamed corporate interests and the domination of the Murdoch press for “propounding nonsense” and “telling lies” about climate science and policy. He said Australia ought to capitalise on its affinity for solar power. “This wonderful country has so much sunshine, you cannot even believe – you could power the whole world from your desert,” he said. “So the idea that you don’t have alternatives … I don’t know who could possibly believe this. You should be exporting sunshine actually, not coal.” Bartholomew questioned the IPCC figures, saying that he “knew a scientist” who did not agree with it. “The IPCC report is based on thousands of scientific reports,” host Tony Jones said in response to Bartholomew’s scepticism. “Six thousand scientific reports and 91 authors and review editors from 40 countries. I mean, balancing that out against the one scientist you know, does it mean that we have to think about consensus?” McIver said her year 10 students had been modelling data from the IPCC report, and even they could see the figures were robust. “The idea there is not consensus around climate change is outrageous,” she said. The panel also heard from Kevin Muslayah, the deputy principal of Red Rock Christian College in Melbourne’s north-western suburbs, who referred to the yet to be released Ruddock report into religious freedom. Muslayah said his school would like to retain the right to hire, and possibly fire, LGBTI teachers based on “a particular alignment of values”. Butler said there was no justification for discriminating against LGBTI teachers or students, saying: “A gay teacher doesn’t teach gay maths. They just teach maths.” Paterson said legislation before parliament this month would prevent discrimination against students on the basis of gender or sexual identity. He said the government would also move to protect teachers “who are willing to teach the values of that school” but said religious schools should retain discretion over who they hire."

"They couldn’t have been any clearer. If you are worried about climate change, you’ve got to do your bit and reduce your harmful emissions. For some, this will involve switching to an electric car and giving up red meat. For everyone else, there is no excuse not to switch to a green electricity (and in some cases, gas) supplier. And there’s a double incentive to go green – not only does it send the message to the traditional energy firms they have to up their renewable game – it will also, most likely, save money through lower bills.  A British Gas customer, in an average UK home – on the firm’s standard variable tariff – spends about £1,200 a year heating and lighting their home. If they live in a bigger house, or have teenage children, bills will be somewhere in the £1,600- to £2,000-a-year range. By switching to Guardian pick Pure Planet – an independent supplier that offers electricity from 100% renewable sources (no nuclear, either) and “100% carbon offset gas” – that same “average” customer can reduce their bill to about £920 a year, a saving in excess of £250.  Pure Planet is one of new entrants to the energy market, but, unlike some others, this has a big firm behind it – BP has a stake. There are two big caveats. Customers have to manage their account via a smartphone app which will not appeal to everyone. Also, the tariff is not fixed, meaning prices could well go up – other suppliers have recently been raising prices. Pure Planet gets good customer reviews on Trustpilot, and Money has not received any complaints. Pure Planet’s Steven Day says prices across the whole market will likely rise over the next few months, but points out that the new breed of green suppliers will remain among the cheapest suppliers. “Green power is now cheaper than brown and there’s no reason for anyone not to do the right thing and switch over,” he says. If you prefer a supplier you can call – or one that is marginally cheaper – Edinburgh-based People’s Energy offers 100% green electricity but only conventional gas. This will cost the average customer about £900 a year – a £300 saving over British Gas’s standard customer. Again, prices could go up over the coming months. Yorkshire Energy has the cheapest fixed tariff – Green Turtle – fixed until 30 November 2019 at just under £1,000 a year for average gas and electricity usage. Switching supplier is easy and takes about 10 minutes. Dig out a recent bill and do a search using a comparison site such as Energyhelpline.com. Make sure you click on “all plans” to ensure you are shown green deals as well as the suppliers the comparison site may be promoting. "
"Among the motivating issues for voters in US elections, the environment is typically eclipsed by topics such as healthcare, the economy and guns. But the upcoming midterms could, belatedly, see a stirring of a slumbering green giant. “The environmental movement doesn’t have a persuasion problem, it has a turnout problem,” said Nathaniel Stinnett, the founder of the Environmental Voter Project, which is aiming to spur people who care about the natural world and climate change to the ballot box. “This group has more power than it realizes. In the midterms we want to flood the zone with environmentalists.”  Any such voting surge would go some way to heeding the increasingly urgent warnings from scientists about climate change. A major UN climate report released this week said the world risks worsening floods, droughts, species loss and poverty without “rapid and far-reaching transitions” to energy, transport and land use. “We show it can be done within laws of physics and chemistry,” said Jim Skea, a coauthor of the exhaustive report. “The final tick box is political will. We cannot answer that.” An obstacle in the US is the large pool of environmental voters who don’t actually vote, according to public records and polls analyzed by the Environmental Voter Project. It estimates more than 15 million people who rank the environment as a top tier issue didn’t vote in the 2014 midterms. Since its creation in 2015, the voter project claims it has increased turnout of target voters by as much as 4.5% in elections. In 2018, it is aiming to reach 2.4 million of these voters across six states as part of a turnout effort that could help swing some key races. An army of 1,800 volunteers will knock on doors, fire off text messages, make calls and send mailouts. The “punchline” of the Environmental Voter Project, Stinnett said, is that it doesn’t talk to voters about the environment at all. It simply tries to get them out to vote. “We are already targeting people who care about the environment, all we want to do is get them to vote on election day,” he said. “Peer and social pressure are the best ways – we will send someone a letter saying ‘did you know 93 people in your building turned out to vote last time?’ We play to societal norms and expectations. “Our focus isn’t to change the outcome of particular elections but there’s no doubt the number of non-voting environmentalists in some districts is so large that they will have an impact. We need to hold politicians’ feet to the fire on the environment, but first of all we need some fire.” Americans of voting age who care strongly about the environment have been unusually reticent to make their voice heard, for reasons that are still unclear. Stinnett said demographics are part of it – the young, Latinos and black people are simultaneously most worried about climate change and least likely to vote – but this doesn’t explain the full story. “It’s hard to figure out why,” he said. “Even among young people, for example, environmentalists are less likely to vote. The environmental movement has done a lot of things to change the way we eat, travel and work, but it hasn’t flexed its political muscles yet. Look at the NRA. Their power isn’t in the amount of money they spend – it’s because if you care about gun rights, you vote like it’s your job. Politicians know that and they are in the business of collecting votes. Why would they spend time on an issue that doesn’t appear to energize voters?” Beyond disasters such as hurricanes and wildfires, most politicians and the media, particularly broadcast news, rarely dwell for long on environmental matters. In 2017, the costliest year on record for climate-related disasters, a total of just 260 minutes coverage of climate change was broadcast across the six major TV networks, according to one analysis. A year prior, no questions on climate change were put to Donald Trump or Hillary Clinton during three presidential debates. Trump has subsequently ignored the issue in office, save the odd disparaging tweet, while overseeing an administration that has systematically dismantled climate, air and water pollution regulations. At first glance, the evidence suggests there will be only a mild voter backlash to this agenda. Voters asked recently by Yale to rank 28 issues placed global warming 15th, behind areas like tax reform, immigration, terrorism, healthcare and the economy. The partisan split is stark, however – while liberal Democrats place global warming fourth out of 28, conservative Republicans rank it dead last. “The issue has become more polarized than abortion in terms of voting priorities,” said Anthony Leiserowitz, the director of the Yale Program on Climate Change Communication. “The most important factor in belief in climate science is political ideology. “It is remarkable that the base of one of the two major parties in the US lists climate change as a top four issue. You wouldn’t have seen that five years ago. But those numbers drop among conservative Democrats and so candidates are afraid to touch it when reaching to the middle. And among conservative Republicans, the issue is just toxic.” In a few close midterm races, this split is evident. In Pennsylvania’s redrawn 10th district, for example, Democrat George Scott, a former soldier and pastor, is up against incumbent Scott Perry. While Scott has said there is an “obligation to our children and grandchildren to take immediate action” on climate change, Perry has done little on the issue other than to attempt to prevent the Pentagon from doing anything related to climate change and seemingly blame God for pollution in Chesapeake Bay. The Environmental Voter Project is targeting 31,292 seldom-voting and non-voting environmentalists in Perry’s district ahead of the election. “This is Trump country and the environment and climate change isn’t a top issue here,” said Alex Bishop, a registered Republican who works in marketing for a tech company. Bishop lives in York, a city in southern Pennsylvania that is a key urban hub in the 10th district, and is involved in outreach to fellow conservatives on climate change. “Even saying ‘climate change’ sets off red flags here so it’s better to connect climate change with other issues, such as immigration or the military protecting fossil fuels. I would say it’s gone from ‘it’s all a hoax’ to ‘maybe something is going on.’ It doesn’t sound like much progress, but it’s slowly turning.” The divisiveness of climate change can be separated from broader environmental concerns over the health of the air, water and landscapes. In Yale’s poll “environmental protection” ranks as a top 10 issue for Democrats and is number 11 for moderate Republicans, a group Leiserowitz describes as comprising roughly a third of the party that follows in the Teddy Roosevelt tradition of fondness for public lands and wildlife stewardship. But in a new political landscape where energizing a core of voters is edging out the desire to reach a diminishing middle ground, climate change is vigorously debated by both sides only during Democratic primary races. This partisan relationship has shown up in Yale’s polling of Republicans. In the two years before the election of Trump in 2016, belief that climate change is happening increased 19% among Republican voters, only to crash once the new president made clear his disdain for climate science and decided to pull the US from the Paris climate agreement. Taken in aggregate, Americans’ belief that climate change is occurring is gradually strengthening, now standing at around seven in 10 voters. Policies to address climate change enjoy surprisingly hefty support – Yale found 85% of Americans support more funding for renewable energy research, 77% want carbon dioxide regulated as a pollutant and nearly seven in 10 want fossil fuel companies to pay a carbon tax. A further 70% of those polled believe environmental protection is more important than economic growth – evidence, perhaps, that the huge swaths of political rhetoric about taxes and jobs is severely out of kilter with the public. “The link between events like hurricanes and climate change is emerging as an idea in Americans’ minds, even as they are swamped by partisanship,” said Leiserowitz. “It’s conceivable climate change will swing future elections but it’s also conceivable we will continue to ignore the issue. After all, it gets almost no ink in the media, so how can we expect people to think it’s important?”"
"Huge reductions in meat-eating are essential to avoid dangerous climate change, according to the most comprehensive analysis yet of the food system’s impact on the environment. In western countries, beef consumption needs to fall by 90% and be replaced by five times more beans and pulses. The research also finds that enormous changes to farming are needed to avoid destroying the planet’s ability to feed the 10 billion people expected to be on the planet in a few decades. Food production already causes great damage to the environment, via greenhouse gases from livestock, deforestation and water shortages from farming, and vast ocean dead zones from agricultural pollution. But without action, its impact will get far worse as the world population rises by 2.3 billion people by 2050 and global income triples, enabling more people to eat meat-rich western diets. This trajectory would smash critical environmental limits beyond which humanity will struggle to live, the new research indicates. “It is pretty shocking,” said Marco Springmann at the University of Oxford, who led the research team. “We are really risking the sustainability of the whole system. If we are interested in people being able to farm and eat, then we better not do that.” “Feeding a world population of 10 billion is possible, but only if we change the way we eat and the way we produce food,” said Prof Johan Rockström at the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research in Germany, who was part of the research team. “Greening the food sector or eating up our planet: this is what is on the menu today.” The new study follows the publication of a landmark UN report on Monday in which the world’s leading scientists warned there are just a dozen years in which to keep global warming under 1.5C, beyond which even half a degree will significantly worsen the risks of drought, floods and extreme heat. The report said eating less meat and dairy was important but said current trends were in the opposite direction. The new research, published in the journal Nature, is the most thorough to date and combined data from every country to assess the impact of food production on the global environment. It then looked at what could be done to stop the looming food crisis. “There is no magic bullet,” said Springmann. “But dietary and technological change [on farms] are the two essential things, and hopefully they can be complemented by reduction in food loss and waste.” About a third of food produced today never reaches the table. The researchers found a global shift to a “flexitarian” diet was needed to keep climate change even under 2C, let alone 1.5C. This flexitarian diet means the average world citizen needs to eat 75% less beef, 90% less pork and half the number of eggs, while tripling consumption of beans and pulses and quadrupling nuts and seeds. This would halve emissions from livestock and better management of manure would enable further cuts. In rich nations, the dietary changes required are ever more stark. UK and US citizens need to cut beef by 90% and milk by 60% while increasing beans and pulses between four and six times. However, the millions of people in poor nations who are undernourished need to eat a little more meat and dairy. Reducing meat consumption might be achieved by a mix of education, taxes, subsidies for plant-based foods and changes to school and workplace menus, the scientists said. To halt deforestation, water shortages and pollution from overuse of fertiliser, profound changes in farming practices are needed. These include increasing crop yields in poorer nations, more universal water storage and far more careful use of fertilisers. “I was surprised by the fact we need a combination of very ambitious options,” Springmann said. “We really need to push it to the edge of what is possible.” All the diet and farming options are already being implemented in somewhere in the world, said Springmann. In the Netherlands and Israel, fertilisers and water are being better used, while big cuts in meat consumption are being seen among young people in some cities. But a global change is needed, he said: “I think we can do it, but we really need much more proactive governments to provide the right framework. People can make a personal difference by changing their diet, but also by knocking on the doors of their politicians and saying we need better environmental regulations – that is also very important. Do not let politicians off the hook.” Prof Tim Benton at the University of Leeds, who was not part of the research team, said: “Ultimately, we live on a finite planet, with finite resources. It is a fiction to imagine there is a technological solution allowing us to produce as much food as we might ever want, allowing us to overeat and throw food away.” He said the environmental burden of the current food system “undermines the ability of future generations to live on a stable and ecologically rich planet”. Prof Peter Smith at the University of Aberdeen, who was also not part of the research team, said: “We know food choices are very personal, and that behaviour change can be difficult to encourage, but the evidence is now unequivocal – we need to change our diets if we are to have a sustainable future. The fact that it will also make us healthier makes it a no-brainer.”"
"Late last month Indonesia was hit by a devastating earthquake and tsunami that left thousands of people dead and missing. This week the International Monetary Fund arrived in the country to hold its annual meeting on the island of Bali. On the day when the IMF issued a warning about trouble ahead for the global economy, the latest report from the UN’s intergovernmental panel on climate change said the world had only a dozen years left to take the steps necessary to prevent a global warming catastrophe. The message is clear for those willing to hear it: get ready for a time when economic failure combines with ecological breakdown to create the perfect storm. Even without the added complication of climate change, the challenge facing the finance ministers and central bank governors gathered in Bali would be significant enough. The IMF has cut its forecast for global growth, but the chances are that next year will be a lot worse than is currently forecast. The risks, the IMF says, are skewed to the downside. You bet they are.  Here’s a brief checklist. For the past 10 years, the world economy has been surviving on a diet of low interest rates and money creation by central banks, but that stimulus is now being gradually withdrawn. In the United States, growth has been further pumped up by Donald Trump’s tax cuts for individuals and companies, but only temporarily. The impact will start to fade next year as higher interest rates start to bite. Trump is already berating the Federal Reserve, America’s central bank, for increasing borrowing costs. In Europe, a colossal row is brewing between Italy’s populist government and the fiscal conservatives at the European commission because the budget proposed by Rome runs completely counter to the EU’s fiscal rules. Officials in Brussels are more worried about Italy than they are about Brexit, and with good reason. Italy’s banks are awash with bad debts and could not survive the sort of financial crisis that appears to be in prospect. It is a much bigger country than Greece, and far too big for Europe to bail out if the worst happens. The standoff between Rome and Brussels is happening as Europe’s growth rate has started to slow. One reason is that its export-driven economies are already being hurt by the early skirmishes in Trump’s trade war. As the IMF noted this week, protectionism is a key risk to global growth. China, the world’s second biggest economy, has always been Trump’s main target, and it has been affected by new US tariffs, as its domestic economy was already slowing. Elsewhere, in the past few months the IMF has been called in to help Argentina, there has been a run on the Turkish lira, and inflation in Venezuela threatens to hit Weimar Germany-style levels. In better times, oil-rich Venezuela might have been well placed to benefit from the rising price of crude oil, which is heading steadily towards $100 a barrel. Every big recession in the global economy has been prefigured by a jump in the cost of crude, which makes it somewhat curious that share prices on Wall Street are so high. Traditionally, stock markets anticipate trouble, but the mood currently is to dismiss higher interest rates, rising oil prices, Italy and trade wars as somehow unimportant. Ominously, next year is the 90th anniversary of the Wall Street Crash. The Great Depression that followed that market meltdown led to new economic thinking. It spawned full employment policies, increased spending on welfare, and a new set of multilateral organisations. Turn the clock forward to 2018 and the parallels are obvious. International cooperation has broken down, economic failure has damaged mainstream political parties, and belief in the invisible hand of the free market has been shattered. But the threat posed by global warming means the current crisis of capitalism is more acute than that of the 1930s, because all that was really required then was a boost to growth, provided by the New Deal, cheap money, tougher controls on finance and rearmament. In today’s context, a plain vanilla go-for-growth strategy would be suicidal. Even so, there are countries that are prepared to self-immolate their economies in pursuit of growth at all costs. America is one. Australia appears to be another. At the other end of the spectrum are those who say there will be a future for the planet only if the idea of growth is ditched altogether. Politically, this has always been a hard sell, and has become even more difficult now that populations in the west have experienced an entire decade of flatlining living standards. In the developing world, the problem has been too little growth rather than too much. Tackling global population growth is a no-brainer from a climate-change perspective, and most of the projected increase comes from low-income countries, most notably in Africa. The reason is simple: poor families have more children. Birthrates fall as countries become richer. Between the two extremes are those who think the circle can be squared by carbon-free growth, made possible by the dramatic fall in the cost of renewable energy. Technology will ride to the rescue, they insist. This sounds like a cost-free (or at least relatively cheap) option, and that’s why almost all politicians pay lip service to green growth. But then they act in ways that make achieving global warming targets harder – by building new roads and expanding airports. And always for the same reason: because doing so will be good for growth. This is called a balanced approach, but it is nothing of the sort. If the IPCC is even close to being right about its timeline, speeding up the transition from fossil fuels to renewables is vital. Can that be done? One of the winners of this year’s Nobel prize for economics – William Nordhaus – says it can, if policymakers get serious about a carbon tax set high enough to price oil, coal and gas out of the market. Here, though, the breakdown in international cooperation and trust becomes really damaging. Ideally, existing global institutions – the IMF, the World Bank, the UN and the World Trade Organization – would be supplemented by a new World Environmental Organisation with the power to levy a carbon tax globally. Even in the absence of a new body, they would be working together to face down the inevitable opposition to change from the fossil fuel lobby. Instead, the response to climate change looks similar to the response to the financial crisis: fail to recognise there is a problem until it is too late; panic; then muddle through. That’s a sobering prospect."
"Far too little is being done to protect people from the heatwaves, storms and floods being supercharged by climate change, according to a high-level international commission. It aims to rebuild the political will to act that was damaged when US president, Donald Trump, rejected the global Paris agreement. The Global Commission on Adaptation is being led by Ban Ki-Moon, Bill Gates and Kristalina Georgieva, CEO of the World Bank. It involves 17 countries including China, India, South Africa, Indonesia, Canada and the UK.  Much more money is being invested in cutting carbon emissions than preparing for the climate change impacts that are already inevitable. More than $380bn (£287bn) was spent on reducing CO2 in 2015-16, compared with just $20bn boosting protection from extreme weather. Former UN secretary general Ban said a step change in adaptation can and must be achieved: “Climate change is happening much, much faster than one may think. [But] where there is political will, anything can be done.” However, he said the international consensus to fight global warming had been damaged by Trump’s actions. On Sunday, Trump questioned whether global warming was caused by human activities, contradicting the long-established conclusions of the world’s scientists. “We were very much united until December 2015 in Paris,” Ban told the Guardian. “Now unfortunately the level of solidarity is being loosened, especially by the Trump administration. Even though it is just one country, it has caused big political damage.” Adaptation measures to safeguard people’s homes, food, water and energy are being implemented in some places, but at far too small a scale, the commissioners said. “Continued economic growth and reductions in global poverty are possible despite these daunting challenges – but only if societies invest much more in adaptation,” said Ban. “The costs of adapting are less than the cost of doing business as usual and the benefits are many times larger.” “We are at a moment of high risk and great promise,” said Bill Gates, co-chair of the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation. “If everyone does their part, we can reduce carbon emissions, increase access to affordable energy, and help farmers everywhere grow more productive crops.” “Our climate has already changed. Dramatic weather events and volatile seasons are the new normal,” said Georgieva. “We face a choice: business as usual and hope for the best. Or we act now and build for a resilient future.” The new group is comprised of 28 commissioners, including two national presidents, representing all regions of the globe and all sectors of development and industry. The US administration is not represented but Francis Suarez, the mayor of Miami, is a commissioner. The commission will produce a major report on adapting to climate change for the UN climate summit in September 2019, followed by a year of action to implement its recommendations. “Scientists and economists believe the cost of adaptation could rise to $500bn per year by 2050 and, in the mid-term, $300bn by 2030,” said Ban. This money is available, he said: “I don’t think it is a matter of [getting the] money. The money can be mobilised. If there is political will, I think we can handle this matter.” In particular, the trillions of dollars held by investment managers and insurers should be put to work, Ban said: “We should not expect all this money to come from governments. The private sector has to be fully engaged.” He said 63% of the $380bn invested in cutting emissions in 2015-16 was from the private sector."

"Donald Trump has reiterated his doubts about climate change, suggesting that the climate could “change back again,” and that climate scientists are politically motivated. The US president has long questioned man-made global warming. In an interview with CBS programme 60 Minutes that aired Sunday night, he said that he no longer believes climate change is a hoax, as he tweeted in 2012. “I think something’s happening. Something’s changing and it’ll change back again,” he said. “I don’t think it’s a hoax. I think there’s probably a difference. But I don’t know that it’s manmade. I will say this: I don’t want to give trillions and trillions of dollars. I don’t want to lose millions and millions of jobs.” The White House has previously declined to clarify Trump’s position. He tweeted in 2017 during a cold snap that “perhaps we could use a little bit of that good old Global Warming.” In the East, it could be the COLDEST New Year’s Eve on record. Perhaps we could use a little bit of that good old Global Warming that our Country, but not other countries, was going to pay TRILLIONS OF DOLLARS to protect against. Bundle up! Trump has said he will withdraw the US from the Paris agreement, an international pact to limit greenhouse gas emissions from power plants, cars and industry. His administration is seeking to roll back all of the country’s significant climate efforts. The president’s comments come as the record-breaking Hurricane Michael flattened communities in Florida and barely a week after an international coalition of scientists warned that it will be incredibly difficult to avoid the intensified heat waves, flooding and extreme storms that will come with higher temperatures caused by humans. Climate scientists say hurricanes are likely to grow stronger in warming oceans. Asked about that, Trump said “you’d have to show me the scientists because they have a very big political agenda.” As for melting ice caps and rising seas, Trump said “you don’t know whether or not that would have happened with or without man.” Global temperatures are already up 1C since industrialization. Keeping them from rising more than 1.5C and avoiding environmental catastrophe would require unprecedented action to begin phasing out fossil fuels within the next 12 years, according to the UN intergovernmental panel on climate change. At 1.5C warmer, seas could still rise 26cm to 77cm. Much of Trump’s cabinet has questioned the scientific consensus that humans are causing higher temperatures that pose immediate and growing threats. Trump economic adviser Larry Kudlow and Republican Senator Marco Rubio of Florida this weekend also questioned how much humans are contributing to climate change. Rubio acknowledged temperature rises and swelling seas but argued inaccurately that “many scientists would debate the percentage of what is attributable to man versus normal fluctuations.”"
"Big business has entered discussions about a self-regulated suite of measures to help Australia meet its Paris commitments, weeks after the Morrison government abandoned the national energy guarantee.  The resources minister, Matt Canavan, accused Australia’s biggest energy companies of interfering in the democratic process, as climate experts and environmental groups lashed the government over the development on Thursday. “We have a demonstrable way in Australia and western society of resolving fraught political disputes about energy. It’s called democracy and I don’t think the corporate sector is a replacement,” Canavan told a Sydney energy conference. The discussions about an industry-wide package to help Australia meet its Paris commitments and provide investment certainty are taking place within the Business Council of Australia’s energy and climate change committee and were first reported by the Australian Financial Review. Quoting industry sources, the paper said the suite of measures would be aimed at curbing emissions, improving reliability and providing investor certainty. Guardian Australia has confirmed discussions for a such a package have taken place. The Business Council of Australia (BCA) was approached for comment. Some experts welcomed news the business community was willing to step up to the plate after the government signalled it would focus solely on energy prices and reliability, and not emissions. But they also lamented the development as a government failure. “This is a sign of just how messed up the politics of climate and energy policy have become,” Frank Jotzo, the research director at the Australian National University Crawford school of public policy, told Guardian Australia. “It shows us just how important it is to the business community to have sensible policy and predictable policy in place. Business would like government to … help that transition along rather than somehow stem the tide in a somewhat chaotic fashion.” Dylan McConnell, of the University of Melbourne’s climate and energy college, told Guardian Australia it was a “reflection of the toxic politics around energy”. “It’s a bit of a concern that we’re potentially heading to a self-regulation model around this,” he said, adding that he was sceptical of the BCA’s credibility on emissions reductions. The Intergovermental Panel on Climate Change warned on Monday that the world had just 12 years to avoid climate change catastrophe. The prime minister, Scott Morrison, on Thursday reiterated his confidence that Australia would meet its Paris commitments, a claim that has been contradicted by a wide range of experts. Erwin Jackson, a senior climate change and energy adviser at Environment Victoria, said the possibility of an industry-led mechanism was “interesting to explore but the core challenge will be ensuring it has broad cross sectoral support”. “It’s a damning indictment of the failure of the Coalition to come up with a credible and enduring climate policy,” he told Guardian Australia. “Business by itself can’t deliver the certainty that the community and investors are going to need to drive the transition.” Jotzo said it was “difficult to conceive of an actual scheme that would be implemented and run by industry alone”. But he said the discussions would send a strong message to the government. “When it comes to to anything that involves financial transactions, you need a policy framework to incentivise that,” Jotzo said."
"The chairman of the Coalition’s backbench energy committee, the outspoken conservative Craig Kelly, says the government needs to axe current subsidies for households and businesses to install renewable energy technology like solar panels. With the Morrison government in the middle of formulating its new energy policy, and with Labor now promising to maintain subsidies for households and businesses to install small-scale renewable energy until 2030, Kelly told Guardian Australia the Coalition needed to wind up the program.  The government’s energy policy rework will take up a number of recent recommendations from the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission’s examination of the electricity market. The competition watchdog has called for the federal small-scale renewable energy scheme (SRES), which provides rebates for installations of renewables, to be abolished by 2021, but it is not yet clear if the government will accept that recommendation. Bill Shorten used an interview with Guardian Australia last week to signal Labor will keep the SRES scheme until 2030 but Kelly declared ahead of the regular meeting of the government’s backbench energy committee: “I think the ACCC report is correct and this scheme should be wound up in its entirety.” The former prime minister Tony Abbott has already prevailed upon the energy minister, Angus Taylor, to axe the small-scale scheme and the federal renewable energy target, which is due to wind down from 2020 will not be replaced by the government. This week, members of the pro-coal Monash Forum are scheduled to dine at parliament house with Trevor St Baker, part-owner of the Vales Point coal generator and founder of the business electricity retailer ERM Power. St Baker has previously signalled interest in pursuing a replacement for the Hazelwood power station if the federal government settles on a favourable energy policy. The government has signalled it wants to encourage new investment extending the life of existing coal and gas plants, and upgrading ageing facilities, with an objective of boosting supply. The Coalition has been on the back foot politically over climate and energy policy since dumping the national energy guarantee, and climate change has been a significant problem for the Liberals in the Wentworth byelection, where the Morrison government faces the risk of losing its one-seat majority in the lower house. Taylor is due to meet with his state and territory counterparts later in October to try and salvage the reliability component of the Neg even though the government has dumped the accompanying emissions reduction target of 26% for the electricity sector. The meeting in late October is expected to consider the future of the reliability obligation and the implementation of the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission’s recommendation that energy companies give consumers a default retail offer. There is expected to be a broad discussion of the ACCC’s recommendations for making power pricing more transparent for consumers. Taylor said the looming talks would centre on “bringing power prices down while ensuring the reliability of the grid”. “Decisive action on key recommendations from the ACCC’s retail electricity pricing report is central to delivering relief to families and businesses.” The ACT’s climate change minister, Shane Rattenbury, told Guardian Australia he was happy to consider the reliability obligation at the looming meeting with Taylor. “The reliability mechanism can probably go ahead in some shape or form,” he said. “We haven’t formed an official view on that yet but, in the broad, I’m happy to consider it. “We will need to see if they have changed the architecture of the scheme and think about how the reliability obligation sits by itself.”"
"The Paris climate agreement set a target of no more than 2°C global warming above pre-industrial temperatures, but also an aspirational target of no more than 1.5°C.  That’s because many participating countries – especially island nations particularly vulnerable to sea level rise – felt that even 2°C global warming is too dangerous.  But there hadn’t been a lot of research into the climate impacts at 1.5°C vs. 2°C, and so the UN asked the IPCC to publish a special report summarizing what it would take to achieve the 1.5°C limit and what the consequences would be of missing it. The details in the report are worth understanding, but there’s one simple critical takeaway point: we need to cut carbon pollution as much as possible, as fast as possible.  Depending on how we define ‘pre-industrial temperatures’ and how fast we keep consuming fossil fuels, we’ll likely burn through the rest of the 1.5°C carbon budget within the next 3 to 10 years.  To stay below 1.5°C, the IPCC therefore concludes the world must embark on a World War II-level effort to transition away from fossil fuels, and also start removing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere at large scales – anywhere from 400bn to 1.6tn tons of it. Realistically, this isn’t going to happen.  We’re currently on track for more than 3°C global warming by 2100.  We can do better than that if countries ratchet down their carbon pledges and implement more aggressive climate policies, but with some nations moving in the wrong direction, like the US and potentially Brazil electing climate denier presidents, even staying below 2°C is looking increasingly less likely. However, these are somewhat arbitrary targets.  1.5°C is less dangerous than 2°C, which is less dangerous than 2.5°C, which is less dangerous than 3°C, and so on.  Any further warming from today’s already-hot temperatures (1°C warmer than pre-industrial) increases global risks, and staying below any of these temperature thresholds is going to require aggressive climate policies from countries around the world. The answer to the question “what should aim for?” is simple: cut carbon pollution as much as possible, as fast as possible.  Until the world reaches zero carbon, the answer will always be the same.   Carbon Brief created an excellent interactive page detailing the differences in climate impacts between 1.5°C and 2°C, based on 70 peer-reviewed studies.  Generally speaking, the IPCC report finds that “Climate-related risks to health, livelihoods, food security, water supply, human security, and economic growth are projected to increase with global warming of 1.5°C and increase further with 2°C.” One of the biggest differences between 1.5°C and 2°C is the impact on coral reefs, which support about 25% of all known marine species.  Coral reefs are very vulnerable to the combination of hotter and more acidic ocean waters resulting from carbon pollution.  At 1.5°C, the IPCC estimates that we’ll lose about 80% of coral reefs.  At 2°C, virtually all coral reefs will be gone.   Summers with no remaining Arctic sea ice are also ten times more likely at 2°C than 1.5°C (at least once per decade vs. once per century).  What happens in the Arctic doesn’t stay in the Arctic – disappearing sea ice appears to be connected to the weakening jet stream, which in turn causes weather systems to get stuck in place for extended periods of time.  This can lead to particularly intense heat waves, floods, droughts, and other extreme weather events.  The volume of sea ice in the Arctic has already declined by about 70% over just the past 40 years. The IPCC report concludes that a world with 2°C of global warming will lead to more heat-related deaths, smaller crop yields, worse extreme weather events, slower economic growth, more people in poverty, and increase the population facing water stress by up to 50% compared to a 1.5°C world.  And the impacts will get progressively worse if temperatures warm beyond the 2°C limit. The take-home message is that the faster we cut carbon pollution, the less severe impacts we’ll face.  We’re not yet doing nearly enough, although the Paris agreement was an important first step, and countries that withdraw from it should become international pariahs.  While it’s important to understand the consequences of missing each temperature target, that bottom line will perpetually hold true."
"On the morning that the world’s leading climate scientists warn that the planet has until 2030 to avert a global warming catastrophe, Mary Robinson appears suitably sombre. She wears black shoes, black trousers and a black sweater and perches at the end of a long table at her climate justice foundation, headquartered in an austere, imposing Georgian building opposite Trinity College Dublin. The only dash of brightness is a multicoloured brooch on her lapel. “It symbolises the sustainable development goals,” she says. “It’s the one good emblem that the United Nations has produced, so I like to wear it.” There seems little reason for cheer on this Monday. The landmark report by the UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) has just warned that urgent, unprecedented changes are needed to keep global warming to a maximum of 1.5C; even half a degree beyond this will significantly worsen the risks of drought, floods, extreme heat and poverty for hundreds of millions of people. Donald Trump, rejecter of the Paris climate agreement, is riding high on the back of Brett Kavanaugh’s elevation to the US supreme court. Britain and the EU are consumed by Brexit. Brazil is on course to elect a president who wants to open the Amazon to agribusiness. Closer to home, the Irish government is flunking its climate policy goals. Now, climate scientists warn that the clock ticks ever closer to midnight.  “Governments are not responding at all adequately to the stark reality that the IPCC is pointing to: that we have about 11 years to make really significant change,” says Robinson, sitting ramrod straight, all business. “This report is extraordinarily important, because it’s telling us that 2 degrees is not safe. It’s beyond safe. Therefore, we have to work much, much harder to stay at 1.5 degrees. I’ve seen what 1 degree is doing in more vulnerable countries ... villages are having to move, there’s slippage, there’s seawater incursion.” Robinson sips a glass of water and sighs. “We’re in a bumpy time. We’re in a bad political cycle, particularly because the United States is not only not giving leadership, but is being disruptive of multilateralism and is encouraging populism in other countries.” This could be the start of a depressing interview that concludes we should hitch a ride on Virgin Galactic’s first trip to space and try to stay there. But it turns out to be surprisingly upbeat. Despite the headlines, Robinson, who served as the UN secretary general’s special envoy on climate change after serving as the president of Ireland and the UN high commissioner for human rights, is hopeful. She has anticipated the IPCC report by writing a book-cum-manifesto, Climate Justice: Hope, Resilience and the Fight for a Sustainable Future, published this week. It tells stories of farmers and activists, mostly women, who tackle climate change in Africa, Asia and the Americas. They are examples of positive change that Robinson thinks can help turn the tide. “I don’t think as a human race that we can be so stupid that we can’t face an existential threat together and find a common humanity and solidarity to respond to it. Because we do have the capacity and the means to do it – if we have the political will.” Climate change may be man-made, but Robinson believes women are key to the solution, through planting trees, recycling waste, eating less meat and a thousand other measures, big and small. “There’s a nurturing quality, a concern for children, that’s very deep in women. And women change behaviour. It’s women who decide what the diet will be. And, of course, in vulnerable countries, it’s women who bear the brunt of climate change.” The former barrister karate-chops the air for emphasis. “I’ve learned from Archbishop Desmond Tutu to be a ‘prisoner of hope’, a great expression that he uses. That means the glass may not be half full, but there’s something in the glass that you work on. Hope brings energy.” So, while the Trump administration withholds leadership and money from the global effort for clean energy – “That’s where it hurts” – the US may yet meet Paris emissions targets, thanks to efforts by We Are Still In, a coalition of mayors, governors, tribal leaders, colleges, businesses, faith groups and investors that is continuing to follow the terms of the agreement. The movement to divestment from fossil fuels is also making progress. “They’ve now moved to trillions being divested. That’s very significant.” Grim scientific prognoses must not paralyse civil society, says Robinson. It must unite, march, organise, pressure politicians. “Feeling a complete inability to do anything – ‘This is too big for me, I give up’ – that’s no use to anybody. [With] despair, all the energy to do something goes out of the room.” Robinson says she is adapting her own behaviour: fewer flights and more teleconferencing; eating less meat as an “aspirant vegetarian”; using public transport, although she confesses to taking taxis frequently. “I talk to the taxi drivers, that’s my compensation. I get them to message for me. Ten years ago, taxi drivers were the most sceptical about climate change. Now, they’re the most keen to get an electric car, or at least a hybrid.” At the age of 73, Robinson has carved out a new role in public life. No longer a high-powered global bureaucrat with a big budget and staff, no longer a head of state trailed by pomp, she instead relies on a formidable intellect, her brand name and her social and political network. You could call it soft power, except Robinson does not do soft. She is friendly and courteous, but the famous iron-grip handshake is still there; so too her antiphathy towards smalltalk. The gaze is direct, the sentences exact. When I go off-topic and ask about Brexit, or the Irish presidential election, there is a tight smile. “We’re straying far from the book, aren’t we?” Supporters and critics have long noted a personal stiffness matched by an unbending commitment to liberal principles. How else would a GP’s daughter from Ballina, County Mayo, emerge in the 1970s as a law professor and outspoken advocate for women’s rights and contraception while other politicians genuflected before the might of the country’s Roman Catholic church? She was denounced from the pulpit and had condoms sent to her in the post. Nominated by the Labour party as a long-shot candidate for the presidency in 1990, she won. It was an astonishing result that prefigured Ireland’s social liberalisation. It enshrined Robinson as a progressive talisman. Kofi Annan tapped her up to become the UN’s high commissioner for human rights in 1997, three months before her presidential term ended. It was a rare misstep. She has expressed regret for letting the then secretary general “sort of bully” her into leaving the presidency early to head to Geneva. Later, George W Bush’s administration bristled at her stance on human rights, Palestine and other issues after 9/11, which contributed to her stepping down in 2002. A year later, Robinson found herself in a Dublin maternity ward holding her first grandchild, Rory. “I was flooded with a sense of adrenaline, a physical sensation unlike anything I had ever felt before,” she writes in Climate Justice. “In that moment, my sense of time altered and I began to think in a time span of a hundred years. I knew instinctively that I would now view Rory’s life through the prism of our planet’s precarious future ... the abstract data on climate change that I had skirted around for so long became deeply personal.” Robinson was struck by the injustice that those least responsible, such as islanders in Kiribati or herders in Kenya, suffered most from climate change, and by the fact that much of the world ignored scientists’ warnings. Her response is to tell the stories of people such as Sharon Hanshaw, a hairdresser in Mississippi who led community recovery efforts after Hurricane Katrina; Constance Okollet, a Ugandan farmer who taught neighbours to plant trees to stop topsoil erosion; and Natalie Isaacs, an Australian entrepreneur who launched an online initiative to help households curb their carbon footprints. “I try to illustrate the hope and the fightback,” says Robinson. “And the need for empathy. We need to have empathy now with those who are suffering ... because that’s where we’ll all be very shortly if we don’t change course.” Robinson wanted to do a documentary to accompany the book, but she was advised instead to do a podcast. “Being of my generation, I said: ‘What’s a podcast?’” she laughs. She agreed. Thus was born an unlikely phenomenon: Mary Robinson, comedian. The former president co-hosts the podcast Mothers of Invention with Maeve Higgins, an Irish comedian based in New York. They banter while discussing climate change and interviewing guests. “People listen through Maeve, through her questions. It’s making it much more real. There’s no doubt that Maeve is drawing me to the dark side. I’m getting funnier because of that.” Higgins does the comedic heavy lifting, riffing and throwing out lines while Robinson plays the straight foil. “I’ve learned that young people now in the United States get their politics from comical programmes,” says Robinson. She alludes to The Daily Show, but mixes up Jon Stewart with Jimmy Stewart and Trevor Noah with Trevor Nunn, which is actually pretty funny. Robinson considers comedy a sensible response to existential threat. “Laughter in a very serious discussion is much more persuasive than if we were all the time serious, serious, serious.” I consider asking her to tell a joke, but my nerve fails; back to business. “We have 11 years to change course and it has to be done with a seriousness of purpose, particularly by governments, because they determine the rules.” Preparations for a conference in Poland in December to ensure implementation of the Paris agreement are not going well, she says: “There’s a lot of arguing around what needs to be done.” She hopes the IPCC report will focus minds. “Future governments won’t be able to do what governments now have 11 years to do. In the future, we will have these tipping points – the Arctic will be gone, the coral reefs will be gone, the permafrost will be dissolving ... all these things will just spin us out of control.” Governments need to end fossil fuel subsidies and increase tax on carbon, she says. “Put a real price on carbon and do it now. These are the levers that move things quickly and get the investment into clean energy. If governments are not capable of being more serious, then they lack moral leadership, which is what we really need now.” Leaving aside the rest of the world, the country outside Robinson’s door challenges her optimism. When Irish civil society marches these days, it is for housing, not climate change. The government hinted that it would increase carbon tax in this week’s budget, but it did not. Climate change has barely registered in the presidential election. Robinson seems unabashed. “In my experience, human rights has always been a struggle. We don’t always keep going forward; there are setbacks and then you dig deeper. You get the prisoner-of-hope mentality and you fight harder.” Climate Justice: Hope, Resilience and the Fight for a Sustainable Future is out now (Bloomsbury, £16.99).

"A maritime climate with wind, sun and waves and an island surrounded by shallow seas with a high tidal range makes the UK probably the best-placed country in the world to take advantage of renewable energy. Britain is already a world leader in offshore wind but has been reluctant to invest in other promising technologies. Underwater sea turbines in particular, wave power and various forms of tidal barrage have failed to be given the political support needed to get them into the mainstream.  In some cases the government is actively discouraging renewables – the onshore wind industry and now solar power. Instead, taxpayer’s money and executive powers are being used to back nuclear power and fracking for gas. With scientists warning that we only have a 12-year window to save the planet from exceeding a dangerous 1.5C increase in temperature neither of these technologies is going to help avoid that threat. There is still time to make a significant contribution to reducing carbon emissions because the renewables that most suit our climate have already been developed and can be installed rapidly. These, plus new battery technology and multiple novel ways of balancing supply and demand including biogas and hydrogen production, make this energy revolution possible. All that is needed is political will. "
"One of the world’s leading climate scientists has launched a scathing attack on the government’s fracking programme, accusing ministers of aping Donald Trump and ignoring scientific evidence. James Hansen, who is known as the father of climate science, warned that future generations would judge the decision to back a UK fracking industry harshly.  “So the UK joins Trump, ignores science… full throttle ahead with the worst fossil fuels,” Hansen told the Observer. “The science is crystal clear, we need to phase out fossil fuels starting with the most damaging, the ‘unconventional’ fossil fuels such as tar sands and ‘fracking’.” Hansen has also written to the UK energy minister, Claire Perry, to underline his objections, warning that the decision was a serious policy error that would contribute to “climate breakdown”. His intervention came as the first fracking operation in England for seven years – which had been due to get under way on Saturday in Lancashire – was postponed until Monday because of bad weather. It also followed the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) report last week that warned the world has only 12 years left to avoid catastrophic climate change, calling on governments to take radical and far-reaching measures to decarbonise their economies. Last week it emerged that Perry was considering relaxing rules on the earthquake limits on fracking, making it easier for companies to push ahead at sites in England. But in his letter Hansen warned that young people could inherit an environment “out of their control” if fracking was pursued. “If the UK were to join the US by developing gas fields at this point in time it will lock in the methane problem for decades,” he wrote, adding that fracking would fatally undermine the UK’s attempt to fulfil its climate obligations. “The fossil fuel companies are well aware methane is a potent greenhouse gas, and yet they seem willing to continue on a path which can have disastrous consequences for our grandchildren,” Hansen said. The Conservative party’s fracking programme – which aims to release fossil fuel gas from wells at sites across England – has been dogged by criticism from environmentalists as well as fierce local opposition. There is a moratorium on the practice in Scotland and Wales. Last month three environmental activists were jailed for their part in a direct action campaign at the Preston New Road fracking site near Blackpool in Lancashire. The Campaign to Protect Rural England (CPRE), which obtained a copy of Hansen’s letter, said it was “imperative that the government heeds the advice, concerns and warnings of leading scientists over fracking”. “The severity of the warnings from the IPCC report underline why fracking is a dead duck,” said Tom Fyans, director of campaigns and policy at the CPRE. “We must speed up the transition to renewable energy – we have absolutely no time to mess around introducing a new carbon-emitting fossil fuel industry.” The Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy defended its support of the controversial energy source. “Shale gas has the potential to be a new domestic energy source, enhancing our energy security and delivering economic benefits, including the creation of well-paid, quality jobs,” it said in a statement, adding it would respond to Hansen’s letter “in due course”. It pointed out that the UK’s Committee on Climate Change “recognises that natural gas can help the UK meet its 2050 carbon emissions reduction target” and that since 1990 the UK has “cut emissions by more than 40% while growing our economy by more than two thirds; a feat unmatched by other G7 countries”. However there is growing disquiet in Tory ranks about the government’s fracking plans. Almost two dozen Conservative MPs are reported to be opposed to fracking and willing to “destroy the government’s majority” if ministers seek to push proposals to relax rules through parliament. Fyans said it was essential that the government listen to the “views and concerns of communities who will see their local environment industrialised” if fracking goes ahead. “The current proposals to fast-track fracking through the planning system, which the government are consulting on, will take local people’s voices out of the discussion,” he said. “Whether or not you agree with fracking, it is a fundamental democratic right for people to be able to voice their concerns – we cannot deny communities this opportunity.” The pressure is also building from the scientific community. The IPCC report called on governments to take radical action to decarbonise their economies. And in his letter Hansen warned that any politicians or officials who push ahead with fracking would bear “disproportionate responsibility” for the consequences. “I urgently call upon politicians of any persuasion to reflect on the peer-reviewed scientific information that is readily available and which clearly points to the need to rapidly phase down fossil emissions,” he wrote. “A task made much more difficult and probably implausible if the world exacerbates the problem by expanding fossil fuel emissions via fracking technology.”"
"Major climate science reports usually pass by largely unnoticed, but in the wake of the latest IPCC report a number of journalists laudably grilled Republican lawmakers about its findings. While their responses were predictably terrible, it’s nevertheless crucial for journalists to hold GOP politicians accountable for their climate denial and policy inaction. Donald Trump’s answers were particularly ignorant and nonsensical in his 60 Minutes interview with Lesley Stahl.  None of the Republicans exhibited Stage 1 climate denial (denying that it’s happening), but several remain in Stage 2 (denying humans are responsible). Trump was the worst of the lot, telling Stahl: Something’s happening [with the climate] and it’ll change back again … I don’t know that it’s manmade. Earth’s climate isn’t magical. Each of its changes has physical causes and will only “change back” if something causes them to do so. Trump’s claim is akin to arguing that if he gains 50 lbs by eating McDonald’s fast food every day he’ll eventually ‘change back’ to his less obese self. Doing so would require a physical cause, like a change in diet. Fossil fuels are the climate’s greasy fast food. Similarly, Trump’s top economic advisor Larry Kudlow said to George Stephanopoulos on ABC’s This Week: how much of [climate change] is manmade, how much of it is solar, how much of it is oceanic, how much of it is rain forest and other issues? I think we’re still exploring all of that. And Senator Marco Rubio (R-FL) told CNN’s Jake Tapper: I can’t tell you to what percentage of [climate change] is due to human activity Climate scientists can. It’s 100% since 1950. For @marcorubio @jaketapper and anyone else, it’s a good thing that scientists have indeed already looked at how much recent trends in climate are due to human activity. https://t.co/h5xLrvY41O[narrator: it was all of it] This is settled science, about which there’s a 97% expert consensus. But of course, Republican politicians prefer the beliefs of the less than 3% of contrarian climate scientists. When Stahl pressed Trump on the conclusions of expert climate scientists, Trump cited some “scientists” whose opinions he prefers. We have scientists that disagree with [human-caused global warming] … You’d have to show me the [mainstream] scientists because they have a very big political agenda The only ‘political agenda’ of the climate scientists writing the IPCC reports is to accurately communicate our understanding of climate science to policymakers. The latest IPCC report cited over 6,000 scientific studies. Marco Rubio used the same tactic as Trump, saying: And I think many scientists would debate what percentage is attributable to man versus normal fluctuations Trump’s Fox friends also echoed this sentiment: Kilmeade on Stahl’s climate change question: “She really believes in global warming, and that’s fine,” but “I don't think you should bring your point of view” in b/c “there’s other scientists” and “the role of man has not been unveiled to a way in which the president accepts.” pic.twitter.com/gVzajMwIpb There are of course “other scientists.” The question is why we should believe the tiny minority of contrarians are right and the 97% of climate science experts who are convinced by the evidence that humans are driving global warming are wrong. For example, one of deniers’ favorite contrarian scientists is Richard Lindzen, formerly of MIT. Last week, Lindzen told the Daily Mail “Warming of any significance ceased about 20 years ago.” That’s Stage 1 climate denial and a ludicrously wrong assertion: Richard Lindzen tells @DailyMailAU, ""Warming of any significance ceased about 20 years ago"" https://t.co/XkVKFAVtqKReality tells a very different story: pic.twitter.com/HwR48KROE6 So yes, there are scientists who disagree with the magnitude of the human contribution to global warming. And those scientists often deny even the most basic facts and data. They’re the fringe who reject the vast majority of the available scientific evidence. After denying that we know humans are driving climate change, the Republican politicians shifted to economics denial, with Trump again the worst of all: I don’t want to give trillions and trillions of dollars. I don’t want to lose millions and millions of jobs. I don’t want to be put at a disadvantage. Rubio similarly said “I’m also not going to destroy our economy.” But Trump and Rubio seem to think that any efforts to cut carbon pollution will destroy the economy, and that’s just willful ignorance. As Senator Mike Rounds (R-SD) said: We ought to be talking about the things that we can do and still maintain a strong economy, because we’re not going to be able to address it unless we keep a strong economy Rounds is right. Republicans ought to be looking for policies to address climate change that will maintain a strong economy. But with a few exceptions, they (including Mike Rounds, who’s voted against the climate 100% of the time) are not. Kudlow noted: Bill Nordhaus from Yale got a Nobel Prize on his own economic work with respect to climate change … I respect that he’s a really brilliant guy. In 2012, Nordhaus wrote an editorial entitled, “Why the Global Warming Skeptics Are Wrong.” In that piece, he noted: the cost of waiting fifty years to begin reducing CO2 emissions … is $4.1 trillion … Current economic studies also suggest that the most efficient policy is to raise the cost of CO2 emissions substantially, either through cap-and-trade or carbon taxes … The claim that cap-and-trade legislation or carbon taxes would be ruinous or disastrous to our societies does not stand up to serious economic analysis. It’s ironic that Trump says he’s worried about losing trillions of dollars as the economist who his top economic advisor cites as a brilliant expert says that waiting to cut carbon pollution would cost trillions of dollars. The latest IPCC report cited a study finding that 1.5°C global warming would lead to climate damage costs of $54tn, 2°C of $69tn, and 3.7°C of $551tn. We’re currently on track for 3.4°C warming by 2100, and the Trump administration is doing everything in its power to increase carbon pollution and global warming. For perspective, the $551tn estimated cost of climate damages at 3.7°C far exceeds the current global wealth of around $100tn. On the other hand, climate policies need not be expensive. Studies have shown that a revenue-neutral carbon tax could grow the economy and create jobs, for example. And as California has demonstrated, smart climate policies are entirely compatible with economic growth. George Stephanopoulos also asked Senator Jeff Flake (R-AZ) if Republicans are going the wrong direction on climate change. Flake responded: I think so … but there are things that we can do and should do and I think Republicans need to be at the forefront if we want to keep our place and keep our seats While Flake is right, his climate voting record is almost as bad as Mike Rounds’ and on par with Marco Rubio’s. They all voted to confirm Scott Pruitt to head the EPA, tried to block the Clean Power Plan, voted against establishing a climate change education grant program in American schools, and voted against an amendment acknowledging that climate change is real and that man-made pollution is a significant contributor. Flake is notorious for sounding reasonable and then refusing to use his considerable power to act on those reasonable comments. He’s all talk and no action. But he’s right that if the GOP remains the stupid party of climate denial, it will suffer long-term electoral consequences. Marco Rubio tried to sound like a reasonable voice on climate change despite his science denial by pointing to legislation he’s helped advance on sea level rise adaptation. But as renowned glaciologist Lonnie Thompson put it, “the only question is how much we will mitigate, adapt, and suffer.” We certainly will have to adapt to and suffer some serious climate change consequences, but the more we mitigate the problem up front by cutting carbon pollution, the less we’ll need to adapt and suffer. Today’s GOP has gone all in on maximizing climate suffering."
"Incentives for consumers to buy hybrid and electric cars rather than diesel or petrol alternatives have been slashed by the government, adding thousands of pounds to the price of a new low-emission vehicle. Car manufacturers said the decision was an “astounding” move. It comes only three months after the transport secretary, Chris Grayling, published a Road to Zero strategy to curb vehicle emissions by promoting greener cars and three days after the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change called for an urgent switch to electric vehicles. The plug-in car grant, which since 2011 has knocked £4,500 off the purchase price of a brand new electric vehicle, will be cut in early November by £1,000, while incentives of £2,500 to buy new hybrid cars will be abolished altogether. The Department for Transport (DfT) has not confirmed how long the grant for electric vehicles will be available but says it will support the purchase of 35,000 zero-emission cars, likely to run early into the next decade. More than 160,000 new cars have been eligible for the grant since its inception, of which around 100,000 were hybrids, a total subsidy to date of around £600m. The DfT said that because plug-in hybrid models, such as the the Mitsubishi Outlander, were now established and popular among consumers, it was focusing its attention on zero emission models such as the Nissan Leaf and BMW i3. Hydrogen fuel cell cars will also remain eligible. To qualify, vehicles must have CO2 emissions of less than 50g/km and be able to travel at least 112 km (70 miles) without any CO2 exhaust emissions. Mike Hawes, the chief executive of the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT), said: “We understand the pressure on the public purse but, given the importance of environmental goals, it’s astounding that just three months after publishing its road to zero strategy, the government has reduced the incentive that gives consumers most encouragement to invest in ultra-low emission vehicles. “Removing the grant for plug-in hybrids is totally at odds with already challenging ambitions for CO2 reduction and sends yet more confusing signals to car buyers.” Hawes said manufacturers had invested billions in new technologies but plug-in hybrids remained less than 2% of overall sales and warned that removing upfront purchase grants could have “a devastating impact on demand”. Car dealers said the decision risked undermining progress in the low-emission sector. Sue Robinson, the director of the National Franchised Dealers Association, said it was “extremely disappointing”. The AA said its research showed the vast majority of drivers cited the purchase price as the main obstacle to owning an ultra-low emission vehicle. Jack Cousens, the AA’s head of roads policy, said: “The government wants to end the sale of petrol and diesel cars but scrapping grants for low-emission cars may well stall their progress.” Any rush by consumers to buy while the grants are still available at the current rates could result in the 9 November deadline being brought forward, the DfT said. Darren Shirley, the chief executive of Campaign for Better Transport, said it was “the wrong signal for the government to send”. He added: “Plans to ban petrol and diesel cars are an important step towards cleaner air but electric vehicles play a vital role and help is needed in making them more affordable in the short term.” Around 35,000 Outlanders are now on UK roads, the most popular model of hybrid to have benefited from the grant until now. More than 40,000 cars so far this year have qualified for the grant, up 23% from last year, according to SMMT figures. Just over a quarter of those are pure electric vehicles, which will remain eligible for the reduced funding. The DfT said it would also establish a £2m fund to subsidise new e-cargo bikes, offering up to £5,000 for businesses who replace older, polluting vans with the zero-emission cycles."
"Donald Trump sat down for a wide-ranging interview with 60 Minutes, in which he was pushed on China, Russia, climate change, his mockery of Christine Blasey Ford, and whether, as he came toward the end of his second year in office, he had any regrets. Here are eight key takeaways: Interviewer Lesley Stahl began by talking about the recent season of hurricanes, including Hurricane Michael, which devastated Florida last week, claiming at least 19 lives. She asked Trump whether he still thinks climate change was a hoax and while he said he did not think climate change was a hoax, he also told her that did not think it was man-made, or would have permanent impacts. “I think something’s happening. Something’s changing and it’ll change back again. I don’t think it’s a hoax, I think there’s probably a difference. But I don’t know that it’s man-made,” said Trump. Trump also accused scientists who say hurricanes are getting more frequent and intense because of climate change of having “a very big political agenda”. Asked about Jamal Khashoggi, Trump said that if the attack was found to be a state-sponsored murder, there would be “severe punishment” for those involved, saying there is “something really terrible and disgusting” about murdering a reporter – a view Trump himself said people might be surprised to hear from him. But, when asked whether he would consider stopping sales of weapons to Saudi Arabia, Trump seemed unwilling. “I tell you what I don’t want to do. Boeing, Lockheed, Raytheon, all these com(panies) – I don’t want to hurt jobs. I don’t want to lose an order like that. There are other ways of punishing.” Trump was repeatedly and expressly asked whether he would reinstate the policy of separating immigrant parents and children at the US-Mexico border, but would not give a straight answer, saying “we’re looking at a lot of things.” When pushed, Trump said: “You can’t say yes or no. What I can say is this: There are consequences from coming into a country, namely our country, illegally.” I will be interviewed on “60 Minutes” tonight at 7:00 P.M., after NFL game. Enjoy! Stahl brought up Trump’s now infamous speech at a political rally in Mississippi in which he mimicked Christine Blasey Ford, the woman who testified before the Senate judiciary committee that Brett Kavanaugh attempted to rape her when they were both teenagers. Trump said if he had not made that speech, “we would not have won” and defended Kavanaugh as an “extraordinary” man. “Why did you have to make fun of her?” asked Stahl. “I didn’t really make fun of her,” Trump replied, adding he thought Ford had been treated “with great respect” despite the fact “there are those that think she shouldn’t have”. Trump said he suspects his defense secretary, General Jim Mattis, might be a Democrat and “could be” heading for the exit. Responding to a question about whether Matthis was going to leave, Trump said: “It could be that he is. I think he’s sort of a Democrat, if you want to know the truth. But General Mattis is a good guy. We get along very well. He may leave. I mean, at some point, everybody leaves. Everybody. People leave. That’s Washington.” Trump said that while he thinks he has a “great cabinet” there are some people he’s not happy with. He agreed with comments made by his wife Melania in a ABC interview last week, that there are some people in the White House who weren’t trustworthy, saying: “I’m not a baby. It’s a tough business. This is a vicious place.” Trump reiterated his standard foreign policy views: China is bad, the EU treats the US like chumps, Trump will stick with Nato as long as other countries pay more towards it, Russia might have meddled in the US election but they’re not that bad, and he has “great chemistry” with North Korean leader Kim Jong-un. Trump accepted that Vladimir Putin was “probably” involved in assassinations and poisonings. As for Russian meddling in the 2016 presidential election, Trump said he believed they meddled, but China meddled, too. “And I think, frankly, China is a bigger problem,” said the president. The tone of the interview was often tense, with Trump telling Stahl at one point “I’m president and you’re not”. While Trump was not as openly hostile to Stahl as he has been to some other journalists, he rarely let her get out a full question, before jumping in to begin his answer or contradict her, meaning the transcript makes for fairly choppy reading. Finally, the president revealed his capacity for self-reflection and humility when Stahl asked him if there was anything he wished he hadn’t said or done in his almost two years in office. One regret sprang quickly to mind: the press’s treatment of him. “So when I won the presidency – the press treats me terribly – I thought very strongly that, you know, the one great thing will happen is the press will start treating me great. Lesley, they treat me worse. They got worse instead of better. Very dishonest.” Stahl pressed: but is there anything you regret? “I regret that the press treats me so badly,” he said."
"Opening in the week the UN has made dire warnings about climate change, Clare Duffy’s two-hander about an ecowarrior and her conservative mother could hardly be more timely. It pits Neshla Caplan, as a young activist preparing to join a Greenpeace-style protest at an Arctic Circle oil rig, against Jennifer Black as her head-in-the-sand mother, who would sooner her daughter put the safety of her family before that of the planet. For all its topicality, however, Arctic Oil skirts around the issues before being diverted into a schmaltzy generation-gap drama. Every playwright needs a reason to keep their characters on stage and Duffy’s solution is unambiguous: the older woman lures her daughter into the bathroom, locks the door and swallows the key. It’s only the first of a sequence of events which, however unlikely, have the merit of keeping the two women in the same place, the better to vent their pent-up frustration and explain their political perspectives.  On a northerly island made wealthy by oil-company investment, one woman’s idealism and campaigning zeal is set against the other’s history of compromise. The conflict is in their maternal instincts: one to nurture the environment, the other to nurture her family. For all the vigour of the performances in Gareth Nicholls’s carefully modulated production, the 75-minute play relies too much on withheld information, retrospective arguments and the settling of old scores; too little on the fertile debate about whether to be passive or active in the face of global catastrophe. After a sequence of melodramatic twists, it makes the sentimental bonding of mother and daughter seem more important than the destruction of the planet. At the Traverse, Edinburgh, until 20 October."
"Rebecca Solnit’s article (Don’t despair: history shows we can still save the planet, 15 October) is another version of “Please someone else sort this out!” The hope on offer is that groups as yet unformed will emerge to save us from global catastrophe. Today’s green organisations and political parties don’t have any answers. If they did, they would tell us all what to do. Neither do governments or big business. Why? Because they are only responding to our demands for cheap goods, easy living and endless economic growth in the rich countries of the world.  Only we the people can prevent catastrophic climate change in our lifetimes. Here are seven things that we can do now: 1. Never buy anything new until the old one breaks, including clothes. You’ll reduce demand for materials, their transportation around the planet and the pollution when they go to landfill. 2. Get rid of your dishwasher – it wastes energy and water. 3. Dig up the pavers and plant a garden. You’ll help prevent flooding. 4. If you live in a city, why do you need a car? Get the bus, cycle or walk. Hire a car to go on holiday. 5. Turn off the lights at bedtime. 6. Buy local produce; cut down food miles. 7. Persuade your neighbours to do the same. Opinion pieces don’t help if they don’t offer practical solutions.Jo SterankaClacton-on-Sea, Essex • Rebecca Solnit is right to be optimistic about the future even if it won’t be easy to reduce our dependency on fossil fuels. Wind and solar plant can now generate cheaper electricity than coal or gas, if only because wind and sunlight are free. Furthermore, as the cost of battery storage falls, renewable energy will become increasingly competitive to the extent that those, like Donald Trump, who try to support hydrocarbon technology will actually handicap their own economies and make them less competitive in future. Rolling out renewable energy capacity is not just about protecting the environment but also about running a successful economy in the 21st century.Liam O’KeeffeAbinger Hammer, Surrey • The battle between public broadcasting and news and entertainment provided by organisations using cloud-based technologies is not only commercial (Update law to keep us top of TV listings, say public broadcasters, 15 October). And it is not only culture and democracy at stake here. The cloud is a euphemism for lots of Earth-based energy-hungry servers, and streaming accounts for a big fraction of internet traffic already. In the light of climate scientists’ ever more urgent calls for drastic reductions in dangerous emissions, champions of public service broadcasting should add its modest call on future precious electricity to its case.Sara ParkinSustainability Literacy Project • It is “great, so very great” that after three of the most damaging hurricanes in US history, President Trump is at least acknowledging that climate change is probably a “real thing”, if not yet believing it is manmade (Trump says climate change is no hoax, but claims ‘it will change back again’, 16 October). Yet he goes on to berate climate scientists for “having a political agenda”. If only as many politicians had a scientific agenda, we might actually be able to get something useful done.Andrew TinsleyHenley-on-Thames, Oxfordshire  • Your profile of the Institution of Engineering and Technology’s report on the urgent need to retrofit thousands of homes to meet the Uk’s climate targets highlights the government’s failures (UK’s housing stock ‘needs massive retrofit to meet climate targets’, 11 October). However, putting the focus on retrofitting social housing is misguided. As our recent report on poor condition housing in the north shows, the highest level of non-decent poorly insulated homes is in the private sector - mostly among older homeowners. The social housing stock is in a much better state than the private rented or owner-occupied homes.Paul HackettDirector, the Smith Institute • Join the debate – email guardian.letters@theguardian.com • Read more Guardian letters – click here to visit gu.com/letters • Do you have a photo you’d like to share with Guardian readers?

"Hundreds of millions of pounds must be spent on the UK’s draughty housing stock to meet the government’s climate change targets, with progress so far too slow to make the difference needed. Repairing existing homes to a high standard, with insulation and renewable energy technology, would cut consumer bills and bring health improvements, a new report shows.  Domestic housing accounts for about a fifth of the UK’s greenhouse gas emissions, mostly from heating and hot water. But attempts to bring these down have largely failed, prompting renewed calls from experts for a national programme of home improvement that would make dwellings low-carbon for the next 30 years. New research by the Institution of Engineering and Technology and Nottingham Trent University has found that meeting government targets of 80% cuts in greenhouse gas emissions by mid-century would require sweeping policy change. “A national programme for a one-off deep retrofit [of all residential property] is needed,” said Marjan Sarshar, professor of sustainability and the built environment at Nottingham Trent University. “Costs will come down as we build up the supply chain capacity.” The report’s authors suggest starting with social housing, which makes up about 4.5m homes. By engaging a whole locality at a time, the costs can be brought down and retrofit schemes carried out more efficiently. It can cost about £17,000 to retrofit a standard house. The benefits go beyond emissions savings, also including lower energy bills, warmer homes and a much-decreased burden on the NHS, which currently spends about £1.4bn a year treating conditions that arise from poor housing. Costs for ongoing maintenance, amounting to £5.2bn a year for social housing alone, would also be drastically cut or eliminated by a one-off “deep retrofit” for most residential buildings. Social housing tenants spend £4.2bn a year on energy, a big chunk of most household budgets, which would also be much reduced if their homes were insulated and fitted with renewables such as solar panels. Insulation for roofs and walls, new windows and doors, small-scale renewable energy such as solar panels or district heating systems, are the basic techniques. But instead of deploying them piecemeal, as in the past, the government should start a system of “deep retrofits”, by which each dwelling would receive a one-off refurbishment covering all the needed improvements and make the homes fit for the next 30 years at least, the report found. The technology, materials and skills needed for these deep retrofits are all available and well understood, but the UK’s failure to put them into practice has prevented the development of a large industry carrying out such work. Successive government attempts to solve the problem have run into problems and been abandoned. The Green Deal, for instance, which supplied loans and grants to people to have insulation installed, was scrapped after only a few years and has not been replaced. Public perception of the value of insulation took a blow when the Grenfell fire, in which 72 people died, exposed the risks from flammable cladding on tower blocks. However, high-quality cladding and other retrofit technologies should be a priority, and a public information campaign to engage householders could allay people’s concerns, the experts said. “We need to reassure people that there are safe solutions,” said Richard Miller, director of Miller-Klein Associates and a lead author of the report. “There is a job to be done.” Retrofitting a typical house can take several weeks, but the residents can remain living there throughout. Many people are reluctant to take on the inconvenience and cost of such building work but the government could offer incentives and subsidies, which along with the savings on energy bills could make the proposition more attractive. The report’s authors also called for cities to get involved by setting up programmes to retrofit properties street by street. The barriers to retrofitting at present were found to be a lack of customer demand, because the energy savings were not enough to tempt people to do the work; lack of government policy; high costs because of the lack of demand; and the difficulty for households of gaining the initial finance needed to embark on the work. Houses built now, even if they are constructed to a high standard, will make up only a fifth of the housing stock by 2050, the experts found, so retrofitting existing buildings must be the priority."
"Since we launched this series six months ago, we’ve been inundated with questions from readers about what can be done to address ever-increasing population growth around the globe. The world’s population is on track to hit 8bn in 2023, and almost 10bn by 2050 – all of which means an increasing strain on resources, and more destruction of our natural environment.  The urgency was emphasised this week when a landmark UN report indicated that we have little more than a decade to take decisive action to confront global warming. As ever, there are crumbs of comfort. In climate news, a Berlin startup has offered €1m (£870,000) to save the ancient Hambach forest from coal mining – and they are not the only tree huggers we have met this week. In southern Africa, Nicola Davis reported on how effective family planning services and contraceptive education has caused a country with one of the highest fertility rates in the world to decisively reverse the trend. Of course, not everywhere is overpopulated. Some states still feel they need all the people they can get. In Guinea-Bissau, Ruth Maclean found there is no panic about population growth – in fact, there is room for more people to be welcomed. About 7,000 refugees are due to become newly minted citizens. For those refugees still stranded in European camps, such as on Lesbos, the upside can seem pretty much non-existent. But Lorenzo Tondo has found a heartwarming story in the shape of an Iraqi-Danish man, Salam Aldeen, who has built a playground for 3,000 children stranded there.

"Known for their distinctive long horns, the Ankole cattle of western Uganda have evolved over millennia to withstand their harsh environment, with its lengthy dry spells and abundance of local maladies such as trypanosomiasis, a disease spread by the tsetse fly. But after flourishing for almost 10,000 years, the Ankole have begun to rapidly disappear. Farmland is dwindling in Uganda due to the expanding human population, and Ankole require vast areas to graze. Local herders have responded to the pressure by replacing them, cross-breeding Ankole cattle with industrial species such as the European Holstein. But while these hybrids gain favourable genetic traits from the Holstein, producing more milk and meat, and requiring less land to keep, there is a hidden cost.  The genetic adaptations which enabled the Ankole to survive in such a harsh climate are diluted in the new hybrids, which lack the immune capabilities to resist local diseases. Instead of reaping profits, the herders now spend much of their money on antibiotics and pesticides to keep the animals healthy. In Burkina Faso, farmers who made similar decisions in recent years have lost almost all of their livestock to disease. But this problem isn’t restricted to impoverished African nations. Across the UK and much of the rest of the world, the cattle farming industry is facing increasing challenges due to environmental pressures as well as the consequences of genetic selection programmes aimed at increasing income. Research has shown that between 2000 and 2014, nearly 100 native livestock breeds worldwide became extinct, as farmers attempted to boost falling profit margins by either cross-breeding or replacing them altogether with a small handful of industrial breeds. “If we don’t do anything to change this, it could spell long-term disaster for the farming industry particularly in the context of climate change,” says Catarina Ginja, a researcher in biodiversity and genetic resources at the University of Porto’s Cibio-InBio laboratory. “The industrial breeds may not be capable of resisting new disease epidemics, which could arise as the climate warms over the next century. “We already had some alarming examples of how vulnerable these breeds can be to a deadly pandemic in the recent past, for example the mad cow disease outbreak in the 1990s, although that was unrelated to climate change. It’s a serious concern.” The reason why industrial breeds are particularly vulnerable to new bacterial or viral infections is because they have very little genetic diversity compared with local breeds, due to decades of inbreeding. Ginja estimates that for breeds like the Holstein, millions of these cows originate from a mere handful of bulls. Over the past 15 years, this has been exacerbated by the advent of genomic sequencing. Breeders can now specifically select cattle with combinations of genes that are known to optimise milk and meat production, and because these are the only animals in the herd that are allowed to mate, over time the entire population becomes descended from a few individuals. This year scientists from the Netherlands published a study showing that genetic diversity in Dutch cattle populations has dropped alarmingly over the past three decades due to such breeding programmes. But because breeders are solely prioritising genes which improve milk and meat yields, any unusual genes which may have offered immune protection against infections become lost. In addition, inherited disorders caused by a single mutation are far more common, as all the animals are effectively related. A common problem for Holstein cattle breeders is Bovine leukocyte adhesion deficiency (Blad) which can spread from one individual bull. Cattle with Blad are prone to recurrent infections and heal very slowly. “Breeders want to produce more and more, and they now know what genetic traits to favour in the population, in order to increase meat or milk production,” says Stéphane Joost, a researcher at École polytechnique fédérale de Lausanne, who chaired a recent European research project on the future of farm animal genetic resources. “But it’s like capitalism in general. They become too extreme. The key is recognising there are limits which are not to be passed.” Breeders are aware of these potential problems, but they try to compensate for it in different ways, rather than changing their overall strategy. “They try to negate any health problems that emerge by giving specific vitamins and drugs to the animals,” Joost says. “And if it’s too expensive to cure them from a particular disease, they let them die. They also buy frozen semen from different banks across Europe, which contains the original genetic material of the species, and inject that into females in the herd at regular intervals to try to maintain the genetic diversity at a certain level.” However, buying semen and drugs is expensive. This means that keeping cattle farming economically viable is a very fine balance. As an example, one study last year showed that while the volume of milk produced by European dairy farms had increased in recent years, profit margins had fallen as production costs - ranging from labour resources to cattle feed – were rising far faster than milk prices. The study showed that in 2013, dairy farms in Slovakia were actually losing €165 per tonne of milk produced. As a result of this, any unforeseen events can cause major problems. Joost points out that this year’s abnormally hot European summer has caused considerable problems for cattle farmers across the continent. They have been forced to spend heavily on air conditioning units to regulate the temperature and humidity for their herds. “Because they’re not very adaptable, they can’t handle consistently high temperatures,” he says. “Unless their environment is artificially cooled, their stress levels rise, they start to weaken, their metabolism slows down, the combinations of different hormones begin to change, and they become less productive. But the artificial cooling also costs a lot.” As the effects of human-induced climate change take hold over the next century and temperatures rise, some scientists fear that the cattle farming industry could be heading for disaster, unless steps are taken to improve the genetic diversity of these animals. “Most of the world will face increasing aridification, and droughts,” says Professor Mike Bruford, a molecular ecologist at Cardiff University who co-ordinates the ClimGen project, an initiative looking into ways to increase the resilience of livestock to climate change. “The current industrial breeding programmes may not be sustainable as temperatures and the amount of forage available change.” But at the same time, going back to solely using local breeds simply isn’t a sustainable option for many farming businesses. The economic returns are not viable, and the carbon footprint from rearing them is extremely high due to the large amounts of land they need. An advantage of breeds like the Holstein is that they require relatively little space. “The carbon budget of cattle production is already enormous,” Bruford says. “This is because of the amount of land being occupied for forage rather than absorbing carbon, as well as the infrastructure needed to produce beef and milk. From a carbon perspective, the most environmentally friendly way to farm cattle is intensively with industrial breeds.” However, scientists believe that the same genomic sequencing tools which have accelerated the inbreeding crisis in industrial cattle, could actually solve some of the problems that farmers are likely to face on a warming planet. These tools are increasingly able to be used to identify other important traits, for example combinations of genes relating to heat tolerance and the immune system. This could help industrial breeds deal more rapidly with environmental change, as well as produce sufficient milk and meat. “These traits can be conserved and prioritised in these animals in parallel with the genetic traits relating to milk and meat production,” Joost says. However, Bruford points out that implementing these strategies will take careful planning and may need to be regulated by national authorities to ensure that the cattle farming industry survives in the long-term. “Farming is a private enterprise, people are there to make money as well as provide food so this kind of genetic selection in cattle breeding needs to be very carefully co-ordinated going forwards,” Bruford says. “Farmers need guidance from the government. For too long, we’ve let them get on with it and haven’t provided adequate support. If you don’t have a strategy, then you’re left with cattle that are productive but aren’t well adapted to their landscape, and that’s when problems arise.”"
"Floridians are staring down a very powerful Category 4 typhoon that is causing extensive damage. The high winds, heavy rains, and storm surge will cost billions of dollars. We know that climate change is making these storms stronger. The storms feed off of warm ocean waters, and those waters are much warmer now because of climate change. I have written about the science in more detail here and here. But basically, Michael strengthened because it passed over really warm waters. Waters that were hotter because of human-caused warming.  Predictably, the hurricane strengthened as it hit shore. As I write this, Michael is coming ashore and the pressure is still falling (low pressures in a hurricane signify a stronger storm). It appears that Michael may have the third-lowest pressure for a hurricane hitting the USA. It is a wonder that a state like Florida, which will get pummeled by Michael, could vote for someone that denies climate change. Think of how backwards the situation is – the Florida Department of Environmental Protection has reportedly been banned from using the terms “climate change” and “global warming”. This policy reportedly went into effect when Florida elected a science denier, Rick Scott, to governor. Rick Scott has been condemned by people in Florida for his backward stance. It is climate denial like his that has contributed to the suffering of residents in the state. It’s not that my colleagues haven’t tried to help Governor Scott understand how his policies hurt his state. A few years ago, scientists met with him and urged him to take climate change seriously. He remained silent. It isn’t that the local media hasn’t tried. Major newspapers have called upon Rick Scott to take action on climate change. But to little avail. Maybe it’s because Rick Scott invests in companies that oppose climate change regulations? It isn’t that his political opponents haven’t tried. Recently, Florida Democrats petitioned Rick Scott to acknowledge climate change. Fortunately, while Rick Scott is now running for Senate, he’s being challenged by Democrat Bill Nelson. He understands science and believes in facts. Nelson writes, Climate change is real, and we must take action to protect ourselves. Denial of this scientific reality is simply not an option, especially in Florida. Rick Scott isn’t the only politician from the state of Florida to reject science and diminish climate change. Senator Marco Rubio has as well. Florida voters could put an end to this nonsense. In the current race for state Governor to succeed Scott, Republican candidate Ron DeSantis is ignoring science. He recently claimed that climate change is not an issue for states to mitigate. Say what? Let’s hope Ron DeSantis loses. His opponent is Andrew Gillum, who is clear as day when he says, Climate change is real, it is impacting Floridians directly, and we will not be silenced on the matter. When I’m Governor, we will not just talk about climate change -- we will put Floridians to work to make our state more energy independent and resilient and transform our state into the Solar Capital of the United States! But it’s not just Florida; there are other states getting hit by Hurricane Michael that are also led by climate deniers. For instance, Georgia will be hit by Hurricane Michael. One of the senators there, David Perdue, congratulated President Trump when he pulled out of the Paris Climate Accord. Georgia’s other Senator, Johnny Isakson also denies the science. He too supported President Trump’s reckless actions. At the congressional district level, the denial continues. Republican Representative Barry Loudermilk was pleased when President Trump walked away from the Paris Agreement. His opponent, Flynn Broady trusts and understands science, however. His position could not be any clearer as he writes, We have the technology and knowledge to develop and place into practice renewable energy sources, reduce carbon emissions, and move our energy needs away from carbon fuels. We owe it to the world to participate in the Paris Agreement and the Kyoto Protocol. As the leading industrial nation we must lead the effort. Climate deniers will try to say this article is gleeful about a hurricane. It is not. First of all, this hurricane and all hurricanes that hit land can cause death and destruction. I pray that people heed warnings and get out of the way. I hope people stay safe, regardless of their understanding of climate change and its effect on storms. Second, elections have consequences and if we as a society want to create a better world and reduce climate change, we have to vote for people who understand science, who believe in facts. Climate deniers are making these storms worse by stopping action on climate change. What the hell do we expect to happen when the deniers are writing the laws? Third, for those who say “taking action on climate is too expensive”, how about you add up the worldwide costs of climate inaction over the past decade. My response to you is, it’s too costly to do nothing. Fourth, what the hell happened to the Republican Party? The GOP formerly thought of itself as the party of intellectuals. How did you become a party where denying science is a litmus test? Where are the Republicans who actually understand climate change and care about it? If you can find one, tell me. Maybe I’ll even write about them on this site. Finally, climate change is only starting. It will continue to get worse and worse. And that means storms will get worse, droughts will get deeper, flooding more severe, and the costs will go up. What we are seeing now and what we’ve seen over the past decade is just a small taste to come of what the future will bring if we don’t take this problem seriously. Good luck Florida and Georgia. My thoughts are with you. See you on the other side."
"The late Prof Mick Moran, who taught politics and government at Manchester University for most of his professional life, had, according to his colleagues, once had “a certain residual respect for our governing elites”. That all changed during the 2008 financial crisis, after which he experienced an epiphany “because it convinced him that the officer class in business and in politics did not know what it was doing”. After his epiphany, Moran formed a collective of academics dedicated to exposing the complacency of finance-worship and to replacing it with an idea of running modern economies focused on maximising social good. They called themselves the Foundational Economy Collective, based on the idea that it’s in the everyday economy where there is most potential for true social regeneration: not top-down cash-splashing, but renewal and replenishment from the ground upwards.  Foundational activities are the materials and services without which we cannot live a civilised life: clean, unrationed water; affordable electricity and gas without cuts to supply; collective transport on smooth roads and rails; quality health and social care provided free at the point of use; and reliable, sustainable food supply. Then there’s the “overlooked economy” – everyday services such as hairdressing, veterinary care, catering and hospitality and small-scale manufacturing – which employ far more people, across a wider geographical range, than the “high-skill, hi-tech” economy with which recent governments have been obsessed. For the Foundational Economy authors, focusing on the fundamental value of invisible and unglamorous jobs “restores the importance of unappreciated and unacknowledged tacit skills of many citizens”. It’s a way of looking at economics from the point of view of people rather than figures, and doing something revolutionary (yet so blindingly obvious) in the process. What is the point of “growth” if the basic elements of a decent life are denied to a large and growing number? Because everybody has these everyday needs, their provision is not – or ought not to be – specific to one or a few regions, and is comparatively resistant to automation. If applied by government as a central plank of industrial strategy, prioritising the foundational economy could fundamentally transform people’s quality of life outside London and the south-east – which would be the direct opposite of the dire “northern powerhouse” template that has only created even more cynicism. Visions of an economy run for social good, rather than individual gain, are being developed by Labour through a series of regional workshops on the “new economics”. As the examples of Preston, Enfield and Oldham councils have shown, it hurts nobody to bring services back into local authority control and to divest from the outsourcing firms whose own definition of “growth”’ is extracting profit from social misery. Any future government will have to take this vision seriously. Take Jeremy Corbyn’s promise of “a million climate jobs” at last month’s Labour conference, which could be a conservative estimate for the task at hand. In 2012, Oxfam reported that 4.7m jobs could be supported and £280bn added to the economy if the government invested in retro-fitting the entire existing housing stock for lower energy consumption. (It could also save a total £8.7bn a year from our domestic fuel bills.) Our homes are the most expensive to heat in Europe, and the oldest, with more than 60% built before 1960. A change in thinking is urgently required to bring about a permanent and ongoing renewal of the foundations of a good society. This brings to mind a long-buried yet prescient quote by Raymond Williams. In his 1960 novel Border Country, he describes a character witnessing “a slow and shocking cancellation of the future” in the wake of the 1926 general strike. This quote has been leapt upon in recent years by a reinvigorated and youthful left. It’s as though, nearly 60 years later, we’ve woken up to the idea that a better future can be reinstated, but that we have to get it back ourselves. Restoring decent basic services for everyone, then keeping the bar high for everyone, is a task akin to painting and repainting the Forth Bridge, and this alone is enough to keep millions of people in stable, valuable work. For a future better than the one we’re dreading, we need to start rebuilding the foundations now.  • Lynsey Hanley is a freelance writer and the author of Estates: an Intimate History and Respectable: Crossing the Class Divide"

"On a recent overcast October afternoon, yet another section of West Cliff Drive, the premier seafront street in Santa Cruz, California, was roped off as workers toiled to prevent it from crumbling into the Pacific Ocean. The erosion gnawing away at this prized road, and the famed surfing beaches it overlooks, is emblematic of the relentless threat that climate change poses to California’s coastline. As the sea level rises and storms of growing strength smash into the coast, the golden sands and beach properties that have come to define the state are at risk.  “I think with every coastal road in California, you’re going have to think about relocating it,” said Gary Griggs, an earth sciences professor at the University of California, Santa Cruz. West Cliff Drive, which sits on an elevated bluff, hugs the coast near Santa Cruz’s 111-year-old boardwalk en route to a nature reserve thick with eucalyptus. The street’s beach houses and towering villas are regularly valued beyond $2m, with some vacant plots of land fetching $1m. “Coastal property values are way inflated, factoring in all the risk involved,” Griggs said. “West Cliff Drive is the place to be now; lots of people who made money in Silicon Valley have moved there.” Santa Cruz sits on the northern lip of Monterey Bay, which is losing several feet of beach a year. Sections of the cliffs beneath West Cliff Drive are abutted by piles of rocks, known as riprap, placed as a last-ditch attempt to stem erosion. There is only one house on the ocean side of the road, and its owners moved in recently. “They didn’t have any idea what they were getting into,” said Griggs, who is doing consulting work for the owners amid a tussle with authorities over riprap earlier put in place without permission. “The seawater keeps rising. In the long run, the main beach in Santa Cruz will certainly be lost, if nothing is done.” Similar challenges are sprouting up along the California coast, particularly in the south of the state. Up to two-thirds of southern California’s beaches will completely erode by the end of this century if there aren’t “large-scale human interventions”, according to a major report released by the state government in August. Around $48bn worth of property will be at risk should the swelling sea level increase beyond 4ft. “If we continue the path we are on there will be significant loss of beaches,” said Madeline Cavalieri, a program manager at the California Coastal Commission. The response to morphing coastlines will have to involve a combination of “protection, accommodation and retreat”, she added. This scenario is particularly painful for a place like Santa Cruz, which draws its cultural and economic strength from its beaches and pounding waves. According to local lore, three visiting Hawaiian princes introduced surfing to the city in 1885, when they rode the waves in longboards milled from local redwood. Surfers from around the world now descend upon Santa Cruz to spots such as Steamer Lane, where a rip hurtles into a sandstone bluff that has been in retreat since the last ice age and is now guarded by an array of rocks. A former lighthouse, now a surfing museum, overlooks surfers scrambling over the rocks and into the foaming water. “If you ask a surfer, it’s very apparent that climate change is real and is happening right before our eyes,” said Nick Muchas, who has lived and surfed in Santa Cruz for the past 15 years. Muchas frets about surfing spots that will suffer as the coasts recede, leading to overcrowding at the better areas, as well as the impacts on land. “West Cliff Drive is our cherished road, it’s our treasure chest, and every winter we can see the whole cliff is becoming more unstable,” he said. “When the surf and spray comes over it, I’d say it’s treacherous.” Erosion has shaped California’s coast since long before mass industrialization started pumping planet-warming gases into the atmosphere. A rock arch near the lighthouse collapsed in the late 19th century, with just a stump remaining now. A separate rock formation, known locally as “the old shoe”, is now more like the bottom of a heel. But climate change is accelerating this process. According to a city climate plan, more than 70 Santa Cruz buildings are expected to be at risk from flooding within 12 years with 4in of sea level rise. By 2100, this grows to 390 residential and 65 commercial properties, along with seven miles of roads. This would come with “high rates of beach and coastal bluff retreat”, the document states. “It’s really hard to say right now what that means, but we do know that tourism is a major driver of our economy here locally,” said Tiffany Wise-West, the sustainability and climate action manager for the city of Santa Cruz. “What if [residents] do have to move at some point? We already have an affordable housing crisis here in Santa Cruz.” Along about a tenth of the California coast, the response to this threat has been to erect seawalls or dump protective rocks. While this may buy time for expensive low-lying infrastructure – waste water treatment plants, power stations, the airports at San Francisco and San Jose – the barriers can exacerbate the loss of beaches. As the sea level rises, beaches would naturally migrate inland with the retreating coastline. But fixed points such as seawalls prevent this shift, trapping and in effect drowning the sand as the sea rises and storms take their toll. Roads, sidewalks and buildings also provide a barrier, which presents a conundrum for cities such as Santa Cruz that want to avoid the opposing financial cataclysms of losing their beaches or having to relocate buildings and people en masse to safer ground inland. The hard choices won’t be deferred for much longer. California’s coastal commission has been pushing Santa Cruz to come up with an erosion plan for West Cliff Drive and the city is turning to residents for feedback. More defences may be erected; some areas may have to be abandoned. The state is keen on “green” solutions – seeding wetlands or other vegetation to slow the tides – but that is tough to do in Santa Cruz, with its steep cliffs and hefty waves. The retreating coastline isn’t the only climate challenge Santa Cruz, like many coastal locations, is facing. Heatwaves threaten the sick and elderly, while lengthening wildfire seasons risk choking the city with smoke. The city, already unaffordable for many residents, could see a future influx of people seeking to escape from baking temperatures inland. “I would say we are on the leading edge in terms of understanding our risks and being proactive and addressing them,” Wise-West said. “It’s a pretty daunting topic, though.”"
"Australia’s chief scientist says the question facing the nation’s energy future is not about renewables versus coal but how best to create “a whole-of-economy emissions reduction strategy”. In a prerecorded interview with Sky released on Sunday, Dr Alan Finkel responded to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change’s report, which warned that greenhouse gas pollution needs to reach zero by 2050 if the world is to have any hope of stopping global warming at 1.5C.  Finkel said for Australia that did not mean debating pro- and anti-coal stances but using all available technologies to create the best outcome. “I feel we’ve got to focus on outcomes,” he said. “The outcome is atmospheric emissions. We should use whatever underlying technology are suitable for that. “People paint themselves into an anti-coal corner or a pro-coal corner but the only question of relevance is to look at the atmospheric emissions.” The IPCC report was largely dismissed by the government last week, including by the deputy prime minister, Michael McCormack, who referred to it as “some sort of report”. Australia’s Chief Scientist Alan Finkel: People paint themselves into an anti-coal corner or a pro-coal corner. The only question of relevance is to look at the atmospheric emissions. MORE: https://t.co/ykweMevBOK #SpeersonSunday pic.twitter.com/9dDS9kLLL4 It was the recommendation that coal-fired power needed to be largely phased out by 2050, to slow global warming to a rate which could save the Great Barrier Reef from complete decline, which raised the government’s ire, with the Coalition remaining firmly committed to coal. Finkel told Sky the report also said “that we need to look at things like coal-fired power with carbon capture and storage associated with it” and the issue was not as black and white as was being presented. In an op-ed published on the Conversation website on Friday, Finkel said there was “no time for fatalism” and urged “all decision-makers, in government, industry and the community to listen to the science”. “We have to look squarely at the goal of a zero-emissions planet, then work out how to get there while maximising our economic growth,” he wrote. “It requires an orderly transition, and that transition will have to be managed over several decades. “That is why my review of the National Energy Market called for a whole-of-economy emissions reduction strategy for 2050, to be in place by the end of 2020.” Finkel said no option should be ruled out “without rigorous consideration” and he again repeated the importance natural gas would play in the transition. “The IPCC has made the same point, not just for Australia, but for the world,” he said in the op-ed, adding: “We have in Australia the abundant resources required to produce clean hydrogen for the global market at a competitive price, on either of the two viable pathways – splitting water using solar and wind electricity, or deriving hydrogen from natural gas and coal in combination with carbon capture and sequestration. “Building an export hydrogen industry will be a major undertaking. But it will also bring jobs and infrastructure development, largely in regional communities, for decades. “So the scale of the task is all the more reason to press on today – at the same time as we press on with mining lithium for batteries, clearing the path for electric vehicles, planning more carbon-efficient cities, and so much more.” Finkel recommended that the government establish a clean energy target in the review he handed to the Turnbull government last year but faced immediate opposition from pro-coal backbenchers, including Tony Abbott and Craig Kelly. Those divides within the Liberal party room were a trigger for the leadership spill that ended with Malcolm Turnbull being dumped as prime minister, after the debate about the government’s proposed energy policy conflated with leadership tensions. It ended with Turnbull quitting parliament and the death of the national energy guarantee, with Scott Morrison ruling out legislating any emissions reductions targets in favour of maintaining them in policy. The prime minister has continued to insist that Australia will meet its Paris emissions reduction targets “in a canter” despite not having any legislated roadmap to cut atmospheric pollution."
"This week came the news from the UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) that we are screwed. I wish I could be more optimistic. I wish I could hold out some hope that things are about to improve. But I look at actions by governments around the world, and the Abbott-Turnbull-Morrison governments, and I find the ability to retain a positive outlook smothered in the face of feckless indifference and wilful ignorance. The IPCC report is not actually, as some would have you think, a prophecy of doom – it is a call for action. Rather than talking of what will happen if the planet warms by 2C above industrial levels, its focus is on how much lower the risks are if we limit it to 1.5C. And the good news is this can actually be done. The bad news is we need to do it by 2030 and it is going to cost, on average, about US$2.4tn every year until 2035 – equivalent to 2.5% of the world GDP. For Australia, that translates to around $46bn – the same amount the government spends on the aged pension. Even if we argue that as we only contribute about 1% of total global emissions we should only contribute 1% of the US$2.4tn cost, we are chipping in $33bn a year in Australian dollars – or equivalent to the combined amount spent this year on the NDIS, Newstart and the childcare subsidy. Not cheap. But keeping temperatures at 1.5C reduces the risk of, for example, all of the Great Barrier Reef dying (we’re still likely to lose 70% to 90%). Our farmers would certainly notice the difference as the reports suggests that biome shifts in Australia (which would see our arid, temperate and tropical regions shift) “would be avoided by constraining warming to 1.5C as compared with 2C”. In a pure dollars sense, the report notes that “the economic damage in the United States from climate change” is around 1.2% of GDP per 1C increase. So it is pretty clear that limiting the temperature rise to 1.5C is worth it. The problem is it is harder to achieve. It requires, for example, reducing emissions to zero by 2050 rather than 2075. And that is tough to do, especially when you have governments like our own that are already fudging their ability to reduce emissions by much lower amounts than what would be required. As we saw earlier this month, the government tried its best to hide the latest greenhouse gas emissions data and, since then, has done nothing but try to con voters that all is well. On Monday, the environment minister, Melissa Price, in an excruciating interview on the ABC’s AM program, refused to say she thought the IPCC report was reliable and boasted that “emissions per capita were at their lowest level in 28 years”. This was repeated by the treasurer, Josh Frydenberg, who took it further by bragging that “what we’ve done on climate is seen that emissions on a per capita and GDP basis have come down to their lowest level in 28 years. That’s the record.” The reality of the IPCC report is that we can limit the damage from climate change but it is going to be hard and it is going to be expensive. What an idiotic thing to brag about. Every government every year since 1990 has been able to say that emissions per GDP are at their lowest level – they haven’t gone up once! Bragging about having reduced emissions per GDP is like boasting that today you are the oldest you have ever been. Reducing emissions per capita (or per GDP) has never been the issue. The only reason people look at that figure (as I did a few years back) is to compare it across nations to contrast greenhouse gas dependency and efficiency. In 2016, Australia had the fifth-highest total emissions in the OECD – behind the US, Japan, Germany and Canada. But, on a per capita basis, guess what? We’re No 1. So if Frydenberg, Price and the prime minister want to talk about emissions per capita, talk about that. Or maybe they can brag about the fact that in 2014 our emissions per capita were 5.5% higher than that of the US but in 2016 they were 12.6% higher. The problem is our government, like the Trump White House and Republican party in the US, consists of two types of people – climate change deniers who are so ignorant they truly do think it is all a UN hoax and those who are willing to enable the deniers for political gain. A choice between the ignorant and the feckless. And it really doesn’t matter which category the prime minster, treasurer or environment minister are in, the end result is the same – climate change policy cons that will not deliver what they say they will. Take the prime minister’s line that we will reach our Paris targets “in a canter”. How, pray tell, will we do this? Well, he told ABC’s Sabra Lane that “this is the advice that we’re working through as a government. But what it’s based on also is we’ve crossed a threshold point, Sabra. No longer in order to see large investment in renewable technologies do you need these heavy subsidies, because it’s now making economic sense all on its own.” In other words, he would have us believe that nothing more needs to be done, it will all happen because of market forces. Even more laughably, Morrison suggested that we would meet our commitments because “we’ve still got the small-scale RET and the large-scale RET programs, they remain in place”. Yes they remain in place but, as the minister for energy, Angus Taylor, recently told parliament, “the truth of the matter is that the renewable energy target is going to wind down from 2020. The target reaches a peak in 2020 and we will not be replacing that with anything.” So Morrison’s two major programs that he believes will help us reach our emissions reduction target by 2030 will end in 2020. But, you know, trust him! Morrison “believes” that “we’re going to meet those targets comfortably”. Faith can move mountains and now apparently also reduce emissions. The reality of the IPCC report is that we can limit the damage from climate change but it is going to be hard and it is going to be expensive. That has always been the biggest con from the Liberal party since Tony Abbott took over – the suggestion that reducing emissions can be done without any pain and little cost. If that were the case, no one would be worrying about it – it would have already have been done. But the con artist always tries to sell the line that the difficult can be done with ease – just trust him, you can get something for nothing. And all the while something nags you, because you think it sounds too good to be true – and it is. The IPCC report makes clear that this government’s con job on climate change must stop, and that not only is the time running out to do something about emissions but that the time to put up with climate-change deniers and their enablers in governments around the world is over."

"A whole new fossil fuel industry will launch in the UK on Saturday when energy giant Cuadrilla starts fracking for shale gas. This follows the defeat of Lancashire resident Bob Dennett’s attempt to block fracking in his local area with a court injunction – and comes just six days after a landmark report from the UN’s IPCC warning that we have just 12 years to prevent catastrophic climate breakdown. I can’t deny the fracking decision is a devastating blow for everyone in the UK who cares about our future and our democracy.  Monday’s IPCC report was unequivocal: renewables need to supply 70-80% of our energy by 2050 to avoid disaster, and by 2030 we must be well on the way to meeting that target. The government should be urgently repealing restrictions that have effectively banned the cheapest clean energy – onshore wind – and reinstating support for solar. They should be dramatically reducing our reliance on coal, oil and gas, too. We simply don’t have time to be distracted by building a whole new fossil fuel industry – in economic terms or in terms of our carbon budgets. But there is still hope. The fight against fracking has united people like no other British movement against environmental destruction in recent years. And we’ve had significant success. The government has been doing everything in its power to force this new industry through for five years. But it’s been seven years since any part of the UK was last fracked. Around the clock for half a decade, local communities are all that have stood in the way of ministers seemingly hell-bent on tearing up our climate targets and fossil fuel corporations determined to prise every penny of profit from our warming planet. Thousands of people have bravely put themselves at risk to prevent, delay and obstruct the frackers. Thanks to them, in Yorkshire, Third Energy has given up its plans to frack after failing to pull together the financial backing to win planning permission. In Lancashire, local councillors refused to allow Cuadrilla to frack at Preston New Road – but the government stepped in and trampled all over local democracy. Ministers are getting themselves into deep political trouble as they ramp up efforts to further overrule local communities – with increasing numbers of their own MPs now threatening to vote down plans to make fracking as easy as building a garden shed. And when a judge sent three peaceful anti-fracking protesters to prison last month, people from all walks of life condemned their harsh sentences and sent messages of solidarity. At a time when our country can feel very divided, the movement to protect our environment is uniting people. Drilling may start in Lancashire, but now is not the time to give in. Fracking is at the front line of the struggle to totally transform the future. A new mass movement for climate justice can shut Preston New Road down – and make sure it is the last ever fracking site in this country. It can block airport expansion, too, and together we can stop HS2. With bold, positive campaigns we can unite communities around calls for clean, safe streets that prioritise people over cars. We can win a public transport system fit for the 21st century, and investment that creates hundreds of thousands of green jobs. The IPCC made clear that nothing short of totally reimagining our economy will deliver a safe climate. The frackers might have won this round – but if we use the moment to unite behind the common and inextricably linked causes of social and environmental justice, we can still prevail. • Caroline Lucas is Green MP for Brighton Pavilion"
"It’s a spectacular trick to get someone to amplify your message when they disagree with you vehemently, describe you as an idiot and decry you as dangerous. But that is exactly what some conservatives have managed to do.  I had been noticing this sleight of hand for a while but it was finally crystallised last week after the climate zealot and federal politician Craig Kelly declared in a widely reported speech that we shouldn’t worry about climate change and that, rather than being the cause of global warming, “fossil fuels actually protect us”.  While this statement is incendiary, and stoked the outrage Kelly no doubt expected, there is nothing new or strange about it. Kelly has made extreme statements like this his stock-in-trade and you could substitute his speech for those by Tony “climate change itself is probably doing good” Abbott or Barnaby “people in the Kmart don’t care about the Paris agreement” Joyce. But what is strange, and what’s so damn smart, is how widely these comments have been repeated and amplified by the very people who oppose that message. To put it simply – a lot of progressives are being played for mugs. Imagine if Kelly, Abbott or Joyce sidled up to one of your more left-leaning friends and said to them: “Hello there, I’m going to make a speech and it’s really important to me that the message gets out. Be a chum and share it all over your social media feeds and tell your friends about it.” Your left-leaning friends would tell them to go to hell. But then they do exactly that when left to their own devices.  It’s shared with commentary, usually “this person is an idiot”, but the claims are still being amplified. Polarising figures win the numbers game almost by default – and not just with climate. Take the time Pauline Hanson wore a burqa into parliament as an example. I would wager that her actions did not surprise the majority of her supporters, and that it upset even fewer than that. They know Hanson’s game – that’s what attracted a lot of them to her in the first place. She loses nothing from the outrage and gains everything. The media firestorm after this stunt saw her views commentated on, shared and picked over for weeks. Those who supported or hated her continued to do so. But there would have been a small handful of people who were invigorated by the outrage – and that helped her. That’s why she looked so happy despite the protestations and condemnation from both sides of parliament that day – it’s all oxygen.  There have been numerous studies, the most shocking around anti-vaccination claims, that suggest attempting to “set the record straight” is actually the same as spreading the false claims yourself.  The researchers found that, despite their intention to combat anti-vaccine lies, “over-time exposure to these interventions strengthened participants’ belief in those lies and falsehoods”.  Despite advertising refuting anti-vax myths, the researchers found that people remembered the myths, not the refutations. Think about that next time you repeat something said by someone you disagree with. It also suits polarising conservatives to be opposed by a group they steadfastly insist on portraying as the “liberal elite”, “latte elite” or inhabitants of the “quinoa corridor”. In his book Insane Clown President, journalist Matt Taibbi described the way Donald Trump would stoke outrage and use the media to not only amplify his polarising statements but use their reporting to portray himself as a victim. This perception was further reinforced each time media figures, celebrities, or anyone else he chose to describe as “elites” attempted to criticise him.  In fact, as Taibbi points out, “[Trump] made his campaign into a class conflict and he used the media as the representatives of the class enemy, because they were the ones in the room. It was a brilliant strategy.” These are reasons enough to stop but there is one more, and it’s the most insidious of all. The anger around Kelly’s statements creates an illusion that there is still a debate going on. That there are still even sides. That climate change isn’t an issue that has united farmers, firefighters, surf lifesavers, soldiers, tourism operators, scientists and most of the rest of the country. This false perception is helped when Labor’s rising star Sam Crosby comes out to debate Kelly’s comments. Ridiculous ideas should be laughed at and mocked, not debated and amplified.  The Overton window is a well-known phenomenon in communications and political strategy that basically says there is a “window” of ideas that are acceptable to the public. Everything inside the window is normal. Everything outside the window is radical, ridiculous or unthinkable. But that window changes – during the US election Vox did an explainer of how the window works and what Trump-style politics had done to debate in the US. “The easiest way to move that window was to force people to consider ideas at the extremes, as far away from the window as possible,” Carlos Maza wrote. “Because forcing people to consider an unthinkable idea, even if they rejected it, would make all less extreme ideas seem acceptable by comparison.” By saying extreme things, these polarising figures shift what is “normal”. Their statements are the new extreme, making what was once extreme seem reasonable. And if you’re repeating their lines, you’re helping them. If we boost Kelly’s assertion that we don’t need to worry about climate change and that fossil fuels protect us, rather than endangering us, we are messing with the dials.  People who say polarising things are not stupid. They are very far from it. When they make statements that seem stupid, they’re doing it for a good reason. There is a purpose and a strategy that is well thought out – and it’s working.  Don’t amplify things you don’t agree with. Don’t help people who look to reduce serious issues like climate change. Resist the urge, even if it feels good. By all means refute, but treat these people like Voldemort from Harry Potter – they shall not be named, their claims shall not be repeated. That’s the way to really hurt them. • Simon Black is a campaigner at Greenpeace"
"Peter Fiekowsky, a physicist and entrepreneur, hates silver bullets. But at a climate summit in California last month he found himself pitching one. In partnership with the company Blue Planet, he was demonstrating a low-tech-looking machine that can pull carbon dioxide from the air and store it in construction materials.  If every new building for the next 30 years was made with the resulting product, humans could erase the globe-warming pollution they’ve sent into the atmosphere, said Fiekowsky, founder of the Healthy Climate Alliance network. Blue Planet’s technology is nascent in a scene dominated by a few companies that specialize in carbon removal, and it won’t be the last newcomer. People have done too much damage to the climate to avoid catastrophe just by halting the burning of fossil fuels. They now will have to re-engineer the world, according to scientists with the UN’s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. The livability of the planet will thus depend largely on tools that are now available only on a small scale and currently still expensive. The key, Fiekowsky said, is not the technology itself. It’s having a meaningful goal: restoring the climate, “because it means maybe we’re not doomed”. The UN’s recent report – which says it will require unprecedented action within the next 12 years to keep temperatures from climbing beyond a current 1C increase to a 1.5C increase – does not inspire optimism in many carbon removal experts. While it’s technically feasible to slow fossil fuel use fast enough and capture enough greenhouse gases to limit warming, the world is not on track to do so. Scaling up carbon capture technology is possible but will be difficult, said Kurt Waltzer, managing director for the Clean Air Task Force. “We are absolutely going to have to have a significant amount of carbon removal, there’s no question about it,” Waltzer said. “The level will probably depend on how quickly we can get to a zero-carbon world, but it is going to be enormous.” Most of the work has previously centered around sequestering carbon from power plants, which is different than drawing it from the air. James Mulligan, carbon removal expert at World Resources Institute, said direct-air carbon capture technologies are “unproven at the scale that we’ll need them”. A decade ago, they were viewed as “impossibly expensive”, he said. Now, some are touting a cost of $100 to $200 per ton of carbon. “That’s still expensive,” Mulligan said. “But halting climate change isn’t going to be free.” Reforestation and new agricultural practices could also trap carbon and help slow warming. But direct removal will still be necessary. With direct-air capture, the most obvious option is to store carbon underground. But technologies that create a sellable product will help reduce costs. Three of the biggest direct-air carbon removal companies – Carbon Engineering, Climeworks and Global Thermostat – are all working to store CO2 in something useable. Carbon Engineering markets a carbon-neutral fuel. Climeworks sends carbon to fertilizers, fuels and soon, the beverage industry. Global Thermostat sells the gas for a wide range of purposes. Products made with carbon don’t demand a high enough price to boost capture around the world, so expanding them will require government intervention. Louise Charles, a spokeswoman for Climeworks, said the company has found government support in Europe and has 14 direct-air capture plants built or under construction. But she said there just isn’t enough money in the industry yet. Next year, Climeworks will enter a new market, letting individuals pay to catch and store carbon to account for their own emissions from flying and driving. Steve Oldham, the CEO of Carbon Engineering, said interest in his company has increased in the last few weeks in light of the IPCC report, which he said may be good for business but is overall “kind of scary”. “We think we have a solution that could be part of solving the problem,” Oldham said. “But the missing piece in the middle is policy, and policy requires both need and a solution.”"

"If a bricklayer builds a wall that falls over 12 years later, killing someone, the bricklayer can be sued and even jailed. If a doctor finds some old packets of thalidomide in their surgery and, in spite of the overwhelming scientific evidence of its horrific effects, dispenses it to pregnant women, they would go to jail. The example can be multiplied endlessly: the reality of our world is that we are responsible for our acts. Unless, that is, you are an Australian politician. A politician can destroy our future, a politician can ignore the best evidence and be responsible for decisions that lead to deaths of many and the suffering of all, and still be free until the end of their days to milk the legal corruption that is Australian public life, picking up highly paid sinecures as ambassadors, board directors and lobbyists for the corporations they were once meant to regulate in our interest. Last Monday there came the unbelievable news contained in the UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) report. If large-scale action is not taken now we will face a global warming catastrophe. The report was a nightmarish scream heard through a spithood of formal scientific language. Any rise above 1.5C is highly likely to be disastrous, with millions of people displaced by rising seas, the extinction of numerous species, and the loss of most coral reefs. At 2C the rate of crop loss doubles, as does the decline in sea fisheries. Almost all coral reefs will be dead. Diseases such as dengue and malaria will be far more widespread, extreme droughts and floods far more common, while security and economic growth will be imperilled. One of the report’s lead authors, the geographer Adelle Thomas, said, “The scientific consensus is really strong. It’s not just a political slogan: ‘1.5 to stay alive.’ It’s true.” The report was specific in how long we have to keep warming at 1.5C: until 2030. Twelve years. This Saturday the voters of Wentworth have the opportunity to turn their byelection into a referendum on climate change. If you are a Wentworth voter, consider the historic responsibility you have and how in the past you have used it to good effect. Last year it was Wentworth, after all, that voted 80.8% yes for marriage equality, the fourth-highest yes vote in the nation. Marriage equality, as many have since noted, was not given to us by enlightened politicians. It was forced on a recalcitrant government by the countless acts of individual courage shown by those who stood up in their workplaces, families, in their kitchens, cafes, sporting clubs, for their dignity and freedom; it was made possible by organisation and a passion that transcended party loyalties, and could not finally be refused. Marriage equality was won by the people, in other words, not gifted by the politicians. Our prime minister, a man with a wit that would make Kenny look like Oscar Wilde, once thought it funny to wave a lump of coal in parliament during the middle of one of eastern Australia’s worst heatwaves. Luckily he had Barnaby Joyce there to laugh. With a similar bro and brio he dismissed the IPCC report while speaking to Alan Jones, saying he wouldn’t be bound by its recommendations. His deputy, Michael McCormack, declared the government would not change policy “just because somebody might suggest that some sort of report is the way we need to follow”. That “some sort of report” – the findings of 91 of the world’s most eminent climate change scientists surveying more than 6,000 studies of the most recent research – didn’t trouble McCormack because he hadn’t read the report. Neither had our environment minister, Melissa Price, who told ABC radio the IPCC report, whatever the shared judgment of its global expertise, was “drawing a long bow” by calling for an end to coal by 2050. But then, of course, this is the same government that offers total political support for the Adani coalmine at a time when the IPCC says coal must be phased out. This is the same government that granted $440m to a foundation that never asked for the cash, to deal with water runoff and the crown-of-thorns starfish on the Great Barrier Reef when the science is clear that climate change is what will kill the reef. We have shown that we are large, that we care, and that we think And this is the same government that has no policies to meet Australia’s commitments to the Paris climate agreement. This is the same government that hides shameful greenhouse emissions reports showing our pollution increasing by releasing them in the days before Christmas, without publicity. And its leader, our prime minister, is the man who says that “we’re doing well” when the government’s own figures show that our pollution is increasing. The Liberal candidate Dave Sharma echoes the same smug complacency of the Liberal government he expects to join next Monday. “I do think we are doing enough,” Sharma has said, “and I do think we have had a good record on climate change. Emissions are at their lowest levels in 28 years,” he said. The evidence is otherwise: absolute emissions continue to rise and are among the highest in the OECD. Like our prime minister, who claims we will meet our Paris agreement targets “in a canter”, Sharma says: “We are on track to meet the Paris commitments and I believe we will address the Paris commitments and we will be addressing affordability and sustainable and coherent energy policy.” Sharma’s diplomatic wording cloaks the truth: the Liberal government is the Aleppo of energy policy. It has none, only the shell-shocked ruins of a once great party. As for the Paris climate targets, according to consultants, NDEVR Environmental, Australia is on a trajectory that will see it fail to reach them. In the face of such sustained stupidity by our leaders many Australians have felt an overwhelming sense of powerlessness. But we should not. If you are a Liberal voter, consider the voices of true conservatism and business As the marriage equality vote showed, as the Sydney Opera House controversy revealed, if we choose to exercise our power we discover that we are not as we have so often been told, small and mean and self-serving, cast in the shrivelled image of our politicians. To the contrary, we have shown that we are large, that we care, and that we think – and that when we dare to exercise it, that the power is ours. In evading their responsibilities on climate change, our politicians have been irresponsible to the point of what would be, in any other sphere of life, criminality. If you are a Liberal voter, consider the voices of true conservatism and business. Mark Carney, the governor of the Bank of England, recently warned “of the catastrophic impacts that climate change could have for the world financial system”. “We accept the IPPC assessment of climate change and that human influence is clear and that the physical impacts are unavoidable,” Jac Nasser, the former chairman of BHP, the world’s biggest resource company, declared, while Eric Schmidt, the former chairman of Google, said: “The facts of climate change are not in question. People who oppose it are hurting our children and making the world a worse place. They’re just simply lying.” Listen to Fiona Simson, the president of the National Farmers’ Federation, who has stated “We’ve turned a corner on climate change … overwhelmingly, I think it’s got to a point where the science is very acceptable.” These are hardly the lunatic voices of the far left. It is clear that the traditional constituencies of the Coalition, business and farmers, support major action on climate change – as do the majority of Australians according to all published research, as do the majority of people in Wentworth. Yet the government, from the prime minister down, dismisses the issue. Indeed, both the government and Sharma, state that they are “doing enough” on climate change. The very phrase drips with the contempt of our political class for Australian citizens who they take for passive fools, easily manipulated. As with marriage equality we see a polity determined to do nothing. Since 2013, the Coalition government in its various incarnations has lied, laughed and destroyed when it comes to this most fundamental matter: that of our future. Their record is one of deceit, obfuscation and craven capitulation to the fossil fuel industry. It is a party that has evaded its most fundamental responsibility to our land and our people, and the time for a reckoning has arrived. This Saturday, voters of Wentworth can lead Australia as they did in the marriage equality survey. They can make the byelection a referendum on climate change by voting the candidate they believe has the best climate policy number 1, any who might have a reasonable policy from 2 to 15, and put Dave Sharma at 16. “We have presented governments with pretty hard choices,” Prof Jim Skea, co-chairman of the IPCC panel has been quoted as saying. “We show it can be done within laws of physics and chemistry. Then the final tick box is political will.” The most important thing a voter can do on election day is demonstrate that this threat to our future must be our politicians’ number one priority, and give our politicians the political will to act now. There is so much beauty in this world. Sometimes it is hard to believe this life that is given us. Sometimes it is hard to believe that it is possible to change it for the better, or save it from the worst. But from today we must, and we can. If we take our compass from power we will know only despair. But if we take our compass from those around us and their actions we discover hope. It is time we rediscovered not partisan division but a common humanity ready to take on our gravest crisis. It is time we acted, and the Wentworth byelection is the first chance Australians have. Our tomorrows are running out. We have only today. • Richard Flanagan is the Man Booker prize winning Australian author • Businessman Geoff Cousins is a former Howard government adviser"
