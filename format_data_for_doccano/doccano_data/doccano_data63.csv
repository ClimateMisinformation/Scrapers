"A sickly sweet smell hangs in the air on the road that zigzags up to the medieval village of Carros, a route that was once lushly forested but now lies in ashes in the wake of wildfires that have devastated swathes of Provence’s countryside. Among those venturing here on Friday to gaze at the apocalyptic vista of blackened trees were Lennard and Sofie Nystedt, a Swedish couple who were among around 10,000 holidaymakers and locals who were forced to flee to the safety of public shelters and hotels overnight on Tuesday as flames swept down hillsides. “We were in Antibes earlier in the day but when we went back in the afternoon there was smoke around our house, so we were evacuated,” she said, as their children lingered behind nearby barriers preventing traffic from using the road inland from Nice. “Our daughter was very frightened. I think it’s something that we are going to remember for the rest of our lives.” With the fires now largely extinguished – albeit against the backdrop of dry conditions and clouds of black smoke that still hung over parts of the skyline around some of the worst-affected areas – minds have turned to the causes, and how life may change forever. “There was a ‘before’, and now there will be an ‘after’,” said the Carros mayor, Charles Scibetta, who told of how residents awoke earlier in the week to a “lunar landscape” around them and promised increased vigilance as well as a tougher approach towards the negligence that heightens fire risks. But there’s also a sense that bigger factors are in play, with many locals quick to cite global warming and a feeling that traditional weather patterns have been ruptured. “It has been changing. It’s almost as if we have just two seasons – winter and summer. One week you can be in your coat but the next you can be in a light shirt,” said Scibetta. At the same time, a cornucopia of other reasons and suspected culprits have been cited – many have even been viewing the fires through the prism of France’s recent terrorist traumas. Quick to capitalise on this, senior members of the regionally strong Front National have described the blazes as “a form of terrorism”. It’s a view quietly articulated by some in the old village of Carros, which lies above a larger “newer” town, and 20km inland from Nice where 86 people died just over a year ago after a lorry drove in to crowds celebrating Bastille Day on the seafront Promenade des Anglais. “It’s true that some people blame the fires on terrorism and they write it on Facebook,” said Mia Rose, a Danish-born resident of the village, as she walked her collie through its sleepy cobblestoned lanes. Nodding towards the new town, built in the 1970s to accommodate workers as one of Provence’s largest industrial zones took shape beside it, she added: “We have a lot of Muslims in town down there, and I have seen some people writing that. But I don’t know, here in the village it’s very different.” Terrorism is not a line of inquiry that has been voiced by authorities investigating the fires though. Indeed, Carros’s town hall officials praise the community’s sense of solidarity and the offers of assistance to help those made homeless in the blazes. Nevertheless, the possibility that criminal motives were behind the fires is a real one. Two 16-year-old boys who were stopped by police remain in custody on suspicion of deliberately starting the Carros fires. Elsewhere, arrests have taken place in relation to other fires including in Peynier, near Aix-en-Provence, where a man was charged on Friday night, while Renaud Muselier, president of the Provence regional council, said that many of the blazes are “of criminal origin” and the “activity of arsonists”. Such arson is not a new thing. Sitting with friends in square in Carros – a village that has traditionally been spared tourists scrums but which was quieter than usual –Malika Merzouk, a local resident, explained some of the motives cited in the past for forest arson. “Some people might set the fires to clear new land to build for example, while others might be trying to bring the price of property down. But either way, it’s criminal and very dangerous,” she added. Throwing another theory into the mix, meanwhile, her friend Stephan Van der Stuyft suggested that the fires could be caused by wolves that have reappeared in the region after crossing over from Italy. After being hunted to extinction France in the 1930s, they now number in the hundreds and have been blamed for driving farmers and their sheep off pastures that then become fire-prone shrubland. “It might be nonsense, but a lot of people seem to be taking it seriously as an idea,” he added. “Still, if you talk to a fireman here they will just tell you that there is no real reason for what has happened. Everything is so dry that sometimes even the spark from a car exhaust can cause something.” It has been an exhausting week for those firefighters, backed by troops, civil security officials and the pilots of 19 specially equipped planes that have been dropping containers of water on flaming inland trees and bushes. Some of the most widely shared footage on social media in recent days has been taken on the beaches of Nice by tourists watching three Canadair CL-415 Superscooper aircraft flying into the sea to pick up water, before embarking on the hazardous job of going low again over fire zones. Yet while the emergency response has largely been successful, the strategy of quickly and aggressively suppressing fires with huge and concentrated resources – an approach established in France in response to the devastating wildfires of the 1990s – is being questioned. An academic study published this month for the international Society for Risk Analysis by two French experts on biodiversity and forest fire management suggests that official policy places too little emphasis on prevention in the first place, while bans on fire use for agricultural purposes have led to the disappearance of a “fire-wise” culture among communities. The authors Thibaut Fréjaville and Thomas Curt argue that the suppression policy itself may even have resulted in the build-up of biomass that increases the hazard of massive fires and lengthens the wildfire “season”. Strongly questioning the sustainability of the fire policy pursued by France and other Mediterranean countries, the authors warn that the approach could be the origin of a new generation of wildfires that will prove even more intense and difficult to suppress. Back in Carros, there is optimism that moves to plant new trees and repair forest beds can produce tangible results within 10 years. “It has been one of our green lungs and so has been extremely important to us,” said the mayor, Scibetta. “We do have other forests but it is still sad to see it being destroyed like this.”"

"The National Institutes of Health deleted multiple references to climate change on its website over the summer, continuing a trend that began when the Trump administration took charge of the dot.gov domain.  The changes were first outlined in a report by the Environmental Data and Governance Initiative (EDGI), which has been using volunteers to track changes to roughly 25,000 pages across multiple government agencies since Trump took office. EDGI counted five instances in which the term “climate change” was changed to simply “climate” on the National Institutes of Health (NIH) site.   The NIH, an agency of the federal government, is the world’s leading public health research body. EDGI’s findings can be confirmed by using the internet archive Wayback Machine and looking up the affected NIH pages. The database appears to show the deletion as having occurred between 28 June and 6 July of this year. The references were altered on pages belonging to the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences, NIH’s division dedicated to the study of the environment and its effects on human health. NIEHS also removed links to an educational factsheet from two separate pages, and a page dedicated to explaining the environmental impacts of climate change. The scrubbing was ineffectual, though, as the term was mostly only deleted from page titles and subheadings. “No other language changes were made and the term ‘climate change’ continues to be used in the body text of the page,” EDGI reported. For example, on the first edited page cited in the report, originally called “Climate Change and Human Health” before the word “change” was removed, the term “climate change” still appears 35 times. Even the page URL, which ends with “/climatechange”, remains unaffected. The page still accurately explains: “Climate change makes many existing diseases and conditions worse, but it may also help introduce new pests and pathogens into new regions or communities.” Donald Trump and key members of his administration have expressed skepticism and outright rejection of the scientific consensus about man-made climate change. Trump has tweeted inaccurate or misleading facts or opinions about climate change more than 100 times. The concept of global warming was created by and for the Chinese in order to make U.S. manufacturing non-competitive. In May, the Guardian reported that the Trump administration was systematically cutting references to climate change from government websites, scrapping an entire section from the White House page on climate change, and replacing it with a brief treatise entitled “An America first energy plan” that made no mention of the empirically uncontroversial reality of climate change. Emails obtained by the Guardian earlier this month revealed that staff at the US Department of Agriculture had been told to avoid using the term climate change in their work, and instructed to reference “weather extremes” instead."
"A campaign to plant enough trees to offset Donald Trump’s climate policies is under way. Organisers hope to plant 10bn trees by 24 December 2017, with the last one being a Christmas tree planted in front of the White House. The organisers of Trump Forest are asking people to donate trees to make up for the 650m tonnes of CO2 that will be released into the atmosphere by 2025 if the president’s plans to backtrack on US climate commitments go ahead.   “Since Trump has taken office, we have seen him make attack after attack on initiatives designed to slow down manmade climate change. Trump has declared a war on a healthy climate for life on Earth so we are fighting back with an army of trees. The more trees that people put in the ground, and the quicker they do it, the faster we will offset Trump’s ignorance,” says glaciologist Daniel Price, a co-founder of the project. The figure of 650m tonnes – equivalent to the annual carbon footprint of 33 million Americans – is calculated from Trump’s decision to rollback the US 2015 Paris agreement pledge to lower emissions by at least 26% below 2005 levels by 2025.  The Obama administration’s clean power plan, which Trump has vowed to review, aimed to cut emissions from existing coal and gas-fired power plants and would have reduced carbon emissions by nearly 650m tonnes by 2025 – just under halfway to meeting the Paris pledge. Jeremy Woods, deputy director of environmental policy at Imperial College London, says the project’s calculations make sense, even if they are at the optimistic end of the scale. He says that trees – especially when they are growing as they use more carbon dioxide from the atmosphere – are a key component of removing CO2 from the air, and an important tool towards a sustainable climate future. “Overall, it’s a positive project. If you plant trees on one hectare of land, roughly the area of a football pitch, with one tree every 10 square metres, that’s 1,000 trees per hectare. With 100 ha per square kilometre, the 100,000 sq kms targeted by Trump Forest would plant 10m hectares with 10bn trees. “I would expect that many trees to take at least 300m tonnes of CO2 out of the air over the eight-year period, so 650m tonnes by 2025 is not outrageous if you take into account the growth of the trees is likely to be higher than my conservative assumptions used here.  “Projects like this demonstrate the importance of doing something now even if they can come across as glib,” says Woods. So far, the tree count stands at 342,000, from 1,242 donors who have invested £39,000 ($50,000). If the campaign is to succeed, they must plant enough trees to fill at least 104,659 sq km, the same size as the US state of Kentucky. (France is 643,801 sq km, England is 130,279 sq km and Ireland 84,421 sq km.) Despite the massive scale of planting needed, the campaigners believe it can be done. “It’s clearly a big challenge, but only recently the world record was broken when India put 66m trees in the ground in a day. If we all chip in, it is a completely realistic goal,” says Price. “In 30 years from now, when people look back on the Trump presidency as an attack on the planet and on rational thought, it would be pretty cool if the history books say his actions were negligible because the global community offset the administration’s additional emissions.” Woods is positive, but cautious. He says that reforestation initiatives are complicated to implement, and that it is difficult to make sure they are sustainably introduced into local communities.  “On balance, it’s a positive thing if it’s done well ... but we also need to remember that tree planting takes time and investment and so not all, in fact, very few, of the 10bn trees are likely to be planted within the next 5 years. The new forest has to be there in perpetuity if the carbon is to be kept out of the atmosphere. And you need to help food production and local communities. “My fear is that people may look at it and say this isn’t that big an area … all we have to do is plant trees on an area the size of Kentucky and the problem is solved, but it’s nothing like that. There’s no silver bullet,” he says. People can contribute in two ways to Trump Forest: either by buying trees from their preferred tree-planting organisation anywhere in the world and sending Trump Forest the receipt so they can count their pledge, or by donating directly to their partner, the Eden Reforestation Projects.  Donating through the Trump Forest website, $1 buys eight mangrove trees in Madagascar (they are hoping to have the credit card fee removed soon so $1 will buy 10 mangrove trees).  The organisers say they have tapped into a global sense of frustration with the president’s climate change policies. The project’s co-founder Adrien Taylor says he felt helpless and had to do something to compensate for Trump’s behaviour.  “Only a small percentage of the world’s population voted in Trump, but everyone, everywhere, pays the cost of his climate ignorance. He should be standing up and taking leadership in addressing what is the biggest collective challenge humanity has ever faced. But he’s not,” says Taylor. “People like Trump are spineless dinosaurs who have no place in politics in this century.”  Go to the Trump Forest website to find out how to donate to the campaign."
"The Swiss, who are more aware of climate change than the average Briton because of their disappearing glaciers and snow cover, are also worried about their trees, particularly the Norway spruce.  The Norway spruce is the mainstay of the Swiss forestry industry but is in danger of dying out this century because of warmer temperatures.  This spruce is common in Britain, best known perhaps as the classic Christmas tree, but also as a favoured habitat for the red squirrel. What the Swiss have discovered is that an increase in temperature and summer droughts expected this century is likely to kill off most of this spruce in their country. Another important tree to the Swiss, the European beech, is also vulnerable to extra warmth and heat. Trees can adapt to climate change but in both these species there is about a 100-year time lapse between generations, so with rapid climate change there is not enough time for adaptations. The Swiss are advocating taking seeds of spruce or beech from warmer valley bottoms and planting them higher up the mountains, or importing specimens of these trees from other countries where over centuries they have adapted to warmer drier conditions.  The alternative, to save the Swiss forestry industry, is to switch to planting other species able to thrive in harsher conditions. The beech has also been identified by the UK’s Forestry Commission as the native species most likely to suffer from a warmer, drier, climate. But there has been nothing like the stark warning that has come from Switzerland. Perhaps the time has come for a closer look at the problem. "
"The BBC has recently come under fire for a Radio 4 programme which featured Nigel Lawson criticising the concept of climate change. This has drawn the ire of many scientists, and rightly so. The science on this matter is settled, there is no meaningful debate to be had, and the evidence is there for all to see should they choose to go and look for it. Basically, Nigel Lawson isn’t real.  It’s all very well putting forward opposing views in the name of “balance”, although it’s worth noting that the importance of “balance” at the BBC seems to differ wildly depending on the subject matter. You seldom get Flat Earth proponents giving contrasting weather forecasts to combat the globular bias in meteorology, and it seems the BBC is perfectly happy broadcasting debates about whether the Welsh language deserves to exist which feature, you know, NOBODY WHO ACTUALLY SPEAKS IT. Balance isn’t a priority in these instances, clearly. But the increasingly-unhinged and militant types who insist that Nigel Lawson exists, they must be given airtime apparently. It boggles the mind.   Look at the facts. It’s “claimed” that Nigel Lawson was a conservative party MP who was Chancellor of the Exchequer from 1983 to 1989. But even this simple statement doesn’t hold up under closer scrutiny. For instance, he was reportedly MP for Blaby. Blaby? That’s clearly not a real place. Doesn’t even sound like one. I’ve been all over the UK and never seen it. Sure, the maps say it’s a village in central Leicestershire, but that doesn’t prove anything. Have you ever met anyone from there? Of course not. It’s just a creation of the midlands councils to squeeze more of my taxes out of central government.  It’s also said that Nigel Lawson was instrumental in the financial world’s “Big Bang”, where the City of London was deregulated and the UK financial markets were allowed to expand and become a dominant global economic force. No doubt it boosted the UK’s fortunes substantially for a prolonged period, but it’s widely believed to be responsible for the eventual 2008 crash, leaving us in the horrific mess we’re in today.  So, we’re supposed to believe that an individual whose policies and actions messed up a whole country, would still be allowed on state-funded TV and radio regularly, as an authority on how something bad definitely isn’t going to happen in the near future? Such a thing would be rejected by the writers of comic books for being too ludicrous, and yet we’re expected to believe that not only does this person exist, but that he’s an authority on matters that he has no experience, expertise or insight on, and that he’d be regularly given platforms to share this lack of knowledge? No, pull the other one. The only feasible explanation is that Nigel Lawson is a fictional creation, put together by conservative and right-wing politicians and influencers in order to make them look more reasonable and professional in comparison.  Sure, you can point to all sorts of “proof” of Nigel Lawson’s existence. His voting records, his birth certificates, his presence in the house of lords, the fact that many people have met him and he is definitely a real person with skin and legs and everything, but this is clearly all just a front, and people need to wake up and stop scaremongering about the existence of Nigel Lawson. Because none of it makes sense! He’s unrepentantly pro-Brexit, but he lives in France? He loves Britain so much he doesn’t want to be anywhere near it? It defies logic. And to the people who say “he must exist, he has six children! Famous ones!”, I say this: Nigel Lawson’s most famous offspring would be TV chef and presenter, the beautiful Nigella Lawson. So, you’re telling me Nigel Lawson was presented with his new-born baby girl and decided to give her his own name? Can you imagine a man who would actually do that? It boggles the mind! No, it can’t have been done. There’s obviously a more logical explanation that will come to me eventually.  That’s the point though; this fantasy that Nigel Lawson exists is just denial and rhetoric from those afraid of change, afraid of losing out. But you can’t shut reality out for long, pretty soon they’re going to have to face facts and accept they can’t dictate how the world really works by harrumphing and complaining constantly. They might get to this point sooner if the BBC, of all things, stops enabling them, and giving credibility to notions that have long been rendered farcical. Like the existence of Nigel Lawson. Dean Burnett’s book The Idiot Brain is available now in the UK, US and many other countries."

"The American Geophysical Union - the pre-eminent organization of Earth scientists - presents annual awards to celebrate the achievements of scientists. The awards, which are often named after famous historical scientists, reflect the contributions to science in the area of the award namesake. With the 2017 award winners just announced, it’s appropriate to showcase one of the winners here.  The 2017 winner of the Roger Revelle medal is Dr. Kevin E. Trenberth. One of the most well-known scientists in the world, he is certainly the person most knowledgeable about climate change that I know.   The Roger Revelle award is given to an honoree who has made outstanding contributions to the understanding of the atmosphere and its interactions with other parts of the climate system. Named after Roger Revelle, who was critical in bringing the idea of human-caused climate change to the scientific community, it is amongst the highest honors. Revelle wrote regarding increasing carbon dioxide in the atmosphere in 1957:  human beings are now carrying out a large scale geophysical experiment Certainly the other scientists nominated were of incredible quality. Why was Kevin granted the award? I cannot answer this for certain because I was not on the committee, but it’s possible that he won strictly because of his scientific contributions.  Dr. Trenberth is a leading voice in the concept of Earth Energy Imbalance (which is really the rate of global warming). He also pioneered research related to the interactions of the atmosphere with the oceans, particularly the El Niño/La Niña cycle. He has worked on advancements to climate models and to experimental observations of climate. Another major area of contribution is the changes in precipitation with climate change, and especially the frequency and intensity of extremes. He has also changed the approaches to attribution of human-caused climate change.  But perhaps Dr. Trenberth won the award because of the sheer volume and impact of his scholarship. He is closing in on 70,000 citations to his work. This puts him near the top of the list worldwide for impact.  Or maybe he won because of his tireless efforts in service to the scientific community, with leadership roles in the IPCC, the World Climate Research Programme, NOAA, and other groups. Or lastly, it could be because he is tireless as both a researcher and a communicator. Dr. Trenberth can be heard or read almost weekly in major newspapers, magazine articles, radio and television shows. When reporters need complex climate science explained, he is a go-to person, and has been for years. His personal life is interesting too. Born in New Zealand, he studied mathematics before embarking on meteorology. His time in New Zealand provided him with a different geographic perspective than his American and European colleagues. New Zealand is more impacted by certain climate oscillations, like fluctuations in the temperature of the Pacific Ocean surface waters. Certainly these experiences affected his climate views.  Growing up, family, school, and sports – he was a top rugby player - were important. He was somehow able to balance these three pillars of life without sacrifice to his academics. Born into a family of very modest means, Kevin had to make his own fortunes. His early academic performance resulted in financial scholarships for school.  After some time spent in the New Zealand army, he was ready to embark upon his scientific career. After winning a New Zealand government fellowship to do his doctorate at MIT, he met his future wife Gail who was as ever energetic, smart, and involved in life as was Kevin. They had a daughter in New Zealand, and, after moving to the U.S. as a professor at the University of Illinois, began fostering, which led to the adoption of their second child. Somehow Kevin and his wife kept both career and family center in their lives and Kevin’s reputation as a top-rated scientist increased. He moved to the National Center for Atmospheric Research in 1984. His scientific work and his public communication efforts meant that he became a frequent target of groups that try to deny human-caused climate change or diminish its importance. The problem with Kevin is, he knows so much you can just assume he is smarter than you.  Well-known contrarians such as Richard Lindzen, Roy Spencer, and John Christy have had their works rebutted by Trenberth for technical errors. Trenberth has also crossed paths with vocal down-players of climate change like Roger Pielke Jr., who reportedly threatened Trenberth by email. Pielke Jr. was working for Nate Silver’s 538 website; his actions lead to Nate Silver stating “We had candid conversations with Michael Mann and Kevin Trenberth (about the emails). We made clear that Roger’s conversations with them did not reflect FiveThirtyEight’s editorial values.” More details of the altercation are available here. Why would I write about this aspect of Trenberth’s career? Because it shows that he has suffered slings and arrows for his tireless work. He has spent his career being honest about the limits of our knowledge of the Earth’s climate but also being clear about our certainty of human-caused climate change. His reward for this tireless service to society has been attacks on his research and his person. However, he has been impeccable in character and scholarship. The ill-advised who tangle with Trenberth have discovered they are on the short end of the intellectual battle. It is my view that the AGU, by granting awards such as these to scientists, effectively encourage others to reach the highest standards in their profession.  Interested readers can go here to read about the other AGU award winners for the 2017 year."

"Extreme heatwaves that kill even healthy people within hours will strike parts of the Indian subcontinent unless global carbon emissions are cut sharply and soon, according to new research. Even outside of these hotspots, three-quarters of the 1.7bn population – particularly those farming in the Ganges and Indus valleys – will be exposed to a level of humid heat classed as posing “extreme danger” towards the end of the century.  The new analysis assesses the impact of climate change on the deadly combination of heat and humidity, measured as the “wet bulb” temperature (WBT). Once this reaches 35C, the human body cannot cool itself by sweating and even fit people sitting in the shade will die within six hours. The revelations show the most severe impacts of global warming may strike those nations, such as India, whose carbon emissions are still rising as they lift millions of people out of poverty.  “It presents a dilemma for India between the need to grow economically at a fast pace, consuming fossil fuels, and the need to avoid such potentially lethal impacts,” said Prof Elfatih Eltahir, at Massachusetts Institute of Technology in the US who led the new study. “To India, global climate change is no longer abstract – it is about how to save potentially vulnerable populations.” Heatwaves are already a major risk in South Asia, with a severe episode in 2015 leading to 3,500 deaths, and India recorded its hottest ever day in 2016 when the temperature in the city of Phalodi, Rajasthan, hit 51C. Another new study this week linked the impact of climate change to the suicides of nearly 60,000 Indian farmers. Eltahir said poor farmers are most at risk from future humid heatwaves, but have contributed very little to the emissions that drive climate change. The eastern part of China, another populous region where emissions are rising, is also on track for extreme heatwaves and this risk is currently being examined by the scientists. Their previous research, published in 2015, showed the Gulf in the Middle East, the heartland of the global oil industry, will also suffer heatwaves beyond the limit of human survival if climate change is unchecked, particularly Abu Dhabi, Dubai, Doha and coastal cities in Iran. The new work, published in the journal Science Advances, used carefully selected computer climate models that accurately simulate the past climate of the South Asia to conduct a high resolution analysis of the region, down to 25km. The scientists found that under a business-as-usual scenario, where carbon emissions are not curbed, 4% of the population would suffer unsurvivable six-hour heatwaves of 35C WBT at least once between 2071-2100. The affected cities include Lucknow in Uttar Pradesh and Patna in Bihar, each currently home to more than two million people. Vast areas of South Asia – covering 75% of the area’s population – would endure at least one heatwave of 31C WBT. This is already above the level deemed by the US National Weather Service to represent “extreme danger”, with its warning stating: “If you don’t take precautions immediately when conditions are extreme, you may become seriously ill or even die.” However, if emissions are reduced roughly in line with the global Paris climate change agreement, there would be no 35C WBT heatwaves and the population affected by the 31C WBT events falls from 75% to 55%. About 15% exposed are today.  The analysis also showed that the dangerous 31C WBT level would be passed once every two years for 30% of the population – more than 500 million people – if climate change is unchecked, but for only 2% of the population if the Paris goals are met. “The problem is very alarming but the intensity of the heatwaves can be reduced considerably if global society takes action,” said Eltahir. South Asia is particularly at risk from these extreme heatwaves because the annual monsoon brings hot and humid air on to the land. The widespread use of irrigation adds to the risk, because evaporation of the water increases humidity. The projected extremes are higher in the Gulf in the Middle East, but there they mostly occur over the gulf itself, rather than on land as in South Asia. The limit of survivability, at 35C WBT, was almost reached in Bandar Mahshahr in Iran in July 2015, where 46C heat combined with 50% humidity. “This suggests the threshold may be breached sooner than projected,” said the researchers.  Prof Christoph Schär, a climate scientist at ETH Zurich, Switzerland, and who was not involved in the study, said: “This is a solid piece of work, which will likely shape our perception of future climate change. In my view, the results are of concern and alarming.” The report demonstrates the urgency of measures to both cut emissions and help people cope better with such heatwaves, he said. There are uncertainties in the modelling – which Schär noted could underestimate or overestimate the impacts – as representing monsoon climates can be difficult and historical data is relatively scarce. Prof Chris Huntingford, at the UK Centre for Ecology and Hydrology, said: “If given just one word to describe climate change, then ‘unfairness’ would be a good candidate. Raised levels of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere are expected to cause deadly heatwaves for much of South Asia. Yet many of those living there will have contributed little to climate change.”"
"Earlier in August, six faith leaders met Australia’s environment and energy minister, Josh Frydenberg. Our group included Bishop Philip Huggins, the president of the National Council of Churches, a Uniting Church reverend, a rabbi, a Catholic nun and an ordained Buddhist. This is not the start of a joke, but a polite and serious exchange. It might seem that religion has little to do with the environment or energy. Yet each of us at the meeting wanted to raise a matter that, when we consider the deepest values of our respective traditions, is of grave moral concern: the proposed Adani coalmine. We were there to ask the minister to revoke its environmental licence. The delegation reminded the minister that a number of faith leaders from across Australia wrote him an open letter about it on 5 May, to which he had not yet replied. Around the world a great many people of faith are deeply concerned about the climate crisis. Despite the reactionary nature of some in the United States, faith leaders are almost completely united and supportive of the science. The pope has issued his famous encyclical, Laudato Si, faith leaders were part of the successful movement in the US to stop the Keystone XL pipeline, and the Dalai Lama has spoken of the need for strong action. The co-founder of 350.org, Bill McKibben, is a mild-mannered Methodist Sunday school teacher. Of course, the faith traditions do not have a monopoly on morality. There are very proud secular and indigenous traditions in this struggle that we honour and respect. Yet we do have much to offer when it comes to ethics and morals. And on this issue, there is a significant groundswell. In Buddhism, the first precept is non-harm, or loving kindness, towards all beings. The tradition also points out the profound interconnectedness of all things, including all forms of life. In Judaism, the first portion of the Torah, B’reshit, makes it clear that our human responsibility is to look after God’s world. We may use it, we may eat from it, but it is clear that we must maintain it in a healthy state to pass on to generations to come. In short, thousands of years before the term was coined, Torah has the strongest of mandates for sustainability. Whichever way you look at it, this is the great moral issue of our time Muslim leaders in the UK say: Allah in His Mercy has placed an amanat (trust) upon all of humanity to safeguard and nurture creation. He has appointed humanity as guardians of His creation, as “a khalifa (steward)” [Qur’an 2:30]. In the US, the evangelical Christian and climate scientist Katharine Hayhoe states: “The poor, the disenfranchised, those already living on the edge, and those who contributed least to this problem are also those at greatest risk to be harmed by it. That’s not a scientific issue; that’s a moral issue.” Pope Francis writes in his encyclical: “Politics and business have been slow to react in a way commensurate with the urgency of the challenges facing our world … Those who will have to suffer the consequence of what we are trying to hide will not forget this failure of conscience and responsibility.” Whichever way you look at it, this is the great moral issue of our time. Nothing less than the stability of civilisation and the viability of life on Earth is at stake. Frydenberg told our delegation that, if Australian coal were not burnt in India, dirtier coal would be burnt instead, resulting in greater carbon emissions. We pointed out that one argument against the abolition of slavery in Great Britain was that they would just have lost market share to the Dutch and the French, who would apparently have treated the slaves worse. The minister rejected the comparison. Frydenberg paints the Adani issue as more complex than we may appreciate. We need the employment. We point out how a fraction of the promised subsidies could employ more people, in clean, renewable energy jobs, while further coral bleaching and 500 extra ships per year through the reef would jeopardise thousands of tourism jobs. We emphasise the crucial truth that the world can only produce around 700bn tonnes more CO2 if we are to avoid climate catastrophe, and that global emissions are currently around 50bn tonnes a year, so time is extremely limited. Adani alone will add 4.6bn tonnes. We do appreciate the complexities; even so, this mine ultimately involves a simple moral choice. Aside from the dangers of rising temperatures and seas, more intense storms, floods and droughts, World Health Organisation figures show that over 100,000 people each year will also die prematurely from lung diseases from burning the coal from this reef-wrecking mega-mine. The minister seems unmoved.  Rabbi Keren-Black asked the minister what he thought were the views of climate scientists employed by the Australian government about building this mine. Momentarily, Frydenberg seemed lost for words. As the meeting came to a close, our Buddhist member, Tejopala, told the minister that he would stand in front of machinery if digging started and that other members of his order had said the same thing. Reverend Sangster concurred. Faith communities have real influence. The minister probably only granted us a meeting because we are religious leaders. Perhaps the two most powerful things people of faith can do are to encourage moving our accounts from banks and superannuation funds that invest in fossil fuels, and to practice non-violent direct action – peacefully obstructing the worst coal, oil and gas projects by physically standing in their way. As we stepped outside the meeting, Reverend Sangster turned to the group and said: “Well, then. See you at the barricades.” Indeed."
"Military and climate experts, including a former chief of the defence force, have warned that Australia faces potential “disastrous consequences” from climate change, including “revolving” natural disasters and the forced migration of tens of millions of people across the region, overwhelming security forces and government. Former defence force chief Adm Chris Barrie, now adjunct professor at the strategic and defence studies centre at the Australian National University, said in a submission to a Senate inquiry that Australia’s ability to mitigate and respond to the impacts of climate change had been corrupted by political timidity: “Australia’s climate change credentials have suffered from a serious lack of political leadership”.  The inquiry into the security ramifications of climate change also heard from some of the country’s leading climate scientists, who warned the security threats posed by climate change had been underestimated, and complained Australia had been “walking away” from exactly the type of research that would help the country prepare. Other experts, however, counselled against “alarmist” predictions and said the focus of climate change response should be on those people most acutely affected by it, rather than the security concerns of developed countries most able to respond. Barrie said the security threat of climate change was comparable to that posed by nuclear war, and said the Australian continent would be most affected by changing climate. “We will suffer great effects from these changes, such as new weather patterns; droughts, sea-level rises and storm surges, because we have substantial urban infrastructure built on the coastal fringe; ravages of more intense and more frequent heatwaves and tropical revolving storms.” But he said the existential impacts of climate change were likely to be first, and most severely, felt across Australia’s region, the Asia-Pacific rim, the most populous region in the world, and one that will be home to seven billion people by 2050.  Barrie posited a scenario in which the glaciers in the Tibetan Plateau and Himalayan-Hindu Kush ranges – which reliably deliver fresh water into China, the Mekong Delta, Myanmar, Bangladesh, India and Pakistan – would disappear. “A serious shortage of fresh water brings famine; starving people are a very serious security problem. The question then becomes ‘what will happen if starving people on the rim of Asia are looking for a new home?’ “Historical evidence suggests that under such circumstances mass migration of these people will occur. It follows that several tens of millions of people might seek better fortunes in Australia and possibly New Zealand. “Most other options for settlement in our region would already have high population densities. Our security forces, and all arms of government, would be overwhelmed in such a scenario.” The Australian Defence Force has been examining the potential insecurities caused by climate change for a decade. Within Defence, there are serious concerns over the vulnerability of military bases to climate impacts, and the military’s reliance on fossil fuels. But Barrie said political action lagged far behind and Australia’s hyper-politicised debate over climate had hampered decisive government action. “Our current posture is a manifest failure of leadership,” he said. Scientists at the ARC Centre for Climate Extremes, led by Andy Pitman from the University of New South Wales, said in their submission that climate scientists could help the country prepare for these sorts of threats but that investments in the required work was not occurring. They noted many assessments of the threats to national security posed by climate change may be an underestimation, and called for a “high-level taskforce to examine risks associated with climate change and national security”. “Most assessments linking climate change with climate risk have assumed changes are well described by the average,” they said, arguing this needed to be “urgently modified”. They said that focusing on average temperature rise masks more serious changes that will occur in relation to extreme events and “compound events”. “We do not know where or when extreme events will hit, which regions will become less vulnerable and which regions will suddenly emerge to be vulnerable,” they say.  They said those problems could be solved, but that Australia was not devoting enough research to the issue. They also noted that while infrastructure and systems are often built to be resilient against isolated events – such as sea-level rise or a storm – that design often assumes they will happen in isolation, but if they occur together they could be “catastrophic”. Again, the scientists said Australia was not focussing on the topic and noted that the US was examining compound events including the co-occurrence of droughts and heatwaves. “Australia lags behind the US and some European countries in examining, assessing and responding to climate-change risks in terms of national security,” they said. “Vulnerabilities associated with national security and climate change are already increasing and exist now. These are not ‘future issues’ that can be left for a decade before strategies are considered. The creation of a high-level taskforce to examine risks associated with climate change and national security is urgent and overdue.” Jane McAdam, director of UNSW’s Kaldor centre for international refugee law told the inquiry climate change functioned as a “threat amplifier”, that magnified risk and exacerbated existing crises. “Disasters become disasters on steroids: more frequent and more intense. Climate change is also a process. Slow-onset impacts such as sea-level rise or desertification take place over time, resulting in a gradual deterioration of living conditions that ultimately renders land uninhabitable.” But she said the prospect of massive, sudden international migration was highly unlikely, and focused on the wrong people. “Reasoned, empirically-grounded analysis has too often been overshadowed by alarmist and ill-informed assumptions about the numbers of people on the move, and the nature of that movement. As a result, the security analysis has been ‘flipped’ away from the needs of the most vulnerable communities to instead focus on the national security of developed states, premised on the flawed notion that they will be inundated by people fleeing the impacts of climate change.” McAdam said most displacement and migration would occur within countries, not across national borders. “Longer-term movement will generally be gradual rather sudden, and movement that is sudden (for instance, in the aftermath of a disaster) will often require temporary relief rather than permanent migration. There is scant evidence to justify claims that there will be mass outflows of people across international borders which will threaten international, regional or national security, or generate new risks of Islamist terrorism or fundamentalism.” McAdam said internal displacement could generate low-level social tensions and potential conflict over key resources such as land, housing, food, water and employment. The parliamentary inquiry has also heard climate change has already contributed to and worsened conflicts across the world, including in Mali, Yemen, and the Arab Spring and civil war in Syria from 2011. The International Committee of the Red Cross said the destruction of the natural environment or access to scarce resources was often used as a weapon of war. “In armed conflict, the natural resources on which people rely are often attacked in contravention of IHL [international humanitarian law] provisions. This can take the form of theft or killing of livestock, theft of land, drainage or poisoning of water resources, destruction of places of trade and livelihood. Removing the basis of communities’ resilience and capacity to adapt to changing weather conditions imperils their survival and contributes to displacement and poverty.”"

"The winter of 2016 was the warmest for England and Wales in records that stretch back to 1910, the Met Office’s annual State of the UK Climate report revealed on Thursday. The average temperature from December 2015 to February 2016 was more than 2C above the long-term average across the southern half of the UK. The report also found that, over the last decade, the number of air frosts has dropped by 7% and the number of ground frosts by 9%, compared with the average between 1981-2010.  2016 was also the first year in records that began in 1959 where there were no snow depths of 20 cm or more. The winter of 2016 was the second-wettest on record for the UK as a whole, just behind the winter of 2014 which saw serious flooding.  Warmer air can carry more water vapour and the UK government’s climate change advisers rate increased flooding as the biggest impact of global warming on the nation.  Storm Desmond, which flooded parts of Cumbria, Lancashire and the Scottish Borders in December 2015, was made 40% more likely by climate change, according to scientists. On Monday, Met Office research showed the UK should expect on increase record winter downpours. Climate change driven by carbon emissions from human activities is driving temperatures up across the world. In January, scientists declared 2016 as the hottest year in century-long records, meaning a new heat record had been set for the third year in a row. Global measurements so far in 2017 put the year on track to be in the top three ever recorded, along with 2016 and 2015. However, in UK alone, 2016 was only the 13th hottest year in century-long records. “The trend towards warmer temperatures is clear, but of course the large natural variations in our climate will mean that increases are not always even year-on-year.” said Mark McCarthy, head of the Met Office’s National Climate Information Centre. Most temperature records based on thermometer data stretch back only a century, but other scientific research indicates the world was last as warm as it is today about 115,000 years ago. The planet has not experienced the current high levels of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere for four million years.         "
"An ambitious target to phase out sales of new petrol and diesel cars by 2030 could halve UK oil imports, a study by environmental and aid organisations suggests. The government has announced plans to ban the sale of conventional combustion engine cars and vans by 2040 as part of its efforts to tackle air pollution and climate change, a move the groups welcomed as a step in the right direction.  But a stronger ambition for all new cars and vans to produce zero emissions by 2030 could reduce UK foreign oil imports by 51% in 2035 compared to current projections, as well as cut pollution and boost investment in UK infrastructure such as charging points. The report by Green Alliance and supported by Cafod, Christian Aid, Greenpeace, RSPB and WWF, comes ahead of the government’s publication of the clean growth plan, which will outline how the UK will cut carbon emissions to meet legal targets. Ministers have signalled that the delayed plan will be published after parliament’s summer recess, and the aim is for it to be “as ambitious, robust and clear a blueprint as it can be”. In 2016, transport accounted for 40% of the UK’s total energy consumption, with road transport accounting for three-quarters of this, but other countries such as Norway and India are ahead of the UK in their ambitions to switch to electric vehicles, the new study said. Along with a tougher target to make the move to zero emission vehicles, the study calls for additional funding for renewables between 2020 and 2025, bringing in zero-carbon standards for new homes and building energy efficiency improvements. Gareth Redmond-King, head of climate and energy at WWF, said the UK could and must go faster than the 2040 goal. “To ensure the UK doesn’t miss out on the jobs and investment opportunity in clean, modern vehicles, the UK should up its ambition. Cleaning up transport and boosting home energy efficiency must be priorities for the UK government in the forthcoming clean growth plan. “Both measures will create jobs for UK businesses and reduce costs to the NHS caused by noxious air pollution and cold, leaky homes,” he said. Laura Taylor, head of advocacy at Christian Aid, said: “The UK government’s long-overdue clean growth plan needs to prove that this government is serious about speeding up the low carbon transition, not slackening the pace. “The benefits to citizens are enormous but areas like home energy efficiency and heating are lagging behind and need urgent political attention.”"
"People who work for climate science denial thinktanks tend not to spend all that much time worrying about getting stuff into scientific journals. Perhaps because it’s easier, people who are paid to tell the public and policy makers that human-caused climate change is overblown bunk would rather pump out newspaper columns, do softball interviews or push out their own self-published reports. There’s a lot less scrutiny in that kind of public relations.  So when two staffers at Australia’s Institute of Public Affairs managed to get some “science” into a journal earlier this month, there was much delight in conservative media outlets, together with a distinct lack of any genuine scepticism.  “Global Warming Is Almost Entirely Natural, Study Confirms,” wrote Breitbart. “Advanced Computer Models Suggest Most Global Warming Is From Natural Forces,” said the Daily Caller.  One of the authors, Jennifer Marohasy, took to the Spectator to claim her research had shown that recent global warming was almost entirely natural. The web traffic behemoth the Drudge Report also linked to Marohasy’s article.  None of the writers bothered to ask a single other genuine climate scientist for their view on the paper.  I asked five. They variously summarised the research as “junk science” and seriously flawed. Oh dear. Scientists including Dr Gavin Schmidt, director of the Nasa Goddard Institute for Space Studies; Prof Steven Sherwood, deputy director at the University of New South Wales climate change research centre; and Prof Piers Forster, director of the Priestley international centre for climate at the University of Leeds, have pointed out to me serious flaws and errors in the paper’s methodology. It also appears that the lead author, the IPA’s John Abbot, claimed an academic affiliation to James Cook University that, according to that university, had expired more than six months before the research was submitted to the journal. I emailed Abbot and Marohasy to ask them to respond to the key points but didn’t hear back.  So what did Abbot and Marohasy do? Here’s where we get into the gory detail.  First, the pair used what’s known as proxy temperature records. These are estimates of past temperatures going back as far as 50AD that have been estimated from analysis of things such as tree rings and lake sediments. There are hundreds of these temperature records but the authors chose only six, and they don’t say why they chose the ones they did.  They then fed these temperature records into several pieces of software and finally into another piece of software that performs a “machine learning” process. Out the other end comes a series of temperature reconstructions, from which Abbot and Marohasy make two claims.  First, they claim that their resulting data shows the world would have warmed by almost as much as it already has, even if the industrial revolution had not happened and we had not added any extra greenhouse gases to the atmosphere.  Second, they claim that if you were to double the amount of CO2 in the atmosphere then you would eventually see planet-wide warming of just 0.6C. Their estimate of this “equilibrium climate sensitivity” (ECS) is much lower than other studies (the UN’s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change says, for example, that studies show the likely range will be between 1.5C and 4C). So what did the scientists think?  Schmidt told me by email the paper was worthless “on a number of measures” and in his opinion demonstrated “what happens when people have their conclusions fixed before they start the work”. Schmidt wrote that “conceptually this methodology can’t possibly work” because the way the authors had calculated the climate’s sensitivity had assumed that all the natural variability was part of the planet’s internal systems, rather than being “forced” externally by volcanic eruptions or changes in the output of the sun. This, Schmidt said, was “in contradiction to their claims elsewhere in the paper.” Schmidt also says “something went wrong” when Abbot and Marohasy digitised their results, meaning that for the northern hemisphere the data had shifted by about 35 years “so what they think is 2000, is actually 1965”. This meant that a huge part of modern warming had been missed. Dr Benjamin Henley, of the University of Melbourne, has published several studies using proxy data to understand ancient climates. He says the paper should never have been published and should be withdrawn. “The paper is seriously flawed and should be retracted by the journal,” Henley told me by email, pointing out several serious issues with the way the data had been used. Henley questioned why only six “paleoclimate” records had been used, when a recent paper identified some 692 proxy records that could be used to determine temperatures. He said the authors had not tried to verify their approach by comparing their data to actual temperature measurements – an “extremely unscientific approach”. “The results are incorrectly interpreted and are not verified or even compared to observed instrumental data. The conclusions are not supported by the results.” Forster reviewed the paper and told me he thought “the methodology is unphysical” because it simply took data and then extrapolated it rather than accounting for what was actually known to be happening in the real world. Forster said the paper contained “fundamental errors” and gave me a detailed rundown. For example, Forster says Marohasy and Abbot’s methodology assumes that all previous natural swings, or oscillations, in temperature that happened before the industrial revolution would continue up to present day.  In reality there a very few periodic or quasi-periodic oscillations in the Earth system. In reality most are random and not periodic. Volcanoes are the biggest issue. Their method assumes that any periodicity caused by volcanoes prior to 1880 has simply continued though to 2000. We know this is not the case and have a good handle on what volcanic activity has been – it was nothing like it was prior to 1880. Their approach is therefore completely unphysical. They also assume that oscillations seen at a given proxy location will also cause the same oscillation on global average or hemispheric average temperatures. We know this is not the case. He said the authors had assumed most of the 1C warming that the planet had seen was caused by random variation, “but we know this is not the case.” He said the paper’s conclusion the ECS was only 0.6C could be ruled out entirely.  He said: “Attribution studies with careful statistics put random variability (of the climate) as contributing a maximum of around 0.2C. With 1C of warming already, and only halfway to doubling CO2, we can rule out ECS below about 1.5 C already.”  Sherwood wrote: “The analysis by the authors seems to work like magic.  “What is interesting about this fancy curve-fitting exercise is that the authors are doing exactly what mainstream climate scientists have falsely been accused of doing: extrapolating into the future from short past records. “There is much evidence that recent warming is unprecedented, for example ancient ice in various mountain regions such as Peru that is now melting for the first time in millennia. Thus the authors’ conclusion is contradicted by direct physical evidence. Also, the authors are alleging that the climate can exert large natural swings in temperature but is insensitive to heating. This is a contradiction.” Prof David Karoly, a climate scientist at the University of Melbourne, told me the study “appears to be junk science” and listed several major issues with the paper’s methodology. He said the authors had not bothered to describe the detailed method they had used to calculate ECS, adding: “ECS is based on global mean temperature changes and cannot be estimated without the globally averaged temperature estimates first.” “In my view the claimed conclusions are not supported by the methods used and the results are likely to be unreliable,” he said.  So none of this is a surprise.  The IPA, which does not have to reveal its funders, has long pushed climate science denial, while promoting fossil fuels and denigrating renewable energy. It’s what they do.  According to the journal manuscript, Marohasy and Abbot list their affiliations as the IPA and the Climate Modelling Laboratory.  The Climate Modelling Laboratory is a trading name linked to Marohasy’s personal business number.  Abbot also adds James Cook University (JCU) to his list of affiliations.  But a JCU spokesperson told me: “John Abbot is no longer affiliated with James Cook University. He was an adjunct senior research fellow between October 2015 and September 2016.” According to the journal’s website, and confirmed by a journal editor, Abbot and Marohasy submitted their manuscript to the journal in 22 April 2017 – more than six months after Abbot’s affiliation with JCU had ended. I also asked Abbot and Marohasy about the nature of the Climate Modelling Laboratory and the affiliation to JCU but have not had a response.  The journal editor who handled the Abbot paper, Dr Vasile Ersek, of Northumbria University in the UK, said he was “sorry to see it involved in a controversy” but said the article “was reviewed by two independent referees and neither found major flaws with the manuscript”. As I’ve written on Planet Oz before, Marohasy has repeatedly claimed that Australia’s Bureau of Meteorology is deliberately conspiring to tamper with its temperature records with the express intention to make global warming look worse than it is.  Marohasy was also the editor of the IPA’s most recent climate book – a collection of essays from a line-up of climate science deniers and contrarians. The IPA said the book had contributions from “some of the world’s leading experts”. Among these “leading experts” is a New Zealander who has written several New Age-style books on cats (including Pawmistry: How to Read Your Cats Paws) while being the “king of rubber-band magic”."
"A Russian tanker has travelled through the northern sea route in record speed and without an icebreaker escort for the first time, highlighting how climate change is opening up the high Arctic. The $300m (£233m) Christophe de Margerie carried a cargo of liquefied natural gas (LNG) from Hammerfest in Norway to Boryeong in South Korea in 19 days, about 30% quicker than the conventional southern shipping route through the Suez Canal. The tanker was built to take advantage of the diminishing Arctic sea ice and deliver gas from a new $27m facility on the Yamal Peninsula, the biggest Arctic LNG project so far which has been championed by the Russian president, Vladimir Putin. On its maiden voyage, the innovative tanker used its integral icebreaker to cross ice fields 1.2m thick, passing along the northern sea section of the route in the Russian Arctic in a record six-and-a-half days. “It’s very quick, particularly as there was no icebreaker escort which previously there had been in journeys,” said Bill Spears, spokesperson for Sovcomflot, the shipping company which owns the tanker. “It’s very exciting that a ship can go along this route all year round.” Environmentalists have expressed concern over the risks of increased ship traffic in the pristine Arctic but Sovcomflot stressed the tanker’s green credentials. As well as using conventional fuel, the Christophe de Margerie can be powered by the LNG it is transporting, reducing its sulphur oxide emissions by 90% and nitrous oxide emissions by 80% when powered this way. “This is a significant factor in a fragile ecosystem,” said Spears. The northern sea route between Siberia and the Pacific is still closed to conventional shipping for much of the year. But the Christophe de Margerie, the first of 15 such tankers expected to be built, extends the navigation window for the northern sea route from four months with an expensive icebreaker to all year round in a westerly direction. In the route’s busiest year so far, 2013, there were only 15 international crossings but the Russian government predicts that cargo along this route will grow tenfold by 2020. This link with the Pacific reduces its need to sell gas through pipelines to Europe. “There has been a steady increase in traffic in recent years,” said Spears. “There’s always been trade along this route but it’s been restricted a lot by the ice. It’s exciting that this route presents a much shorter alternative than the Suez route. It’s a major saving.” Simon Boxall, an oceanographer at the University of Southampton, said that shipping companies were making a “safe bet” in building ships in anticipation that the northern sea route will open up. “Even if we stopped greenhouse emissions tomorrow, the acceleration in the loss of Arctic ice is unlikely to be reversed,” he said. “We’ve been able to sail through the north-west passage for several years now but the northern passage, which goes past Russia, has opened up on and off since 2010. We’re going to see this route being used more and more by 2020. “The irony is that one advantage of climate change is that we will probably use less fuel going to the Pacific.” The extent of Arctic ice fell to a new wintertime low in March this year after freakishly high temperatures in the polar regions, and hit its second lowest summer extent last September."
"As countries the world over legislate to phase out petrol and diesel cars, attention is turning to the environmental impact of mining the materials needed for electric vehicle batteries. This additional scrutiny has largely focused on ethical concerns with cobalt and lithium supply chains, despite Tesla CEO Elon Musk’s observation last year that the lithium ion batteries his vehicles use are mostly made of nickel and graphite, with lithium itself merely “the salt on the salad”.  But the extraction of nickel – predominately mined in Australia, Canada, Indonesia, Russia and the Philippines – comes at an environmental and health cost.  Plumes of sulphur dioxide choking the skies, churned earth blanketed in cancerous dust, rivers running blood-red – environmental campaigners have painted a grim picture of the nickel mines and smelters feeding the electric vehicle industry. The Philippines this year closed or suspended 17 nickel mines because of environmental concerns. Miners struggling with low nickel prices have welcomed rising demand from an industry that the International Energy Agency estimates will deploy up to 70m electric vehicles by 2025 (pdf).  It is coming on too slowly for some – the Ravensthorpe mine in Western Australia became the latest in a long line of nickel projects to be marked for closure in September. But on the same day in the same state, Anglo-Australian mining giant BHP Billiton unveiled plans for a $43m (£33.5m) processing plant to supply 100,000 tonnes of nickel sulfate per year to the emerging battery market. Carey Smith, a senior analyst at Alto Capital, says BHP Billiton has deep enough pockets to hold on for the electric vehicle boom, but notes it is only doing so after failing to sell its unprofitable Nickel West business due to an estimated A$1bn (£616m) in environmental clean-up liabilities. “They’ve got 40 years worth of slag, which isn’t the cleanest material in world,” Smith says. “It needs to be disposed of carefully, burying it somehow or covering it with clay.” South32, which spun-off from BHP Billiton in 2015, runs the Cerro Matoso mine in Colombia, where residents of nearby communities and mine workers have reported elevated rates of deformities and respiratory problems associated with exposure to pollution generated by nickel mining and smelting (pdf). A BHP Billiton spokesperson told the Guardian all the company’s projects met environmental approval requirements. Dr David Santillo, a senior scientist at Greenpeace Research Laboratories, says : “The mining of nickel-rich ores themselves, combined with their crushing and transportation by conveyor belt, truck or train, can generate high loadings of dust in the air, dust that itself contains high concentrations of potentially toxic metals, including nickel itself, copper, cobalt and chromium. “We have to get smarter at recovering and reusing the vast quantities that we have already extracted from the earth, rather than relying on continued pursuit of new reserves of ever poorer quality and at substantial environmental cost.”  French carmaker Renault, producer of the Zoe, Europe’s best-selling electric vehicle in 2016, said that it recycles almost 70% of the battery weight, although did not specify what proportion of nickel is recycled.  Tesla claims that the nickel in its vehicles is 100% reusable at the end of life, but refused to disclose to the Guardian where the nickel in its car batteries is sourced from.  In a statement a Tesla spokesperson said suppliers were “three or four layers removed from Tesla. It is obviously quite difficult to have perfect knowledge about everything that happens this far down in the supply chain, but we’ve worked extremely hard to gather as much information as possible and to ensure that our standards are being met.” Robert Baylis, from the mining consultancy Roskill, says entering the electric vehicle supply chain will see nickel miners attract additional scrutiny over carbon emissions. A 2009 study published in PLOS One concluded that the global warming potential of mining and processing nickel was the eighth highest of 63 metals over the previous year. However, a 2016 Union of Concerned Scientists study (pdf) found that the manufacture and operation of electric vehicles produced less than half the carbon emissions of comparable petrol and diesel-powered vehicles.  Russian mining giant Norilsk Nickel has responded to pressure on carbon emissions and claims to have reduced its use of coal-fired energy by 49% in 2016 (pdf). “It is of strategic importance to us as a key player in the supply chain that is enabling the growth of electric vehicles and clean energy solutions,” says Larisa Zelkova, vice-president at Norilsk Nickel. The company has a lot of ground to make up – its home city of Norilsk is rated one of the most polluted cities in the world, thanks largely to the 350,000 tonnes of sulphur dioxide emitted annually by the city’s nickel factory, which was decommissioned last year. In 2016, Norilsk Nickel made headlines when an overflow of oxidised nickel waste turned the city’s Daldykan river red.  Andy Whitmore of the London Mining Network, a coalition of anti-mining campaign groups, says nickel producers should sign up to international standards such as the Initiative on Responsible Mining Assurance. “I am not sure that nickel has got the attention it deserves,” he says. “Although the mining industry has responded to its critics over the years, mainly we would argue by changes in policies rather than true change in practice, I don’t believe the pressure around [electric] cars has made a difference to date.”"
"“Hope is essential – despair is just another form of denial,” Al Gore said last week, in an interview to promote the sequel to his 2006 climate change documentary An Inconvenient Truth. As well as the very bad news of Donald Trump’s science-denying presidency, An Inconvenient Sequel: Truth to Power, which opens in the UK today, brings good news: the plummeting cost of renewable electricity and the 2015 Paris climate agreement. In 2017, denial of the facts of climate change – and myriad linked dangers including air and ocean pollution, famine and a refugee crisis the likes of which we can hardly imagine – is in retreat, with the Trump administration the malignant exception. Virtually all governments know that climate change is happening, and polls show most people do too – with those living in Latin America and sub-Saharan Africa particularly worried. The question is not whether global warming is happening, but what we are going to do about it. There are, and need to be, many answers to this. Gore believes the solutions to climate change are within reach, if people can only find the political will to enact them. Even if how to whip up sufficient zeal to make this happen remains a puzzle, his essential message is one of optimism.  Others are less sanguine. A widely shared article by David Wallace-Wells in New York magazine last month sketching out some worst-case scenarios included an interview with pioneering climate scientist Wally Broecker, now 84, who no longer believes even the most drastic reductions in carbon emissions are sufficient to avert disaster. Instead, he puts his hopes in carbon capture and geoengineering. Others oppose anything that smacks of a techno-fix, believing the very idea that human ingenuity can get us out of this mess is yet another form of denial. The human reaction – or lack of one – to climate change is a subject of interest in itself. The novelist Amitav Ghosh wrote The Great Derangement, a book about why fiction writers mostly ignore the subject, and argued that the profound alteration of Earth’s climate is difficult to think about. Wallace-Wells, in New York magazine, refers to “an incredible failure of imagination”. Politics, supposed to help us make sense of the world, has sometimes been more hindrance than help: is climate change really an inconvenient truth, because it means we have to give up eating beef and taking long-distance flights, or a too-convenient truth for anti-capitalists who want to bring down the financial system? Such left-right binarism, and the relentlessly partisan nature of US politics, is surely why Gore now prefers to frame climate change more as a “moral” issue than as a political one. But the clearest and simplest message from his decade of advocacy is the need for action at every level. Such action takes many forms, ranging from protests against the Dakota Access pipeline in the US to anti-fracking demonstrations in Lancashire. This year the Guardian in conjunction with Global Witness is documenting the deaths of people all over the world who are killed while attempting to defend the environment from damage or destruction. In a similar vein, the Natural History Museum has chosen its revamped central hall to showcase a key moment for environmental activism. When it was first announced that Dippy the dinosaur would be replaced with a blue whale skeleton that had previously hung quietly among the mammals, there were grumbles. But a month after its grand reopening in the presence of royalty and Sir David Attenborough, the revamped museum is a smash hit with more than 115,000 visitors a week. Partly this is because the installation of the skeleton brings Alfred Waterhouse’s 1870s terracotta building, with its marvellous moulded monkeys, back to life in the most magnificent way. Whereas visitors once mostly stuck to the ground floor until they joined the procession to the dinosaurs, the aerial position of the whale bones now draws people upstairs. From an overcrowded lobby, Hintze Hall has been raised into a wondrous public space. But the whale, which died as a result of being stranded off the coast of Ireland in 1891, is more than a 19th-century relic. What the museum has done by giving this vast, dead creature such prominence is to issue a warning and a call to action. And it makes no bones about this: “Rescued from the brink of extinction in the 1960s, the blue whale is a symbol of hope for the future of the natural world,” says the information panel. “Threats such as marine pollution and climate change linger – the blue whale remains a vulnerable and endangered species.” Like the hole in the ozone layer over Antarctica, which stopped growing after a 1987 treaty phased out chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs), whale conservation is one of the global environmental movement’s greatest success stories. Blue whales were critically endangered, until activists persuaded governments to legislate to save them, and the museum’s new exhibit is called Hope. Optimism alone won’t halt climate change, or prevent further extinctions. But like Gore, the director of the Natural History Museum, Michael Dixon, and his colleagues understand that the most vital currency of the environmental movement is hope. With the knowledge we now have of climate change’s likely consequences, the alternative is nihilism. • Susanna Rustin is a Guardian columnist"
"Donald Trump’s decision to pull the US out of the historic Paris climate agreement and turn his back on the other 194 countries that signed it leaves him isolated on the world stage. But Trump is also isolated from the very Americans he purports to lead, and here lies hope. Across America, families, businesses, churches, institutions and governments are busy building a clean energy future. And no president can stop that. When he announced he was pulling the US out of the Paris Accord, Trump said: “I was elected to represent the people of Pittsburgh, not Paris.” And that prompted the mayor of Pittsburgh to join other American mayors – more than 100 so far – in affirming his city’s commitment to move to 100% renewable energy.  This reflects the fact that the people of Pittsburgh – and Philadelphia and Phoenix and Salt Lake City and towns and rural areas across America – want clean energy in their backyards. In liberal areas and conservative ones, Americans are transforming the way they power their lives as we move to 100% clean energy for all. Consider Buffalo, in upstate New York. Once an industrial powerhouse dotted with manufacturing and steel mill factories, it lost half its population in the second half of the 20th century and became the third-poorest big city in the United States.  It is home to exactly the kind of “forgotten” people Trump talked about on the campaign trail. In a city featuring old houses and tough winters, heating bills regularly cost more than rent for some. But in a once blighted area on the West Side, hundreds of residents are working with Push Buffalo – an organization Rahwa helps run – to weatherproof homes, install solar energy systems and build a stronger community, all while training local residents for good jobs in the emerging green economy. On the other side of the country, California’s Asian Pacific Environmental Network organized in eight different languages, from Korean to Cantonese, to secure $2bn for solar development in low-income housing projects.  And in South Los Angeles, a community group called Strategic Concepts in Organizing and Policy Education – Scope – is helping black, Latino and low-income communities of color take advantage of economic and job opportunities in the growing clean-energy economy. But it’s not just city communities that are building a clean energy future that has the power to blunt the worst effects of climate change. So are rural American states, including states whose people voted for Trump.  Iowa produced over 36% of its electricity from wind power last year – a bigger share than any other state. South Dakota gets almost 70% of its electricity from water and wind. In Kansas, wind energy has grown from less than 1% of the state’s electricity generation in 2005 to 24% in 2015. American businesses get it, too. Just ask Boeing, whose South Carolina airplane factory is powered by 100% renewable energy. Walmart, General Motors and other major US corporations are major customers for renewable power. In our work with the Solutions Project and Push Buffalo, we have seen how clean and efficient energy projects are everywhere, from universities to churches, from factories to farms and from military bases to shopping malls. Combatting climate change is an important motivation for many of these efforts. But we’ve seen that even Americans who don’t “believe” in climate change are embracing renewable energy. Some of them value cleaner air; others value energy independence and national security and others are called to care for creation. Simplifying it all is the economics: as renewables become as affordable as fossil fuels – and even more affordable – they become more common, and economies of scale make them cheaper still. And people in America are not only embracing these lower bills. They are embracing community ownership of renewable energy infrastructure, creating good local jobs and building local wealth. Their vision is to transform America’s energy economy from a draining and extractive model to a regenerative and sustainable model that makes communities – and the nation – stronger. Time and again, Donald Trump has promised to help forgotten, hard-hit Americans. But trying to hold back the rising tide of clean energy will not help them – and it won’t work, anyway. If Trump truly cared about making life better for the people he was elected to lead, he would join his fellow Americans – and the rest of the world – in building a prosperous, sustainable clean energy future. The people of this country will keep helping themselves – to renewable energy. They are putting this country and their communities first, in a way that also serves the planet. The US and the rest of the world will continue our historic march to clean energy for all – no matter who’s in the White House. Rahwa Ghirmatzion is deputy director of Push Buffalo, a local membership-based community organization fighting to make affordable housing and a just transition to clean energy a reality Mark Ruffalo is an actor and the co-founder of the Solutions Project, which works to accelerate the transition to 100% clean, renewable energy for all people and purposes"
"The fate of the giant iceberg that broke free from Antarctica’s Larsen C ice shelf last month has been revealed. Twice the size of Luxembourg, the trillion-tonne iceberg known as A68 was found to have broken off the ice shelf on 12 July after months of speculation about a rift which had been growing for years, with the iceberg “hanging by a thread” for weeks. In terms of size, it’s fairly big. This is a 5,800 sq km iceberg - that’s twice the size of Luxembourg, or roughly the area of Delaware. While that doesn’t make it the largest iceberg on record - that gong goes to an iceberg that broke away from the Ross ice shelf in 2000 - it is one of the biggest. It is also exciting for the technological advances that have allowed scientists to regularly track the development of the rift, monitoring its growth down to 1km resolution. But in terms of its impact, the event is less dramatic: the iceberg itself won’t result in a sea level rise, and scientists say there is no evidence its formation is down to climate change. But, they note, the release of the iceberg might make the rest of the Larsen C ice shelf less stable. Collapse of the Larsen C ice shelf would remove buttressing from glaciers, meaning they could flow faster into the sea, eventually resulting in sea level rises. Only time will tell what the full impact of the birth of the new iceberg will be. At 5,800 sq km it is one of the largest icebergs ever recorded, with its calving leaving the Larsen C ice shelf about 12% smaller in area and at its lowest known extent. “The really interesting thing is that it didn’t just break through in one clean shot, it formed a lace-network of cracks first and then we were all waiting on tenterhooks to see which one would be the final pathway,” said Dr Anna Hogg, an expert in satellite observations of glaciers at the University of Leeds and member of the Centre for Polar Observation and Modelling.  Now scientists say the iceberg has spawned further lumps of ice.  Based on radar data from the European Space Agency’s  Sentinel-1 mission, Hogg says there are now at least 11 smaller icebergs floating near A68 – fragments thought to have broken off the enormous tablet of ice, or from the Larsen C ice shelf itself, possibly as a result of A68 bumping against the shelf. “I am calling them ‘small bergy bits’ but the largest ones are bigger than 10km long, which is actually a colossal piece of ice in its own right,” said Hogg.  And the remaining cracks in the ice shelf have not remained static either. “They have continued to grow and extend a bit still,” she said. “Since the iceberg has broken free there has still been some continuing activity on the remaining ice shelf so we are really interested to continue to monitor that.” What’s more, the iceberg appears to have drifted away from the ice shelf, with a gap of about five kilometres now visible between the two. “That would suggest that [the iceberg] is floating in the ocean – it is not currently grounded,” said Hogg, adding that there are a number of options for the future of A68: it may break up into smaller pieces, get pushed around by the winds, or be steered by the ocean currents. “We think that this berg is about 200 metres thick of ice, and of course 90% of that is beneath the ocean surface, so it is possible it could become grounded,” she added. The latest update comes as Hogg and her colleague Hilmar Gudmundsson from the British Antarctic Survey release a commentary in the journal Nature Climate Change exploring the implications of the loss of such huge icebergs on the future stability of ice shelves like Larsen C.  The new data, says Hogg, shows that the remaining forking cracks in the Larsen C ice shelf are growing in the direction of a feature known as the Bawden Ice Rise – an outpost which supports the ice shelf, a little like scaffolding, or the pillar of a building’s facade. Should the cracks continue in a straight line and the ice shelf break around such a point, she adds, the support would be lost, a result that could greatly reduce the ability of the ice shelf to act as a buttress, and hold back the flow of glaciers into the sea. “If the ice that is resting on those pinning points does break off, that is definitely a concern,” said Hogg. But experts including Hogg have been quick to point out that calving events like that which occurred in July are part of the natural life cycle of an ice shelf and are not necessarily influenced by climate change."
"The central highlands of Afghanistan are a world away from the congested chaos of the country’s cities. Hills roll across colossal, uninhabited spaces fringed by snow-flecked mountains, set against blistering blue skies. In this spectacular, harsh landscape, one can pinpoint more or less where human settlement becomes impossible: at an altitude of 3,000 metres (9,840ft).  This is where Aziza’s family lives, in the village of Borghason. In a good year, they just about survive by cultivating wheat and potatoes for food and a small income. However, when the rains fail, as they increasingly do, the family is plunged into debt, unable to reimburse merchants for that year’s seeds. “Last year, we had to borrow money from the bazaar,” Aziza says. Things are about to get tougher. The precariousness of life in Bamiyan, one of Afghanistan’s poorest provinces, leaves villages like Borghason at the mercy of climate change. On a recent visit, the Guardian trekked from freshwater lakes surrounded by jagged massifs at 4,500 metres down to villages at the receiving end of erratic weather, a common result of global warming. Warmer temperatures melt the mountain snow earlier, resulting in an increased flow of water before farmers need it. These are irregularities that farmers living at the margins of economic sustainability cannot afford. “People are surviving,” says Andrew Scanlon, country director for the UN Environment Programme (UNEP). “[But] their ability to bounce back is almost zilch.” Farmers say unanimously that temperatures have risen over the past decades. Rain is scarcer and more unpredictable. “People know about climate change even if they don’t call it that,” says Fatima Akbari, the UNEP’s country assistant. “They know all about change in water and weather.” Despite 15 years as one of the world’s biggest receivers of international aid, much of it to agriculture, Afghanistan remains woefully underdeveloped and largely defenceless against jolts from nature. Western donors primarily poured money into short-sighted programmes such as heavy engineering and cash-for-work schemes, designed for “quick impact”, Scanlon says. “Soldiers and engineers were on six-month contracts and needed to quickly win hearts and minds,” he adds. Governments and engineers got accustomed to short time frames. Meanwhile, little was done to build long-term resilience. Winning hearts and minds was meant to win the war, yet climate change endangers that elusive victory. Although research on the topic in Afghanistan is limited to small-scale anthropological analyses, studies from Iraq and elsewhere link global warming and security. According to the UNEP, about 80% of conflicts in Afghanistan are related to resources like land and water – and to food insecurity, an immediate consequence of global warming. According to a report by the UNEP, the World Food Programme and the National Environmental Protection Agency (NEPA), the biggest climate hazards to Afghan livelihoods are drought and floods, caused by irregular snowmelt or rainfall. Bamiyan is one of the places most at risk, but also the source of environmental problems elsewhere. The mountains in Shah Foladi, one of four recognised national parks, feed both the Kabul basin and the Helmand river, which runs south for 700 miles (1,126km). In Helmand, water has instigated conflict for decades and been central to foreign intervention since the early cold war, when the US got involved in irrigation projects. Despite fighting a worsening war against insurgents, the Afghan government seems, to an extent, aware of the need to address the risks of global warming. “In the region, Afghanistan is the most vulnerable country facing the ravages of climate change,” says Prince Mostapha Zaher, grandson of the former king Mohammad Zahir Shah and director general of the NEPA. Zaher, a trained microbiologist and a forceful presence, has entered Afghanistan into 14 international environmental conventions since 2005. Still, the government’s priorities appear to fall short of his ambitions. Zaher describes the NEPA, which is not an actual ministry, as a “fledgling agency on a shoestring budget”. He has spearheaded efforts to protect Afghanistan’s extraordinary biodiversity by helping to name four areas as national parks. In June, marking World Environment Day, a wetlands site inside the city of Kabul became the latest. Kol-e-Hashmat Khan is a stopover for migratory birds of “world-class importance” and is visited by 150 species each year, according to the UNEP. Threats to the site come not just from the climate but from humans, too. Garbage is piled high on the water’s edge. One-fourth of the site’s nearly 200 hectares have been grabbed by “strongmen”, who burn reeds and erect cream-coloured villas jutting from the banks. “Afghanistan is one of the most biodiverse countries in the world,” says Scanlon, adding that the country boasts about 3,000 endemic plants, almost four times more than Europe. National biodiversity is another victim of international donors, such as USAid, that subsidise fertiliser and pesticides to Afghan farmers, and have used pesticides to eradicate poppies. Scanlon says international agencies generally have a “poor understanding” of Afghanistan’s natural riches. “I still speak to high-ranking officials from the World Bank, EU and other UN agencies who think Afghanistan is a desert, absolutely devoid of ecological value,” he adds. In Bamiyan, the UNEP works to promote sustainable farming. In the village of Khoshgak, farmers used to cultivate the hills to take advantage of rainfall, but that drained them of all nourishment. Now, by collecting water in concrete basins fed by underground pipes, they grow apricots, barley and potatoes in the valley. “Before, there was nothing here. It was scorched,” says Haji Qadir, a village elder, from his neatly manicured garden. Still, he remembers the valley of his childhood being more fertile. “The air used to be cleaner, not full of dust like now.” Women are particularly affected by erratic weather. In Borghason, when the rains fail, farmers switch crops from barley to wheat, which is less ideal as livestock feed, says Chaman, an older woman in the village. As a result, women – who are tasked with fetching water and tending livestock – have longer distances to hike. Villages in Bamiyan exemplify how climate change can hamper the ability of families to sustain themselves. According to Prince Zaher, they show why global warming should be taken as seriously as fighting insurgents. “Terrorism is not going to be lingering here for ever,” he says. “But climate change is an ongoing death sentence.” • This article was amended on 30 August 2017. An earlier version said Bamiyan was the “epicentre” of the region’s environmental problems. Bamiyan is one of the places most at risk, but also the source of environmental problems elsewhere."

"Staff at the US Department of Agriculture (USDA) have been told to avoid using the term climate change in their work, with the officials instructed to reference “weather extremes” instead. A series of emails obtained by the Guardian between staff at the Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS), a USDA unit that oversees farmers’ land conservation, show that the incoming Trump administration has had a stark impact on the language used by some federal employees around climate change. A missive from Bianca Moebius-Clune, director of soil health, lists terms that should be avoided by staff and those that should replace them. “Climate change” is in the “avoid” category, to be replaced by “weather extremes”. Instead of “climate change adaption”, staff are asked to use “resilience to weather extremes”. The primary cause of human-driven climate change is also targeted, with the term “reduce greenhouse gases” blacklisted in favor of “build soil organic matter, increase nutrient use efficiency”. Meanwhile, “sequester carbon” is ruled out and replaced by “build soil organic matter”. In her email to staff, dated 16 February this year, Moebius-Clune said the new language was given to her staff and suggests it be passed on. She writes that “we won’t change the modeling, just how we talk about it – there are a lot of benefits to putting carbon back in the sail [sic], climate mitigation is just one of them”, and that a colleague from USDA’s public affairs team gave advice to “tamp down on discretionary messaging right now”. In contrast to these newly contentious climate terms, Moebius-Clune wrote that references to economic growth, emerging business opportunities in the rural US, agro-tourism and “improved aesthetics” should be “tolerated if not appreciated by all”. In a separate email to senior employees on 24 January, just days after Trump’s inauguration, Jimmy Bramblett, deputy chief for programs at the NRCS, said: “It has become clear one of the previous administration’s priority is not consistent with that of the incoming administration. Namely, that priority is climate change. Please visit with your staff and make them aware of this shift in perspective within the executive branch.” Bramblett added that “prudence” should be used when discussing greenhouse gases and said the agency’s work on air quality regarding these gases could be discontinued.  Other emails show the often agonized discussions between staff unsure of what is forbidden. On 16 February, a staffer named Tim Hafner write to Bramblett: “I would like to know correct terms I should use instead of climate changes and anything to do with carbon ... I want to ensure to incorporate correct terminology that the agency has approved to use.” On 5 April, Suzanne Baker, a New York-based NRCS employee, emailed a query as to whether staff are “allowed to publish work from outside the USDA that use ‘climate change’”. A colleague advises that the issue be determined in a phone call. Some staff weren’t enamored with the new regime, with one employee stating on an email on 5 July that “we would prefer to keep the language as is” and stressing the need to maintain the “scientific integrity of the work”. In a statement, USDA said that on 23 January it had issued “interim operating procedures outlining procedures to ensure the new policy team has an opportunity to review policy-related statements, legislation, budgets and regulations prior to issuance”. The statement added: “This guidance, similar to procedures issued by previous administrations, was misinterpreted by some to cover data and scientific publications. This was never the case and USDA interim procedures will allow complete, objective information for the new policy staff reviewing policy decisions.” Kaveh Sadeghzadeh of the Natural Resources Conservation Service added that his organisation “has not received direction from USDA or the administration to modify its communications on climate change or any other topic”.  Trump has repeatedly questioned the veracity of climate change research, infamously suggesting that it is part of an elaborate Chinese hoax. The president has started the process of withdrawing the US from the Paris climate agreement, has instructed the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to scrap or amend various regulations aimed at cutting greenhouse gases, and has moved to open up more public land and waters to fossil fuel activity. The nomenclature of the federal government has also shifted as these new priorities have taken hold. Mentions of the dangers of climate change have been removed from the websites of the White House and the Department of the Interior, while the EPA scrapped its entire online climate section in April pending a review that will be “updating language to reflect the approach of new leadership”. “These records reveal Trump’s active censorship of science in the name of his political agenda,” said Meg Townsend, open government attorney at the Center for Biological Diversity. “To think that federal agency staff who report about the air, water and soil that sustains the health of our nation must conform their reporting with the Trump administration’s anti-science rhetoric is appalling and dangerous for America and the greater global community.” The Center for Biological Diversity is currently suing several government agencies, including the EPA and state department, to force them to release information on the “censoring” of climate change verbiage. While some of the changes to government websites may have occurred anyway, the emails from within the USDA are the clearest indication yet that staff have been instructed to steer clear of acknowledging climate change or its myriad consequences. US agriculture is a major source of heat-trapping gases, with 15% of the country’s emissions deriving from farming practices. A USDA plan to address the “far reaching” impacts of climate change is still online.  However, Sam Clovis, Trump’s nomination to be the USDA’s chief scientist, has labeled climate research “junk science”. Last week it was revealed that Clovis, who is not a scientist, once ran a blog where he called progressives “race traders and race ‘traitors’” and likened Barack Obama to a “communist”."
"ExxonMobil has knowingly misled the public for decades about the danger climate change poses to a warming world and the oil giant’s long-term viability, according to a peer-reviewed study. An analysis of nearly 200 documents spanning decades found that four-fifths of scientific studies and internal memos acknowledged global warming was real and caused by humans.  At the same time a similar proportion of hundreds of paid editorials in major US newspapers over the same period cast deep doubt on these widely accepted facts. The study also cites ExxonMobil calculations that capping global warming at under 2C – the goal enshrined in the landmark Paris climate accord – would impose sharp limits on the amount of fossil fuels that could be burned, and thus potentially affect the firm’s growth. Both findings are relevant to ongoing investigations by state and federal attorneys general, along with the Securities and Exchange Commission, on whether the company deceived investors on how it accounts for climate change risk. The new study was published on Wednesday in the journal Environmental Research Letters. Earlier reporting by InsideClimate News unearthed the internal documents and came to much the same conclusion. In response, the company – the largest oil producer in the United States, with revenue of $218bn last year – denied having led a four-decade disinformation campaign. Exxon spokesman Scott Silvestri called the latest study “inaccurate and preposterous” and said the researchers’ goal was to attack the company’s reputation at the expense of its shareholders. “Our statements have been consistent with our understanding of climate science,” he said. The company also criticised journalists for having allegedly “cherry-picked” data in a way that unfairly put the company in a bad light, but the new study pushed back on that claim. “We looked at the whole cherry tree,” Geoffrey Supran, a researcher at Harvard University and co-author of the study, told AFP. “Using social science methods, we found a gaping, systematic discrepancy between what Exxon said about climate change in private and academic circles, and what is said to the public.” As early as 1979, when climate change barely registered as an issue for the public, Exxon was sounding internal alarms. “The most widely held theory is that... the increase in atmospheric CO2 is due to fossil fuel combustion,” an internal memo from that year read. A peer-reviewed study by Exxon scientists 17 years later concluded that “the body of evidence... now points towards a discernable human influence on global climate”. At the same time, however, the company was spending tens of millions of dollars to place editorials in the New York Times and other influential newspapers that delivered a very different message. “Let’s face it: The science of climate change is too uncertain to mandate a plan of action that could plunge economies into turmoil,” Exxon said in 1997, as the Bill Clinton administration faced overwhelming opposition in Congress to US ratification of the Kyoto Protocol. Natasha Lamb, managing partner of investment management firm Arjuna Capital, said the new analysis could bolster the lawsuits accusing ExxonMobil of deliberately downplaying climate change risks. “The Harvard research shows systemic bias in sowing public doubt, while acknowledging the risks privately,” she said after reviewing the study’s main findings. “That is at the heart of the investigations.” Lamb’s firm filed the first shareholder proposal in 2013 asking ExxonMobil to assess whether imposing a 2C limit on warming would result in the company not being able to exploit its reserves. Those efforts were swatted down, but four years later a decisive 62% of shareholders called on ExxonMobil, in a non-binding vote last May, to detail how climate change will affect its future. In three other lawsuits, coastal communities in California are suing 37 oil, gas and coal companies, including ExxonMobil. Marin and San Mateo counties, along with the city of Imperial Beach, assert that these fossil fuel purveyors knew their product would cause sea level rise and coastal flooding but took no action to inform the public or curtail their carbon emissions. The new study “confirms some of the central tenets of our cases,” said Vic Sher, a senior partner at Sher Edling and a lawyer in the case. “We will prove that Exxon and the fossil fuel industry knew for decades that greenhouse gas pollution would cause warming of the air and oceans, sea level rise, and other consequences,” he told AFP. “The industry engaged in deception and denial while aggressively marketing and making enormous profits.”  "
" An Australian pilot project capturing carbon emissions and storing them in building materials aims to have a full-scale production plant by 2020. Mineral Carbonation International, an Australian company developing carbon-utilisation technology will officially launch its technology and research program at the Newcastle Institute for Energy and Resources on Friday. The launch will include a demonstration of the hour-long process bonding CO2 - stored in large cylinders at one end of the warehouse - with crushed serpentinite from the nearby Orica Kooragang Island operation, permanently converting it into solid carbonates. “This mimics but greatly speeds up the natural weathering by rainfall which produces common types of rocks over millions of years,” MCI said. “These carbonates and silica by-products have the potential to be used in building products such as concrete and plasterboard to create green construction materials.” By 2020 MCI hopes to be producing 20,000 to 50,000 tonnes of the bonded material for building companies, and said it anticipates the process will be economically viable even without a high carbon price. “There is a big demand among consumers for green building products,” said Marcus Dawe, chief executive of MCI. “The interest around the carbon brick has been extraordinary, but we’re going beyond that.” In May the federal government said it would lift restrictions on the Clean Energy Finance Corporation to allow it to invest in carbon capture technology. Similar initiatives around the world include a Canadian company making synthetic gasoline out of CO2 and hydrogen gas, and a US company manufacturing plastic products from methane gas. Dawe said serpentinite was a readily available “feedstock” to absorb CO2, found around the world. “Nowhere in the world had anyone scaled up enough to create enough material to give to manufacturers, to experiment and test them and find out what products they can make from them,” he said. “This is all about getting them to a scale and getting them as economical as we can.” He said a decade of research and development had worked towards reducing the cost of carbonation, but conceded there were environmental concerns with mining serpentinite. There were concerns about the environmental impact of any mining operation he said, but this process was “the only thing on scale to deal with the CO2 problem we have”. He said the material could also be used to safely store carbon and backfill mines and quarries. “As much as possible we want to make this an environmental solution,” he said. “It really is the end state for carbon.” Dawe said he saw the biggest potential for the process in the four billion tonnes of cement made around the world each year. However environmental scientists and former chief climate commissioner, Tim Flannery, said there was already an acceptable substitution – fly ash and bottom ash from coal fired power stations – to make cement. “I think it’s more likely we’ll be mining that to make negative carbon concrete and cement,” he said. “One of the big problems is the coal-fired power stations charge people to take their waste away. Under a different regime you could be encouraging the uptake of that.” Flannery also noted the energy cost of mining and transporting serpentinite, and said the cost of building and operating renewable power sources would soon be cheaper than running a coal-fired power station. Prof Peter Cook, geologist and professorial fellow at the University of Melbourne, said the technology was a viable process and would be a contribution to reducing carbon emissions, but the difficulty was in the scale required. “We need to be realistic about it, it’s not going to be the solution to the problem of global warming and climate change,” he said. “I’m sure it will work chemically, and they’ve shown that it does. The issues is the extent to which you can deploy it.” He said he was not diminishing the “great” value in what MCI was doing. “The difficulty is just the scale of the issue that we’re facing,” he said. “I think it’s one of these processes where you’ll be able to make money from it in the local area. The difficulty is, for instance we’re getting 36bn tonnes of CO2 per annum from our use of fossil fuel. It’s important to keep that sort of number in mind when you think about the scale of the thing.”"
"Everyone has mummy issues these days – including climate scientists. A recent study made headlines by suggesting that the number-one thing a person can do to reduce their carbon footprint is to have fewer children. Right on cue, a neo-Malthusian chorus seized on the study as another opportunity to shame women for their reproductive choices. Averting climate catastrophe is a collective responsibility – but it’s far more comfortable to blame your mother, or someone else’s, for every social ill. I’ve just crossed the invisible rubicon between the age when you’re shamed and terrified out of the very idea of breeding and the age when you’re coerced and cajoled into it – if you have a uterus, of course. If you don’t, you can pretty much sit back and wait for some woman to do the donkey work of organising your genetic legacy, safe in the knowledge that you’re unlikely to be judged on your reproductive choices. I’m consistently taken aback by the number of men my age and older who speak offhandedly about their “future children”, without having planned in the slightest for the arrival of these notional sprogs – simply assuming that it’ll happen someday, when they’ve had time to dedicate themselves to their life’s work.  “Environmental concerns” are, of course, a reasonable excuse for the decision not to reproduce. But why should we need excuses? Speaking as a 30-year-old woman with no current plans to procreate, I profoundly resent the constant reminders about the apparently deafening ticking of my “biological clock”. The insistence that I produce either a baby or a bloody good excuse is unremitting, from friends, strangers, internet busybodies and advertising algorithms trying to sell me pregnancy tests and nappy rash cream. I find it a dispiriting example of gendered double standards, but mostly I find it goddamned rude. I’ve got my deflections and explanations lined up, the weary reassurances that I love babies and can’t wait to be an auntie – but the truth is much simpler. The truth is that I just don’t want to. I can’t be bothered. It looks like a huge amount of work, and I’ve already got a lot on, but even if I didn’t, I shouldn’t have to say anything more than “I don’t want to”. Nobody should. In this, as in every other question affecting women’s basic bodily autonomy, “no” ought to mean “no” – and “no further questions”. Nobody should be peer pressured into pregnancy – babies, after all, are rather like hard drugs, in that once you’ve had one, it’s surprisingly hard to simply put it down and walk away. That tends to be frowned upon, and not just by the baby. You can’t just dabble in these things. And having a baby can be a gateway that turns into something more serious, like having a toddler or, in extreme cases, a teenager. Motherhood is a matter of consent. It is now generally understood that pressuring women and girls to have sex is unacceptable. Why, then, is it OK to pressure us into having kids? Why, for that matter, is it OK to pressure us out of it? Why should any pregnant woman have to apologise for the pitter-patter of tiny carbon footprints – at least until the parsimonious old hypocrites running the world have actually committed to not cooking the human race to death. For most millennials, of course, this is still a distressingly academic question. Women in their late 20s and early 30s are increasingly delaying motherhood for the simple reason that we can’t afford it, leading to some stern admonitions about social responsibility and the future of the welfare state from those who might have been better placed ensuring we still had one. The problem is that right now, women “of childbearing age” are very often, and rather more urgently, of rent-paying age and have accumulated fifty grand’s worth of student debt. By this stage, we’ve had 20 years of teachers and tabloids warning us against the indulgence of having kids we can’t afford. What’s a millennial girl to do? If we don’t have kids, we’re selfish; if we do, we’re thoughtless harlots out to drain hard-working male taxpayers of their beer money. During the age of Enlightenment, revolutionary thinkers upended society with the notion that every man has a right to individual liberty and autonomy. Almost all of them stopped short at extending the same courtesy to women, whose main duty was still to endure repeated and dangerous pregnancies. Women were expected to raise and bear autonomous individuals, not become them. Even Mary Wollstonecraft, one of the finest thinkers of the 18th century, backed up her salvo for female intellectual worth by arguing that education would make women better mothers. We’ll never know if motherhood itself might have changed her mind – Wollstonecraft died in childbirth. More than 200 years later, we are still blaming mothers for everything that’s wrong with the world, apparently including climate change. The modern ideal of motherhood still burdens women with most of the responsibility for social reproduction and almost none of the power. We’re expected to meet impossible standards of childrearing without inconveniencing our employers or our fellow citizens. We’re still expected to quietly get on with it. I’m not sure that’s good enough anymore. If we want to grow up as a society, we’ve got to get over our mummy issues. If we want to ensure that the next generation arrives healthy and on schedule, we could always buck the historical trend and actually trust women. We could abandon shame and coercion, and give women choices. Real choices, choices that come with resources to back them up. We could make childcare a common good, and housing a public right. We could make contraceptive, reproductive and maternal healthcare available to anyone who needs it. We could recognise, finally, that bearing and raising children is not a sacred duty. It is not biological destiny. It is work – hard, real, important work, work that should be chosen freely, or not at all. • Bitch Doctrine: Essays for Consenting Adults is published by Bloomsbury."

"Tony de Brum, the former Marshall Islands foreign minister who became a leading advocate for the landmark Paris Agreement and an internationally recognised voice in the fight against climate change, has died aged 72. De Brum, who was also the Pacific nation’s climate ambassador, died on Tuesday in the capital Majuro surrounded by his family, according to Marshall Islands President Hilda Heine.   After witnessing nuclear testing in the islands while growing up, de Brum also fought against nuclear weapons and for his nation’s independence. Heine described him as a national hero. “The very existence of the Paris Agreement owes a lot to Tony de Brum,” Heine said in a statement. “He was a giant of history, a legend in every meaning of the word, and a custodian of our shared future.” Although the Marshall Islands, population 70,000, remains one of the places most vulnerable to climate change because it protrudes just 2 meters (6 feet) above sea level, de Brum said in 2015 at the time that he was determined to stay and fight. De Brum’s own island home of Majuro has slipped beneath the waters. All that remains at low tide is a pile of rocks. “The thought of evacuation is repulsive to us,” he said. “We think that the more reasonable thing to do is to seek to end this madness, this climate madness, where people think that smaller, vulnerable countries are expendable and therefore they can continue to do business as usual.” Heine said de Brum was out fishing with his grandfather at age 9 when he witnessed the horrors of “Bravo shot,” a US thermonuclear test at Bikini Atoll. Born in Tuvalu, de Brum became one of the first Marshallese to attend university and returned home to become a leading participant in negotiations that secured the nation’s compact of free association with the US and membership to the United Nations. Heine said de Brum remained committed to the cause of nuclear justice and global disarmament, as well as climate change. During the negotiations for the Paris accord, de Brum helped form the High Ambition Coalition of 100 rich and poor nations and helped secure a global commitment to try to limit Earth’s warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit) compared to pre-industrial times. The US signed up for the accord under President Barack Obama but President Donald Trump announced in June that the nation would withdraw."
"Approximately one-quarter of Americans identify as evangelical Christians, and that group also tends to be more resistant to the reality of human-caused global warming. As a new paper by Brian Webb and Doug Hayhoe notes: a 2008 study found that just 44% of evangelicals believed global warming to be caused mostly by human activities, compared to 64% of nonevangelicals (Smith and Leiserowitz, 2013) while, a 2011 survey found that only 27% of white evangelicals believed there to be a scientific consensus on climate change, compared to 40% of the American public (Public Religion Research Institute, 2011).  These findings appear to stem from two primary factors. First, evangelicals tend to be socially and politically conservative, and climate change is among the many issues that have become politically polarized in America. Second, there is sometimes a perceived conflict between science and religion, as Christians distrust what they perceive as scientists’ “moral agenda” on issues like evolution, stem cell research, and climate change. As Webb and Hayhoe describe it: theological conservatism, scientific skepticism, political affiliation, and sociocultural influences have reinforced one another to instill climate skepticism into the evangelical tribe mentality, thus creating a formidable barrier to climate education efforts. There are also evangelicals who have tried to convince their peer group about the reality of human-caused climate change and our moral obligation to address it. These include the Evangelical Environmental Network, the Evangelical Climate Initiative, the Young Evangelicals for Climate Action, and evangelical climate scientists like Sir John Houghton and Doug Hayhoe’s daughter Katharine Hayhoe (one of TIME magazine’s 100 most influential people). However, a majority of evangelicals continue to reject the reality of human-caused climate change, and there hasn’t been research quantifying the effectiveness of these evangelical climate leadership efforts. Brian Webb and Doug Hayhoe’s study did just that by testing the effectiveness of a climate lecture delivered by Katharine Hayhoe to undergraduate students at the predominantly evangelical Houghton College in New York. Approximately half of the participants self-identified as conservatives and Republicans, 28% as liberals and Democrats, and the remainder as neither liberal nor conservative. 63% of the participants identified as evangelicals (most of the rest were of other Christian denominations). Katharine Hayhoe’s lecture presented climate science information through the lens of an evangelical tradition. In addition to presenting scientific evidence, it included an introduction about the difference between faith and science (faith is based on things that are spiritually discerned, whereas science is based on observation). About six minutes of the 33- to 53-minute lectures were devoted to theology-based ethics. The participants filled out a survey before and after the lecture, detailing their acceptance that global warming is happening, its cause, whether there’s a scientific consensus, how high of a priority they consider it, how worried they are about it, and how much it will harm various groups. The results showed an increase in pro-climate beliefs for every single question after listening to Katharine Hayhoe’s lecture. Acceptance that global warming is happening increased for 48% of participants, and that humans are causing it for 39%. Awareness of the expert scientific consensus increased among 27% of participants. 52% were more worried about climate change after watching the lecture, and 67% increased their responses about how much harm climate change will do. 55% of participants viewed addressing climate change a higher priority after attending Katharine Hayhoe’s lecture. For most of the remaining participants, there was no change in responses to these questions. By testing three different lecture approaches, Webb and Hayhoe also concluded that the lecture was equally effective when presented in person or as a recorded video, and that adding material about common climate misconceptions didn’t make the lecture any more effective. There’s been some debate among social scientists about how much facts matter in today’s politically polarized society. Some have warned about the “smart idiots” effect, in which people who are more knowledgeable are often less persuadable, essentially because they have more tools with which to reject information they find inconvenient. However, other research has shown that climate-specific knowledge does increase peoples’ acceptance of human-caused global warming. The question then becomes how to arm people with that climate-specific knowledge. One thing most social scientists agree on is that people are more open to information when it comes from “trusted sources” – people with whom they have shared values. For evangelicals, Katharine Hayhoe is a perfect example, and this study confirms that her lectures are effective at informing evangelical college students about climate change. Other climate scientists can follow Hayhoe’s successful example by identifying groups whose membership is predominantly skeptical about human-caused global warming, with whom the individual scientist shares a commonality that will make him or her a trusted source of information. This could consist of religious beliefs, political leanings, or other shared values. This study has shown that the trusted source approach is an effective one at breaking through individuals’ resistance to the realities of human-caused climate change."
"Low-income and disadvantaged Australians are bearing the brunt of energy price rises caused by policy uncertainty, a new report has found.  The Australian Council of Social Service and the Brotherhood of St Laurence have warned they are receiving harrowing reports since steep rises in wholesale energy prices began in mid-2016.   They say struggling families are having their gas and electricity disconnected, or going without hot water because they can’t afford to get their systems fixed.  The report – co-authored by Acoss, the brotherhood and the now-closed Climate Institute – calls on the government to provide investment certainty by implementing climate and energy policies in line with its commitment to the Paris agreement.  It also recommends reviewing laws that allow disconnection of households that cannot afford their bills; making it easier for at-risk households to access rooftop solar and energy-efficient products; and improving the energy efficiency of public and community housing stock.  The report also warns the current transition to decentralised energy sources, including household batteries and small-scale solar, is shutting out low-income Australians.  “Put plainly, there are concerns that, without significant policy and regulatory reform, the future energy market will create a two-tiered system that favours those who can access and afford distributive energy resources (such as solar panels) and those who cannot, further widening the gap between the haves and the have-nots,” the report says. “This inequity is further exacerbated when incentives to support the uptake of distributive energy are recouped in a regressive manner through electricity bills, rather than more progressive means, such as from government budgets.”  The Australian Competition and Consumer Commission is investigating rising electricity prices, acting on a request from the Coalition in March, and has demanded energy retailers disclose their profit margins, according to News Corp.  Acoss’s chief executive officer, Cassandra Goldie, said the report’s 17 recommendations focused on delivering cheaper clean energy, empowering consumers, improving household efficiency and strengthening households’ capacity to pay bills. “Efforts to provide access to affordable, reliable and clean energy are failing and low-income and disadvantaged households are bearing the brunt,” Goldie said.  “Governments must listen to people’s very deep concerns about energy prices and make the transition to clean energy equitable and affordable for everyone.” The report was produced after consultation with 120 experts across Australia between March and June this year.  The Brotherhood of St Laurence’s head of energy and climate change, Damian Sullivan, said the report’s recommendations, if adopted, would provide immediate relief for families and reduce power bills over the long term. “We hear harrowing accounts of the impacts of higher energy costs,” Sullivan said.  “Unless there is a nationally coordinated plan that is fair and inclusive – and far better integration between climate, energy and social policy – vulnerable households will be left behind.”  Another report released on Monday – the ME Bank household financial comfort report – found the increasing cost of necessities, including energy, was the major source of financial stress for Australian households. It found that 40% of households whose financial situation worsened in the past six months attributed their financial stress to the rising cost of necessities. Households had been hit with bill shock in the first half of 2017. “While retail inflation is low in general, hikes in the cost of necessities such as fuel, household gas and electricity are the biggest worry for over 40% of households,” the report says.  The report, a survey of 1,500 households, also found inequality in Australia was worsening.  It found that 45% of households earning less than $40,000 had seen their incomes reduce. At the same time, 46% of those on $100,000 or more experienced rises to their income. "
"It is only a matter of time until every Australian car is all-electric. But while other countries are speeding up the transition, with plans to ban petrol cars within a couple of decades, Australia is stuck debating even modest cuts to vehicle emissions, let alone policies to encourage zero-emissions cars. But as the UK, France, India and other countries move quickly towards getting all-petrol cars off the roads, could Australia’s fleet be caught up in the winds of change?  According to Michael Bradley, chief executive of the Australian Automobile Association, Australia should be cautious in embracing all-electric cars. “All the signs point to electric vehicles making up a significant proportion of the global fleet but in Australia we have some unique challenges,” he tells the Guardian. He says the distances Australians travel and the reliance of our electricity grid on coal means electric cars are neither convenient for consumers, nor a solution to climate change. Recently, Stanford University economist Tony Seba made headlines with modelling suggesting no petrol or diesel cars would be sold anywhere in the world by 2025. He argued that once the shift starts – which it already has – “internal combustion engine vehicles will enter a vicious cycle of increasing costs”. He argued the combination of automation and electrification would turn the industry upside down, increasing safety, lowering maintenance and insurance costs, and leading to a world where few people owned cars, with most relying on robot electric cars hailed with apps such as Uber. But other more conservative projections also see the transition happening quickly, if not so suddenly. Projections by the Australian Energy Market Operator suggest as many as 45% of new cars will be electric by 2036. Other projections from the CSIRO, Australian National Uuniversity, the Department of Environment and Energy and others put the number at between 15% and 100%. According to Behyad Jafari, chief executive of the Electric Vehicle Association, the one thing that’s clear is even the more optimistic projections need to be ramped up year after year. “We saw this with the uptake of rooftop solar panels too,” says Jafari. “The people who came closest with their projections but still fell short were Greenpeace – they were laughed at for their projections.” But Jafari says the moves in the UK, France, India and elsewhere will drive changes in the automotive industry that will affect Australia regardless of policy settings here. Jafari said moves in the UK, which is one of the few other right-hand-drive markets in the world, will have a strong impact. “As a major right-hand-drive market, auto manufacturers, particularly those based in Europe and the US do their product planning based on the needs of the UK market first, and then off the back of that they look at which models they will bring to Australia,” says Jafari. “With the UK moving away [from internal combustion engines] by 2040, that sends a signal starting today that the investments and the advancements in technology are required.” But so far, Australia is trailing the world with its takeup. In 2016 there were 1,369 electric vehicles sold – just 0.1% of the sales – a drop from the 2015 figure of 1,771. Fewer than half of those cars were all-electric, with the rest being plug-in hybrids. Globally, one of the biggest concerns consumers have about electric cars is the distance they can travel between charges – and the availability of public charging stations. The concern has been labelled “range anxiety”. Bradley says it’s a real problem in Australia. “It’s an issue for Australia given our vehicle use and how it’s different to what it is in other countries,” he says. Since Australia is a vast continent, with large distances between cities, and with a lot of people commuting to work, electric cars might not be able to go the distance Bradley says. But Jafari says while range is something that is of great concern to consumers, it’s mostly a misplaced worry. “People are tricked by thinking that because we have a large country that we drive long distances. In fact we fly long distances and drive relatively short ones,” he says. Data from the Australian Bureau of Statistics seems to support Jafari’s argument. In 2016, the majority of drivers drove less than 30km per day. And 99% of drivers drove less than 160km a day – a distance some electric cars could do on half a charge and one all would easily achieve on one charge. Bradley says those figures don’t account for what people do on weekends – when they might drive out of town. For those drives, he said, people would need to charge along the way. And again, given Australia’s vast size, charging infrastructure is expensive to deploy. Technology available today would seem to satisfy most consumer needs, however. A Tesla Model S can drive 426km on one charge, meaning it could easily drive between Sydney and Canberra on a single charge. And with just two quick charges of less than 30 minutes along the way, it could drive from Sydney to Melbourne. Installing fast-charging stations along highways will alleviate range anxiety, and that’s what has started to happen. This week the Queensland government launched its planned “electric super highway”, which will be a 1,600km stretch dotted with super-fast charging stations along the way. When completed in just six months’ time, electric vehicle owners will be able to drive from far-north Queensland to the border of NSW without being more than 100km from a charging station. Jafari says he’s not concerned about public charging infrastructure since he thinks businesses will jump in and build that as soon as there’s confidence in the electric car market growing in Australia. He says the key thing that will shift the takeup of electric cars in Australia will be the availability of models under $60,000 and closer to the $25,000 range. That will be more likely as more such models are made for the UK market, but how fast it happens will depend on Australian policies such as the controversial emissions standards. Many consumers who are considering electric cars have environmental concerns at the front of their minds. When it comes to air quality concerns, there’s no question electric cars are the best option. “Obviously electric vehicles are a clear winner on that front,” says Bradley. But Bradley says in the Australian context, when it comes to climate change and emissions of CO2, electric cars are not a solution. “Driving an electric car on Australia’s grid at the moment is dirtier than driving a comparable petrol car.” Australia’s electricity grid relies heavily on coal, making it highly emissions intensive. According to the Australian government’s Green Vehicle Guide, a Tesla Model S, for example, might put out zero emissions, but it produces about 185g of CO2 per kilometre when the lifecycle of its fuel (in this case electricity) is considered.  But Jafari argues that’s not a fair comparison, since a Tesla Model S is a performance car – with acceleration similar to some of the fastest sports cars on the market. In addition, Jafari says there are a multitude of ways of charging electric vehicles with electricity from renewable sources. Queensland’s electric highway will be powered with renewable energy, for example, and most public charging stations purchase green energy. AGL has also launched a $1 a day car charging plan for home charging, which is sourced from emissions-free sources. “The energy industry is decarbonising and, without a shift towards electrification of vehicles, leaves the benefits of that on the table – we’ll produce more green energy but leave our cars powered by fossil fuels,” Jafari says."
"Eleven record-breaking summers on from An Inconvenient Truth, Al Gore doubles down. Bonni Cohen and Jon Shenk’s galvanising documentary accompanies the former US vice-president throughout 2015 and 2016, by which point he had pivoted from touring pro-bono slideshows to addressing the Climate Reality Leadership Corps programme initiated by the first movie’s success.   Cohen and Shenk don’t deviate radically from that film’s formula. Again, excerpts of Gore’s orations (manna for bar chart aficionados) are bolstered with visits to natural disaster sites (as Irwin Allen foresaw, extreme weather is inherently cinematic), while behind-the-scenes diversions find our host battling to discuss temperature hikes with an election-crazed media and an expert-intolerant public.  Other climates have changed, then, and the sequel benefits dramatically from its expanded sense of the challenges we face – everything from the needs of developing nations to terrorism. One under-discussed byproduct of climate change is an increasingly hot-headed world.  Candidate Trump looms, dismissing science as a wussy liberal fetish. An updated coda sees Gore abandoning his conciliatory rhetoric to swing for an individual currently undoing much of the hard diplomatic work observed herein. Railing against rising tides, Gore emerges as a cannier performer and a more compelling subject than he was in 2006; a message that sounded critical then has become no less urgent with time."
"Conservationists have called for action to protect the capercaillie, one of Scotland’s rarest and most treasured birds, after data showed its population had fallen 50% in just over two decades. An extensive field survey of capercaillie breeding grounds in the Highlands estimated a population of only 1,114 birds between 2015 and last year, compared with an estimate of 2,200 between 1992 and 1994.   The world’s largest type of grouse, the capercaillie was placed on the UK’s red list of the most endangered birds after a severe population decline from the 1970s onwards. The survey suggests the shy and elusive bird, which was reintroduced to Scotland in the 1830s after a previous extinction, is now almost wholly restricted to forests in Strathspey in the Cairngorms, where more than 80% of the remaining birds live.  It is believed to have wholly disappeared from the islands where it once lived on Loch Lomond, and its numbers are shrinking fast in Deeside and Perthshire, raising questions about the overall conservation effort to protect it.  Ornithologists blame changing climate (affecting important plants for the capercaillie such as the blaeberry), collision with deer fences, predation and increasing pressure from housing developments and sports such as mountain biking for the decline.  Its breeding has been hit hard by increasingly wet and erratic weather conditions in spring and early summer depleting food supplies when capercaillie hens are readying to breed, and during the first week of a chick’s life. After previous surveys recorded a sudden slump in capercaillie numbers in the late 1990s, where the population fell to 1,073, conservationists removed or made more visible hundreds of miles of deer fences in long stretches of the Highlands, to prevent adult birds flying into them. Yet the latest figures show a continuing Scotland-wide decline in overall numbers. The field surveys, overseen by the government agency Scottish Natural Heritage and carried out over the winter every six years, show there were an estimated 1,980 capercaillie in 2003-2004, 1,285 in 2009-2010 and 1,114 in the latest survey. Conservationists warn that the pressures of climate change on the species is being exacerbated in the Cairngorms national park, now its last stronghold, by large scale house-building projects and recreational pressures being permitted or overseen by the park authority.  The national park is being heavily marketed for outdoor sports, where mountain biking paths, hill walking and countryside sports can disturb the bird throughout the year and increase the fragmentation of its breeding and feeding areas.  Gus Jones, an expert in capercaillie ecology with the Badenoch and Strathspey Conservation Group, said: “Inappropriate large-scale housing needs to be restricted because we have pretty limited woodland. Housing and recreational pressures in the wrong places are sterilising large areas which capercaillie need or are making them less suitable.” SNH confirmed that its efforts to protect the bird were now focusing on the Cairngorms. It said work was going on to help capercaillie outside the park area but did not identify new projects designed to do so.  “The latest national survey shows that the majority of capercaillie in Scotland are within the Cairngorms national park so it is appropriate to focus our limited resources there,” a spokesman said. “However, action will still continue outwith the park’s boundaries.” Cairngorms national park said its capercaillie strategy was intended to heavily involve the local community and carefully manage recreational activities to protect its habitats. “We hope to develop a programme of conservation action to support the long-term survival of the species and provide a model to save ‘at risk’ species in national parks around the world,” said Andy Ford, the park’s nature manager."

"Ain’t no mountain dry enough? Ben Nevis may well have grown by a metre last year but now it is also nude from basecamp up for the first time in 11 years. You would expect snow under foot atop the summit’s stone cairn at the lofty height of 1,345m, not a blunt, barren crown. So what on earth happened to the formerly covered peak?  Well, Scotland has had its third warmest winter since 1910 but, even so, white mountain tops can be as hit-and-miss as white Christmases. Indeed, avid snow-watchers are keen to stress that it is a popular misconception to presume peaks are always snowy, or that the lower the altitude, the less the chance of a powdery summit. Many mountains in South America’s Andes are as dry as the arid Atacama desert upon which some of them reside – even when you get to the uppermost point. Monte Pissis, in Argentina, is the third highest in the western hemisphere and, at almost 7,000m, the tallest snowless peak in the world. Rising air temperature, driven by increasing concentrations of greenhouse gases – AKA global warming – has accelerated deglaciation in recent decades. As a consequence, researchers believe we are in a transition phase, from a world with glacierised mountains to a situation where permanent snow and ice cover is likely to be strongly reduced or even eliminated. This has potentially dire consequences for the half of the world’s population who depend on mountain water and who could soon be driven to stockpiling. But it’s not all doom and gloom – Ben Nevis expert Iain Cameron is confident the snow will return. “It can snow at any time on Ben Nevis, but snowfall at this time of the year is generally ephemeral,” says Cameron. “The first substantial falls you can expect are in October.” For how many more years that will periodically be the case remains to be seen. At this rate, snow-topped mountains could be primed to join proper Toblerones in the litany of things of which we may have seen the last."

"US diplomats should sidestep questions from foreign governments on what it would take for the Trump administration to re-engage in the global Paris climate agreement, according to a diplomatic cable seen by Reuters.  The cable, sent by the US secretary of state, Rex Tillerson, to embassies on Friday, also said diplomats should make clear the United States wants to help other countries use fossil fuels.   In the wake of Donald Trump’s announcement in June that the United States would withdraw from the accord, the cable tells diplomats to expect foreign government representatives to ask questions like: “Does the United States have a climate change policy?” and “Is the administration advocating the use of fossil fuels over renewable energy?“  If asked, for example, “What is the process for consideration of re-engagement in the Paris Agreement?,” the answer should be vague: “We are considering a number of factors. I do not have any information to share on the nature or timing of the process,” the cable advises.  The US state department did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the cable.  Trump campaigned on a promise to “cancel” the Paris deal, saying he believed it would cost the US economy trillions of dollars, while leaving developing nations such as China unfettered. In a sharp difference with the previous administration of Barack Obama, a Democrat, Trump has several times called climate change a hoax.  In June, Trump left the door open to re-engagement if terms improve. The United States would “start to negotiate, and we will see if we can make a deal that’s fair”, he said.  The state department guidance clarifies that right now, “there are no plans to seek to re-negotiate or amend the text of the Paris Agreement.” But it adds: “The president is sincere in his commitment to look for a path to re-engage that takes into account his concerns for US economic growth and energy security.”  The Paris accord, agreed by nearly 200 countries in 2015, seeks to limit planetary warming by curbing global emissions of carbon dioxide and other gases that scientists believe drive global warming. The United States, under the Obama administration, had promised to cut emissions as much as 28% from 2005 levels by 2025.  Separate from the diplomatic cable, the Trump administration is reviewing a draft report written by scientists across 13 federal government agencies that shows the effects of climate change pose dire, near-term threats to the United States.  The Environmental Protection Agency declined to comment on the draft, which the New York Times published on Monday.  The report puts the White House in the awkward position of either clearing the report’s findings or editing them. The diplomatic guidance makes clear that the United States intends to attend global climate summits during the prolonged process of withdrawing from the Paris deal, to protect US interests. The next summit is in November.  A US official said a major US priority in these talks would be to beat back attempts to have separate standards in the guidance on emissions cuts for rich and poor nations – long a sticking point in negotiations.  “There’s certainly nothing in the policies of this administration that would make us think that we should be acting differently,” the official said on condition of anonymity to discuss the internal memo.  The cable also anticipates questions over why the United States has changed its policy to make it easier for global development banks such as the World Bank to finance coal-fired power projects. In 2013 the Obama administration said the United States would oppose most coal projects, guidance since altered by the Trump administration.  “The new principles will allow the [United States] the flexibility to approve, as appropriate, a broad range of power projects, including the generation of power using clean and efficient fossil fuels and renewable energy,” the cable said. "
"The elevation of science to a central theme in American politics is an extraordinary development in the co-evolution of science and society. Three months after Donald Trump’s inauguration, 40,000 or so people turned out in the rain in Washington, DC for the March for Science, with similar numbers in other cities. Given Trump’s all-out attack on the role and size of government—his proposed 2018 budget slashes almost all programs other than national defence—there could just as easily have been a March for Education or a March for Affordable Housing. But the high profile of science in national politics has been building since the turn of the millennium, fuelled by controversies around embryonic stem cell research, and of course climate change. Starting with the year 2000 presidential campaign between George W. Bush and Al Gore, Democrats explicitly began positioning themselves as the party of science. During the 2004 campaign, Democratic candidate John Kerry pledged that “I will listen to the advice of our scientists, so I can make the best decisions. . . . This is your future, and I will let science guide us, not ideology.”   A year later, journalist Chris Mooney published a book whose catchy title, The Republican War on Science, later got picked up by the Democratic party, with a statement on its 2008 campaign website that “We will end the Bush administration’s war on science, restore scientific integrity, and return to evidence-based decision-making.” Indeed, Barak Obama’s 2008 inauguration speech included the memorable promise that he would “restore science to its rightful place.”  So by the time of Trump’s election, science was already a strong issue for Democrats. But everyone wants science on their side, and even Donald Trump insisted, on the day of the science march, that “Rigorous science is critical to my administration’s efforts to achieve the twin goals of economic growth and environmental protection.” Having science on your side, however, requires a strong voice for expertise in political discussions. And as we all know, one of the more common diagnoses of political pathologies leading to Trump, as well as to the Brexit vote in the UK, is that the voice of experts has been rejected by the citizenry.  So the rhetorical stakes around science and politics are pushed even further. “We live in an age that denigrates knowledge, dislikes expertise and demonizes experts,” wrote Anne Applebaum in the Washington Post last May. Tom Nichols, who teaches at the US Naval War College, and wrote The Death of Expertise, fleshes out the diagnosis: “Americans have reached a point where ignorance—at least regarding what is generally considered established knowledge in public policy—is seen as an actual virtue.” What makes this so discomfiting is that it cuts close to the bone of our identity as rational humans struggling to make sense of a complex world. Everyone, even Trump, says they want science on their side because being modern and rational is all about basing decisions on reliable knowledge—all the more so in the face of challenges such as climate change, pandemics and cyberwar, to name just a few apocalyptic horsemen. So you can’t make any claim to authority without implying that you have some rational, empirical basis for preferring one course of action over another. How, then, have we at the same time come to live in a world of post-truth politics, fake news, alternative facts, and counter-narrative? Amidst the bruising debates over issues like climate change, GM crops, stem cell research, vaccines, and so on, a number of social and behavioural scientists have begun to investigate the question of why people come to the beliefs they have about science. The larger agenda here is to understand how our cognition limits our capacity to act in the way that the Enlightenment model of rationality tells us we should be acting. Particular attention is being focused on why people don’t more readily accept the findings of scientific experts on politically controversial issues with scientific elements.  For example, John Cook, a cognitive scientist at George Mason University, writes: “Science denial, as a behaviour rather than a label, is a consequential and not-to-be ignored part of society…When people ignore important messages from science, the consequences can be dire.” This idea – that “science denial” is a “behaviour rather than a label” – turns the act of people not accepting what experts tell them from an act of individual (and perhaps ill-informed) judgment into a coherent phenomenon that experts themselves can do research on. Efforts to pathologize “science denial” link to a growing body of work about human cognitive limits that can be traced, in part, to the wonderful set of studies carried out by Daniel Kahneman and Amos Tversky, starting in the 1970s, on judgment under uncertainty. These established that the heuristics most humans readily use to make sense of the world on a daily basis also introduce significant biases into our understanding of the world. Kahneman of course eventually won a Nobel prize for this line of research. If people are naturally limited and biased in their abilities to see and assess the probabilistic constitution of many of the decisions that they face, it is only a short step to ask if they are, as a matter of evolutionary cognitive development, similarly limited in their more general capacity to think scientifically. And if people naturally look at the world in systematically biased ways, and if certain classes of people – say political conservatives – consistently reject the findings of science, then one might begin to explore the question of whether these two observations could be causally related.  And so, experts have begun studying why experts don’t get more respect. Scienceblind and The Knowledge Illusion are two such books by cognitive scientists published this year. As the titles suggest, they take up the question of why people understand so little about the world around them. The first of these, by Andrew Shtulman, focuses on why we don’t intuit scientific truths about the world. It looks in particular at how children’s misunderstanding of the world can help us see how difficult it is even for adults to acquire correct understanding of how things work.  Shtulman’s central premise is that we need to leave our childish intuitions behind and accept the findings of science in order to act effectively in the world. “Intuitive theories,” Scienceblind tells us, “are about coping with the present circumstances, the here and the now. Scientific theories are about the full causal story—from past to future, from the observable to the unobservable, from the miniscule to the immense.” And the book concludes, “While science denial is problematic from a sociological point of view, it’s unavoidable from a psychological point of view. There is a fundamental disconnect between the cognitive abilities of individual humans and the cognitive demands of modern society.” The second book, The Knowledge Illusion, by Steven Sloman and Philip Fernbach, looks not only at how little we know, but also at how we know a lot less than we think we do. “Because we confuse the knowledge in our heads with the knowledge we have access to, we are largely unaware of how little we understand.” While the authors recognise that teaching people more facts about science might not change their beliefs about the world, they also believe that if people realised how little they actually do know, they would moderate their positions on key issues, and be open to a wider range of possibilities. “Getting people to think beyond their own interests and experiences may be necessary for reducing their hubris and thereby reducing polarization.” The book attributes “antiscientific thinking” to false causal models that individuals hold in their heads, often in common with their social groups. Both of these books share the perspective that we’re all dumb but it’s not our fault; we’re born that way. The first step is to recognise how little we each understand of the world, rather like accepting original sin.  It’s hard not to sympathise with this perspective: a little more humility in a lot more people could be good for the world. But we didn’t need cognitive science to tell us that. After recognising our ignorance, the second step must therefore be an acceptance of what scientific experts tell us. Otherwise, what would be the point of accepting our ignorance? I find this emerging intellectual programme around science denial problematic on so many levels that it’s hard to know where to start. Certainly one part of the problem with the idea of an innate cognitive stance toward science, and with discussions about science in the political world more generally, is the undisciplined way in which the word “science” gets used – as if particle physics, climate modelling, epidemiology and cultural anthropology have so much in common that they are substitutable for “science” in any sentence. Which science does “science denial” pertain to? Moreover, the entire programme fetishizes individual cognition and understanding by positioning the innate ignorance of the individual as the bottleneck at the intersection of knowledge, uncertainty, expertise, and political disagreement. The idea that these books implicitly endorse is that progress in tackling the complex problems of modernity is being blocked by individuals who do not accept new causal knowledge generated by science. The effort to provide a behavioural explanation for why people might not accept the opinions of experts strikes me as not entirely dissimilar in its implications from the early ambitions for eugenics, in that it seeks in the biology of the individual an explanation for complex social phenomena. It makes one wonder what the appropriate treatment for science denial might actually be? Meanwhile, the situation in the science enterprise itself is hardly reassuring. There is a reasonable case to be made—and I have tried elsewhere to make it —that much of science is on the verge of a crisis that threatens its viability, integrity, legitimacy and utility. This crisis stems from a growing awareness that much of the science being produced today is, by the norms of science itself, of poor quality; that significant areas of research are driven by self-reinforcing fads and opportunities to game the funding system, or to advance particular agendas; that publication rates continue to grow exponentially with little evidence that much of what is published actually gets read; and that the promises of social benefit made on behalf of many avenues of science are looking increasingly implausible, if not ridiculous.  Maybe a little science denial is actually in order these days? The emergence of science denial as a pathology designed to explain why science is not leading to improved political decision-making seems, if nothing else, completely overwhelmed by the precisely opposite condition.  The vast scale of the knowledge-production enterprise, combined with the likelihood that much of what’s produced is not much good, makes it possible for anyone to get whatever science they need to support whatever beliefs they might have about how best to address any problem they are concerned about – with little, if any, capacity to assess the quality of the science being deployed.  Twenty-five years ago, Silvio Funtowicz and Jerry Ravetz developed their concept of “post-normal science” to help understand the role of knowledge and expertise when facts are uncertain, values in dispute, stakes are high, and decisions are urgent. Under such conditions—which are common to many of today’s societal problems—Funtowicz and Ravetz describe how the “traditional distinction between ‘hard’, objective scientific facts and ‘soft’, subjective value-judgements is now inverted.” That is to say, facts become soft, and values hard. Under such conditions, our expectations for Enlightenment ideals of applied rationality are themselves irrational. We are asking science to do the impossible: to arrive at scientifically coherent and politically unifying understandings of problems that are inherently open, indeterminate and contested – to provide, as Scienceblind promises us, “the full causal story.”  Meanwhile, the reliability of the very types of science that underlie books like Scienceblind and The Knowledge Illusion are increasingly called into question as evidence of irreproducibility continues to mount, including across many fields of research that make strong generalisations about human behaviour. Our biggest problem is not science denial; it’s post-normal science denial.

"Climate change may have contributed to the suicides of nearly 60,000 Indian farmers and farm workers over the past three decades, according to new research that examines the toll rising temperatures are already taking on vulnerable societies. Illustrating the extreme sensitivity of the Indian agricultural industry to spikes in temperature, the study from the University of California, Berkeley, found an increase of just 1C on an average day during the growing season was associated with 67 more suicides.  An increase of 5C on any one day was associated with an additional 335 deaths, the study published in the journal PNAS on Monday found. In total, it estimates that 59,300 agricultural sector suicides over the past 30 years could be attributed to warming. Temperature increases outside the growing season showed no significant impact on suicide rates, suggesting stress on the agriculture industry was the source of the increase in suicides. Also supporting the theory was that rainfall increases of as little as 1cm each year were associated with an average 7% drop in the suicide rate. So beneficial was the strong rainfall that suicide rates were lower for the two years that followed, researcher Tamma Carleton found. Farm sector suicides in India decreased last year, but remain at epidemic levels in some states and are a source of immense pressure on legislators. One drought-hit state, Maharashtra, reported 852 farmer suicides in the first four months of this year, while in 2015, one of the worst years on record, about 12,602 farmers killed themselves across India. Overall, more than 300,000 farmers and farm workers have killed themselves in the country since 1995.  In recent months, a site in central Delhi has been strewn with evidence of the despair felt by the Indian agricultural sector.  Skulls and bones said to belong to farmers who killed themselves have been piled at Jantar Mantar, within walking distance of the Indian parliament. They were brought to Delhi by farmers from Tamil Nadu, a state suffering its worst drought in 140 years, which the protesters claim has triggered hundreds of suicides in the past months. Worse than the parched crops were the bank loans that loomed over many farming families, said Rani Radhakrishnan, one of the protesters. In February, owing 80,000 rupees (£945), her husband stood outside his bank branch in the city of Trichy, and consumed a toxic concoction. He died on the spot. “He had talked about things like this [suicide] happening with others, but never about doing it himself,” she said. The next week, Radhakrishnan and her daughter-in-law stood outside the bank brandishing wads of rupees. “We told them, we have repaid your money, now will you give us back my husband’s life?” she said. Last year the Indian government launched a £1bn insurance scheme to protect against crop failures and try to halve farmer and farm worker suicides. Maharashtra, Punjab and the country’s most populous state, Uttar Pradesh, have all passed farm-debt waivers at enormous cost to the public purse to appease the demands of the agricultural sector, which commands strong political sway. Carleton said her research showed little evidence Indian farmers were changing their practices to accommodate rising temperatures.  “Without interventions that help families adapt to a warmer climate, it’s likely we will see a rising number of lives lost to suicide as climate change worsens in India,” Carleton said. The true suicide rate was probably higher, she added, because deaths are generally underreported in India and, until 2014, suicide was considered a criminal offence, discouraging honest reports.  “The tragedy is unfolding today,” she said. “This is not a problem for future generations. This is our problem, right now.” • In the UK, the Samaritans can be contacted on 116 123. In the US, the National Suicide Prevention Hotline is 1-800-273-8255.

"There is only a 5% chance that the Earth will avoid warming by at least 2C come the end of the century, according to new research that paints a sobering picture of the international effort to stem dangerous climate change.  Global trends in the economy, emissions and population growth make it extremely unlikely that the planet will remain below the 2C threshold set out in the Paris climate agreement in 2015, the study states.  The Paris accord, signed by 195 countries, commits to holding the average global temperature to “well below 2C” above pre-industrial levels and sets a more aspirational goal to limit warming to 1.5C. This latter target is barely plausible, the new research finds, with just a 1% chance that temperatures will rise by less than 1.5C.  “We’re closer to the margin than we think,” said Adrian Raftery, a University of Washington academic who led the research, published in Nature Climate Change. “If we want to avoid 2C, we have very little time left. The public should be very concerned.”  Governments settled on the 2C threshold partly through political expediency but also because scientists have warned of severe consequences from sea level rise, drought, heatwaves and social unrest should the temperature rise beyond this.   Such risks have been underscored by a separate study, also released on Monday, that shows unabated climate change will cause around 60,000 deaths globally in 2030 and 260,000 deaths by 2100. The study, by the University of North Carolina, found that rising temperatures will exacerbate air pollutants that will particularly threaten those with existing conditions.   According to the University of Washington study, there is a 90% likelihood that temperatures will rise between 2C and 4.9C by 2100. This would put the world in the mid-range warming scenarios mapped out by the UN’s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. It negates the most optimistic outcome as well as the worst case, which would see temperatures climb nearly 6C beyond the pre-industrial era.  Rather than look at how greenhouse gases will influence temperature, the new research analyzed the past 50 years of trends in world population, per capita gross domestic product (GDP) and carbon intensity, which is the amount of carbon dioxide emitted for each dollar of economic activity.  After building a statistical model covering a range of emissions scenarios, the researchers found that carbon intensity will be a crucial factor in future warming. Technological advances are expected to cut global carbon intensity by 90% over the course of the century, with sharp declines in China and India – two newly voracious consumers of energy. However, this decline still will not be steep enough to avoid breaching the 2C limit.   The world’s population is expected to grow to about 11 billion people by 2100, but the research found that this will have a relatively small impact upon temperatures as much of this growth will take place in sub-Saharan Africa, which is a minor contributor of greenhouse gas emissions.  It has long been acknowledged that emissions cuts promised under the the Paris agreement would not be sufficient to avoid 2C warming. However, it is hoped that periodic reviews of commitments will result in more severe reductions.  Donald Trump’s pledge to remove the US, the world’s second-largest emitter, from the accord has cast a large shadow over these ambitions.   “Even if the 2C target isn’t met, action is very important,” said Raftery. “The more the temperature increases, the worse the impacts will be. “We would warn against any tendency to use our results to say that we won’t avoid 2C, and so it’s too late to do anything. On the contrary, avoiding the higher temperature increases that our model envisages is even more important, and also requires urgent action.”  Raftery acknowledged that a breakthrough technology could “dramatically” change the outlook but noted that major advances of the past 50 years, such as the computer, robotics, hybrid cars, the internet and electronic fuel injection, have improved carbon efficiency steadily at around 2% a year, rather than in huge jumps.  Andrew Dessler, a climate scientist at Texas A&M University who was not involved in the study, said the research’s conclusions were “reasonable” but said it was difficult to assign a precise probability to future temperature rises.  “I agree that staying below 2C and 1.5C are unlikely and very, very unlikely, respectively,” he said. “But this research gives a false sense of rigor. Tomorrow someone could invent a carbon-free energy source that everyone adopts.  “If you look at technology adoption and action taken on the ozone layer and acid rain, it’s clear these things can change faster than people predict.”  Dessler said the falling cost of renewable energy would be a major factor in reducing emissions but further impetus would be needed through new actions such as a price on carbon.   “It’s like you’re driving and about to collide with the car in front of you,” he said. “You want to hit the brakes as fast as you can. The later you wait, the more painful it’s going to be.” John Sterman, an academic at the MIT Sloan Sustainability Initiative, said the research was an “urgent call to action”. MIT research has shown that emissions cuts in the Paris agreement would stave off around 1C of temperature increase by 2100 – findings misrepresented by Trump when he announced the US departure from the pact. Sterman said the US must “dramatically speed the deployment of renewable energy and especially energy efficiency. Fortunately, renewables, storage and other technologies are already cheaper than fossil energy in many places and costs are falling fast. “More aggressive policies are urgently needed, but this study should not be taken as evidence that nothing can be done.”"
"Sir David Attenborough has said he is more encouraged about the future health of Earth than he has been for some time after a “worldwide shift” in attitudes about concern for the natural world and the damage that humans are doing to the planet. The veteran wildlife broadcaster said there are “signs of hope” for the health of the planet and called the Paris climate change agreement a “big advance” in an interview at the Edinburgh TV festival despite President Donald Trump’s disengagement. “I spend a lot of time wringing my hands and saying how dreadful it is that this forest has been obliterated and that sea has been polluted and whatever,” Attenborough said. “But there are signs of hope. “I have the sense that worldwide, certainly in Europe, certainly in China – which we never thought before was concerned – and even perhaps if I may say so there are people in America – pace Mr Trump – who don’t accept that human beings can do no wrong. “There has been a worldwide shift, I think, among people in general about the concern there should be for the natural world. I am encouraged more than I have been for some time.” The Paris climate change agreement between nearly 200 countries tried to limit the increase in global temperatures compared with the pre-industrial age to well below 2C and ideally to 1.5C. The agreement was signed last year but Trump pulled the US out of the deal after becoming president. “I think the Paris agreement represents another big advance,” Attenborough said. “I would like to think the reason that political figures can adopt that sort of policy, which they know will be at a cost to their national economies, is that they are beginning to realise that people worldwide wish for that happen because they wish to protect their natural world.” The 91-year-old – who was described by Barack Obama as a “great educator” when they met in 2015 – argued that natural history programmes had a vital role to play in educating people about conservation issues. One of the tasks of the BBC, he added, was keep the natural world at the forefront of people’s minds. “The effect that human beings are having on the natural world is profound,” he said. “We are having a great damaging effect. Because we are out of touch with the natural world in a way that we weren’t 200 years ago [because of urbanisation] that means most of us don’t see the effect we are having. What is more, we don’t understand the processes of the natural world, which makes this [natural history broadcasting] of crucial importance to the future of humanity.” Attenborough also admitted that he cried watching the birth of an elephant with crippled back legs – which eventually learned to walk – and seeing a herd of elephants seemingly grieve over the bones of dead elephants. “One of the things that has brought tears to my eyes is particularly elephant sequences,” the veteran broadcaster said."
"Let’s begin with the bad news. First, Earth Overshoot Day – the point at which the world consumes more natural resources than the planet can renew throughout the year – shifted forward this year to 2 August, putting humanity in the red for longer.  Research revealed that summer temperatures in parts of the Middle East and North Africa are increasing twice as fast as the average pace of global warming, so by 2100 it will be impossible to live there. Also, climatologists fear that global wheat will not be able to bear the heat (a potential disaster given that it supplies 20% of dietary calories worldwide) and others say there is only a 5% chance we can stay under 2 degrees of warming (the threshold set by the Paris Agreement). Wow. The Sixth Mass Extinction might be upon us but the most endangered species on the planet right now is the climate optimist. As an antidote, visit mission2020.global, convened by Christiana Figueres (star of the Paris talks), and acknowledge the eco “wins”. These include the fact that last year global emissions plateaued while growth has continued. Previously emissions have only plateaued during recessions. This suggests we are starting to unlink greenhouse gas emissions from production and consumption. The aim now needs to be to move to a downward trend but we are, in the words of scientist Johan Rockstrom, “starting to bend the curve of emissions”. That is huge! It has also been a giant year for renewable energy. Wind and solar made up three-quarters of new energy capacity and coal demand was cut by 10%. Dystopian visions are strangely seductive. A better way to look at this is as an age of great transformation. Excitement brings out the optimist. Endurance swimmer Lewis Pugh (known for his “Speedo diplomacy”, after he campaigned to create the world’s largest marine protected area off Antarctica) once again brings attention to warming waters, most recently swimming against the edge of Arctic ice. According to reports, the photographer Kelvin Trautman also played an active role in hauling the UN patron of the oceans out at the end of a 22-minute swim. Sometimes you crave straight-talking common sense in the fashion world. Manchester-based former teacher Sarah Jerath is happy to oblige with her fledgling collection. ‘Consumers have the right to see and understand how money flows across fashion’s supply chains,’ she says. Jerath’s approach also calls time on disposable fashion: her collection is made up of ‘forever’ dresses, skirts, tops and knitwear, plus jumpsuits that have attracted attention from fashion bloggers. If she can ensure a long life for those pieces she’s on to a winner; research from wrap.org.uk shows that extending the life of clothes by an extra nine months, in the UK, reduces the carbon, water and waste impacts of that garment by up to 30%.

"Amid fears that rising levels of nitrogen oxides pose a major risk to public health, Britain plans to ban all new petrol and diesel cars and vans from 2040. As part of the government’s much-anticipated clean air plan it has said the move is needed because of the unnecessary and avoidable impact that poor air quality was having on people’s health.  With the inevitable demise of diesel and petrol vehicles we asked electric car drivers to tell us what it’s like to drive one, and why they are the future. Drives a Nissan Leaf In an electric car you glide around in virtual silence like a limousine, but it can also out-accelerate the boy racers at the traffic lights! A scheme where I live in Manchester, means I only have to pay £20 a year to have free access to chargers across the city. There are almost a dozen kerbside and car park chargers inside a 1-2 mile radius of my home, plus I can charge from empty to full in around four hours for less than £3 on domestic electricity.  Benefits of electric cars include a low-cost mileage, no road tax, no congestion charge and low servicing costs. They’re also easy to drive with just one pedal, and there’s no smelly flammable refuelling involved. People tend to be curious when they find out I have an electric car and want to know more especially as there are a lot of myths like low acceleration. However, charging infrastructure could definitely be improved in the UK. The UK government’s policy isn’t really a policy. Saying you’ll ban internal combustion engine car sales in 23 years from now doesn’t make sense, as the market will get there long before that. Norway plan the same by 2025 so why can’t we? Drives a Nissan Leaf and e-NV200 It’s beautiful to drive. And with just forward and reverse they are not difficult to drive. There is no clutch or shifting of gears. They are peaceful, without any noise and there are no stinking fuels. I just plug it in at home. It’s pre-warmed in the winter and pre-cooled in the summer which is wonderful when going to work. They’re fun. I’ll never go back to fossil fuel cars.  Where I live in Norway, most people have their own houses which makes it easy to install chargers outside. There are normally charging stations every 50km with most places having at least two. What it comes down to though is money. It’s expensive to pay for diesel and electricity is much cheaper. I can drive 10km for around 10p. They’re also so much cheaper, both in parts and repair. We save around £6,000-7,000 a year by not using a diesel car. I think the UK government’s plan is too little too late. It’s crazy when you think about how much oil is burnt every day by internal combustion engine cars. I’m just glad to be able to do my bit for the environment. Drives a Chevy Volt  Driving the Volt is like driving any compact car except that it’s usually quieter. The car has good acceleration and terrific handling. Regenerative braking means you hardly ever need to use the foot brake except to hold the car at a complete stop. When the battery is exhausted, it seamlessly transitions to gasoline (petrol) power. This allows for the occasional unplanned evening side-trip that would otherwise exceed the vehicle’s battery range. That said, the next car I buy will definitely be exclusively electric.  I received a one-off federal tax credit of $7,500 to buy the car which was helpful but I don’t think America will be very proactive in promoting electric cars in the future. At the moment, the relative costs of electricity and gasoline where I live mean that it’s actually cheaper to run the Volt 100% on gasoline than on electricity. This comparison gets much worse in the winter owing to the car being electrically heated. But because of the environmental benefits of running on electricity, I don’t do that; I still run on electricity as much as I can. Some people might think an electric might not be good for a long range journey, however I think the ones with larger batteries could manage it. Also, you can still rent an internal combustion engine car when necessary. Perhaps as a result of having bought one, there are now several Chevy Volts at work – which has made it much harder to access the at-work charging station! Drives a Nissan Leaf  The government cut 75% off the cost of my home charger, which meant I only had to pay around £100. It’s great as it means I can charge the car at home and use it for future vehicles too. Overall it only costs just over 1p a mile to run, which is much cheaper than petrol.  The conversation I’ve had about the electric cars this morning has been phenomenal. With the government’s plans more people will realise how viable they are. I feel 2040 is too far into the future though. I willing to bet that the last petrol car will be sold around 2035.My wife and I fight over who gets to take it to work. It’s very fast off the line too,but we don’t do too many long journeys as the charging infrastructure in Somerset is limited. Some of my colleagues in the car industry find it a bit strange but I’ve always been an early technological adapter. Drives a Renault Zoe I rent my electric car through a car club as my university offers free access. There’s a one-off joining fee and a minimum spend of £5 each month but it’s still cheaper than other alternatives. You don’t have to worry about stopping at petrol stations and there’s no bad feeling about adding to localised pollution. The only problems I have had at charging points is when fossil fuel car drivers have parked in EV spaces which is pretty frustrating. My friends think it’s a bit exciting taking part in what is likely to be the future of motor travel. My family are kind of the same about it finding it cool that I care enough about the environment to drive an EV. My dad was especially surprised with the acceleration of the Zoe as it isn’t nearly as sporty as a Tesla. I think the government’s plan is a great initiative but more could be done to subsidise electric vehicle purchase and improve car testing schemes. I feel that once loads of people get to try them they will change their mind.  Driving the car is basically like driving a big go-kart with instant acceleration and an automatic gearbox. I honestly cannot recommend it enough. "
"Australia has a critical shortage of climate scientists, leaving it at serious risk of not delivering essential climate and weather services to groups like farmers, coastal communities and international organisations, a report has found. The report into the nation’s climate science capability by the Australian Academy of Science found the climate science workforce needed to grow by 77 full-time positions over the next four years, with 27 of those positions urgently required.  Those figures take into account all the climate scientists at the CSIRO, the new CSIRO climate science centre to be established in Hobart, as well as those at the Bureau of Meteorology, universities and other institutions. But it didn’t consider extra resources  that might be needed in the study of climate change mitigation or adaptation. The Australian Academy of Science’s investigation was prompted by the CSIRO announcement in 2016 that the research agency was going to sack about 100 climate scientists – a number later reduced to about 40. The report found the areas most in need of investment were general climate modelling, climate observations and climate services, which help industry and the community access information produced by scientists. Infrastructure required for climate services was also at risk, the report found. The supercomputing resources at the National Computational Infrastructure were essential for using Australia’s climate models, but also applying other climate models to the region. “Right now that isn’t secure. It’s not funded in an ongoing sense,” said report contributor Julie Arblaster from Monash University. “At the moment there isn’t any funding available to host that data at the National Computational Infrastructure in Canberra. That is something that is still a difficulty for climate science and needs to be considered going forward.” Scientia professor in the school of mathematics and statistics at the University of New South Wales, Trevor McDougall, who led the investigation, said the report was being considered by the new national climate science advisory committee, which reports to the federal government and is taking some recommendations to ministers. The report said Australia had more to lose than other developed nations by not making adequate investments, since it was effected by factors that are unique to the southern hemisphere and more exposed to the impacts of climate change.  McDougall said a striking example of a lack of regional capability was the level of understanding about what will happen with rainfall over the Murray-Darling basin, where about 40% of Australia’s agricultural output originates. “We currently do not know whether rainfall evaporation is going to increase or decrease over that basin and has obviously large implications for sourcing our food and for the profitability of companies in that region,” McDougall said. “Each business needs to know the impact for them at the scale of, say, the local city council or the council scale in the bush. We aren’t there yet and we’ll never get there if we don’t invest in the climate science to do that. And it’s not going to happen – that kind of detailed regional specific understanding and prediction won’t happen if we leave it to other countries to do climate science for us.” "
"Coincidence doesn’t prove causality, as they say, but when the same two things happen together over and over again through the vast span of geological time, there must be a causal link. Of some 18 major and minor mass extinctions since the dawn of complex life, most happened at the same time as a rare, epic volcanic phenomenon called a Large Igneous Province (LIP). Many of those extinctions were also accompanied by abrupt climate warming, expansion of ocean dead zones and acidification, like today. Earth’s most severe mass extinction, the “Great Dying,” began 251.94 million years ago at the end of the Permian period, with the loss of more than 90% of marine species. Precise rock dates published in 2014 and 2015 proved that the extinction coincided with the Siberian Traps LIP, an epic outpouring of lava and intrusions of underground magma covering an area of northern Asia the size of Europe.  But those rock dates presented science with a new puzzle: why was the mass extinction event much shorter than the eruptions? And why did the extinction happen some 300,000 years after the lava began to flow? Now in a new study published in Nature Communications, Seth Burgess of the US Geological Survey, along with James Muirhead of Syracuse University and Samuel Bowring of MIT, think they have the answer. As Burgess told me: It’s clearly not the entirety of the LIP that’s guilty. There’s a subinterval that’s doing the work, and I set out to figure out which subinterval that was, and what makes it special. Burgess noticed that the beginning of the mass extinction, as well as a jolt to the carbon cycle and abrupt climate warming, coincided exactly with a switch in the style of volcanic activity in the Siberian Traps. During the initial 300,000 years of the eruptions, basalt lava poured over a vast area of Siberia building to several kilometers thick. In this time there was some stress to life in the Northern Hemisphere, but no mass extinction. Life only began to disappear across the globe at exactly the same time that lava stopped erupting above ground, and instead began to inject as sheets of magma underground. In Siberia you have got the Tunguska Basin which is a thick package of sediments that contain carbon-bearing rocks like limestone and coal. When you start intruding magma, [it] cooks those sediments and liberates the volatiles. So the deadly interval of magma in the entire Large Igneous Province is the first material to intrude and pond into the shallow crust In other words, it wasn’t the lava, it was the underground magma that started the killing, by releasing greenhouse gases. Norwegian scientist Henrik Svensen had earlier identified hundreds of unusual volcanic vents called “diatreme pipes” all over Siberia that connected underground intrusions of magma (“sills”) to the atmosphere, showing signs of violent gas explosions. This new work emphasizes the importance of Svensen’s 2009 conclusions: The diatremes that have been mapped are the geologic representation of that gas escape on a catastrophic level. Our hypothesis is that the first sills to be intruded are the ones that really do the killing [by] large scale gas escape likely via these diatremes. Svensen, who was not involved in Burgess’ study, commented: The Burgess et al paper is a crucial step towards a new understanding of the role of volcanism in driving extinctions. It’s not the spectacular volcanic eruptions that we should pay attention too - it’s their quiet relative, the sub-volcanic network of intrusions, that did the job. The new study shows convincingly that we are on the right track. While other scientists have proposed that an array of killers may have been involved in the end-Permian mass extinction, from mercury poisoning to ultraviolet rays and ozone collapse to acid rain, Burgess argues that it was principally greenhouse gas emissions triggered by magma intrusions that caused the extinction through abrupt global warming and ocean acidification. I asked him to outline the evidence for that. There are 3 primary lines of evidence that support that link. The first is: right before the onset of the mass extinction we have evidence for a massive input of isotopically light carbon into the marine system. He went on to explain various lines of evidence that point to the source of that carbon being methane and carbon dioxide resulting from magma intruding and cooking organic-rich sediments. He continued: Just prior to extinction and persisting after the mass extinction the sea surface temperature is thought to have gone up about 10°C. You get that increase by pumping greenhouse gas into the atmosphere. So that’s the second. And then the third line of evidence is a physiologic selectivity to the marine mass extinction. Organisms that make their shells out of calcium carbonate suffer much higher mortality than organisms that make their shells out of silica, for example, which suggests that the ocean was acidified, and you get that by pumping gases like CO2 into the atmosphere. That’s not to say that other factors had no role in ruining the environment: There is a cacophony of kill mechanisms, and I think that this first pulse of sills is the trigger for quite a few of those, sitting at the top, and beneath it are a cascade of negative effects from ocean acidification to climate warming and on down the line. Coincidentally, Joshua Davies of the University of Geneva and colleagues have just narrowed down the trigger for the end-Triassic mass extinction, another of Earth’s biggest mass extinctions, to the underground phase of its associated Large Igneous Province. The Central Atlantic Magmatic Province (CAMP) is another enormous igneous province which stretches from Maine to South America, and includes the Palisade Sill visible from Manhattan.  They too used high precision rock dates on a vast sill that intruded organic rich sediments in the Amazon Basin, and found that this underground magma intrusion also coincided with the extinction. Like Burgess, Davies also argues that greenhouse gas baked from sediments drove climate change, which drove the mass extinction in a smaller repeat of the end-Permian events, this time 201.5 million years ago. “I think CAMP is very similar to the Siberian Traps and that’s the reason why there’s an extinction at that time. I’m not surprised that they got similar results,” said Burgess. Diatreme pipes from magma intrusions have also been identified as a likely cause for a more recent global warming and very minor extinction event – the Paleocene–Eocene Thermal Maximum (PETM) 56 million years ago. Again, prodigious quantities of greenhouse gases erupted from oil-rich deposits, although in that case it’s been hard to locate and date the “smoking gun” intrusions due to the fact that they are under the Atlantic Ocean. Burgess’ insight makes a testable prediction: Only Large Igneous Provinces characterized by sills intruded into a volatile-fertile basin are going to be lethal on a global scale. This may explain why some Large Igneous Provinces are tied to mass extinctions, and some are not. Burgess thinks that the Deccan LIP, which happened at the time when the dinosaurs disappeared at the end of the Cretaceous, would not have triggered a major mass extinction on its own: The Deccan Traps doesn’t satisfy those 2 criteria. It’s predominantly flood basalt lavas erupted onto old granitic rock. Acting alone there would likely have been negative effects on the biosphere because of the gases and the particulate matter released by those lavas, which are not insignificant, but I would argue that acting alone it would have been minor relative to the observed mass extinction. But with the Chicxulub impactor sharing the causal burden together they caused the mass extinction at the end of the Cretaceous. The more science learns of these past greenhouse gas-driven events, the more uncomfortable the parallels to today become. I asked Burgess if it was ridiculous to make the comparison. No, I don’t think the comparison is ridiculous at all, and I think that the timescales over which the environment changes associated with mass extinctions are frighteningly similar to the timescales over which our current climate is changing. The cause might be different but the hallmarks are similar. Geologically fast build-up of greenhouse gas linked to warming, rising sea-levels, widespread oxygen-starved ocean dead zones and ocean acidification are fairly consistent across the mass extinction events, and those same symptoms are happening today as a result of human-driven climate change. Even though the duration of those past events was longer, and the volume of emissions was larger than we will produce, we are emitting greenhouse gases around 10 times faster than the most recent, mildest example – the PETM. The rapidity of today’s emissions prompted scientists Richard Zeebe and James Zachos to observe in a 2013 paper: The Anthropocene will more likely resemble the end-Permian and end-Cretaceous disasters, rather than the PETM. When the promises made for the 2016 Paris Agreement on climate change are added up, they aim to limit peak warming this century to about 3.3ºC compared to about 4.2ºC for the business-as-usual scenario, and the 2ºC limit the world is aiming to stay under. It’s sobering to compare those numbers to the majority of mass extinctions in the geological record which were characterized by abrupt warmings typically around 6-7ºC. Howard Lee is a geologist and science writer who focuses on past climate changes."
"This is an unabashed endorsement of an important group. I have no affiliation with them or conflict of interest. They are great, period. The ability to convey complex climate science to a wide-ranging audience is a golden attribute, something very few can achieve. This characteristic makes the Yale Climate Connections group unique.  The Yale Climate Connections effort comprises several interrelated efforts whose end result is captivating science education for the rest of us. What is most exciting to me are their daily radio spots that focus on a current issue of climate change. The Yale group includes a team of editors, radio producers, and freelance reporters nationwide to record and post short (90-second) spots that are both interesting and informative.  From someone who works in climate communication, I am surprised that a group can have this high of a throughput. It means your reporters have to be identifying relevant topics, finding experts to interview, learning enough to ask informed questions, and then perform audio edits. And this happens five days a week. The breadth and width of the topics can be seen at the group’s website. The radio spots are currently carried on almost 350 radio stations across North America and are hosted by Dr Anthony Leiserowitz, well known for his research on public opinions related to climate change, the “Six Americas.” In addition to the short radio segments, the group produces original feature articles and a monthly series of videos that explore topics in much more detail than the short radio spots. These longer videos are produced by award-winning videographer Peter Sinclair. In addition to its public outreach, the Yale group has worked behind the scenes to provide training workshops to help reporters, editors, and television weathercasters become more familiar with and comfortable discussing climate change with their audiences. I have worked with weathercasters quite a bit myself, and they are under a lot of pressure to provide well-watched weather forecasts and to avoid conflict that might turn off audiences. They are also confined to very short televised segments, so delving into complex climate topics is challenging.  As part of this training, the Yale group and its partners involve many top scientists to update weathercasters on what is known about human influence on climate change. The experts also help the weathercasters develop stories that are true to the science but short and simple enough to be delivered within a normal broadcast.  There are some other activities, but I think this summary is enough to appreciate what the Yale group is doing. With the proliferation of climate communication groups, one may wonder why the Yale team has been so successful. In my view, it is because of the quality of their team. I mentioned earlier that Dr. Leiserowitz is involved, and no one knows more about public engagement with climate change than he does. Another key player is Bud Ward, who began working with the Yale team in 2007. Bud has decades of editorial and writing experience on environmental and energy issues. But it isn’t just editors and videographers that make this a winning team; it is also their scientists. For example, Zeke Hausfather is a contributor. He is well respected for his work on temperature measurements and was an author on a major studies confirming the accuracy of the global temperature record and the rate of temperature change. He also worked for the Berkeley team which set out to test the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration/Nasa temperature measurements (they confirmed the measurements).  Karin Kirk is another regular contributor. She has an advanced degree in Earth Sciences from Montana State University and has combined her technical background with a focus on communication. There are other members of the Yale team I could mention but for brevity I will just encourage you to review their site."
"If you are like me, you picture the Amazon region as an ever lush, wet, tropical region filled with numerous plant and animal species. Who would imagine the Amazon experiencing drought? I mean sure, if we think of drought as “less water than usual,” then any place could have a drought. But what I tend to envision with respect to drought is truly dry.  People who work in this field have a more advanced understanding than I do about drought, how and why it occurs, its frequency and severity, and the impact on natural and human worlds. This recognition brings us to a very interesting paper recently published in Scientific Reports, entitled Unprecedented drought over tropical South America in 2016: significantly under-predicted by tropical SST [sea surface temperature]. So, what did this paper show?   Well, the Amazon region does encounter periodic droughts. There was one in 2005, another in 2010, both of which were 100-year events, and the most recent one in 2015-2016. The authors of this study, Amir Erfanian, Guiling Wang, and Lori Fomenko, all from the University of Connecticut, measured drought in three ways. They quantified the precipitation deficits and water storage on the ground. They also used two different vegetation measures of drought. The results showed that the most recent drought was unprecedented in severity. The video below shows a brief visual overview of the findings of this paper: But the authors really wanted to know why the drought occurred in the first place and why it was so severe. Droughts in the Amazon region are mainly driven by surface water temperatures in the neighboring oceans, particularly in the El Niño/La Niña region. So, the authors looked at the relationship between changes in precipitation and sea surface temperatures in tropical oceans. They found that warmer than usual water in the Atlantic and Pacific oceans was the main driver for the reduced rainfall during the three extreme droughts in the past decade.  The authors also found that the water temperatures alone could not adequately explain the size and severity of the 2015-2016 drought. This suggests that there are other factors involved as well. To be clear, the authors found that the relationship between water temperatures and drought worked well for prior droughts (the 2005 and 2010 droughts as well as 1983 and 1998 droughts, also El Niño years) but fell apart in 2015-2016. That is, using the relationship, the predicted 2015-2016 drought should not have been nearly as severe or as large as it was. The paper also reports that the 2015-2016 drought clearly exceeded that of the 100-year events in 2005 and 2010. So, in approximately one decade, this zone has had three 100-year events. Quite astonishing.  So why was SST unable to explain the 2015-2016 drought, like it had for past events? Part of it has to do with land-use changes. That is, human changes to the land surface such as deforestation. Another part is related to warming from greenhouse gases. It is clear that land-use changes can affect drought. As farmers deforest, for instance, they convert woodlands and forests into agricultural land. This changes not only the darkness (reflectivity) of the land, but it also impacts the transfer of water to and from the atmosphere (evapotranspiration).  One might ask how warming affects droughts. As air temperatures increase, air is able to evaporate water more rapidly and dry out surfaces. At the same time, air can contain more water vapor so that when rain does occur, it is more often in heavy downpours. These two changes underlie what is referred to as an accelerated hydrological cycle. Simply put, man-made warming is accelerating the movement of water through the ecosystem, which can cause drought even if precipitation does not decrease. Warming also causes changes in the large-scale patterns of air motion (atmospheric circulation) that reduces rainfall in this region. I communicated with the senior author, Dr. Wang, who told me: Since oceanic forcing could not fully explain the severity of the latest drought, one will have to account for the roles of greenhouse gas warming, land use land cover changes, and/or dynamic ecosystem feedback in order to advance the understanding, attribution and prediction of extreme droughts in this region. The frequent recurrence of severe droughts in the recent decade may be a precursor of what the future might have in store for this regional climate and ecosystem. So why do we care? Well, for a number of reasons. First of all, droughts in this part of the world create an increased risk for desertification and fire occurrence and hurt the region’s ecosystem, harm trees, and accelerate the release of carbon dioxide. We know that the 2005 drought, which was a 100-year event, led to a record number of wildfires and increased emissions. We also know that similar consequences occurred five years later during the 2010 drought. Similarly, smaller droughts in Brazil in 2007 and 2012 caused widespread water supply problems, particularly in densely populated locations. To make a long story short, investigating these additional factors may help better explain the most recent Amazon drought. Simply using the past relationship between SST and drought was not a sufficient explanation. This finding, and the recognition that droughts present real consequences for both human societies and natural ecological systems, should motivate us to take actions to reduce harm in the future."
"Norway’s plan to ramp up oil and gas production in the Arctic threatens global efforts to tackle climate change, according to a new study.  The research says 12 gigatonnes of carbon could be added by exploration sites in the Barents Sea and elsewhere over the next 50 years, which is 1.5 times more than the Norwegian fields currently being tapped or under construction.  The authors of the report from Oil Change International – an NGO backed by Friends of the Earth, WWF and Greenpeace – say this undermines the 2015 Paris agreement to cut worldwide emissions in order to keep the planet’s temperature rise to between 1.5C and 2C. The report highlights the “cognitive dissonance” between Norway’s progressive domestic measures to comply with the Paris agreement on emissions cuts and its role as Europe’s biggest exporter of fossil fuels.  Climate campaigners say this is like trying to put the brakes on climate change at home while stomping your foot on the global gas pedal.  Norway has proposed a record number of 93 blocks for oil and gas exploration in the Barents Sea this year, according to the report. Instead of adding new fossil fuel fields, it says Norway should reassert its environmental credentials by relying on existing production.  The study is the first of several detailed country-by-country follow-ups on a broader survey done by the group last year that highlighted the gulf between global pledges and national actions. They focussed on Norway because it has long been a supporter of ambitious global reduction targets and has used part of its oil revenues to develop renewable technologies and tackle deforestation. If it cannot leave fossil fuels in the ground and make the transition to a carbon-free economy, the authors ask, then how can any of its rivals in less developed nations be expected to do so? “This is uncharacteristically irrational behaviour for Norway,” said Hannah McKinnon of Oil Change International. “The Paris climate goals mean the world has to stay within a finite carbon budget. Norway’s current plans for fossil fuel production, expansion, and exploration are dangerously out of line with these budgets. Norway can’t be a climate leader at the same time as depending on new oil and gas production.” The government says such accusations are unfair because they run against the convention at international climate talks for the responsibility for emissions to lie with consumers rather than producers. In this regard – of purely domestic carbon use – it is doing better than most nations because it gets 97% of its electricity from renewable sources, has a high carbon tax, is a leader in promotion of electric vehicles, and is pioneering carbon capture and storage at waste plants and cement factories.  It also notes that oil and gas output is flat, it is unrealistic to assume that all exploration will be successful and the trend for overall production is away from carbon-heavy oil and towards cleaner gas, which is important as a “transition fuel” for countries that are trying to move away from coal. Officials point out that without Norway’s gas the UK would be far further behind in meeting its climate goals. “We are part of the solution, not the problem,” the deputy minister for petroleum and energy, Ingvil Smines Tybring-Gjedde, told the Guardian. “This government is investing more in renewables and energy efficiency than any other. But renewables are not yet at a level where we can switch off oil and gas. We need a bridge.” The government argues that its oil and gas reserves are the most efficiently extracted in the world and that, so as long as there is demand for these fuels, it is better that they come from Norway. It also puts the number of newly offered exploration blocks closer to 50. But the authors say this misses the point because Norway exports 10 times more carbon than it emits, which makes this relatively small country the seventh biggest source of the climate pollutant.  “This is the first time we have seen how Norway’s exports affect other countries,” says Silje Lundberg of Friends of the Earth Norway. The authors urge the government to reassert Norway’s climate and ethical leadership by committing immediately to a managed decline of production, which would be supported by 44% of Norwegians according to a recent poll. They cite studies [Norwegian] here and elsewhere that show leaving fossil fuels in the ground is the most cost-effective way of reducing emissions. Although the government warns other less efficient oil-producing countries would take up any shortfall left by Norway, Lundberg points to estimates by the government’s own statistical bureau that suggest there would still be an overall reduction of about a third.  Politicians from the two main parties are reluctant to scale back an industry that, as of June this year, provided almost 200,00 jobs and about 40% of the country’s export earnings. But they may not have much choice. Oil prices are less than half of their recent peak of 2014 and related employment has fallen by a fifth.  Globally, it is becoming harder to find investors for fossil fuel projects as renewables, such as solar and wind, become cheaper. Even with the very deep pockets of a $960bn sovereign wealth fund, Norway may yet baulk at the next big oil expansion – a proposed $13bn investment into the Wisting Field in the Barents Sea – that is due to be decided upon in the next two or three years. For the small Green Party – which surprised many by winning a power-broking position in Oslo’s last municipal elections – this will be a part of their campaign for next month’s national elections. “We greens have said we don’t want to support a government that continues to explore new oil. That would be hypocrisy,” said Lan Marie Nguyen Berg, deputy mayor of transport of environment in the capital. “We need to be less dependant on an industry that faces great turbulence in the coming decades.”"
"When the story of Volkswagen’s cheating on diesel emissions tests broke nearly two years ago, a number of reporters asked me if this spelled the end for diesel cars. My response was a confident, dismissive “no”. While dieselgate would cast a long shadow, there was no reason to write off diesel cars, at least in the short term. After all, the technology does exist to make clean diesel cars. It’s just a question of improving the existing regulations and enforcing them better. I was wrong.  Here is what we have learned in those two years: First, we underestimated the depth of the deception that has been propping up diesel cars in Europe and elsewhere. Evidence from testing performed by several governments in Europe and elsewhere, as well as by outside independent organisations, confirms that huge numbers of diesel car manufacturers have been cheating, at least outside the US. Even more troubling, evidence is piling up that this cheating was not the result of misunderstandings of regulatory requirements, or honest mistakes by some engineers, but well-thought-out corporate strategies. Second, the lowest-cost NOx emission control technology for smaller cars, the lean NOx trap, is inadequate to reduce diesel emissions from cars in the real world, and might have to be supplemented with additional after-treatment systems or abandoned entirely in favour of a better, but higher-cost, technology, selective catalytic reduction (SCR). Even then, SCR systems will have to be beefed-up from current designs. This is significant, because one reason manufacturers seem to have cheated is because doing the right thing cost more and would have made some diesel models less competitive on price. The revelation that German diesel car manufacturers might have colluded to under-specify the size of urea tanks in SCR system designs, among other things, is only the latest piece of evidence in this context. Third, we know much more about the global health impacts of high real-world NOx emissions. A study published earlier this year in Nature, in which some of my colleagues at the International Council on Clean Transportation were involved, estimated that excess diesel vehicle NOx emissions – amounts greater than are already nominally permitted under regulations – were linked to about 38,000 premature deaths worldwide in 2015, mostly in the EU, China, and India. The study projected that the impact of all real-world diesel NOx emissions, both permitted and “excess”, will grow to 183,600 early deaths in 2040. Fourth, the belief that diesel cars are necessary to meet fuel-efficiency standards and reduce CO2 emissions has been thoroughly debunked. Moving away from light-duty diesels towards improved gasoline, hybrid, and electric vehicles will actually lower the cost of meeting future vehicle CO2 standards. Diesels are not a bridge to a zero-carbon on-road transportation system, as some claim; diesels are blocking the path. Fifth, the prospects of long-term alternatives to diesels have improved dramatically. The cost of electric-vehicle batteries has come down faster than most of us, me included, thought possible. Granted, electric vehicles are not yet competitive on cost, or on some other attributes mainstream consumers care about. But it now seems very likely that electric vehicles will be competitive across different market segments much sooner than anticipated.  And so here we are, not quite two years since the revelations about Volkswagen first came to light and set off a chain reaction. Industry has worked to impede regulatory changes that could bring the urgent problem of excess NOx emissions under control. Within weeks of dieselgate, manufacturers in Europe were lobbying to set conformity factors in the new Real Driving Emissions on-road test that would permit them to emit NOx at more than twice the regulatory limits even under the unrealistically narrow range of driving conditions that the test features. As a result, European diesel cars may not meet Euro 6 emission limits until 2024 – a decade of failure that will cost tens of thousands of lives. In India, manufacturers are resisting early adoption of improved testing procedures and real driving emissions tests altogether. In Thailand, manufacturers are pushing to delay implementation of Euro 6 standards from 2020 to 2028. The list goes on. Even if Europe somehow manages to solve its problem of high diesel car emissions over the next several years, it is likely to persist for much longer in Asia and Africa unless something happens to change things. Diesel technology is becoming decreasingly competitive; hybrid and electric vehicle technology, increasingly so. This is happening at the same time as cities around the world are seeking to restrict diesel car usage directly or indirectly, for example by imposing additional toxicity charges on diesel cars. The resale value of diesel cars is under pressure. The tax differential between diesel and gasoline fuel is being reduced in France, and other countries hope to follow suit. As a result, diesel car sales at least in Europe and India show signs of having peaked, and might be on a long-term downward trajectory already. Investors in manufacturers planning to build diesel cars should perhaps begin to worry not about a return on their capital, but about the return of their capital. The death of diesel cars may not be imminent, but the patient is terminally ill. Policymakers face a stark choice: keep it on life support, or not. Short-term measures can keep light-duty diesels alive. But at what cost? Daimler’s CEO Dieter Zetsche says diesel is worth fighting for. Everything we have learned over the past two years tells us it is not. We must fight, but for clean air, to save lives, and for a zero emission future."

"What can we say about the role of climate change in the unprecedented disaster that is unfolding in Houston with Hurricane Harvey? There are certain climate change-related factors that we can, with great confidence, say worsened the flooding.  Sea level rise attributable to climate change – some of which is due to coastal subsidence caused by human disturbance such as oil drilling – is more than half a foot (15cm) over the past few decades (see here for a decent discussion). That means the storm surge was half a foot higher than it would have been just decades ago, meaning far more flooding and destruction. In addition to that, sea surface temperatures in the region have risen about 0.5C (close to 1F) over the past few decades from roughly 30C (86F) to 30.5C (87F), which contributed to the very warm sea surface temperatures (30.5-31C, or 87-88F).  There is a simple thermodynamic relationship known as the Clausius-Clapeyron equation that tells us there is a roughly 3% increase in average atmospheric moisture content for each 0.5C of warming. Sea surface temperatures in the area where Harvey intensified were 0.5-1C warmer than current-day average temperatures, which translates to 1-1.5C warmer than “average” temperatures a few decades ago. That means 3-5% more moisture in the atmosphere.  That large amount of moisture creates the potential for much greater rainfalls and greater flooding. The combination of coastal flooding and heavy rainfall is responsible for the devastating flooding that Houston is experiencing.  Not only are the surface waters of the Gulf of Mexico unusually warm right now, but there is a deep layer of warm water that Harvey was able to feed upon when it intensified at near record pace as it neared the coast. Human-caused warming is penetrating down into the ocean. It’s creating deeper layers of warm water in the Gulf and elsewhere. Harvey was almost certainly more intense than it would have been in the absence of human-caused warming, which means stronger winds, more wind damage and a larger storm surge. (As an example of how this works, we have shown that climate change has led to a dramatic increase in storm surge risk in New York City, making devastating events like Hurricane Sandy more likely.)  Finally, the more tenuous but potentially relevant climate factors: part of what has made Harvey such a devastating storm is the way it has stalled near the coast. It continues to pummel Houston and surrounding regions with a seemingly endless deluge, which will likely top out at nearly 4ft (1.22m) of rainfall over a days-long period before it is done.  The stalling is due to very weak prevailing winds, which are failing to steer the storm off to sea, allowing it to spin around and wobble back and forth. This pattern, in turn, is associated with a greatly expanded subtropical high pressure system over much of the US at the moment, with the jet stream pushed well to the north. This pattern of subtropical expansion is predicted in model simulations of human-caused climate change.  More tenuous, but possibly relevant still, is the fact that very persistent, nearly “stationary” summer weather patterns of this sort, where weather anomalies (both high-pressure dry hot regions and low-pressure stormy/rainy regions) stay locked in place for many days at a time, appears to be favoured by human-caused climate change. We recently published a paper in the academic journal Scientific Reports on this phenomenon.  In conclusion, while we cannot say climate change “caused” Hurricane Harvey (that is an ill-posed question), we can say is that it exacerbated several characteristics of the storm in a way that greatly increased the risk of damage and loss of life. Climate change worsened the impact of Hurricane Harvey."
"So, the government is committed to banning all diesel and petrol cars by 2040 (Report, 26 July). Has it considered the wider impacts? Power stations will face huge peak-time demand when drivers charge vehicles overnight. Can they cope? Will we face increased electricity charges?  The rare metals in lithium batteries are produced only in inconvenient places. More than 85% of the world’s supply comes from China. How dependent will that make us upon them? Mining these materials is far from environmentally friendly. Each tonne processed produces 2,000 tonnes of toxic waste, laced with ammonia and hydrochloric acid. Much is dumped into landfill, decimating agriculture and poisoning drinking water. The very manufacture of an electric vehicle can create a large carbon footprint, offsetting global warming benefits. Then there is the issue of safe disposal of obsolete batteries. We could create more problems than we solve.William Harry PlantCrook, County Durham • The ban on petrol and diesel vehicles will have no immediate impact. The reality is that the decarbonisation of transport will require a combination of solutions. The government should start with the roll-out of E10, a readily available greener fuel containing 10% bioethanol. This would offer an immediate solution to improving air quality, equivalent to taking 700,000 cars off the road. It requires no new infrastructure, is compatible with almost all petrol cars today and provides a practical, simple, low-cost solution to addressing worsening air quality. E10 also provides a greener option for the petrol needed for hybrid vehicles that a growing number of consumers are opting for today, as consumer confidence in pure electric vehicles remains low. Bioethanol is a non-fossil renewable fuel which, when blended with petrol, has lower NOx and particulates than diesel, and is non-carcinogenic. Our industry has already invested over £1bn in the UK to produce it. Yet again, we are missing a golden opportunity to take action today to deliver on our climate and air quality goals, and of course to support farming and those jobs in the UK already employed in this industry.Mark ChesworthManaging director, Vivergo Fuels • If petrol and diesel cars are replaced by electric cars then this will reduce tailpipe emissions, but not non-tailpipe emissions, which can still contribute significantly to air pollution, particularly for particulate matter. It will also reduce noise from engines, but not from tyres. Car infrastructure (roads and parking) takes up space that can be used in much better ways that are healthier for the population, for example by making it car-free public space or green space. This will also reduce heat-island effects. Finally, many people do not get enough physical activity, partly due to the use of cars, which cause disease and premature mortality. A shift away from the car to public and active transport (walking and cycling) can facilitate an increase in physical activity and save thousands of lives. We urgently need a rethink of what we want our cities to be: detrimental to health or promoting health. A shift away from car-centric cities to more active and green cities is urgently needed to achieve the latter, and a ban on diesel and patrol cars is only a small step.Mark J NieuwenhuijsenResearch professor in environmental epidemiology, Barcelona Institute for Global Health  • The traffic jam on the M25 shown in your picture (Carmakers fear ban on petrol and diesel cars may lead to bumpy road, 27 July) would still be undesirable even if they were all non-polluting vehicles. Commuting on today’s scale is largely unproductive, whatever the transport mode, in both economic and personal terms. The first postwar new towns, such as Harlow, were designed to be “self-contained and balanced communities for living and working”. For the first few years that was largely achieved, until it was destroyed by globalisation. Today thousands commute out and a similar number commute in. In planning the new developments needed to solve the housing crisis, a return to that principle as far as possible would be highly desirable.Frank JacksonHarlow, Essex • City councils are rightly concerned that ministers’ pollution plans don’t stack up (Clean air plan condemned as weak and inadequate, 27 July). The government’s own evidence shows that charging for urban driving is the quickest way to meet legally binding pollution thresholds. Yet ministers would rather councils removed speed humps instead. Far from cutting the 40,000 deaths annually due to pollution, this would merely increase the numbers killed by speeding. Meanwhile the vast sums being spent on England’s motorways and trunk roads mean yet more traffic on our city streets. And now councils are being deprived of the means either to restrain urban traffic or to invest in healthy alternatives such as cycling and walking. If funded adequately, the government’s cycling and walking investment strategy could be a fantastic way to reduce not only pollution but also congestion, road danger and ill-health due to physical inactivity. These four urban transport problems impose similar annual costs on society: about £10bn each, according to government estimates. Electric cars can address only the first of them, whereas cycling and walking could tackle all four. Will it take another court case before Mr Gove heeds the evidence?Roger Geffen Policy director, Cycling UK • The latest clean air plan looks likely to put Sheffield back in the fog again. Not only are we choked by “Chelsea tractors” doing the school run and idling queues of traffic, but the decision not to electrify our main railway line to London means that diesel locomotives will continue to add to our respiratory misery.Mike PeartSheffield • The business secretary, Greg Clark, says that the decision by BMW to assemble an electric version of the Mini at Cowley is a vote of confidence in the UK industrial strategy to be the “go to” place for next-generation vehicles (Report, 26 July). The facts suggest otherwise. The key component for the electric version (the electric drivetrain) will come ready-made from Germany to be integrated into a variant of a car already in production at Cowley. The only “go to” aspect of the arrangement seems to be that the key technology element will be made in Germany and “go to” Cowley. Good for jobs at Cowley maybe, but rather lame as an industrial strategy. Other countries, including Germany, Japan, China, France and the US, are investing significantly in technology for electric vehicles. If we really expect to be a major player in this new area we will have to invest on a similar scale, and there is little sign of that.Rod LoganWalton-on-Thames, Surrey  • Join the debate – email guardian.letters@theguardian.com • Read more Guardian letters – click here to visit gu.com/letters"

"Randy Kolka hands me a fist-sized clump of brownish-black material pulled up by an auger from a bog. It’s the color and texture of moist chocolate cake. When I look closely I can see filaments of plant material. This hunk of peat, pulled from two meters (7ft) below the surface, is about 8,000 years old. I’m holding plants that lived and died before the Egyptians constructed the pyramids and before humans invented the wheel. In my hand is history. And carbon gold.  “That’s the oldest [from this bog] right there,” says Kolka, a soil scientist with the USDA Forest Service Northern Research Station. Two hundred miles north of Minneapolis, I’m visiting the Marcell Experimental Forest, which has conducted research on northern Minnesota peatlands since 1960 and today conducts some of the world’s leading research into how peatlands, and their vast carbon stores, might react to a warming world.  These peatlands – the largest in the lower 48 – started forming during the end of the ice age when depressions carved out by great glaciers created pools for sphagnum moss and other water-loving vegetation to take root. Most peatlands today were born as lakes – “sometimes at the bottom … you’ll find shells,” Kolka explains – then became marshes and finally bogs with meters of carbon-rich peat dating back millennia. Peatlands are created when dead vegetation subsides, partially decayed and partially preserved, into waterlogged landscapes or when the water table rises, overtaking the vegetation. The organic material doesn’t fully degrade due to a lack of oxygen in the wetlands. It accumulates and compresses, trapping the carbon the living plants had captured from the air. Over time, peatlands today could become coal deposits tomorrow, essentially storing carbon in perpetuity – unless someone decided to burn it for energy. Peatlands are the superheroes of ecosystems: purifying water, sometimes mitigating flooding and providing a home for rare species. And they beat nearly every system when it comes to carbon storage. Known peatlands only cover about 3% of the world’s land surface, but store at least twice as much carbon as all of Earth’s standing forests. In addition, at least one-third of the world’s organic soil carbon, which plays a vital role in mitigating climate change and stabilizing the carbon cycle, is in peatlands. “From a climate perspective, [peatlands] are the most essential terrestrial ecosystem,” says Tim Christophersen, a senior program officer with Forests and Climate at the United Nations Environment Programme. Unlike rainforests or coral reefs, peatlands have largely been ignored by researchers and policymakers, to the extent that we don’t even know where all of the world’s peatlands are. Scientists used to believe that the vast majority of the world’s peatlands were in boreal and temperate areas, such as Minnesota, but we now know that the tropics are also home to huge areas of peatlands. Early in 2017, scientists announced they had discovered the world’s largest tropical peatland in the Congo. The massive peatland – covering an area larger than New York State – stores as much carbon as is emitted from burning fossil fuels globally in three years, about 30bn metric tonnes. “Many countries still do not know if they have peatlands,” Christophersen says. A study published this year in Global Change Biology estimates that tropical peatlands – the most important in terms of carbon storage – may cover three times more land than previously estimated. But they are difficult to find because not all wetlands contain peat. The only way to know for sure is to send researchers to sample the soil, and that takes money. Greta Dargie, a research fellow at the University of Leeds, helped discover the peatlands in the Congo. She says the best way to uncover the world’s still-hidden peatlands and make sure they aren’t destroyed for agriculture is to start with satellite data and “identify areas which have the potential [for peatlands]”. As researchers look for unknown peatlands, the peatlands we do know about are under threat from a wide variety of human impacts. Historically, they’ve been seen as wastelands that can be conveniently converted into agriculture, since people don’t usually live on them. “Peatlands are facing tremendous pressures due to deforestation, conversions and drainage for agriculture, and infrastructure development,” says Daniel Murdiyarso, a senior scientist with the Indonesia-based Center for International Forestry Research. Sixty percent of the world’s known tropical peatlands are in southeast Asia where destruction is rampant (though a recent Global Change Biology study estimates that South America, not southeast Asia, may in fact hold more peatlands). In Indonesia, vast tracts of peatlands have been drained to make room for palm oil or pulp and paper plantations. Like humans, peatlands need water to survive. When peatlands are drained, the compressed organic matter begins to decay, turning long-submerged carbon into carbon dioxide and adding more greenhouse gases to our already overheated atmosphere. Complicating matters, peatlands and all wetlands are natural sources of methane, a more potent but shorter-lived greenhouse gas. In some cases, draining may actually decrease methane emissions. Drained peatlands also become susceptible to burning – and when they burn, they are almost impossible to put out. In 2015 Indonesia’s peatlands burned en masse after years of draining and deforestation. The fires spread a toxic yellow haze over much of the region. The crisis cost Indonesia over $16bn, according to the World Bank; released more than 800m metric tonnes of CO2; and, according to one study, led to the premature deaths of 100,000 people in Indonesia, Malaysia and Singapore. Murdiyarso says that palm oil, pulp and paper, and other agricultural businesses in Indonesia may be considered “success stories” in terms of profit, “but if the environmental costs are internalized, the story will be different”. Indonesia is not doing this, but since the 2015 fires the country has set a total moratorium on any development in peatlands. However, mixed messages from regional governments, lack of clear land tenure and corruption mean the central government has its work cut out for it. The good news is that if we block drainage canals, peatlands can be partly restored by preventing water levels from declining further. Planting native plants in degraded areas can also help by retaining water. Further damage can be mitigated by such measures, but whether damaged peatlands will ever recover their lost carbon and ecological potential, Kolka says no one knows, and if they can, timescales could be in the thousands of years. One potential way to secure the world’s vulnerable peatlands is through the global carbon market. Indonesian entrepreneur Dharsono Hartono spent nine years working to secure a Verified Carbon Standard (VCS) for his Katingan Project in Borneo. Today it’s the largest land use VCS project on the planet, covering 157,875 hectares (390,000 acres) of peatland containing a gigatonne of carbon, according to Hartono, and is a vital community project promoting less carbon-intensive agriculture. Carbon storage varies by peatland but generally is 30–70kg of carbon per cubic meter (35 cubic feet). “This is a long-term business, you just have to be persistent,” Hartono says, adding that now that his “product” is ready he’s on the look out for buyers. Hartono started the project with a focus on climate change, but he says it has since transformed: “It’s become a story of the people,” he says, who are the “heart and soul” of the project. Thirty-four villages surround Hartono’s concession in a buffer area that is partly peatlands as well. In order to protect the main site from fires, the project also has to change neighboring farms. Hartono and his team have spent the past few years helping communities shift from slash-and-burn farming to what he calls “climate-smart agriculture.” “You have to find a solution, you can’t just tell people not to burn,” he says. They developed a program of using cover crops of legumes to suppress weeds and injecting select bacteria into the soil to decompose organic matter rapidly, which provides extra nutrients to the soil without burning. They are also encouraging farmers to steer away from planting oil palm and instead focus on a diverse set of crops. “We want to build the forest back in the community land,” Hartono explains. With community buy-in, Hartono may not only succeed in protecting one of Indonesia’s largest intact peatlands, but also improve the lives of those who live nearby by better protecting the environment they depend on and allowing them to avoid the social and economic issues – such as price shocks, heavy pesticide use and dealing with large corporations – that come when local farmers depend solely on palm oil. But even finding and protecting peatlands may not be enough in a warming world. Back in Minnesota, Kolka takes me to visit the research center’s newest and most important project: the Spruce and Peatland Responses Under Changing Environments (Spruce). A collaboration between the US Department of Energy and Oak Ridge National Laboratory, Spruce may be the most cutting-edge research on peatlands today. Here, 10 massive open-air chambers sit along three boardwalks. In some of these eight-meter high chambers, researchers are adding heat – both above and below the peat – to mimic a warmer atmosphere. In other chambers, researchers have added higher concentrations of CO2. Some get both treatments. Spruce scientists are trying to answer a potentially world-changing question: How will peatlands react as the world warms and CO2 concentrations rise? Scientists fear that peatlands may go from being a carbon sink to a massive, unstoppable source. If climate change causes peatlands to dry out, it could mean a slow – or possibly sudden – release of tonnes of CO2 into the atmosphere. Further warming, more potential release of CO2: a textbook example of a positive feedback loop. Even more worrying are the bogs, fens and peatlands locked in the permafrost further north: if those melt, researchers fear a sudden influx of massive amounts of both CO2 and methane. The project is in its infancy, but Kolka says so far the good news is highlighted in a 2016 Spruce study that found heating the peat does not result in a loss of carbon or methane below one foot, which means old carbon may stay locked away even in a significantly warmer world. Kolka says Spruce will help inform climate models for the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, the UN group that provides scientific and economic research to the world’s governments on climate change. We hike out deeper along a boardwalk into one of the bogs, where the peat goes eight meters deep. “This is sort of one of my favorite places on the planet out here,” Kolka says. “This is what I consider the ultimate bog.” Although 150 years old, the trees are thin and straggly; the mosquitoes are out and feasting; the land is flat and unstable. I wonder how many people would see the landscape as Kolka does. “It does things that no other ecosystem does from a functional stand point, from processing chemicals to nutrients. It’s one of the harshest environments on the planet,” he says. “And one of the most important.” It’s then that I realize, to save peatlands, we need to see them differently."
"I feel for Laurie Penny, who is caught between pressure to have children and pressing reasons not to have them (‘Women shouldn’t apologise for the pitter-patter of tiny carbon footprints’, Review, 29 July). However, a solution is staring her in the face: respond to the pressure by citing the pressing reasons. Various global disasters are plausibly likely to occur in a few decades – see The Uninhabitable Earth by David Wallace-Wells. Even if Wallace-Wells’ article overestimates and only half of those disasters really occur, humans will be in for a rough time starting around mid-century.

"It is 9am and the temperature in Kuwait City is 45C and rising, but already people working outside. A row of litter-pickers are already hard at work along a coastal highway, their entire bodies covered to protect them from the sun. Outside one of the city’s many malls, valets hover beside the air-conditioned entrance, while two men in white hats huddle wearily next to their ice cream stands.  Other city residents are luckier. They can avoid the outdoors altogether, escaping the inferno by sheltering in malls, cars and office buildings, where temperatures are kept polar-cold.   For years, Kuwait’s climate has been steadily heating up. In the summer months, the Gulf state now frequently touches 50C, and was last year awarded the grim prize of being the hottest place on earth, when temperatures reached a staggering high of 54C.  But while the capital is making plans to prepare for climate change and the rising heat, there are growing concerns for those residents who cannot afford to shelter inside, and mounting questions about how such an energy-intensive city can survive as resources such as water and oil dwindle. Nearly 70% of Kuwait’s population is made up of migrant workers, many of whom power the near-constant construction of new office complexes and malls across the state. Though labour legislation now bans work outdoors between 12pm and 4pm, many are seen toiling through the hottest hours of the day regardless. During a recent visit, the Guardian witnessed tens of labourers on a building site close to Kuwait international airport working well past the 12pm deadline in 47C heat. Climbing on scaffolding amid the skeleton frame of a future shopping mall, some tried to take shelter in the shade available, as others swigged from bottle of water to cool down. The irony: they were installing air conditioning. One company manager overseeing the site, who asked to remain anonymous, said: “Here in Kuwait or in the Gulf, you can see that most of the labourers are not citizens. They come from Egypt, India or Bangladesh.” Many of the toughest jobs on the site are subcontracted out, he explained, allowing companies to flout laws designed to shield workers from the heat. If the labourers decline to work in these conditions, “they won’t get any money and will be forced to return to their home countries”, he said. He added that he had never witnessed a government inspection targeting working conditions, and that official were only concerned with workers’ residency visas. The conditions for those men and women forced to work outside are set to worsen: between 2010 and 2035, Kuwait’s annual average temperature will increase by 1.6% to 28.7C , according to the country’s Environmental Public Authority (EPA), making for increasingly sweltering summer temperatures and more of the dust storms that already plague Kuwait City and beyond. “Yes, we’re under pressure,” says Shareef al-Khayat, head of the climate change division at the EPA. “Not just from rising temperatures, but sea level rises – the demand for electricity and water will also be harder in the future.” His colleague, Sameera al-Kandari, jokes: “But we’re prepared – we have air conditioning everywhere!” One of the problems at the heart of Kuwait City’s struggle against the effects of climate change is the central role that oil has played – and continues to play – in the construction of the urban landscape: the discovery of the precious resource in 1938 not only created a deeply felt symbol of national pride, and massive wealth, but reshaped the design of modern Kuwait City from the ground up.  The 1952 “Kuwait masterplan” drew ideas from British urban planners – such as Ebenezer Howard’s garden city movement – to completely remodel the city, demolishing the previous close-knit mud-brick buildings adapted to the local climate that made up the Old City, and replacing them with more western notions of what an urban environment should look like.  Kuwait City subsequently underwent a radical transformation, switching to a grid system where cars – powered by cheap petrol – were required to navigate the maze of highways for almost all everyday tasks.  “The planners who came [in the mid-20th century] planned according to the highways and then started filling in the blanks,” explains Dr Nasser B Abulhasan, head of AGi Architects, a firm trying to spur sustainable building in Kuwait. “Unfortunately in this region, the way they look at sustainability is limited. In practice, Abdulhasan says, this means “using solar panels to feed air-conditioning machines on the roof of fully [glass] glazed buildings. But why do I have a fully glazed building, as I need to pump more energy to cool it?” How will such an energy-intensive city cope as the abundance of resources such as oil and water dwindle? Dr Mohammed al-Rashid of the Kuwait Institute for Scientific Research predicts that by 2030, “30% of the oil produced here will be needed for electricity and water production”. Around 99% of the country’s fresh water comes from desalination, itself an energy-intensive process currently heavily dependent on oil. Covered reservoirs, blue-and-white striped like candy, jut out of the dusty landscape along desert highways – essential in a region with the highest water consumption in the world. And yet here, water is heavily subsidised by the government: the average consumer pays just over £2 [0.8 Kuwaiti dinars] per 1,000 gallons, supplementing the real price of £25.50 [10 KWD]. Though Kuwait has the second-largest reserve of water in the Gulf Cooperation Council – made up of the UAE, Bahrain, Saudi Arabia, Oman, Qatar and Kuwait – this is only enough for nine days’ worth of consumption, says al-Rashid, though it could last 50 days with conservation. Either way, it is clear that the city-state is heading towards an existential crisis in a world that needs to learn to live without oil.  One solution AGi proposes is a rethinking of the way buildings are designed, offering an alternative to the large, glass-clad structures reliant on continuous air conditioning. The firm’s creations are designed to use less energy from their inception, and are often inspired by traditional Persian windcatcher towers, clad in terracotta and with carefully-placed windows that face away from the sun. These draw in air from outdoors, channelling it across a pool of water at ground level to cool the entire building through a central courtyard. “Environmentally, but also socially, it goes back to what the traditional city was like,” says Aisha Alsager, managing director of AGi. Al-Kandari of the EPA also explains that construction on an $4bn eco-friendly “smart city” for Kuwait will begin in 2019. “This means applying technology to make life easier,” he says. “The city will have buses, not cars, for transportation. There will be more places for walking, and sensors will monitor water consumption, helping us to reuse water. Air conditioning will be controlled by block, not by house.” The project will be built by a consortium of South Korean construction companies, and is expected to accommodate 25,000 to 40,000 households. But not everyone is convinced. “They say they want to make a green city, but they haven’t made the basis of what makes a greener city clear,” says Dr Abulhasan of AGi. “The only thing defined so far is using solar panels and better quality glazing – they haven’t said shrink everything,” he added, emphasising that becoming accustomed to living in smaller spaces is a key part of the transition to a more sustainable environment. “We need to change the way we live, and the way we move around the city,” adds Alsager. “Everywhere around the world is removing highways, and in Kuwait we’re increasing them tenfold.”  Adapting to rising temperatures will require a radical shift in thinking in Kuwait, especially concerning the most vulnerable. “We can’t manage the way these companies work,” says the construction manager, referring to the contractors who incentivise labourers to work outside in punishing conditions. “Of course, when I see labourers working after midday in this heat, it’s horrible. But what can we do? It’s their rules.”  Follow Guardian Cities on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram to join the discussion, and explore our Archive"
"In a democracy, we hope that science helps to inform the public about its problems. In the case of climate change, believe it or not, the evidence suggests this is going relatively well.  Climate science is a vast, sprawling field of knowledge that has achieved great success in occupying the public consciousness. According to Yale University’s Climate Change in the American Mind project, six in ten Americans are worried about global warming, seven in ten think global warming is happening and eight in ten think humans have the ability to reduce global warming. These figures have fluctuated very little since 2012, suggesting that the US public is relatively well informed about the risk, reality and policy potential of climate change, even in the face of well-documented attacks by climate sceptics.  Despite this evidence that the public knows enough about climate change to regard it as a problem, some climate communication researchers continue to claim that the public remain misinformed. Some have focused their attention on the proportion of the public that know the level of consensus within climate science. In 2013, a group of researchers launched the Consensus Project, publishing a claim that 97.1% of journal articles expressing a position on anthropogenic global warming either explicitly state or imply that humans cause warming. The claim made a huge media splash, became a key part of the Obama administration’s climate change messaging, and even gave birth to a new Guardian blog. The Yale report has found that only one in ten Americans could correctly identify the approximate level of scientific consensus. It is argued that perceptions of the degree of consensus play a “pivotal role” in “acceptance of science” and that awareness of scientific consensus is a “gateway belief” towards increasing public concern about climate change.  The debate around these perceptions and their significance is going on within a relatively small pool of researchers, and the argument over effects is intense. Put this in the context of broader debates in psychology about replication and the usefulness of laboratory studies and we get a picture of a young field of study that is yet to reach a “consensus on consensus”. Nonetheless, we are left with a puzzle: if so few Americans appear to know the exact level of scientific consensus, why do so many of them think climate change is real and worrisome? The simplest explanation is that the public have already heard enough about the scientific evidence to make up their mind, without being fed increasingly esoteric information about levels of scientific agreement. The real question is not whether the US public think climate change is a problem (most of them do), but what should be done about it. Here it is the crucial non-scientific issues around climate change that should take centre stage. Instead, valuable media and political attention has been expended on boosting the 97% meme, crowding out deeper conversations about policy framing, coalition building, public values and morality which do not lend themselves to headline numbers. I was one of a team of social scientists making this point in an article published in the journal Environmental Communication last week. Summarising several decades of social science research on the politics of science and technology, we argue that numbers cannot help to tie people together in the absence of other social connections, that policy progress does not necessarily rise or fall on the basis of scientific consensus, and that drives for consensus-seeking are part of a more troubling trend towards depoliticising key policy issues. Our commentary prompted a tetchy reaction in a newsletter from Climate Nexus, a climate communication organisation dedicated to “a constructive search for solutions”. Rather than engaging with the arguments or providing counter-evidence, they described us as “fluffheads”, “no men in no man’s land between reality and denial” (half of us are women), and said that our arguments should not be publicised in the media. .@ClimateNexus outrageously labels new #EnvComm commentary as ""Denier Roundup,"" proving authors points abt efforts to close off debate. pic.twitter.com/4varP1J1Is Climate activists are clearly pained by the glacial progress being made on climate policy, as am I. However, there is as yet no convincing evidence that consensus quantification plays a significant role in building the public’s understanding of climate change. Attempts by climate communicators to shut down this argument is quite the opposite of “constructive” and smacks of the same cavalier attitude to evidence displayed by many climate sceptics over the years. More importantly, consensus messaging is an attempt to win political arguments with scientific numbers and risks a further politicisation of science that the US can ill-afford. It is less about informing democracy and more about reducing engagement to the level of a trivia quiz. Warren Pearce is a Research Fellow (iHuman) at the University of Sheffield."
"Sam Clovis, who has been nominated by Donald Trump to be the Department of Agriculture’s (USDA) top scientist, previously ran a blog where he called progressives “race traders and race ‘traitors’” and likened Barack Obama to a “communist” and a “dictator”.  Clovis, previously a college professor and radio talkshow host in Iowa, wrote the blog for his show Impact with Clovis. The website has been taken down but is archived.    In a September 2011 post, Clovis said that Obama was “brought up by socialists to be a socialist. His associations were socialists or worse, criminal dissidents who were bent on overthrowing the government of the United States.”  Warming to the theme, Clovis claimed in subsequent posts that Obama had a “communist father, socialist mother” and “has designs on being a dictator”. Obama’s followers, Clovis claimed are “progressive, Maoist, anti-colonist”.  Clovis, who served in the Air Force for 25 years, turned his attention to race in August 2011, labeling progressives as “liars, race traders and race traitors”. He also accused progressives of keeping “minorities in this country enslaved to government” with a supposed desire to “essentially eliminate people of color from the American landscape”.  In June 2011, Clovis said the civil rights leader WEB Du Bois was “the first race trader” for convincing black people to vote for Woodrow Wilson.   According to CNN, a USDA spokesperson defended Clovis. “Dr Clovis is a proud conservative and a proud American,” the spokesperson said. “All of his reporting either on the air or in writing over the course of his career has been based on solid research and data. He is after all an academic.”  Clovis is a departure from previous USDA’s chief scientists, without a strong science background. He also departs from mainstream scientists with his views on climate change, which he said he was “skeptical” about in 2014, claiming that “a lot of the science is junk science”.  Despite this colorful background, or perhaps because of it, the Trump administration has nominated Clovis and is awaiting his confirmation. In July, agriculture secretary Sonny Perdue said Clovis was a “trusted advisor and a steady hand”.  “He looks at every problem with a critical eye, relying on sound science and data, and will be the facilitator and integrator we need,” Perdue added. “Dr Clovis has served this nation proudly since he was a very young man, and I am happy he is continuing to serve.”  Clovis was Trump’s top policy advisor in 2015 when the presidential candidate announced his infamous Muslim ban. The former Iowa college professor described the policy of banning all Muslims from entering the United States to the Guardian as a “reasonable precaution” in order to “stop, take a break, have a look and make sure everything is cool”"
"The first generation of electric-car buyers have been people with homes where it is easy to plug one in. “The vast majority of Nissan Leaf customers are [families with] 2.4 children, mums and dads, with off-street parking,” said Gareth Dunsmore of Nissan Europe. “Tomorrow that won’t be the case.”  Dunsmore envisages charging points becoming ubiquitous at workplaces, and at shopping centres, railway stations, hotels and cinemas. For longer journeys, rapid chargers that can recharge a car’s battery in 30 minutes will increasingly proliferate across motorway service stations and at conventional refuelling stations. For drivers living on terraced streets, the answers are not so simple but solutions are beginning to emerge. For example, Kensington and Chelsea council is running a trial with a UK energy company and German firm to add charging sockets to street lamps. Most mass market electric cars today have a range of 100-150 miles before the battery runs flat. Some of the top-end cars, such as Tesla’s electric sports cars, can run for 334 miles before needing a plug socket.  While that may not sound much compared to the 400-500 miles or more that a petrol or diesel car can manage before refilling, most car journeys in the UK would easily be accomplished in an electric car. Half of journeys are one to five miles; 38% are for five to 25 miles and only 2% are for 50 miles and more.  Of course, some people will need to go much further – and that’s where plug-in hybrids come in, using a petrol engine to run an electric motor after the battery runs out.  Improving battery technology is expected to extend even pure electric cars’ ranges to about 400 miles within a decade. Londoners in an electric car can already enter the congestion charge zone for free. If the government’s anti-pollution drive leads to more towns and cities imposing an air quality zone, that could lead to more tolls, from which electric cars are likely to be exempt.  In terms of upfront costs, electric cars are still clearly more expensive than conventional ones – but companies like Renault and Nissan are getting around that with deals where buyers lease the battery. For example, the UK’s best-selling electric, the Nissan Leaf, is £16,680 with the battery on lease for a monthly fee, rising to £21,680 if you buy the battery outright. Electricity is certainly cheaper than petrol or diesel. Travelling 100 miles in an electric car will cost £3-£4 depending on energy tariffs, compared with £15 in a petrol car. Affordability is a key issue. When Volvo announced all its new car launches would by electric or hybrid from 2019, it stressed that they would be premium models, ie expensive.  Jack Cousens of the AA said: “Buying a car is an important financial decision, and families on low incomes will need government assistance and incentives to make the change to electric vehicles.” Makers of electric cars sell their models with a warranty for the battery, which will lose capacity over time. In the case of the Nissan Leaf, it’s covered for five years or 60,000 miles, rising to eight years or 100,000 miles for the version with a bigger battery. But yes, eventually you will need to either buy a new battery – by which time their cost should have fallen – or sell the car on.  Electric cars have been around long enough in the UK for a second-hand battery market to be emerging. One energy company, Eaton, is already selling used electric batteries for reuse as household batteries. Probably, yes. One car-buying website says bad headlines for diesels, which on average sell for £7,000 used, are causing prices to fall faster in value than before. Motorway.co.uk predicts that over the next year the average price of used diesel cars could fall as much as 15% compared to their current depreciation rate. There are 8,476 filling stations across the UK. Energy analysts Wood Mackenzie say they are closing at a rate of about 100 a year and, with the rise of an electrified fleet, there will probably be no more than 6,000 sites by 2035. Numbers will probably continue to fall, although some may be converted to fast-charging sites Yes, even with fossil fuels in the power mix. In the UK, 50% of power is now generated from low carbon sources, and with that share growing rapidly in the next decade, emissions from electric cars will fall too. Analysts are expecting a 100-fold increase in the production of lithium, the key material in electric cars’ batteries. Much of that will come from South America, particularly Chile and Bolivia, which claims to have 70% of the world’s lithium reserves. China and Australia also provide lithium."
"2014, 2015, and 2016 each broke the global temperature record. A new study led by climate scientist Michael Mann just published in Geophysical Research Letters used climate model simulations to examine the odds that these records would have been set in a world with and without human-caused global warming. In model simulations without a human climate influence, the authors concluded:  To put those numbers in perspective, you have about a one-in-3,000 (0.03%) chance of being struck by lightning in your lifetime. You have about as much chance of being struck by lightning this year as 2014, 2015, and 2016 each being as hot as they were due solely to natural effects. That means denying human-caused global warming is like planning to be struck by lightning three years in a row. Perhaps a tinfoil hat will help. On the other hand, in model simulations accounting for human-caused global warming, the odds of these events goes up substantially: It’s unusual to have three consecutive record-breaking years even with the aid of global warming, but without the human climate influence, it simply wouldn’t happen.  These findings tie in to the “leaked” the National Climate Assessment report, which climate scientists sent to the New York Times for fear that the Trump administration would censor or suppress the document. Previous drafts of the report were available to the public, although few take notice before the final version is published. Climate scientists worried that the administration would tamper with that final version. Among the report’s conclusions: Many lines of evidence demonstrate that it is extremely likely [95%–100% confidence] that human influence has been the dominant cause of the observed warming since the mid-20th century … the likely range of the human contribution to the global mean temperature increase over the period 1951–2000 is … 92%–123%. This conclusion is consistent with the latest IPCC report, which likewise concluded that humans are responsible for all of the global warming since 1951. These conclusions are denied by many members of the Trump administration. For example, Trump’s EPA administrator Scott Pruitt said earlier this year: I would not agree that [CO2] is a primary contributor to the global warming that we see. Similarly, when Trump’s Department of Energy secretary Rick Perry was confronted with the 100% human contribution to global warming since 1951, he responded by saying “I don’t believe that ... don’t buy it.” And of course the president himself has called global warming a Chinese hoax, and didn’t mention science once in his shameful speech declaring his intent to withdraw America from the Paris international climate agreement.  Across the pond, serial climate misinformer Nigel Lawson recently went on BBC Radio 4 and claimed that global temperatures have declined during the past 10 years. That, of course, is patently absurd considering the record-breaking temperatures we’ve experienced over the past 3+ years. In fact, the short-term warming trend over the past 10 years is higher than the long-term trend. .@BBCr4today airs false statements on climate by Lord Lawson in the name of balance. Scientists fact-checkhttps://t.co/jIvKEuKxj5 pic.twitter.com/oowi8QnlfB Scientists were rightly appalled that the BBC once again made the “ignorant and irresponsible” decision to host a climate science denier. It’s understandable that climate scientists would worry about the possibility that the Trump administration would censor their findings. Not only has the administration denied this politically-inconvenient science, but the Republican Party has a history of censoring climate science research. That’s what the George W Bush administration did just a decade ago. And the Trump administration has been telling government scientists not to use the phrase “climate change” and deleting climate science information from government websites. At the American Geophysical Union conference (the largest annual meeting of climate scientists) last December, climate scientists expressed fears about this type of censorship. Many took to the streets to stand up for science. The scientists pledged to have learned the lessons of the Bush administration censorship, and not to allow the Trump administration to do the same. That’s why the National Climate Assessment report was sent to the New York Times. This time, climate scientists are fighting back against censorship of their science. Unfortunately, scientific censorship is no longer our main concern. It was an effective strategy over a decade ago, when most people remained blissfully unaware of the threats posed by human-caused global warming. But since then, the issue has become politicized. As Trump and Pruitt and Perry have illustrated, denying basic climate science has become the political norm among Republican Party leaders.  Simply put, it’s possible that the Trump administration would have censored or suppressed the National Climate Assessment report, but even an uncensored report doesn’t threaten them. The document mostly reiterates the findings of previous reports, like the last IPCC assessment. Political party leaders would just add it to the stack of documents and evidence whose inconvenient findings they deny. That’s the problem we now face. It’s not one that physical scientists can solve – at least not without the aid of social science research. We’ve had enough evidence telling us about the need to act on climate change for decades. More evidence won’t convince people; we now have to figure out the best ways to communicate it, as climate scientists like Katharine Hayhoe are learning: In the meantime, we’re left wondering how many lightning strikes it will take to shock the climate science denial out of our system. We’ve been struck by three in a row, yet the denial is still going strong."
"When it comes to cars, I had a bit of luck this summer. No, I wasn’t loaned the new Tesla Model 3. My street underwent a pavement improvement scheme. All the parking bays were suspended and minicabs no longer idled their engines during the night. I found myself living in an accidental Low Emissions Zone. It was wonderful.  Yet despite research telling us that even very low levels of air pollution can shorten our lives, there are plans for just six Clean Air Zones across the UK by 2019. Instead, our dreams of breathable air lie with the Electric Vehicle (EV) revolution. It’s coming to save us in, um, 23 years (new petrol and diesel cars will be banned in 2040). Can EVs really save the day? When it comes to decarbonising, yes. Growth in electric vehicles alone could save 2m barrels of oil per day by 2025. Impressive. But there are concerns over limitations of battery technology and the rare earth minerals needed to produce them. Those who tried to save the planet last time around by buying a diesel car and have been left with a particulate-spewing monster are obviously feeling tender. At the extreme end of EV bashing is Dirty Secrets of Electric Cars, a video from a pro-fossil fuel advocacy group connected to the global-warming-denying Koch brothers. The best I can say is that it lacks imagination. And you need imagination when buying into the promise of electric power. This is not just swapping cars, it’s about a whole new decarbonised power structure, one that takes periodic giant leaps forwards, in battery technology, in grid and storage innovation. The pavement on my street is sadly completed – but I had a brief taste of low pollution, and I can tell you it’s exhilarating. Whatever your view of Milton Keynes, you probably hadn’t reckoned on a tree cathedral, a 1,000-year-old moot (meeting place) or a light pyramid patronised by sheep (see above).

"A Himalayan fungus used in Chinese medicine, which underpins the livelihoods of communities of harvesters in Nepal, is under the threat due to climate change. Harvesting the Cordyceps sinensis fungus, called ‘yarsha gumba’ in Nepal, provides a livelihood for Himalayan dwellers. The fungus fetches up to Rs 2,800,000 (£20,000) per kg in raw form. During the peak season of yarsha collection, locals drop everything to pursue fungus hunting, including their usual profession. Even schools remain closed during yarsha collecting seasons.  The fungus grows on the head of the larvae of caterpillars and locals crawl on hands and knees to find it. The work is hazardous in the high altitude regions where the fungus grows, with hunters young and old regularly succumbing to exposure. Himal Aryal, who has been involved in the yarsha trade for eight years in Rukum, a mountain district west of Kathmandu, told Climate Home that 90% of buyers were Chinese. “It is known as Himalayan Viagra as it helps to increase libido in both sexes, for which only a few rich people buy the fungus,” he said.  But local yarsha hunters have been experiencing a huge drop in the availability of the fungus in recent years. Bibek Jhakri, who has also collected the fungus for eight years, said: “I used to find 50-60 yarshas a day during my earlier years, while now finding four to five per day is a matter of luck for me.” He said he was afraid his major source of income won’t last. Most of the yarsha hunters in Thabang, the western district where Jhakri is from, are worried about their seasonal source of income. They could, a decade before, rely almost exclusively on income generated by yarsha collection. Collectors in hilly areas typically lack academic education and production from agricultural land in those areas is marginal. A 2016 study published in the journal Biological Conservation, found a combination of climate change and untimely and over harvesting were to blame for the previous falls. Whereas in future the range of the fungus would be reduced by up to a third because less snow would fall in the pastures and snow would melt earlier in spring. High mountains are experiencing a more rapid change in temperature than lower elevations. “There are strong theories that guide the expectation of climate change being comparatively higher in mountains than at sea level,” Nicholas Pepin, a geographer at the University of Portsmouth, told Climate Home. In Mugu district, hunters Pabitra Rokaya and Dhir Bahadur Bohara, have experienced sharp decrease in yarsha availability in recent years and people around them have given up. “[We] are able to find only a tenth of what we used to in past years. If the decline happens yearly like this, we could no longer depend on yarsha as our primary source of income,” said one."
"In 50 years, the region near where I grew up, Cameron Parish in south-west Louisiana, will likely be no more. Or rather, it will exist, but it may be underwater, according to the newly published calculations of the Louisiana government. Coastal land loss is on the upswing, and with each hurricane that sweeps over the region, the timeline is picking up speed. As a result, Cameron, the principal town in this 6,800-person parish (as counties are called in Louisiana), could be the first town in the US to be fully submerged by rising sea levels and flooding. So it’s here one would expect to feel the greatest sense of alarm over climate change and its consequences.   Instead, Cameron has earned a different kind of fame: it’s the county that, percentage-wise, voted more in favor of Trump than all but two other counties in the US in last year’s election. (Nearly 90% of registered voters did.) Why would some of the people most vulnerable to climate change vote for a politician skeptical of climate change’s existence? Why would people in Cameron Parish support policies that could ruin them? To get to the root of this question, I slipped my tennis shoes into knee-high marsh waders, navigated the ropes on a rusty shrimp boat, and ate mountains of fried seafood. I spoke to people living different and yet parallel lives in Cameron Parish, where timelines are defined as pre-storm or post-storm, and where people kindly addressed me as Miss Shannon. In rocking chairs and over lunch specials, I asked them about their seemingly contradictory views. I asked them why they voted for Donald Trump. And I asked them how they felt about being the proud residents of what may be America’s first drowning town. Tressie Smith is a 44-year-old mother of two and a business owner – her seafood restaurant is the most popular lunch spot in town. That popularity is aided by the fact that her would-be competition was all destroyed in hurricanes Rita (2005) and Ike (2008). The population of Cameron dropped a stunning 79% between 2000 and 2010. When the hurricanes hit, Smith was working for a cafe down the road. When it closed after the storms, Smith saw an opening. She bought a barber shop, tacked up naval-themed decorations and named her new business Anchors Up Grill, a wry nod to the local conditions. Her special is the “dynamite shrimp poboy”, a sandwich with jumbo shrimp grilled in a spicy sauce and covered in melted cheese and bacon, for $11. “Oh yeah, I’m concerned,” Smith says when asked about the future. “And the bad thing is they won’t give me any hurricane insurance. They said my building don’t qualify.” Her structure, with its glass and metal garage and creaky wooden trailer steps, stands out among the remaining buildings on the street, which are mostly bunker-like big cement city offices. If another storm hit, Anchors Up looks like it’d be the first to go. “They did insure me the first year we were open, but then, for no reason, they wouldn’t renew it,” she recalls. “But this is all I can do, because I had to mortgage my house and my land to get this. Because of the rules and regulations, it costs so much to live here.” Many locals in Cameron repeat this phrase – “rules and regulations”. They’re referring to the strict construction rules placed on residents who wanted to return to Cameron and rebuild after Rita and Ike hit the town. As a result, all structures needed to be raised in order to qualify for hurricane insurance. The result is a humble town whose homes appear strangely grandiose: single-story modest brick houses now rest on top of large, grassy man-made hills, a kind of south Louisiana castle. For 10 years, Smith was a truck driver, which gave her a particular vantage point from which to observe the coast. “I think the coast is disappearing, I really do. Because I traveled this road so much, driving for the oil fields. By the way it looks, it looks like the water is getting closer and closer.” But Smith stops short of offering an explanation. “I really don’t know what is causing it, I don’t know what you’d call it – erosion? I guess it’s probably caused by climate change, but I don’t really believe in the concept.” She pauses to sip her Coke, and reconsiders. She looks east down the road, where an $11bn- liquefied natural gas plant is slated to be constructed, once federal approval comes through. “But why would they be spending millions of dollars on those liquefied natural gas plants if the coast’s going to disappear? And they probably know a lot more than me.” As for her politics, Smith thinks Cameron’s residents voted for Trump because “we think he could help the oil field out, and hopefully stop the imported seafood from coming into our country so our people can make a living,” she says. Smith, like most of the residents of Cameron, has been highly dependent on state and federal assistance programs to recover after the storms. But what if, in Trump’s push to shrink the size of the government, recovery programs are cut? “We’d be screwed,” she says frankly. “But that doesn’t change my opinion about Trump,” she quickly adds. “Outsiders think that everybody is just looking for a handout down here, but there is hard-working people that live here. There are just not many jobs right now, especially if all you know is commercial fishing. Even if Trump cuts those programs that helped us, we gonna make it one way or another here, with or without help. Down here we survive.” Standing in green wading boots in shin-high water about 40 miles north of the Anchors Up Grill, Brandon Vail wipes the nitrogen pellets off of the inside of his glasses. A fertilizer plane has just passed over his rice field. Vail is a young, highly educated self-employed rice farmer who makes about $35,000 a year from farming. He works on 4,500 acres of land – corn, crawfish, cattle, hay, soy beans and rice – which he leases from 22 different landowners. But the arable land around where Vail farms is disappearing, as development sprawls and coastal loss creeps northward. “With the ground losses we have here, it doesn’t really pay to be really big for us. I do better to be diversified. I been losing ground to residential and commercial development, and also to mitigation land to make room for that. So over the last four years, I’ve lost about 1,000 acres. Some people have lost more.” He’s not optimistic about the future of farming. “This year is my 19th crop. I probably picked a poor career choice because I can see the writing on the wall. If I had kids I wouldn’t want them doing what I’m doing in this area. I don’t think farming will be a viable industry in this area 50 years from now. I may be wrong. I hope I’m wrong.” Vail is a registered Republican, and he gets heated when he thinks about how his fellow Trump voters are perceived from the outside. “Everyone thinks just because you’re from the south you’re a Confederate flag-waving drunk idiot. We’re not all like that. Some of us are educated. We just see things different from you.” He added: “My parents busted their ass and cut corners for me to go to private school. My sister is a complete Democrat. We’re Catholic. But I’m looked at like some kind of racist slaveholder. I’m lumped into that category. But we don’t fit.” Vail says he’s pleased with the drawdown on environmental restrictions that Trump has instituted since taking office. “When he took office he stopped the EPA’s Waters of the US rule, where anything that would flow into a navigable tributary would have had jurisdiction under the EPA. Well, navigable tributaries go through half the land I farm. So you’re saying a ditch I put in my field to drain the water off, then that the land comes under your jurisdiction? You can tell me when I can go into it, and what I can use as fertilizer?”  He shakes his head in disgust. “Residents can go buy RoundUp, can send out their detergents and soaps and all this kind of runoff into downstream water, but then they want to blame the farmers?” Vail adds: “There’s not a farmer on earth that is going to ruin soil or water. We learn best management practices, and most of us will use those practices because it increases the bottom line. You can’t wait around for some bureaucrat to tell you what you can and can’t do.” “I’m gonna let you in on a little secret,” Mr Benny says, as he leans close enough that his worn white baseball cap shades the afternoon sun on my face. “I’m the luckiest man in the world.” Seventysomething Benny Welch lives across from the oceanfront marsh in Cameron Parish, just behind a big oak tree, whose limbs he clung to through the night in 1957 when Hurricane Audrey hit, sweeping his family out of their home and him – fortuitously – into a wishbone-shaped crevice of branches, the only thing left standing when it was all over.  Mr Benny – as everyone refers to him here – spends his days strolling through a garage packed with boxes overflowing with severed alligator parts. He and his family make their money hunting alligators, and then selling the otherwise discardable pieces of the alligator bodies – the styrofoam-like handles of perforated jawbone, the scaly claws with ladylike fingernails, the phallic-shaped teeth stained brown with age. The Welch family have done well for themselves thanks to a number of contracts with gas stations around the south, whose clients impulse purchase the alligator-tooth necklaces as they pay for their Big Gulps. He shows me one of the most popular pieces: an alligator tooth surrounded by rectangular beads stamped with the Confederate flag. But business wasn’t always so good. The double-hit of hurricanes in 2005 and 2008 “turned the marshes upside down”, he recalls. “We didn’t know what what to do, there was no alligator eggs for three years.” Mr Benny’s son lets me know that their alligator hunting business has brought in a high-end clientele. He brings out a photo of a grinning Donald Trump Jr taken during an alligator hunting trip. That personal connection has helped inform Mr Benny’s politics. “I’m Donald Trump all the way,” he says with a smile. Even though Mr Benny’s family has been directly impacted by hurricanes, and even though the state mapping agency indicates that his home will be submerged within 50 years due to coastal land loss, Mr Benny isn’t buying it. “I don’t believe it,” he says, shaking his head. “I don’t believe that the tide is gonna rise 10 feet and that the Ice Age is coming and stuff like that.” Like many of the residents here in Cameron, Mr Benny sees time on a longer horizon than others might. “I been here 75 years, you understand?,” he reminds me with gentle force. “And I’ve lived on the water and guess what? The tides still come up almost the same way, and there is no flooding. And today our front marshes aren’t underwater.” “If you go by what the real scientists say, there’s no proof. In the last 10 years the average temperature of the world hasn’t even risen a half degree. And if you listen to everyone talking it, it’s up five or 10 degrees. And it’s not true! It’s a political thing. How much money has Al Gore made off global warming?,” he laughs, shaking his head with a cackle. “It ain’t happened yet!” Bronwen Theriot is the 36-year-old science teacher at South Cameron High School. She’s also a member of a group colloquially called the “die-hards”: residents who had their homes destroyed by Hurricane Rita in 2005, managed to rebuild, and then had their new homes destroyed again in 2008 by Hurricane Ike. And still, she made it home. “I came back every time. To the same place,” says Theriot, proudly. Theriot’s boyfriend works for the state, and so state policies on coastal subsidence are regular dinner conversation for the couple and their kids. “I’ve looked at those maps a million times,” she says, referring to the maps recently published by the state of Louisiana that show Cameron 50 years from today in the “red zone” – underwater. “I’ve looked at the aerial photos. I see how if we don’t do something to protect our coast we will have no coast to protect,” she says, matter-of-factly. “And it is evident if you take a ride around here.”  To the right of her home are a line of weed-bedraggled cement slabs, where her neighbors once lived; empty plots left by those driven away by the uninhabitability of this coast.  “From a scientific perspective,” she says, putting on her high school science teacher hat, “the map is showing you – look, this is going to happen. Compared to other places where they have stopped the erosion versus here where they haven’t, it’s clear that not enough is getting done. “But I don’t know what is causing the coastal depletion,” she says. “When it comes to depletion and subsidence, I feel like there are so many items it could be attributed to, and perhaps it is not one individual thing, but a lot of things adding up. “Do I think it is climate change? That’s hard,” she says, smiling. Theriot seems caught between her job as a science educator and her life as a longtime Cameron resident, tasked with teaching about the environment in a fiercely red town. “From a scientific perspective ... data is manipulated all the time. So whoever is interpreting the data, as much as you try to not have a bias, you could still have a bias. Of course, I am going to be more proactive about coastal restoration and protections because it is directly affecting me, so for me, looking at the data, I am very very worried.” She relents: “But I think the data is incomplete. And I am still not sure about climate change. I am still researching it. I feel like I don’t have enough good sources to say yes or no on if climate change is a real thing.” Now, from her elevated balcony overlooking the old slabs, she takes a clearer position. “I’m a big proponent of the oil industry, because that’s how my family and my community made a lot of its money. So that is my livelihood. So it is hard for me to point that finger.” The Louisiana shrimping season just opened this week, and as a lifelong shrimper and the owner of a couple boats and a dock, today should be a busy day for Leo Dyson, not a slow one. But the wind’s been blowing too hard to take out the boats, and so here he sits, perched on a pile of barnacle-crusted wood pallets. Dyson cares most about shrimp. “In these countries like China and everything, they work under communism where the government owns everything – the boats, the factories. In China, they raise their shrimp in sewage ponds they load with antibiotics, and that can cause cancer. We are one of the few countries that will even accept shrimp from China, and it doesn’t make sense that the FDA even allows that. But we gotta produce shrimp for the same price as them under free enterprise.” “So I think Trump will help this. I think he will make changes to the FDA and import tariffs and all that. I think he will make a more even playing field where everybody will still be able to make a living. So I voted for him because I thought he was the best man for the job.” Dyson is not particularly concerned about the forecasts that show the coast disappearing over the coming decades. He thinks global warming is a gossipy scam. “Too bad you’re not writing for the National Enquirer,” he teases, “because then you could say ‘fisherman sleeps with alien and causes global warming!’ “The fact is I’m 68. I’ve seen cold weather and I’ve seen hot weather. And you know the earth’s been through some ice ages. And when the ice ages was over, did they think it was global warming? A planet that doesn’t change becomes a barren waste, so that’s why it’s changing.” Instead, Dyson says that what worries him most are the environmental regulations ostensibly intended to save the coast. “The laws are already there to protect the coast. And I understand Trump is not 100% environmentalist. But I think it’s a good thing to get the government out of our lives. I don’t want any more environmental regulations. I don’t want any more fishing laws. And I don’t want a lot of restrictions where people can’t make a living.” Dyson says hurricanes aren’t all bad news in his line of work. “The wetland restoration is doing more to harm the ecosystem than if they left it alone. After [hurricanes] Rita and Ike we caught a lot of shrimp, because the levees were washed away and nature worked the way it was intended to, where man didn’t mess with it. These structures – the levees and all – are making it get worse every year. So for me having a hurricane would be good for business – for a little while. “If I thought global warming was real, I’d be the first to admit it,” he says, looking out across the rough water. “Because I’d be the first to see it. I’m here on the water after all. I could see how in 3,000 years we could be underwater, because I mean who knows, but in 50? I don’t think so. I was told that 50 years ago. Things don’t change much here.”"
" The government’s new clean air plan has been branded inadequate by the leaders of eight heavily polluted cities, as campaigners said banning petrol and diesel cars from 2040 would not help the thousands dying each year from illnesses linked to toxic fumes. The long-awaited report was published by Michael Gove, the environment secretary, on Wednesday, after a court ruled last year that the government must improve its proposals for tackling illegal levels of pollution.  It confirmed conventional petrol and diesel cars would be banned in 23 years but the government refused to legislate for more “clean air zones” that would charge the dirtiest vehicles to enter some of the UK’s most polluted cities. The plan also stopped short of bringing in a scrappage scheme to encourage people to give up diesel cars, considering only a “targeted” version to incentivise some some groups of people on low incomes or in particularly polluted areas. In a letter to Gove, the leaders of Liverpool, Leeds, Birmingham, Southampton, Leicester and Oxford city councils called for urgent legislation and a proper diesel scrappage scheme, saying the long-awaited air quality plan would not enable them to keep to their legal limits on pollution. The city leaders said the “updated clean air plan, while indicating long-term ambition, still lacks some specific actions that would enable us to meet the legal limits and establish safer air sooner rather than later”. The criticism means the government could face further legal action to force it to produce a more comprehensive plan, with environmentalists, doctors and opposition politicians arguing it is insufficient to deal with a “health emergency” estimated to be killing 40,000 people a year. Some energy experts also warned that a wholesale switch fromconventional to electric cars could put the National Grid under huge pressure and require many new power stations. ClientEarth, the environmental lawyers that previously took the government to court, said it appeared to be “little more than a shabby rewrite of the previous draft plans and is underwhelming and lacking in urgency”. “The court ordered action by the UK to obey its own laws as soon as possible. This plan kicks the can down the road yet again,” said James Thornton, chief executive of the firm. “The 2040 diesel and petrol ban, while important is a diversionary tactic and doesn’t deal with the public health emergency caused by illegally polluted air, now.” Ministers had been urged to introduce charges for vehicles to enter a series of clean air zones (CAZs) in new cities, adding to existing plans for such measures in Birmingham, Derby, Leeds, Nottingham, Southampton, and London. But the government said it only wants new charging zones to be considered as a last resort, despite its own research showing that such clean air zones are the “quickest, most cost-effective way” to tackle the problem. It named 80 A-roads and motorways with particularly poor air quality but said councils should exhaust other options before opting to impose charging, and restrictions should be time-limited and lifted as soon as pollution is within legal limits. Instead, most councils will be given money from a £250m pot to tackle pollution hotspots with “surgical interventions” such as improving public transport and changing road layouts. Labour said the government was “shunting the problem on to local authorities”, which have 18 months to submit their plans for action. In their letter to Gove, six councils warned that some of these suggestions for surgical interventions risk “displacing the problem elsewhere in our cities rather than solving it .... and they could also increase traffic and congestion”. “Only national backing of local action, in law and in resources, will enable us to tackle this crisis effectively,” they said. Another council, Sheffield, called the report “woefully inadequate”, with Jack Scott, cabinet member for transport, saying he was “highly sceptical that the government’s announcement today even meets their legal duties on air quality”. Sadiq Khan, the Labour mayor of London, also joined in the criticism saying the ban on petrol and diesel cars from 2040 was a “half-hearted commitment” that Londoners cannot afford to wait for. This was echoed by Ed Miliband, the former Labour leader and energy secretary, who said he feared the new ban in 23 years’ time was a “smokescreen for weak measures to tackle 40,000 deaths a year from air pollution now”. Gove had also been pressed to bring in a scrappage scheme for diesel cars, but the final document only said the government would consider a limited programme to incentivise drivers to switch the most polluting cars for cleaner vehicles. This would be directed at those who most need support, such as those on lower incomes or those living in the immediate vicinity of a clean air zone. It sounded a negative tone about the idea, saying previous schemes have been “poor value for the taxpayer and open to a degree of fraud”. The report’s flagship measure was a pledge to ban new sales of conventional diesel and petrol cars by 2040, but this did not go as far as expected because hybrid car sales would still be allowed. Previously, the government had said 2050 emissions targets required “almost all new cars and vans sold to be near-zero emission at the tailpipe by 2040”. Senior doctors specialising in child health expressed dismay at the failure to take more decisive action. Prof Neena Modi, president of the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health, said there was “indisputable evidence demonstrating the tragic effects it has on the development of the lungs and hearts of children”.  “Having been told [by the courts] to go back to the drawing board so many times, that the government’s final air quality plan still lacks sufficiently strong measures to clean our air is frankly inexcusable,” she said. Prof Jonathan Grigg, from Barts and the London school of medicine and dentistry, also said more urgent action was needed “The 2040 target means that several generations of children will suffer the long term consequences of inhaling sooty particles and oxides of nitrogen,” he said. “The government needs to act now, with a faster and more robust response to this public health emergency.” Industry figures criticised the lack of detail and Mike Cherry, chair of the Federation of Small Businesses, said it “still leaves many small businesses in the dark, particularly regarding any potential diesel scrappage scheme”. Others were concerned about jobs when conventional cars are phased out. Tony Burke, assistant general secretary of Unite, said nothing should be done to jeopardise the “hard won” success of the car industry, adding: “The announcement has wide-ranging implications for the UK economy and future employment prospects of hundreds of thousands of skilled workers. We are calling for a national debate embracing employers, unions and ministers.” Mike Hawes, the boss of car industry body the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders, said it was crucial that the government supported the development of electric car technologies and attracted the major battery manufacturers to the UK to prevent the industry, which supports 814,000 jobs, from being damaged.  Environmental groups also reacted with disappointment. Friends of the Earth, the green charity, said it was a cynical move for the government to grab headlines with the eyecatching promise to ban new diesel cars in future, when there is little in the plan to deal with immediate problems. The plan was described as gimmicky by Areeba Hamid, a clean air campaigner at Greenpeace UK. “While this plan makes the right headline-grabbing noises, in reality it means that children across the UK will continue to be exposed to harmful air pollution for years to come, with potentially irreversible impacts,” she said. “The government cannot shy away any longer from the issue of diesel cars clogging up and polluting our cities, and must now provide real solutions, not just gimmicks.” Opposition parties criticised the plan for failing to go far enough and highlighted the weakness of proposals to deal with air quality in the short and medium term. Sue Hayman, the shadow environment secretary, said there had already been “seven years of illegal air pollution under this Conservative government, who have only acted after being dragged through the courts”. “Despite the scale of the problem of illegal air pollution, we are presented today with further consultations and delays, a squeamish attitude to clean air zones, shunting the problem on to local authorities and no detail about how the government’s 2040 target will be achieved,” she said. “With nearly 40 million people living in areas with illegal levels of air pollution, action is needed now, not in 23 years’ time.” The plan was defended by Gove, who said it “sets out how we will work with local authorities to tackle the effects of roadside pollution caused by dirty diesels, in particular nitrogen dioxide”.  “This is one element of the government’s £3bn programme to clean up the air and reduce vehicle emissions,” he said."
"If progressives can’t take back control of the White House and Congress from climate change deniers in the next three years, it’s conceivable that humankind could be screwed. But evidence is mounting that a new political force is up to the task. It has millions of potential supporters across the US, the UK and Canada. It’s openly critical of capitalism. And it’s led by millennials such as Moumita Ahmed. The 25-year-old activist is intimately aware of what’s at stake. She grew up in Queens, New York, and rose to prominence during the 2016 Democratic primaries as co-founder of a group now known as Millennials for Revolution.  She has since rallied thousands of people her age against Donald Trump’s travel ban and the Republican healthcare bill. Yet climate change is never far from Ahmed’s mind. Rising oceans directly threaten her family members back in Bangladesh. “It makes me so angry and upset,” Ahmed said. “But at the end of the day, I still believe there is hope.” The enduring legacy of Bernie Sanders’ campaign was to show that millennials support leaders who fight the status quo The window for hope is closing rapidly. Over 60 climate experts warned this June that we only have until 2020 to stop the worst damages of global warming. “While the world can’t be healed within the next few years, it may be fatally wounded by negligence,” argued Hans Joachim Schellnhuber, a leading climate researcher. Trump is inflicting wound after wound. His exit from the Paris climate treaty is a blow to the global fight against climate change. Yet it’s only one of many concessions Trump’s made to the fossil fuel industry, which spent $36 million on lobbying from January to March alone, according to the Center for Public Integrity.  “I have been moving at record pace…to eliminate the barriers to domestic energy production,” Trump said recently. Oil and gas companies are delighted. “Not in our wildest dreams, never did we expect to get everything,” boasted an industry leader. And Republicans in the House, the majority of whom deny the existence of climate change, are now rushing through legislation that “could provide bulletproof armor during future challenges to Trump’s agenda,” reported InsideClimateNews. Voters have just two chances to reverse course before the three-year window closes: the 2018 midterms and the 2020 presidential election. But turning the US into a climate hero isn’t as simple as rejecting the Republican party.  Democratic elites must be convinced that bold climate action is possible. And the party needs “to gain enough power to pass their shit,” said Vox columnist David Roberts, an expert on climate politics. In today’s political environment, “that second step just seems impossible.” Yet millennials such as Ahmed have no choice but to fight. And a series of recent elections prove her generation is becoming strong enough to win. The first evidence came in 2015, when an 18% surge of millennial voters helped oust Canada’s Conservative Prime Minister Stephen Harper, a close ally of oil and gas.  Harvard International Review said it’s “exciting … in a global context.” Current Liberal Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, while still a booster of oil, is bringing in a national price on carbon, which is “big, positive news” to green groups like the Pembina Institute.  Next came the 2016 Democratic primaries. Voters under the age of 30 cast two million votes for “socialist” Bernie Sanders while Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump combined got 1.6 million. Sanders leveraged this support to get far-left policies in the Democratic platform, including a climate test for oil pipelines and tougher limits on fracking. Anti-fracking activist Josh Fox declared it a “monumental victory.” Yet Ahmed believes the most enduring legacy of Sanders’ campaign was to show that millions of millennials support political leaders who fight the economic status quo. “For us to deal with [climate change] we have to address capitalism,” Ahmed argued.  Despite Harvard polling suggesting that 51% of young people oppose our current system, the message fell on deaf ears in the Democratic Party. “We’re capitalists, and that’s just the way it is,” huffed Rep. Nancy Pelosi this February.  Across the Atlantic, Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn was listening. He borrowed campaign ideas from Sanders in the UK’s 2017 election, vowing to fix an economy “rigged for the rich” and take bold action on issues like global warming. The result was a flood of 18 to 24-year-old voters – with turnout as high as 72 percent – and huge election gains for Labour. “Britain’s younger generation flexed their political muscles to real effect for the first time,” the Guardian reported. To Ahmed it proves a powerful global movement of young people is emerging: “We are the future.” Others aren’t so sure. Despite all the enthusiasm for Sanders in 2016, actual voter turnout among Millennials in the US election was a dismal 50%. “Youthful enthusiasm for the outsider is an extremely fickle political horse,” Roberts argued.  To win the Senate in the 2018 midterms, Democrats need to defend 25 seats and pick up an additional three. “The Senate map is horrifically bad for the party,” Vox noted, while gerrymandering tilts the House “in favor of Republicans.” Democrats have also lost four special elections for Congress since Trump came to power.  But far-left politicians are winning local elections across the country. They include Chokwe Lumumba, the new 34-year-old mayor of Jackson, Mississippi, who vowed to build “the most radical city on the planet”; and a Black Lives Matter advocate as Philadelphia’s next District Attorney.  An 18% surge of millennial voters helped oust Canada’s oil-friendly Conservative Prime Minister Stephen Harper This trend “has major implications” for US progressive politics, according to the outlet McClatchy DC. Meanwhile, thousands of young people are joining activist groups such as Our Revolution, Indivisible and Democratic Socialists of America. “We’re still seeing a ton of action and organizing coming out of millennials,” Ahmed explained. “It’s going to have a ripple effect.” If momentum persists, it’s plausible that millennials who expelled an oil and gas leader in Canada, turned a socialist into a serious challenger for US President and invigorated the UK’s far-left could block Trump’s climate agenda as early as 2018. With time quickly ticking down, it would mean a less screwed future for us all. Geoff Dembicki is the author of Are We Screwed? How a New Generation is Fighting to Survive Climate Change"

"Squid and anchovies, more commonly eaten by Britons holidaying abroad, are being drawn into UK waters in large numbers by climate change, according to major new report that suggests the nation’s long-lost bluefin tuna is also returning. However, global warming is harming sea birds, such as puffins, fulmars, terns and razorbills, as the fish they rely on are driven north or deeper as waters warm. The analysis of the impact of climate on the UK’s seas, which draws on the work of 400 scientists, found a steady rise in water temperature. It also found a clear rising trend in sea level, leading to much more frequent extreme high water events. Improved defences and forecasting have prevented an increase in coastal floods, but the report warns that sea level rise around the UK is likely to accelerate. Squid were seen in the North Sea only occasionally in the past but have increased “dramatically”, according to the report, with thousands of tonnes now caught each year and mostly exported. “The difference now is it is an established summer trawl fishery – that is a clear change,” said Matthew Frost, chair of the working group that produced the report for the UK Marine Climate Change Impacts Partnership (MCCIP). He said fishing boats had been quick to spot the new stocks: “If something comes, they realise that very quickly.” Anchovies have followed the same path northwards. “You now have an anchovy fishery, which is clearly linked to climate change – that is what the science is showing,” said Frost. The anchovies come from the Bay of Biscay, where there is a large Spanish and French fishery and the shift could have political ramifications, he said, especially after Brexit when the UK takes back control of its territorial waters. “The shift leads to political implications around who is allowed to catch what and what the quotas are, so it is an important development.” Bluefin tuna were common around the UK before the second world war, with the giant fish a popular target for “big game” fishermen. The decimation in later decades of the mackerel and herring that tuna eat then saw the giant fish disappear.  But shifting mackerel and herring populations and warming waters have seen the tuna return. “Sightings are definitely becoming more frequent,” said Frost, with large shoals seen off south-west England in 2015 and 2016. The report is an update on the MCCIP’s first analysis in 2006. At that time, it found that sea bass was becoming more common as temperatures rose. But it has not become established as an important catch, due to overfishing, said Frost: “It is a very popular fish to eat.” However, as fish suited to warmer water move north into UK waters, cold water fish seeking cooler temperatures are moving out, including cod. A dramatic reduction in fishing has seen North Sea cod recover to sustainable levels from near collapse in 2006, but their recovery would probably have been even greater without the warming of the sea. The UK’s waters are heating by about 0.5C per decade. “That may not sound like a lot to us but it is really significant in terms of the biology and ecology,” said Frost. Part of the reason is that rising temperatures give a higher baseline, making hot spells even more extreme. Many British sea birds are struggling to cope with climate change with populations of Atlantic puffins, fulmars, black-legged kittiwakes and common, Arctic and little terns all finding the fish they eat harder to come by. Severe summer storms are also having an impact, particularly on razorbills, whose nests can be damaged and whose chicks die more often. The report also predicts that over the coming century some species, such as the great skua, Arctic skua and Leach’s storm petrel could become extremely rare or even extinct in the UK. Sir David Attenborough praised the scope of the new report: “Concern about the state of our seas has caused them to be studied more intensively – and extensively – than ever before. They have never been more important.” Other physical changes considered by the report include the frequency of extreme water levels. It found the tide was above 5.75 metre at a reference site at Newlyn in Cornwall for almost 60 hours in 2015. In contrast, that level was never reached for more than 30 hours a year between 1915 and 1985. The strength of the Gulf Stream, the flow of warm water up the Atlantic which is a key factor in the UK’s mild climate, is weakening, the report found. But a collapse of the current, which would plunge the UK into a much colder climate regime, is unlikely this century.  The scientists also reported increasing acidification of the ocean, as carbon dioxide rises in the atmosphere and is absorbed by the seawater. This may harm the ability of animals to form their shells but the higher CO2 could benefit some algae and seagrasses. Overall, the impact of climate change on the UK’s seas is a mix, Frost said: “Some things will be of benefit – a good example is new fisheries, and it could even increase biodiversity in some cases. But of course the knockback to that is the increased frequency of very intense storms and potential for flooding.” “But what stands out from the report is we weren’t wrong” in our projections in 2006, he said. “What scientists were saying then is coming to pass.”"
"Cars must be driven out of cities to tackle the UK’s air pollution crisis, not just replaced with electric vehicles, according to the UK government’s top adviser. Prof Frank Kelly said that while electric vehicles emit no exhaust fumes, they still produce large amounts of tiny pollution particles from brake and tyre dust, for which the government already accepts there is no safe limit.  Toxic air causes 40,000 early deaths a year in the UK, and the environment secretary, Michael Gove, recently announced that the sale of new diesel and petrol cars will be banned from 2040, with only electric vehicles available after that. But faced with rising anger from some motorists, the plan made the use of charges to deter dirty diesel cars from polluted areas a measure of last resort only. Kelly’s intervention heightens the government’s dilemma between protecting public health and avoiding politically difficult charges or bans on urban motorists. “The government’s plan does not go nearly far enough,” said Kelly, professor of environmental health at King’s College London and chair of the Committee on the Medical Effects of Air Pollutants, official expert advisers to the government. “Our cities need fewer cars, not just cleaner cars.” Ministers were forced to produce an air pollution plan after being sued twice in the courts over illegal levels, but it was criticised as “woefully inadequate” and “lacking urgency” by city leaders and “inexcusable” by leading doctors. The government’s own research showed the fastest and most cost-effective measure to cut the nitrogen dioxide (NO2) pollution largely caused by diesel engines is to charge dirty cars to enter urban areas. Electric vehicles emit no NO2 but do produce small particle pollution from the wear on brake discs and tyres and by throwing up dust from roads. A recent European commission research paper found that about half of all particulate matter comes from these sources. “While governments don’t currently pay much attention to particulate matter, it is in fact highly polluting, with strong links to cardiopulmonary toxicity,” said Kelly in an article in the Guardian.  The Royal College of Physicians estimates that 29,000 people die early each year from particle pollution, more than the 23,500 premature deaths attributed to NO2. The combined total is 40,000 because some people are harmed by both pollutants. NO2 levels are illegally high in most urban areas, allowing legal action to be taken, but small particle levels are not.  The legal limit in England and Wales for particulate matter is two and a half times the World Health Organisation’s (WHO) guideline set in 2005 and which has already been adopted in Scotland. London’s air is above the WHO limit but below that in England and Wales, said Kelly: “So it’s legal but unhealthy.” In any case, both the UK government and the WHO agree there is no safe level of small particle pollution. Kelly said enabling people and goods to move easily and cheaply around cities such as London is crucial, especially as their populations are growing fast, and backed better public transport as the solution: “The safe and efficient movement of people around the capital can only be achieved through a clean and expanded mass transit system – served by buses, overground train and the underground system – and by as much active transport in the form of walking and cycling as is feasibly possible.” “Encouragingly, attitudes toward car ownership do appear to be changing, with younger Londoners increasingly replacing little-used vehicles with car club membership and ride-sharing apps,” he said. Oliver Hayes, Friends of the Earth air pollution campaigner, said: “Electric cars are critical in the fight against climate change and deadly air pollution, but they’re not a panacea. We must now build the infrastructure that reassures ordinary people that cycling and walking is safe, and invest in public transport that is consistently clean, cheap and reliable.” A government spokeswoman said: “Reducing roadside pollution is a priority for this government – which is why we have committed £3bn to help towns and cities take action against harmful [NO2] emissions caused by dirty diesels. Next year the government will publish a comprehensive Clean Air Strategy which will address other sources of air pollution.” Kelly said the traffic pollution problems facing the UK affect cities around the world, which are also increasing rapidly in size. “By 2050, nearly two-thirds of the world’s population will live in urban areas. How we manage and plan for growing urbanisation will be key to so many global aspirations from improving air quality and human health, maintaining economic success and combatting climate change.”"
"“Excuse me, but gigawatt is pronounced ‘gigg-uh-watts’,” Bill Nye said in 1985. “You say it with a hard ‘g’.” He was a 32-year-old engineer living in Seattle who called into the live sketch comedy TV show Almost Live! to correct the show’s host, Ross Shafer, who mispronounced the word “gigawatt” while talking about science on-air.  Shafer quipped back: “Who do you think you are – Bill Nye the science guy?” The name stuck. Nye was asked to call in every day at 4.35pm to give science-based answers to the show’s call-in questions. He started working as a comedy writer for the show, which led him to hosting Bill Nye the Science Guy, the quintessential children’s science show which ran on PBS from 1993 to 1998. While Nye started his career trying to explain basic science to people, he has come full circle – on the biggest scale of his life. On top of his new Netflix show, which was just renewed for a second season, and a documentary about him which premieres this fall on PBS, Nye just released his latest book, Everything All at Once: How to Unleash Your Inner Nerd, Tap into Radical Curiosity and Solve Any Problem. “The book is a way of thinking, which I feel is both scientific and creative,” said Nye on the phone from his home in Los Angeles. “We have hardly done anything to address climate change or improve the lives of people in the developing world; we have to get to work.” The book traces Nye’s upbringing in the 1950s to the moment he fell in love with science in the 11th grade. It’s filled with anecdotes of his time studying mechanical engineering at Cornell University in the 1970s – with famed science professor Carl Sagan – and working at the Boeing aircraft company. Nye was always the funny guy at work, so he moonlit as a standup comedian in Seattle’s local comedy clubs and scored his first televised set on Seattle Public Access Channel 29 in 1977, where he walked onstage and said: “Hi, my name is Bill, I work in an office and I have a car. Do you want to go home with me?” The timing was off and he blew the joke. When Nye looks back, he cringes. “What was I thinking?” he said. “It was awful!” But the stage time paid off in 1991 when he started doing science experiments on the wrap-up segments of Back to the Future: The Animated Series. Two years later, he began hosting Bill Nye the Science Guy, an Emmy Award-winning TV show. “What’s amazing to me is how many people grew up watching the show and were affected by it in a good way,” he said. “It’s like wow, really? I’m really proud of that.” This April, Nye launched a Netflix show called Bill Nye Saves the World, which is often seen as an extension of his children’s show. “I don’t think of it as educational so much as thought provoking – it’s science with an opinion,” said Nye. “We hope to give our viewers a scientific perspective on global issues.” The show has Nye breaking down the science of global warming with a star-studded cast that includes supermodel Karlie Kloss and rapper Desiigner. “Are there alternative medicines that don’t work? Are video games inherently bad or good?” asks Nye. “These are all ideas which lead to questions that can be answered with a scientific point of view. Scientific thinking is what we argue for and defend.” In one recurring segment, scientists, pundits and academics with opposing views chat about timely science topics, whether its genetically modified organisms or vaccines. “From a scientific perspective, you have to get vaccinated, that’s it,” said Nye. “You can’t choose to believe in gravity; if you walk off a cliff, you will be affected aversely. Climate change is not a 50-50 thing which you can choose to believe in or not. If you choose to ignore human’s influence on the world’s climate, we will be affected adversely.” The show is only 30 minutes and has been criticized for glazing over scientific details. However, Nye’s new book is an in-depth look at some of the topics touched upon in the show, such as climate change deniers and “climate change whiners”. Nye defines the whiners as senior citizens in their sixties and seventies who claim they can’t see the effect of climate change in their day-to-day lives. One problem could be its overwhelming scale. “Climate change is happening in slow motion, it’s not an instant catastrophe, it’s subtle,” said Nye. “But when you go to the Greenland and see the ice, there’s no more arguing about it.” As someone who has protested outside the White House after Trump pulled out of the Paris climate agreement and has stomped alongside 1 million activists for the March for Science, Nye thinks there is still a long way to go for science advocacy in the US – especially with Trump’s proposed 2018 budget slash to scientific research programs. “It’s in no one’s best interest to ignore science or cut funding for basic research,” said Nye. “It’s going to be a significant issue for voters in upcoming elections around the world.” Considering Trump’s climate policies, it comes as a surprise that the president’s name is not mentioned once in Nye’s book. Not once. “As Abraham Lincoln said, ‘This too shall pass,’” said Nye. “He’s not going to be president forever and there’s substantial evidence he won’t be president by the end of the summer.” Nye draws a parallel to when Richard Nixon resigned as president – history could repeat itself. “Trump has done a lot of extraordinary things,” he said. “Maybe he will change his mind on a lot of issues and become less unpopular than he is right now.” Speaking of his own popularity, Nye is not concerned about his own haters – such as Sarah Palin, who calls him a “kid’s show actor” – and those who say he isn’t enough of a “certified scientist”. “I’d like to just remind people what it takes to get a degree in mechanical engineering at American universities, all you do for four years is physics,” he said. “I took a class called ‘Heat Transfer’, another was called ‘Thermodynamics’. I still have my textbook, Mathematics for Engineers.” But Nye thinks this is all beside the point of the big idea that drives Everything All at Once. “They’re just trying to shoot the messenger,” he said. “Climate change is bigger than I am; it’s bigger that you are. I’m sorry, people, you can shoot the messenger but the climate is still changing.”"
"From 2040, Britain plans to ban all new petrol and diesel cars and vans as part of the government’s much-anticipated clean air plan. Amid fears that rising levels of nitrogen oxide pose a major risk to public health, the government said the move is needed because of the unnecessary and avoidable impact that poor air quality was having on people’s health.  With the future looking electric, we’d like to hear from electric vehicle drivers all over the world. Perhaps they have been the norm in your country for years and you think the UK government’s plans are too little too late. What is it like to drive an electric vehicle? Why do you drive one? How does it differ from driving one that is diesel or petrol? What are the benefits?  You can share your experiences, anonymously if you prefer, in the form below.

"Scientists have uncovered the largest volcanic region on Earth – two kilometres below the surface of the vast ice sheet that covers west Antarctica. The project, by Edinburgh University researchers, has revealed almost 100 volcanoes – with the highest as tall as the Eiger, which stands at almost 4,000 metres in Switzerland. Geologists say this huge region is likely to dwarf that of east Africa’s volcanic ridge, currently rated the densest concentration of volcanoes in the world. And the activity of this range could have worrying consequences, they have warned. “If one of these volcanoes were to erupt it could further destabilise west Antarctica’s ice sheets,” said glacier expert Robert Bingham, one of the paper’s authors. “Anything that causes the melting of ice – which an eruption certainly would – is likely to speed up the flow of ice into the sea. “The big question is: how active are these volcanoes? That is something we need to determine as quickly as possible.” The Edinburgh volcano survey, reported in the Geological Society’s special publications series, involved studying the underside of the west Antarctica ice sheet for hidden peaks of basalt rock similar to those produced by the region’s other volcanoes. Their tips actually lie above the ice and have been spotted by polar explorers over the past century. But how many lie below the ice? This question was originally asked by the team’s youngest member, Max Van Wyk de Vries, an undergraduate at the university’s school of geosciences and a self-confessed volcano fanatic. He set up the project with the help of Bingham. Their study involved analysing measurements made by previous surveys, which involved the use of ice-penetrating radar, carried either by planes or land vehicles, to survey strips of the west Antarctic ice. The results were then compared with satellite and database records and geological information from other aerial surveys. “Essentially, we were looking for evidence of volcanic cones sticking up into the ice,” Bingham said. After the team had collated the results, it reported a staggering 91 previously unknown volcanoes, adding to the 47 others that had been discovered over the previous century of exploring the region. These newly discovered volcanoes range in height from 100 to 3,850 metres. All are covered in ice, which sometimes lies in layers that are more than 4km thick in the region. These active peaks are concentrated in a region known as the west Antarctic rift system, which stretches 3,500km from Antarctica’s Ross ice shelf to the Antarctic peninsula. “We were amazed,” Bingham said. “We had not expected to find anything like that number. We have almost trebled the number of volcanoes known to exist in west Antarctica. We also suspect there are even more on the bed of the sea that lies under the Ross ice shelf, so that I think it is very likely this region will turn out to be the densest region of volcanoes in the world, greater even than east Africa, where mounts Nyiragongo, Kilimanjaro, Longonot and all the other active volcanoes are concentrated.” The discovery is particularly important because the activity of these volcanoes could have crucial implications for the rest of the planet. If one erupts, it could further destabilise some of the region’s ice sheets, which have already been affected by global warming. Meltwater outflows into the Antarctic ocean could trigger sea level rises. “We just don’t know about how active these volcanoes have been in the past,” Bingham said. However, he pointed to one alarming trend: “The most volcanism that is going in the world at present is in regions that have only recently lost their glacier covering – after the end of the last ice age. These places include Iceland and Alaska. “Theory suggests that this is occurring because, without ice sheets on top of them, there is a release of pressure on the regions’ volcanoes and they become more active.” And this could happen in west Antarctica, where significant warming in the region caused by climate change has begun to affect its ice sheets. If they are reduced significantly, this could release pressure on the volcanoes that lie below and lead to eruptions that could further destabilise the ice sheets and enhance sea level rises that are already affecting our oceans. “It is something we will have to watch closely,” Bingham said."
"Today is the United Nations’ (UN) International Day of the World’s Indigenous Peoples, numbering an estimated 370 million in 90 countries and speaking roughly 7,000 languages. To mark it, the Guardian interviews Kankanaey Igorot woman Victoria Tauli-Corpuz about the UN’s Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples, which she calls “historic” and was adopted 10 years ago. Tauli-Corpuz, from the Philippines, was Chair of the UN Permanent Forum of Indigenous Issues when the Declaration was adopted, and is currently the UN Special Rapporteur on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples. In this interview, conducted via email, she explains why the Declaration is so important, argues that governments are failing to implement it, and claims that the struggle for indigenous rights “surpasses” other great social movements of the past:   DH: Why is the UN Declaration so important?  VTC: [It’s] so important because it enshrines and affirms the inherent or pre-existing collective human rights of Indigenous Peoples, as well as the individual human rights of indigenous persons. It is a framework for justice and reconciliation between Indigenous Peoples and states, and applies international human rights standards to the specific historical, cultural, social and economic circumstances of Indigenous Peoples. The Declaration is a standard-setting resolution of profound significance as it reflects a wide consensus at the global level on the minimum content of the rights of indigenous peoples. It is a remedial tool which addresses the need to overcome and repair the historical denial of the fundamental human rights of indigenous peoples, and affirms their equality to all other members of society.  DH: How significant an achievement was it?  VTC: In the 1970s Indigenous Peoples had brought to the UN’s attention the problems and issues they were facing, which led the UN to establish the Working Group on Indigenous Populations in 1982. This was mandated to listen to the developments in indigenous territories and to draft a declaration on their rights. The drafting started in 1985 and Indigenous Peoples took an active part. When the Working Group finished its draft in 1995, it was brought to the Commission on Human Rights where the intergovernmental negotiations took place. On the first day, the Chair of the Intergovernmental Working Group told Indigenous Peoples that we weren’t allowed to speak at the negotiations - only to observe. We walked out, of course, because we could not accept and respect a declaration on our rights made without our participation. This led to a change in the UN rules and we were allowed to take part. It was during my term as Chair of the UN Permanent Forum that the Declaration was adopted. There was a real concern that [that would never happen], or that it would be watered down, but finally in September 2007 we were able to achieve this important victory. DH: How has the Declaration helped indigenous peoples to date? VTC: Its adoption has boosted the confidence and commitment of many Indigenous Peoples to sustain and strengthen their movements to assert and claim their rights, especially to their lands, territories, resources and self-determination, which includes the right to have their free, prior and informed consent obtained when projects are brought to their lands. I would daresay that Indigenous Peoples’ movements in many countries, regions and even the global movement gained more strength after the Declaration’s adoption. It has made Indigenous Peoples’ rights issues more visible and discussed during global processes, such as the High Level Political Forum on Sustainable Development Goals. Unfortunately, even if the UN’s member states adopted the Declaration, most have not been able to implement it effectively. There has been limited progress. Many Indigenous Peoples are still being dispossessed of their lands by states and corporations, and are being criminalised and assassinated when they fight to protect their lands from being grabbed and polluted by mining and oil companies. The Declaration remains the main tool to fight these battles. In some cases, these battles are being won. DH: When you talk about “implementation”, do you mean it being respected as a Declaration or made legally binding? Are there any countries where attempts to do the latter have made serious progress? VTC: Implementation means that states will amend their constitutions and adopt a national law to protect and respect the rights of Indigenous Peoples which are consistent with the standards established in the Declaration. Effective implementation requires states to develop an ambitious program of reforms to remedy past and current injustices. It involves all branches of the state, executive, judiciary, and legislative, and implies a combination of political will, legal reform, technical capacity, and financial commitments. Several countries have taken the significant step of passing such laws or enshrining recognition of Indigenous Peoples’ rights in their constitutions, such as Bolivia, Brazil and Ecuador, among others. Brazil was an early leader in this regard and has titled over 100 million hectares of indigenous land, but we are now seeing this progress threatened by the current administration. Latin America has historically been the strongest with regard to recognising indigenous land rights - yet many countries now face potential roll-back. The Declaration doesn’t have to be made legally binding for it to be implemented effectively.  DH: Do you think the Declaration could be improved? Or is there anything in it you would be critical of? VTC: No, I don’t think the Declaration has to be improved. It is not a perfect document, but it is the result of more than two decades of drafting and negotiating until Indigenous Peoples and states agreed that it was acceptable. Every article represents a response to some of the human rights violations and injustices suffered by Indigenous Peoples. . . We fought to be called “Indigenous Peoples”, a title that recognises us as distinct with our own identities and cultures. We fought for the inclusion of free, prior and informed consent. The biggest problem [with the Declaration] is a lack of implementation. Indigenous Peoples are still forced from their lands for development and conservation projects, and still face violence and criminalisation when they stand up for their rights. DH: What did you think of the Pope’s comment earlier in the year saying indigenous peoples have the right to ‘prior and informed consent’? Were you surprised? VTC: I was very glad to hear the Pope’s comments on the right to free, prior and informed consent and his recognition that our lands are vital to our identities, values and spirituality. His words inspire hope for Indigenous Peoples facing an uphill struggle. The Pope also recognised the importance of indigenous rights in the global struggle against climate change: when Indigenous Peoples’ rights to their lands are protected, they are the best guardians of the world’s forests and biodiversity. Studies show that where Indigenous Peoples have secure rights to their lands, carbon storage is higher and deforestation is lower. DH: In your time as Rapporteur you’ve visited many countries and spoken to many indigenous peoples around the world. What has been the most distressing trip you’ve made so far?  VTC: Around the world, Indigenous Peoples face escalating attacks as well as arrests for refusing to give up the lands they have called home since time immemorial. Seeing evidence of this violence on my visits has been particularly distressing. When I visited indigenous communities in Brazil last year, they showed me the scars on their bodies from rubber bullets and the graves of their murdered leaders. I later found out that some of the communities I visited were attacked only hours after I left. I have seen evidence of this violence in many countries. In the last year alone I communicated my concerns to governments about these attacks in Brazil, Colombia, Ecuador, Guatemala, Honduras, India, Indonesia, Kenya, Paraguay, Peru, the Philippines, Tanzania and the United States. DH: And what has been your most inspiring trip?  VTC: What inspires me the most is the firm determination of indigenous peoples to fight for their rights. Also, their capacity to survive and their high levels of resilience in the face of great difficulties.  DH: You’ve mentioned some of the threats and challenges that indigenous peoples have to deal with. Very briefly, what do you think are the biggest threats?  VTC: I think the biggest threats are extractive industries, conservation projects and climate change. Many Indigenous Peoples live on resource-rich territory - in large part because they have protected and preserved that land for generations - making them prime targets for both extractive industries and protected areas. Despite the fact that the UN Declaration has been accepted as an international norm, international law still heavily privileges investors and companies. Also, as I found in my report to the [UN] General Assembly last year, protected areas are still being established on indigenous lands without their consent, even though Indigenous Peoples are the proven best guardians of the forest and forcing them from their lands does not improve environmental outcomes. Finally, Indigenous Peoples often live in areas at increased risk of climate change-related disasters. I have already heard from Indigenous Peoples in Kiribati whose homes have been lost to rising seas. Unfortunately, even the solutions to climate change, such as wind farms and geothermal energy, can sometimes threaten indigenous land rights. Where Indigenous Peoples’ rights are ignored, they face the loss of their lands, livelihoods, sacred sites and self-governance. DH: What do you think of the mainstream media’s portrayal of indigenous peoples?  VTC: I think that there has been an increase in media coverage over the years. I’m glad to see less coverage that portrays us as primitive, but sometimes the media fails to capture the fact that we are not anti-development. We are also seeing more media coverage - but still not enough - on the contributions of Indigenous Peoples to global goals on climate, poverty and peace. If Indigenous Peoples’ rights are not secured and protected, it will be impossible for the world to deliver on the promises of the Paris Agreement and the Sustainable Development Goals. Secure land rights for Indigenous Peoples is a proven climate change solution, and denying indigenous land rights and self-determination is a threat to the world’s remaining forests and biodiversity. It is also a primary cause of poverty. Many indigenous communities face intractable poverty despite living on resource-rich lands because their rights are not respected and their self-determined development is not supported. Protecting the rights of indigenous women, who are often responsible for both their communities’ food security and for managing their forests, is particularly important. Finally, undocumented land rights are a primary cause of conflict and a threat to investment in developing countries. Securing their rights can help mitigate these conflicts and create a more peaceful world. DH: Finally, do you think the struggle for indigenous peoples’ rights and territories is comparable to any of the other great social movements in the past?  VTC: I think the Indigenous Peoples’ movement surpasses other social movements. They have struggled against colonisation for more than 500 years and continue against forms of colonisation and racism. At the same time, they continue to construct and reconstruct their communities and practice their cultural values of collectivity, solidarity with nature, and reciprocity even amidst serious challenges. Many still fight to protect their territories, which makes their movement different from others. "
"Donald Trump has failed to knock the Paris climate agreement off course despite his efforts to derail it, according to the former US vice president Al Gore. “The US will meet its commitments [on emissions] in spite of Donald Trump,” he said in London, where his new film An Inconvenient Sequel: Truth to Power was released on Friday. “Every other country has pledged [to combat climate change]. I think the psychological message is that the train has left the station. The signal sent to investors, businesses, individuals and civil society is extraordinarily powerful.”  He said the US president was now isolated and unable to prevent global action on climate change, despite his announcement of the US’s withdrawal from the 2015 Paris agreement. “I was very concerned at his speech – I feared that some other countries would use it as an excuse [to delay or withdraw from the Paris agreement]. I was extremely gratified that the rest of the world redoubled their commitment to Paris,” he told journalists. “I think he has isolated himself. Even today in the US, members of his own political party in the House [of Representatives] and the Senate are beginning to separate themselves from him, and why wouldn’t they?” Gore’s new film recounts much of the story of the Paris negotiations in which he took part informally in attempts to persuade governments, businesses and civil society of the need for concerted global action on the climate. It comes just over a decade after his first film, An Inconvenient Truth, which won an Oscar and helped make Gore co-winner of the Nobel peace prize in 2007 alongside the scientists of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. The first film dealt mainly with the science of global warming, making clear the consensus among experts that human activities, chiefly in burning fossil fuels, were contributing to what could end up as large-scale and disastrous changes to the world’s climate. Its sequel takes the story forward, detailing some of the probable effects of climate change now being seen, such as floods, droughts and fierce rainstorms, and also some of the potential solutions, such as renewable energy, which is surging ahead across the globe. Like the first film, the new documentary dwells on some of the remarkable story of Gore’s life, including his term as vice president to Bill Clinton, during which the Kyoto protocol aiming to reduce greenhouse gas emissions was signed, and the 2000 presidential election, in which Gore won the popular vote but was denied the presidency in a controversial supreme court decision to halt a vote recount in Florida, handing the post to George W Bush. Gore told journalists: “I do not know of a position in the world with [the ability to achieve] positive change that is like the position of US president.” The film was largely made before Trump’s election victory, but a final section examines his rhetoric on climate change during the campaign, and initial actions on taking office. As well as announcing the withdrawal from Paris, Trump has appointed several people to high office who dismiss the human role in climate change, including department of agriculture chief scientist Sam Clovis. He has also begun the dismantling of President Obama’s clean power plan, as well as longer-standing regulations on clean air and water, and the Guardian recently revealed that his team have censored officials’ use of the term climate change. Gore said of Trump’s election: “It is a setback, but not the worst setback we have received. I have seen a lot of setbacks over the years. The damage I feared Trump would do has turned out to be less than I feared.” He pointed to the success of renewable energy, the price of which has plunged dramatically in recent years. In the film, he visits Georgetown in Texas, where the conservative Republican mayor has moved to run the town using only clean energy. “I’m not saying business and new technology will solve this on their own, but it is a tremendous benefit, a legitimate basis for hope.” Gore’s film also deals with aspects of his own role in the Paris negotiations, highlighting efforts he made to broker a deal with the Indian government, which initially took a tough line in the talks, arguing for developing countries to continue using fossil fuels. Gore helped to win a cooperation with the renewable company Solar City that would benefit India. Though the film casts his role as pivotal, Gore acknowledged that “there were many elements involved, a lot of people – President Obama, [Indian prime minister Narendra] Modi, the World Bank and others.” He also praised the French hosts of the talks for a “virtuoso performance” in gaining the global agreement, particularly former president François Hollande and foreign minister Laurent Fabius. The new film highlights the increasing threat of extreme weather. Hurricane Sandy, which caused widespread damage on the US eastern seaboard in 2012, is a taste of disasters to come, according to Gore. He also spent time filming floods in Florida, the low-lying US state most threatened by climate change. Since his election defeat in 2000, Gore has made climate change his focus. He co-founded, with former Goldman Sachs banker David Blood, the fund manager Generation Investment Management, which specialises in renewable energy and other emissions-cutting technologies, and has run a series of “climate leadership” programmes to train politicians, businesspeople and civil society leaders in climate science.  Gore, who will turn 70 in March, has no plans to let up on his globetrotting efforts on climate change. Does he have any regrets over his long and varied career? Just one: “I might have campaigned an extra week in Florida.”"
"Glencore’s multibillion-dollar Wandoan coalmine proposal has been granted mining leases years after it was shelved amid falling commodity prices and a ramped-up global response to climate change.  On Tuesday Queensland’s natural resources and mines minister, Dr Anthony Lynham, approved three 27-year leases covering 30,000 hectares for the first stage of its $7bn mine near Roma.  Doubts about the future of the Wandoan mine had lingered since 2012, amid falling thermal coal prices and a poor market outlook. The approval has enraged environmental groups, who say the government is prioritising a flailing coal industry over communities and putting the state’s agricultural industry at further risk.  “For many years local farmers have been fighting this coalmine,” an Australian Conservation Foundation spokesman, Jason Lyddieth, said on Wednesday. “We know that digging up coal and burning it is polluting our air and fuelling climate change. “The Queensland government needs to get serious about preparing for a carbon pollution-free world. It needs to get serious about our water, our land and our air.” Greenpeace said the approval showed the government was more interested in propping up the fossil fuel industry than protecting communities and the environment.  “We can either have a healthy planet and thriving Great Barrier Reef or we can have new coalmines, not both,” said a climate and energy campaigner, Nikola Casule. “Our politicians must abandon their coal fetish and instead harness the renewable energy revolution to protect Australian communities and position Australia as an industry leader in this rapidly growing sector.” GetUp promised to “resist this mine every step of the way”. “In 2010 local landholders took this mine to court on the basis of destruction to their land and water, and the mine has been troubled by complex compensation claims,” said a Queensland campaigner, Ellen Roberts. Lock the Gate called it “a very dark day for farming in Queensland”. A spokeswoman, Carmel Flint, said: “A large number of farmers have already been displaced by Glencore over this vast area, and now we fear that remaining farmers on and near the lease will be forced out. “This project will be eligible for a secretive Queensland government loan via the royalty deferral package announced in June. “So, Queenslanders are expected to subsidise mining giant Glencore for five years as it rips through one of our core agricultural regions. The open-cut mine is proposed to operate for 35 years in the Surat basin, and will require a railway to the Gladstone port. In a statement on Wednesday, Glencore said new, large-scale projects depended on market support and that significant investment was still needed. Glencore has previously acknowledged the disproportionate risk surrounding new projects. Australian Associated Press contributed to this report"
"Swiss police say hundreds of bodies of mountaineers who have gone missing in the Alps in the past century could emerge in coming years as global warming forces the country’s glaciers to retreat.  Alpine authorities have registered a significant increase in the number of human remains discovered last month, with the body of a man missing for 30 years the most recent to be uncovered. Rescue teams in Saas Valley in the Valais canton were called last Tuesday after two climbers retreating from an aborted ascent spotted a hand and two shoes protruding from the Hohlaub glacier. Rescuers spent two hours freeing the mummified body with icepicks and their bare hands, also recovering a silver wristwatch and a ring. A helicopter flew the remains to Bern, where forensics experts matched the DNA to that of a German citizen, born in 1943, who had gone missing on a hike in 11 August 1987.  One rescue worker said the man had worn shoes “unsuitable” for walking on ice, suggesting he may have slipped after walking a few metres onto the glacier and fallen down a crevice. Both feet had become detached from the body, indicating the force of the fall. The discovery comes less than a week after the bodies of a Swiss couple, missing for 75 years, were found in the Tsanfleuron glacier in the same canton. Marcelin and Francine Dumoulin had disappeared after going out to milk their cows in a meadow above Chandolin on 15 August 1942. Last Thursday, the remains of a person believed to have been killed in an Air India crash more than 50 years ago was also discovered in the French Alps, on Mount Blanc. Switzerland’s glaciers have been melting at an unprecedented rate, losing almost one cubic km in ice volume or about 900 bn litres of water over the past year. According to an investigation by Tagesanzeiger newspaper, eight of the 10 months in which the glaciers have lost the most in volume over the past century have been since 2008.  Since 1850, when glaciers covered 1,735 sq km (670 sq miles) of Swiss land, the total area has shrunk by a half, to about 890 sq km. Police in Valais expect the bodies of many more missing persons to emerge because of global warming. “It’s quite clear,” a spokesman, Christian Zuber, told the Guardian.  “The glaciers are retreating, so it’s logical that we’re finding more and more bodies and body parts. In the coming years we expect that many more cases of missing persons will be resolved.” He said a map that lists everyone who had gone missing since 1925 to the present day contains 306 names and locations, one fewer since the discovery of the German mountaineer. At least 160 alpinists remain missing in France’s Mont Blanc massif, and the Morteratsch glacier in Graubünden is believed to contain the bodies of 40 mountaineers. Zuber described the “great relief” at being able to pass on the information to the families “who would otherwise never know with 100% certainty whether their loved one had perished on the mountain. Finally when a corpse is discovered, you have an absolute guarantee”, he said. He said that feeling had also been palpable earlier this year when a local woman was able to retrieve the bodies of her dead parents, the Dumoulins, who had disappeared when she was just four years old. “We locals are obviously used to the mountains, but such discoveries are no less emotional for the people here,” he said. Rolf Trachsel, head of mountain rescue in Saas-Fee, who led the operation to recover the German man’s body, said it had been discovered in an area popular with hikers. “There was very little snow, and it was not very steep. It was about half an hour’s hike away from the next mountain cable-car station.” He said although the team had to deal with the sad fact they were recovering a dead man, they also felt considerable relief. “If someone has gone missing, logic tells you their body has to turn up again one day,” Trachsel said.  “It’s obviously good that we can put our efforts into recovering someone, especially after 30 years, and knowing how important it is for the family to find out what happened.” The body was taken to the Institute of Forensic Medicine (IRM) at the University of Bern by helicopter for examination and formal identification where it is still being held. Christian Jackowski, a scientist at IRM, said the discovery of human remains was now a regular feature of the Swiss summer holiday season, as climbers started to swarm the Valais region’s ice-covered mountains. Usually bodies emerged from the ice at the top of the glacier, rather than its “tongue” at the bottom of the valley, Jackowski said. The extent to which bodies have been preserved by the ice depends on the circumstances of the person’s demise, with some human remains having been mummified by sunshine and dry winds before being engulfed in ice, while others have been reduced to skeletons. The majority of bodies are trapped in ice, crevices or streams after an accident or a suicide, though some cases are treated in relation to criminal cases. Other bodies could be the victims of military skirmishes. Though Switzerland stayed neutral in world wars one and two, the Mont Blanc massif became a frontline towards the end of the second world war amid intense fighting between the German army and French resistance fighters. In most cases, forensic experts face a race against time once bodies have been removed from the ice and start to thaw. Dental records and DNA samples are checked against a database of missing people to determine the identity of the corpse.  Since 2000, authorities in Switzerland have taken DNA samples of missing people’s family members immediately after their disappearance to facilitate the process."
"In the ballroom of a conference centre in Denver, Colorado, 972 people from 42 countries have come together to talk about climate change. It is March 2017, six weeks since Trump’s inauguration; eight weeks before Trump will announce to the world that he is withdrawing America from the Paris Climate Agreement. These are the early dark days of the new America and yet, in the conference centre, the crowd is upbeat. They’ve all paid out of their own pockets to travel to Denver. They have taken time off work. And they are here, in the presence of their master, Al Gore. Because Al Gore is to climate change… well, what Donald Trump is to climate change denial.  It’s 10 years since the reason for this, the documentary An Inconvenient Truth, was released into cinemas. It was an improbable project on almost every level: a film about what was then practically a non-subject, starring the man best known for not winning the 2000 US election, its beating heart and the engine of its narrative drive a PowerPoint presentation. When the filmmakers approached him, he explains to the room, “I thought they were nuts. A movie of a slideshow, delivered by Al Gore, what doesn’t scream blockbuster about it?” Except it was a blockbuster. In documentary terms, anyway. The careful accretion of facts and figures genuinely shocked people. And it’s a measure of the impact it had, and still continues to have, that Gore delivers this vignette to a rapt crowd who, over the course of three days, are learning how to be “Climate Reality Leaders”. It’s the reason why we are all here – his foundation, the Climate Reality Project, an initiative that grew out of the film, provides intensive training in talking about climate change, combating climate change denial – and the tone might be described as “activist upbeat”. This is a crisis that is solvable, we’re told. Trump is just another hitch, another hurdle to overcome. And it will be overcome. Only occasionally does a sliver of despair leak around the edges. You have to stay positive, a man called David Ellenberger tells the audience. Though sometimes, he admits: “There’s not enough Prozac to get through the day.” It’s almost a relief to hear someone acknowledge this. Because before there was “FAKE NEWS!!!” and the “FAILING New York Times!” Trump was tweeting about “GLOBAL WARMING hoaxsters!” and “GLOBAL WARMING bullshit!” The war on the mainstream media may capture the headlines currently, but the war on climate change science has been in play for years. And it’s this that is one of the most fascinating aspects of Gore’s new film, An Inconvenient Sequel: Truth to Power. Because if the US had a subtitle at the moment, it might be that, too, and the struggle to overcome fake facts and false narratives funded by corporate interests and politically motivated billionaires is one that Gore has been at the frontline of for more than a decade. The film runs through a host of facts – that 14 of the 15 hottest years on record have occurred since 2001 is just one. And the accompanying footage is biblical, terrifying: tornadoes, floods, “rain bombs”, exploding glaciers. We see roads falling into rivers and fish swimming through the streets of Miami. The nightly news, Gore says, has become “a nature hike through the Book of Revelations”. But what his work has shown and continues to show is that evidence is not enough. The film opens with clips from Fox News ridiculing global warming. In recent weeks, the New York Times has started describing the Trump administration as waging a “war on science”, a full-on assault against evidence-based science that runs in parallel with his attacks on evidence-based reporting. And Gore is in something of a unique position to understand this. What becomes clear over the course of several conversations is how entwined he believes it all is – climate change denial, the interests of big capital, “dark money”, billionaire political funders, the ascendancy of Trump and what he calls (he’s written a book on it) “the assault against reason”. They are all pieces of the same puzzle; a puzzle that Gore has been tracking for years, because it turns out that climate change denial was the canary in the coal mine. “In order to fix the climate crisis, we need to first fix the government crisis,” he says. “Big money has so much influence now.” And he says a phrase that is as dramatic as it is multilayered: “Our democracy has been hacked.” It’s something I hear him repeat – to the audience in the ballroom, in a room backstage, a few weeks later in London, and finally on the phone earlier this month. What do you mean by it exactly? “I mean that those with access to large amounts of money and raw power,” says Gore, “have been able to subvert all reason and fact in collective decision making. The Koch brothers are the largest funders of climate change denial. And ExxonMobil claims it has stopped, but it really hasn’t. It has given a quarter of a billion dollars in donations to climate denial groups. It’s clear they are trying to cripple our ability to respond to this existential threat.” One of Trump’s first acts after his inauguration was to remove all mentions of climate change from federal websites. More overlooked is that one of Theresa May’s first actions on becoming prime minister – within 24 hours of taking office – was to close the Department for Energy and Climate Change; subsequently donations from oil and gas companies to the Conservative party continued to roll in. And what is increasingly apparent is that the same think tanks that operate in the States are also at work in Britain, and climate change denial operates as a bridgehead: uniting the right and providing an entry route for other tenets of  Alt-Right belief. And, it’s this network of power that Gore has had to try to understand, in order to find a way to combat it. “In Tennessee we have an expression: ‘If you see a turtle on top of a fence post, you can be pretty sure it didn’t get there by itself.’ And if you see these levels of climate denial, you can be pretty sure it didn’t just spread itself. The large carbon polluters have spent between $1bn and $2bn spreading false doubt. Do you know the book, Merchants of Doubt? It documents how the tobacco industry discredited the consensus on cigarette smoking and cancer by creating doubt, and shows how it’s linked to the climate denial movement. They hired many of the same PR firms and some of the same think tanks. And, in fact, some of those who work on climate change denial actually still dispute the links between cigarette smoking and lung cancer.” The big change between our first conversation in Denver and our last, on the phone this month, is the news that Gore had been desperately hoping wouldn’t happen: Trump’s announcement on 1 June that he was pulling America out of the Paris Agreement. The negotiations in Paris are right at the heart of the new film, its emotional centre, and when I watch it in March, the ending still sees Gore expressing guarded optimism. So, what happened? “I was wrong,” he says on the phone from Australia, where he’s been promoting the film. “Based on what he told me, I definitely thought there was a better than even chance he might choose to stay in. But I was wrong. I was fearful that other countries for whom it was a close call would follow his lead, but I’m thrilled the reaction has been exactly the opposite. The other 19 members of the G20 have reiterated that Paris is irreversible. And governors and mayors all over the country have been saying we are all still in and, in fact, it’s just going to make us redouble our commitments.” The film had to be recut, the ending changed, the gloves are now off. What changed Trump’s mind? “I think Steve Bannon and his crowd put a big push on Trump and convinced him that he needed to give this to his base supporters. He had blood in his eyes.” It’s instructive because Bannon, Trump’s chief strategist, is also the ideologue behind Trump’s assault on the media. And Bannon’s understanding of the news and information space, and efforts to manipulate it via Breitbart News and Cambridge Analytica, both funded by another key climate change denier, Robert Mercer, are at the heart of the Trump agenda. And what becomes clear if you Google “climate change” is how effective the right has been in owning the subject. YouTube’s results are dominated by nothing but climate change denial videos. This isn’t news for Gore. He has multiple high-level links to Silicon Valley. He’s on the board of Apple and used to be an adviser for Google. “We are fully aware of the problem,” he says with what sounds like resigned understatement. Gore has had more than a decade fighting climate change denial, and in some respects, the problem has simply worsened and deepened. “On the other hand, two-thirds of the American people are convinced that it’s an extremely serious crisis and we have to take it on,” he says. “And there is a law of physics that every action produces an equal and opposite reaction. And I do think there is a reaction to the Trump/Brexit/Alt-Right populist authoritarianism around the world. People who took liberal democracy more or less for granted are now awakening to a sense that it can only be defended by the people themselves.” And it’s in this, his belief in social progress against all odds, that he takes his lead from the civil rights movement. The cut of the film I see compares the climate change movement to the other great social movements that eventually won out: the abolition of slavery, women’s suffrage, civil rights. Something profound and disturbing is happening right now, though, he admits. “The information system is in such a chaotic transition and people are deluged with so much noise that it gives an opening for Trump and his forces to wage war against facts and reason.” Is it, as some people describe, an information war? “Absolutely,” he says. “There’s no question about it.” What there isn’t much of, in the film, is Al Gore, the man. In 2010, he split from Tipper, his wife of 40 years and the mother of his two grown-up daughters, and what becomes clear is just how much of his life the fight takes up. When I catch up with him next, he’s in London for a board meeting of his green-focused investment firm, Generation Investment Management, and I ask him to tell me about his recent travels. “Two weeks ago, I had three red-eyes in five days. I’ve been in Sweden, the Netherlands, Sharjah, then let’s see, San Francisco, New York, Los Angeles. Where else?” he asks his assistant. “Vegas,” she says. “We did CinemaCon.” “Vegas, we did that. And then, let’s see, Nashville, on my farm.” I assume this amount of travel is connected to the release of the film, but no. “I’ve been at this level for the past 10 years and longer.” He hesitates to use the word “mission”, he says, and then uses it. “When you feel a sense of purpose that seems to justify pouring everything you can into it, it makes it easier to get up in the morning.” He does tell me a bit about his parents though. He describes his father, Al Gore Sr, who grew up poor then became a lawyer and a politician, as “a hero to me”. And it was at the family farm in Carthage, Tennessee, that he held the first Climate Reality training, an informal get-together of 50 people that has morphed into the event I witnessed in Denver. There’s no “type” or demographic, I shared a table with a disparate group – including a consultant for the aerospace industry, a French lawyer and an American chef. And they seemed to have almost nothing in common aside from their passion to do something about climate change. “I’m a gardener so I’m seeing what’s happening with my own eyes,” the chef, Susan Kutner, told me. “You can’t ignore it.” In light of Trump’s fixation with fake news, it’s fascinating to see. Gore has been fighting disinformation for more than a decade. And, he’s developed his training programme counter to the prevailing ideology. The answer is not online. Social media will not save us. We will not click climate change away. The answer he’s come up with is low-tech, old-fashioned, human. He takes the time to talk to people directly, one to one, in the hope they will speak to other people – who will speak to other people. The course is run by Gore. He is on stage almost the entire time over three intensive days. And the heart of it is still the slideshow. One of his aides tells me how he was up until 2am the night before. “He’s obsessed with his slides, he has 30,000 of them and he switches them around all the time.” In the film, you see him perpetually hustling, calling world leaders, rounding up solar energy entrepreneurs, training activists. Hearing information from “people you know” is at the heart of his strategy. “You need people who will look you in the eye and say: ‘Look, this is what I’ve learned, this is what you need to know.’ It works. I’ve seen it work. It is working. And it’s just getting started. We’ve got 12,000 trained leaders now.” How many people do you think it’s impacted? “Millions. Honestly, millions. And a non- trivial percentage of them have gone on to become ministers in their countries’ governments or take leadership roles in international organisations. They’ve had an outsized impact. Christiana Figueres [the UN climate chief], who ran the Paris meeting, she was in the second training session I did in Tennessee. And, right now, people are getting really fired up.” Al Gore shared the Nobel Prize in 2007 for his efforts in combating climate change, but in some ways it feels like he’s just getting started. The rest of the world is only now cottoning on to the enlightenment struggle that’s at the heart of it – a battle royal to defend facts and reason against people and forces for whom it’s a truth too inconvenient to allow. For Gore, the US oil companies are the ultimate culprits, but it’s only just becoming apparent that Russia has also played a role, amplifying messages around climate change as it did around the other issues at the heart of Trump’s agenda, and we segue into his visits to Russia in the early 90s, during one of which he met Putin for the first time. What did you make of him? “I would not have thought of him as the future president of Russia. I once did a televised town hall event to the whole of Russia and Putin was the one who was in charge of making sure all the cables were connected and whatnot.” What does he make of the investigations into Russian interference? “I think the investigation of the Trump campaign’s collusions with the Russians and the existence of financial levers of Putin over Trump is proceeding with its own rhythm beneath the news cycle, and may well strike pay dirt.” It’s also worth pointing out that when someone passed his campaign stolen information about George W Bush’s debate research, he handed it to the FBI. And then he amazes me by pulling out a reference to an interview I conducted with Arron Banks, the Bristol businessman who funded Nigel Farage’s Leave campaign. He’s been reading up about the links between Brexit and Trump, and Banks’s and Farage’s support of Putin and Russia. “He told you: ‘Russia needs a strong man,’ didn’t he? And you hear that in the US, and I don’t think it’s fair to the Russians. I am a true believer in the superiority of representative democracy where there is a healthy ecosystem characterised by free speech and an informed citizenry. I really resist the slur against any nation that they’re incapable of governing themselves.” Brexit, Trump, climate change, oil producers, dark money, Russian influence, a full- frontal assault on facts, evidence, journalism, science, it’s all connected.

"With the first six months of 2017 in the books, average global surface temperatures so far this year are 0.94°C above the 1950–1980 average, according to NASA. That makes 2017 the second-hottest first six calendar months on record, behind only 2016.  That’s remarkable because 2017 hasn’t had the warming influence of an El Niño event. El Niños bring warm ocean water to the surface, temporarily causing average global surface temperatures to rise. 2016 – including the first six months of the year – was influenced by one of the strongest El Niño events on record.  For a long time one of the favorite climate denier myths involved claiming that we hadn’t seen any global surface warming since 1998. That myth has fallen by the wayside since 2014, 2015, and 2016 each broke the global surface temperature records previously set in 2010 and 2005 (which were also both hotter than 1998). Yet the myth persisted for years because 1998 was anomalously hot due to the monster El Niño event that year, which meant that global temperatures weren’t much hotter than 1998 until 2014 to today. Now the first six months of 2017 have been 0.3°C hotter than 1998, despite the former having no El Niño warming influence and the latter being amplified by a monster El Niño. In 1998, there was also more solar energy reaching Earth than there has been in 2017.  In terms of El Niño and solar temperature influences, 2017 thus far has been most similar to 2006, but 2017 has been 0.3°C hotter than 2006 as well. In a recent Senate committee hearing, Trump’s Department of Energy Secretary Rick Perry said that he didn’t believe human carbon pollution is the primary control knob for the Earth’s climate (it is; hence the title of this NASA paper published in the journal Science in 2010), but instead placed most of the blame on “naturally occurring events – the warming and the cooling of our ocean waters.” That’s a simple hypothesis to test. If global surface temperatures were rising due to an exchange of heat from ocean cycles, then as Perry noted, ocean temperatures would be alternatively warming and cooling. When oceans transferred heat to the surface, their temperatures would cool, and vice-versa. That’s simply not happening – measurements show that the oceans have steadily built up heat: Instead, every component of the Earth’s climate is warming. Surface air temperatures, lower atmospheric temperatures, ocean temperatures, and sea levels are rising as ice around the globe melts. That’s a key signature not of an internal Earth cycle, but of an external influence – either an increase in incoming energy from the sun, or a decrease in outgoing energy, for example due to an increase in the heat-trapping greenhouse effect. And as we’ve established, there’s actually been a slight decrease in incoming solar energy.  The culprit is quite clearly human carbon pollution. That’s how the first six months of 2017, despite lacking solar or El Niño ocean warming, can be hotter than 1998, and 2006, and every year before 2016. In fact, research has shown that global surface temperatures are already rising about 20 times faster than Earth’s fastest natural climate change, during the transition in and out of ice ages. And unless we take serious action to cut carbon pollution, that rate will rise to perhaps 50 times faster than Earth’s fastest natural climate change. Climate deniers have recently been shifting to the ‘global warming isn’t bad’ myth. It should go without saying that such rapid climate change is dangerous. Species can only adapt so fast. The IPCC concluded that we’re already approaching the point at which up to 30% of global species are at increasing risk of extinction. If we don’t take action to curb global warming, the IPCC projects that by century’s end, 40% or more of global species could go extinct, as we approach Earth’s sixth mass extinction.  Today’s remarkably hot temperatures, caused by human carbon pollution, are a sign of what’s to come. If we don’t get global warming under control, the consequences will indeed be bad."
"In a bold new strategy unveiled on Monday in the Guardian, the US Department of Agriculture – guardians of the planet’s richest farmlands – has decided to combat the threat of global warming by forbidding the use of the words.  Under guidance from the agency’s director of soil health, Bianca Moebius-Clune, a list of phrases to be avoided includes “climate change” and “climate change adaptation”, to be replaced by “weather extremes” and “resilience to weather extremes”.  Also blacklisted is the scary locution “reduce greenhouse gases” – and here, the agency’s linguists have done an even better job of camouflage: the new and approved term is “increase nutrient use efficiency”.  The effectiveness of this approach – based on the well-known principle that what you can’t say won’t hurt you – has previously been tested at the state level, making use of the “policy laboratories” provided by America’s federalist system.  In 2012, for instance, the North Carolina general assembly voted to prevent communities from planning for sea level rise. Early analysis suggests this legislation has been ineffective: Hurricane Matthew, in 2016, for instance drove storm surge from the Atlantic ocean to historic levels along the Cape Fear river. Total damage from the storm was estimated at $4.8bn.  Further south, the Florida government forbade its employees to use the term climate change in 2014 – one government official, answering questions before the legislature, repeatedly used the phrase “the issue you mentioned earlier” in a successful effort to avoid using the taboo words.  It is true that the next year “unprecedented” coral bleaching blamed on rising temperatures destroyed vast swaths of the state’s reefs: from Key Biscayne to Fort Lauderdale, a survey found that “about two-thirds were dead or reduced to less than half of their live tissue”. Still, it’s possible that they simply need to increase their nutrient use efficiency.  At the federal level, the new policy has yet to show clear-cut success either. As the say-no-evil policy has rolled out in the early months of the Trump presidency, it coincided with the onset of a truly dramatic “flash drought” across much of the nation’s wheat belt.  As the Farm Journal website pointed out earlier last week: “Crops in the Dakotas and Montana are baking on an anvil of severe drought and extreme heat, as bone-dry conditions force growers and ranchers to make difficult decisions regarding cattle, corn and wheat.”  In typically negative journalistic fashion, the Farm Journal reported that “abandoned acres, fields with zero emergence, stunted crops, anemic yields, wheat rolled into hay, and early herd culls comprise a tapestry of disaster for many producers”.  Which is why it’s good news for the new strategy that the USDA has filled its vacant position of chief scientist with someone who knows the power of words.  In fact, Sam Clovis, the new chief scientist, is not actually a scientist of the kind that does science, or has degrees in science, but instead formerly served in the demanding task of rightwing radio host (where he pointed out that followers of former president Obama were “Maoists”). He has actually used the words “climate change” in the past, but only to dismiss it as “junk science”.   Under his guidance the new policy should soon yield results, which is timely since recent research (carried out, it must be said, by scientist scientists at MIT) showed that “climate change could deplete some US water basins and dramatically reduce crop yields in some areas by 2050”.  But probably not if we don’t talk about it. Bill McKibben is the founder of the climate campaign 350.org."
"As the motor car industry is at the forefront of environmental degradation both globally and locally, it is only right that manufacturers take a lead in tackling the problem (Ford launches £2,000 scrappage scheme, 22 August). Instead, they offer only a scheme to sell more cars based on an unproven theory. This appears to posit that the pollution created by running an “old” car is so much greater than that of running a “new” one, that an environmental disaster might be delayed if we buy new cars more quickly. If Ford will reveal their figures for this old/new pollution differential and compare them with an evaluation of the pollution created in manufacturing a brand-new vehicle, then we might establish whether or not they know what they are talking about.Dr Kevin BannonLondon • Join the debate – email guardian.letters@theguardian.com  • Read more Guardian letters – click here to visit gu.com/letters"
"Someone writes a memo about his views on gender difference and it kicks off. Apparently women are in tears, too traumatised to go to work. A baker refuses to ice a wedding cake for two guys and my Twitter feed practically bursts into flames. “HOW CAN THIS BE HAPPENING?!” But mention the climate crisis, something that is smashing temperature records, raising sea levels, driving diseases into places they’ve not been before, and which may lead, as Professor Stephen Hawking suggests, to a need for the human race to flee the planet, and there’s radio silence. You can almost see the digital tumbleweed.  Nearly 30 years after Nasa’s James Hansen testified before a US Senate committee that human activity was warming the planet and must be stopped, it seems the issue does not stir the general population. Partly it’s because of the tens of corporate millions spent by the biggest polluters to create doubt that stalls legislation. That lobbying has worked. Trump said he believes the Chinese made it up, perfectly playing to the right’s paranoia, even as the sand their heads are buried in is getting so hot it would cook an ostrich egg. But what is surprising is that the left are not more fired up about the climate crisis. In the UK, commentators such as Katie Hopkins imply that the only people who care are hysterical lefty shills. Of course lots of people, on the left and right do care, more than ever. After all, this is an issue of science and survival and we all have the same to lose. But in my experience, many on the left who should care more about climate change just don’t. People who are extremely vocal about homophobia, transphobia, racism and sexism seem to have a blind spot. Which is odd because in the coming decades, all those problems (and more) will be supersized. Peter Tatchell has long warned that tolerance does not always survive periods of social turbulence. Violent hatred bubbles just under the surface in society. On the day same sex marriage began in the UK, for example, one relatively intelligently argued comment under a newspaper article concluded that what we needed to stop men marrying men and women marrying women was “a civil war”. Such people are kept at bay – just – by stable societies; by the rule of law; by the fact that the majority of us have a roof over our heads, relative security and three meals a day. But there is plenty of historical evidence to suggest that under stress, civilisation wobbles. Minorities get it harder and sooner. Berlin, infamously, pre-Nazism was a centre of gay freedom. A few years later its gay citizens were in concentration camps. Trump’s transgender military ban comes just six months after the presidency of the most LGBT-friendly commander-in-chief in history. Does Trump really think trans people shouldn’t serve? Or is he simply cynical and savvy enough to know his base will be appeased, as they always are, by a kick to those on the fringe? People are killed because they are of colour, women, trans, gays or lesbians. These are among the most important issues. But could it be that there are things that we must also raise our voices for, that are more important and on which all other issues rest and rely? The DUP’s position on equal marriage, the BBC gender pay gap, Piers Morgan’s views on non-binary people – all are meaningless if the fight that future generations face is for clean water or surviving wars caused by migration that will make the Syrian crisis, itself partly driven by extreme drought, look like a children’s tea party. We must wake up and take responsibility. This is not a case of either/or – it is possible to campaign on multiple issues at the same time, but for too long, too many progressives have stayed silent over climate change. We can start to change that by watching Al Gore’s new film An Inconvenient Sequel this weekend. There’s no one left to warn us: scientists and politicians have done so, the Earth itself could not be clearer: this week in Iraq birds are falling from the sky as the country suffers through 50C heat. Spain has just broken its all-time temperature record, hitting a shocking 46C amid a European heatwave named Lucifer. We are on the verge of something literally unimaginable from which scientists say there will be no way back. We have been warned, over and over again. We will only have ourselves to blame. • Matthew Todd is a former editor of Attitude magazine and the author of Straight Jacket: How to be gay and happy"
"Clouds perform an important function in cooling the planet as they reflect solar energy back into space. Yet clouds also intensify warming by trapping the planet’s heat and radiating it back to Earth. As fossil fuel emissions continue to warm the planet, how will this dual role played by clouds change, and will clouds ultimately exacerbate or moderate global warming? Kate Marvel, a physicist at Columbia University and a researcher at Nasa’s Goddard Institute for Space Studies, is investigating the mysteries of clouds and climate change. And while she and her colleagues would like to offer definitive answers on this subject, the fact is that few now exist. In an interview with Yale Environment 360, she discusses what is known about the behaviour of clouds in a warming world (they are migrating more toward the poles), why strict controls need to be imposed on geoengineering experiments with clouds, and why she is confident that science and human ingenuity will ultimately overcome the challenge of climate change.  Yale Environment 360: Why are clouds such a challenge when it comes to accounting for them in climate change models? Kate Marvel: Clouds are really important to the climate. They explain why different climate models predict different possible futures. Some climate models are saying it’s going to get really hot, and some climate models are saying it’s going to get hot, but not as hot. And it turns out that differences in cloud changes, predicted by the models, are kind of the main reason for that.  And clouds are hard to model because they are simultaneously large and small. When you think about how clouds form, they are the result of microscopic water droplets, or ice crystals, coalescing like grains of sand. But at the same time, they cover 75% of the Earth’s surface. So it’s really hard for a climate model, which is fundamentally large scale, to get those really small-scale processes right. So we know that climate models don’t handle clouds very well. We’ve known that for a while. But clouds are also very important in regulating the climate. They block a lot of sunlight, but they also trap a lot of heat coming up from the Earth’s surface. e360: So it’s opposing effects. What dictates which effect a cloud will have? Marvel: It depends on several aspects; what the cloud is made of is very important. Clouds that are made of ice particles are less reflective, they reflect less sunlight than juicier clouds made of liquid water droplets.  Cloud height is also really important. If you look up on a clear, summer day, and you see wispy, cirrus clouds, those obviously are not very good at blocking sunlight; they let sunlight stream through. But they are very good at trapping the heat from the planet’s surface. So, high clouds in general have a warming effect, but, low, thick clouds – the kind you see on a cloudy, gloomy day – are really good at blocking sunlight, so those have a cooling effect. e360: Researchers have gained a deeper understanding of cloud behaviour in a warming world. Talk a bit about what we’ve learned. Marvel: We had a paper in the Journal of Climate that showed clouds are moving in the way that we would expect them to. So if you think about those low clouds that block sunlight, they are going to be much more effective in the tropics, where there is more sunlight, than there is further toward the poles, where the sun is less intense. And climate change is predicted to alter atmospheric circulation patterns. It is predicted to push everything poleward. We have seen clouds following that particular trajectory. If you look at the large-scale patterns of clouds, they are moving toward the poles. e360: A Nature paper published after yours found an upward motion to clouds. Did you also find that? Marvel: We found hints of it; in the Nature paper it is much clearer because they made corrections that accounted for the fact that the satellite records are really patchy and they were able to really observe clearly that high cloud shift. And there have been other studies that have observed that when it’s warmer, high clouds shift upwards. That is an effect that we think we understand fairly well. e360: What are the consequences of this poleward and upward motion of clouds? Marvel: Both of them give rise to what I think is the most confusing part of climate jargon. We call it a “positive feedback”, and you think that sounds great. I like getting positive feedback. But when climate scientists talk about a positive feedback, we mean some process that changes in response to warming, that accelerates that warming.  e360: And is this trend, poleward and upward, something that the models say will continue under a business-as-usual scenario? Marvel: Yes, we think so. e360: There was some discussion when these studies came out regarding whether this was a consequence of global warming or that these movements were a consequence of recovery from major volcanic activity. Where do things stand with that at this point? Marvel: That’s a really good point. You have to be careful about attributing things to natural external forces versus human-caused external influences. We are currently working on a project that is trying to tease out those influences. But I don’t think there’s been a study published that definitively attributes the observed changes to one particular external sourcing. e360: Of course, climate deniers can grab hold of something like that and say, “See, they don’t really know.” Marvel: That’s one of the greatest things about science ... we can say we don’t know, or we don’t know yet. I’m suspicious of people who say, “I have all the answers.” I think there’s this real tendency to say that, “Oh, well if you don’t know everything, you don’t know anything.” And I think that’s totally wrong. The continued existence of science does not invalidate science. The fact that we’re still asking questions doesn’t mean that the method we’re using to answer those questions is wrong.  e360: Most of our cloud observations come from weather satellites. However, there was a Nasa satellite in the planning stage that was designed to look at cloud behaviour. President Trump’s proposed budget zeroes out that mission. Should Nasa projects that deal with climate change be a priority in the upcoming budget? Marvel: I certainly think so. We have this amazing satellite technology. We can observe all of us from space. We can measure things that we never dreamed we could measure and that’s a miracle. I also think it’s extremely cost-effective. Why would we not want to do it? I started my career as an astrophysicist, and then I realised that nowhere else in the universe is as good as here, right? This is the best planet. And it’s part of Nasa’s mission to look at other worlds, but we also want to look down at our world as well. e360: In a recent commentary, a group of researchers, including two from the University of Washington, made the case for conducting small-scale experiments using a geoengineering technique known as cloud brightening. They want to spray saltwater into marine clouds making them more reflective of sunlight as a possible way of reducing global warming. What’s your take on such experiments? Marvel: With geoengineering, I’m always very concerned because if I want to do an experiment on human subjects, as a university researcher, I have to go in front of a review board and convince them that all of my human subjects have given informed consent to participate in this experiment. And with a lot of geoengineering experiments, I worry about how that consent is going to be obtained. The Climate Geoengineering Governance Project is starting to think about how we would design an international law regime to actually regulate this.  e360: You’ve written that when it comes to climate change, “I refuse to give in to despair. I just don’t have time for that. I’m too busy doing science.” Tell me more about the roll-up-your-sleeves attitude you’ve got. Marvel: People ask me, “Aren’t you just depressed all the time? How do you keep going in the face of this?” We’re all going to die. You know, there’s not a lot of good news there. But we all manage to find happiness and fun in our lives anyway. And I do have hope, I do think that we are an amazing species; and we do a lot of terrible things, but we also do a lot of very good things. I do have hope in human ingenuity. I don’t think we peaked with the internal combustion engine. So that gives me hope. Going back to your question about Nasa satellites, the fact that we as a species can look at our planet from above, that’s amazing. The fact that we understand how the planet actually works, and we keep continuing to ask these questions – that gives me hope. That makes me optimistic about the future of our species.

"Queensland will have a 2,000km network of electric vehicle charging stations that make up one of the world’s longest electric vehicle highways within six months. The state government announced on Thursday it would build an 18-station network stretching along Queensland’s east coast from Cairns to Coolangatta and west to Toowoomba. The stations, which recharge a vehicle in 30 minutes, will offer free power for at least a year in what the environment minister, Steven Miles, said was a bid to boost the number of electric cars on Queensland roads, currently about 700. “This project is ambitious, but we want as many people as possible on board the electric vehicle revolution, as part of our transition to a low-emissions future,” Miles said. The $3m network had “the potential to revolutionise the way we travel around Queensland in the future”, he said. Queensland’s “electric highway” will span a comparable distance to the “west coast electric highway” in the US, which runs from California to Oregon and Washington state. However it is dwarfed by the Trans-Canada EV highway, which, at about 8,000km, is the world’s longest. But the US in total now boasts 16,107 stations and 43,828 charging outlets, according to the US Department of Energy. Tesla drivers can reputedly make journeys of 20,000 km. The Queensland stations, which will range from the capital Brisbane to the small sugar town of Tully, would be powered with “green energy” bought through renewable energy credits or offsets. Miles said a state household energy survey showed half of Queenslanders would consider “an electric vehicle, plug-in hybrid or regenerative braking hybrid” when buying a new car in the next two years. While lower prices and longer-lasting batteries were driving global uptake, most in the survey said “improvements to public fast-charging infrastructure would further tempt them into purchasing an EV”, Miles said. Car executives from Audi, BMW, Hyundai, Jaguar Land Rover, Mercedes Benz and Mitsubishi lined up to praise the move and called on other states to follow. The Audi Australia managing director, Paul Sansom, said electric car drivers travelling “the vast distances in between our capital cities … need to have confidence that they will be able to find a charging station when they need it, even if they’re driving in an unfamiliar region”. “This is the current expectation around frequency of petrol stations, and it’s, rightly, what consumers will demand as EVs become more prevalent.” Behyad Jafari, the chief executive of the Electric Vehicle Council, said the state government had shown “national leadership” with “a signal to the market that Queensland is serious about electric vehicles”. This gave the industry “certainty to unlock investment to grow our economy and create new, high skilled jobs”, he said. “I encourage all governments across Australia to follow suit, particularly as this support will help to provide motorists with increased choice of cars that are cheaper and healthier to operate.” Queensland is Australia’s biggest carbon polluter, with the transport sector making up the state’s second largest source of carbon emissions with 21.1m tonnes in 2014, having almost doubled since 1990. Passenger cars make up almost half of transport emissions, according to the state environment department. The $3m contract to build the network has been awarded to Brisbane technology company Tritium, which began as a solar car racing parts manufacturer."
"Tourists have been warned to avoid blooms of toxic micro-algae that have been proliferating in hot weather in the sea off Spain’s Canary Islands. Tenerife in particular is awash with visitors at this time of year but some of those having a dip in the Atlantic ocean have come out scratching themselves after brushing up against the tiny algae.  The spreading algae have produced a greenish-brown hue in the waters off some beaches in the tourist haven.  “Since the end of June we have seen episodes of massive efflorescence, or bloom, of microalgae, sometimes reaching as far as bathing beaches,” said Jose Juan Aleman, director of public health for the Canaries. The algae are a type of bacteria, trichodesmium erythraeum, also known as sea sawdust, said Aleman. “Its proliferation is a natural, temporary phenomenon which is going to disappear” in due course, he added, suggesting global warming was helping the algae spread. The bacterium “contains a toxin which can lead to skin irritation, dermatitis, hence one must avoid coming into contact with it in the water and on the sand”. With the islands last year welcoming more than 13 million foreign tourists, local authorities were keen to reassure sun-seekers. “Generally it has not been necessary to close the beaches,” said Aleman. No swimming, algae alert @playasanjuan @tenerife pic.twitter.com/0sqIeAblqu However, AFP found that several have been closed to swimmers over recent weeks, including the popular Teresitas beach at Santa Cruz de Tenerife. Marta Sanson, professor of plant biology at Tenerife’s La Laguna university, said that “ideal conditions are allowing proliferation of these micro-algae”. Those include “an increase in water temperature” as well as a “dust cloud sweeping in off the Sahara which is rich in iron, a nutrient which micro-organisms like”."
"The Paris-based International Energy Agency was born in a crisis. In the wake of the 1973 oil shock, as Arab petroleum producers withheld supply from countries that supported Israel in the Yom Kippur war, the then US secretary of state, Henry Kissinger, called on the OECD to set up a new body to ensure its members would always have the reliable and affordable energy they needed. Over time, as the agency has expanded its focus to map broader energy trends, it has sometimes faced accusations of conservatism – that it has underestimated the uptake of renewable energy, and has been overly bullish about the future of fossil fuels. But last month it released a report that pointed to a rupture more far reaching than the 70s oil embargo. It suggested investment in new coal power across the globe has peaked and is on the verge of a steep decline. In a coinciding media briefing, the IEA chief economist, Laszlo Varro, declared the “century of coal” that started in 2000 – evident in the extraordinary wave of investment by emerging Asian nations – may already be over. “It is becoming clear that Chinese coal demand has peaked,” he went on. “The outlook for imports [to] India and other countries is uncertain.” What does this mean for Australia, producer of about 30% of the world’s coal trade, as it plans a vast expansion in production in outback Queensland? The future of coalmining is really two separate questions, with their own answers. Neither is clear-cut, but thermal coal – burned in power stations to provide electricity – is on a different trajectory to higher-quality metallurgical coal, mainly used in producing steel. About 55% of the coal Australia exports is thermal, but the 45% metallurgical coal is more lucrative, reaping nearly two-thirds of the revenue. The bulk of the thermal coal is exported from the Hunter Valley of New South Wales; most of the metallurgical product comes from Queensland. Combined, coal exports were worth $55bn last financial year. Only iron ore brings in more. Until last year, coal prices had been on a steep downward trajectory since 2011. The surge in demand last decade prompted investment in mines across the globe but demand had slowed by the time they became operational, resulting in oversupply. By 2014, global coal use had stopped growing. In 2015, it started to decline. Several factors were at play, many of them long-term trends. China stopped growing as rapidly, took steps to limit choking air pollution, and began to shift its economy from relying on industrial exports to a greater emphasis on services and consumption. Climate change policies began to cut into coal’s market share in developed countries. In the US, the rapid development of cheap shale gas projects made coal uneconomic before the introduction of Barack Obama’s emissions policies. By early 2016, the IEA was reporting that 80% of Chinese coalmining operations were losing money and the companies responsible for about half of US coal production were bankrupt.  It triggered a reaction. The Communist party forced the closure of some mines, restricted operation at others, to cut Chinese production by more than 10%. The global thermal coal price quickly doubled. The price of metallurgical coal surged further, tripling in April this year after Cyclone Debbie ravaged large parts of Queensland, reducing supply from some mines. Australia’s export revenue from coal exports soared 57% in a year. Both events illustrated the potential for volatility in coal markets owing to the weather or government fiat. But the bounce was brief. Market analysts at Citi Research last month warned investors that the outlook for coal stocks was pessimistic: major banks were financing fewer projects; Donald Trump’s much-vaunted pro-coal and anti-climate change stance was having little impact in the US. In a report for the Australian Conservation Foundation, consultants ACIL Allen agreed. “At present, there is considerable pessimism regarding the long-term outlook for prices of thermal coal in international markets,” it said. “This is reflected in forecasts by credible Australian and international agencies.” Citi forecasts modest growth in Australian thermal coal exports in the near term, including the potential expansion of a couple of mines. But with prices expected to fall to US$60 a tonne by the end of the decade, down from a US$110 peak late last year, it sees no incentive for investment in new major projects – especially given public opposition and investor apathy towards coal. It makes for an unlikely environment in which to develop a mega-mine backed by public money. But that is what Australia is considering. The Indian billionaire Gautam Adani’s $21bn proposal to build a giant mine in the Galilee basin, about 340km south-west of Townsville, dates back to 2010. It has outlasted three Australian prime ministers and survived the signing of a global deal to combat climate change. Unsuccessful court battles have been waged and lost by opponents, promised imminent start dates have come and gone, and government support has steadily increased. Though known as the Carmichael mine, if fully developed it will actually be 11 mines: six of them open-cut and five underground, spread over a length of 50km. Eventually, the company says, it could yield up to 60m tonnes a year to be shipped to burn in Indian coal plants. The rail and port infrastructure necessary would open up the possibility of reviving some of the dormant coalmining plans in the basin, with a total potential additional output of about 150m tonnes of coal a year. To put that into context, Australia now exports about 200m tonnes. It is, by any measure, a massive expansion that could push the world measurably closer to breaching the goals of the Paris climate agreement. The details of the Adani proposal have moved over time. It was initially proposed to run for 150 years but that has been scaled back to 60. The company promised it would create 10,000 jobs; an ACIL Allen Consulting economist contracted by the company later conceded in court a more likely figure was 1,464. And the project is promised to initially start on a smaller scale, producing 25m tonnes a year. It has environmental approval, has been granted access to groundwater from the Great Artesian Basin, and won a four-year deferment before it has to start paying royalties to the state. In June Adani announced it had made a final investment decision and was ready to go ahead. In truth, this was spin – it was still yet to secure finance for the project (Australian banks have not been willing) – but it was ramping up pressure on the Australian government to approve a $900m low-cost loan through its Northern Australia Infrastructure Facility to help to fund a railway that Adani would own and operate for itself and other potential Galilee basin miners. Adani’s biggest champion has been the recently resigned resources minister Matt Canavan, who argued the mine should go ahead on economic, humanitarian and, most audaciously, environmental grounds. Specifically: bring jobs and growth to struggling north Queensland; help improve the lives of the 240 million Indians living without electricity; and be better for the planet given that India is building coal plants anyway, and Australian coal is a cleaner product than what is dug up in other parts of the world. All three points have been contested. There has been significant pushback against the idea that, in a world where the demand for coal is flat at best, existing Australian mines would not lose out if the Galilee basin were developed. The coal consultancy Wood Mackenzie was commissioned to look at the issue by the $2bn Infrastructure Fund, which owns a stake in the coal-reliant Port of Newcastle, and found existing mines in southern Queensland and NSW would be hit. “Put simply, either the $1bn loan to Adani will have a significant impact on coal production and jobs in the Hunter Valley, Bowen basin and Surat basin, or the business case for the Adani rail line is deeply flawed and the promised jobs for north Queensland unlikely to materialise,” it reported.  Testing the humanitarian and environment arguments requires a closer look at the changes under way in the Indian electricity market. India is the world’s second largest importer of thermal coal. It doesn’t want to be. Its coal minister, Piyush Goyal, has repeatedly said he wants to cut imports completely. It won’t happen in the short term – some of the country’s plants were built to run using higher-quality coal, which is not available domestically – but a shift is under way. Reuters reported that demand for imported thermal coal in India fell 13% in the first seven months of this year.  Meanwhile, the country is seeing extraordinary reductions in the cost of large-scale solar power – 40% in a year – to the point where it is cheaper than domestic coal for the first time. There are questions over whether this is sustainable, but India has set an ambitious solar target of 100 gigawatts within five years. A draft national electricity plan released in December found no new coal-fired plants would be needed for a decade, and proposed coal plants with a capacity of 13.7GW – more than half Australia’s total coal fleet – were cancelled in May alone. What does this mean for the Carmichael mine? Goyal says India does not need it, but will use the coal. Tim Buckley, of the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis, says a two-week trip he took to India to meet energy executives and government officials suggested a different story. “There was almost zero discussion on Carmichael,” he says. “The project is not on the radar, not expected to happen, immaterial for India’s energy plans given the progressive move away from imported thermal coal and just unbankable for Indian banks given excessive Adani group debt.” India is not the only country rethinking the scale of its coal commitment. China has not cut imports – it is more focused on closing inefficient domestic mines – but its coal consumption peaked three years ago. It has an incredibly large fleet of generators likely to operate for decades to come, but they are running at less than 50% capacity. It cancelled 103GW of proposed coal-fired plants (more than twice the capacity of Australia’s east coast grid) this year. Government officials note what is happening – the chief scientist Alan Finkel’s independent review of Australia’s electricity security noted that China is diversifying its energy mix, India limiting imports and South Korea cutting coal power to reduce pollution – but this shift receives little clean air in the Australian political debate, where the Minerals Council is an influential player and the major parties are supportive of a long-term source of jobs and revenue.  Misinformation is rife. Peter Freyberg, the head of coal at the mining giant Glencore, claimed that the IEA had projected that fossil fuels would provide almost 70% of energy in 2030, even if the world got its act together to limit global warming to an increase of less than 2C. He was making a point about coal’s longevity but, in reality, the IEA paints a different picture. Yes, it estimates 64% of energy would come from fossil fuels in 2030 under this scenario – if you count electricity generation, industrial processes, transport, heating and cooking, and if you assume carbon capture and storage suddenly becomes viable. Even then, the biggest chunk would be expected to come from natural gas, which is considered a cleaner transitional fuel. The IEA found burning coal to generate electricity would decline sharply, with wind and solar providing more than half the world’s needs within 13 years. Traditional coal-fired power would be gone by mid-century.  Metallurgical coal is not expected to decline as quickly – in simple terms, there is not the readymade alternative to coal in steel manufacturing that there is in electricity generation. The IEA has forecast only a 15% drop in global trade of metallurgical coal by 2040 should the world deliver on the headline Paris agreement goals. Australia has about a fifth of the global market, and higher quality coal than many competitors, suggesting its market share should more or less hold up. As the government points out, Australia also offers higher quality thermal coal than its competitors. But Tony Wood, energy program director at the Grattan Institute, says the numbers are compelling even once this is factored in. “Malcolm Turnbull says coal will be part of the energy mix for the next several decades, and this is true, but it is a declining part of that mix,” Wood says. “We may have a bigger share, but it is still a bigger share of a declining market. Unless someone does something with carbon capture and storage – or the world turns away from acting on climate change, which doesn’t seem likely – this is not an industry with a long-term future.” • Support our independent journalism and critical reporting on energy and the environment by giving a one-off or monthly contribution"
"The embattled Commonwealth Bank is being sued by shareholders for what they say is a failure to properly disclose the risks to the business posed by climate change. The case will be the first anywhere in the world to test in court how companies are required to disclose climate change-related risks in their annual reports, and follows calls by shareholders, regulators and central banks around the world for greater clarity.  The papers were filed on Tuesday, after which the federal court will decide how the case should proceed. The claim, brought by lawyers at Environmental Justice Australia on behalf of Commonwealth Bank shareholders Guy and Kim Abrahams, says the bank’s 2016 directors’ report did not adequately inform investors of climate change risks. It also seeks an injunction to stop the bank making the same omissions in future annual reports. The move comes six months after the Australian financial regulator warned climate change poses a material risk to the entire financial system, and called for companies to report on climate change-related risks as financial risks. The sorts of risks the Commonwealth Bank might face as a result of climate change are diverse, said David Barnden, a lawyer at Environmental Justice Australia. “CBA has exposure to the Australian economy in general. We could be talking about anything from extractive projects to the housing market, which might face risks from sea level rise,” Barnden said. Reputational risks for the bank as the economy moves away from fossil fuels could also be significant, Barnden said, with the shareholders raising concerns about the bank’s position on funding Adani’s proposed Carmichael coalmine and associated infrastructure. “There is an aspect of the claim that looks at the reputational and financial risks the Carmichael mine might pose to the bank,” Barnden said. “We say that CBA ought to have known of those risks and should tell investors what its plans are with respect to the mine and if it is considering financially supporting the mine.” Another part of the claim focuses on the Commonwealth Bank not disclosing any climate-related risks as major or material risks. “When the bank talks about major or material risks to the bank, we say it should be talking about climate change,” said Banden. In February, Geoff Summerhayes from the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority, gave a speech saying that business needed to stop reporting on climate change as a purely ethical or environmental issue and begin seeing it as a financial problem. He said: “Like all risks, it is better they are explicitly considered and managed as appropriate, rather than simply ignored or neglected.” And in June, the G20’s Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures (TCFD), led by Bank of England governor Mark Carney and former mayor of New York City Michael Bloomberg, recommended banks disclose lending to companies with carbon-related risks. The report recommended banks and other organisations include climate-related risks in their audited annual financial statements. The proposals were supported by nearly 400 institutional investors controlling US$22tn in funds. Emma Herd, chief executive of the Investor Group on Climate Change in Australia, said putting climate-related risk into the heart of financial reporting means it is treated very differently by the company. “It means that you have a different level of internal governance processes, a higher degree of audit and scrutiny and you report the information in a much more robust and detailed way,” she said. “It’s stepping it up a notch in terms of how seriously companies treat the data.” Herd said a lot of companies – not just banks – would be watching the case for potential implications any decision might have for their reporting requirements. “For banks as well as all companies, this is an area that is moving very quickly,” Herd said. “And certainly from the investor perspective the bar keeps getting raised in terms of what is considered adequate disclosure in terms of climate-related financial risk.” The case focuses on sections 297 and 299A of the Corporations Act. Section 297 says annual financial statements must present a “true and fair view” of the financial position and performance of the company. Section 299A says the financial report must contain enough information to allow people to make an informed assessment of the company’s financial position, business strategies and future prospects. Guy Abrahams, one of the claimants and a chief executive of not-for-profit Climarte Inc, said in a statement: “We bought Commonwealth Bank shares more than 20 years ago as an investment in our children’s future. “We are deeply concerned about the serious risks climate change poses to the environment and society. The bank should tell investors about the risks climate change will have on its business.” The Commonwealth Bank has been contacted for comment."
"  The South Australian premier, Jay Weatherill, has renewed his warning that Labor-led state governments could go it alone on energy policy if the Turnbull government can’t resolve its internal battle over the clean energy target.  In an interview with Guardian Australia, Weatherill has also upped the ante by signalling the Labor states might look to collaborate on an alternative policy to the clean energy target recommended by the chief scientist if there is a better mechanism to provide certainty for investors and emissions reduction. Asked whether he was wedded to the chief scientist’s central recommendation in the event the states decided to break away and pursue their own policy, Weatherill said: “No, not really. If we are going to do it ourselves we might as well design the best system.” South Australia has long championed an emissions intensity trading scheme for the electricity sector – a form of carbon trading – but Weatherill fell into line behind Finkel’s clean energy target after the report was published in an effort to achieve national consensus. “For the sake of argument we were prepared to compromise and move away from the emissions intensity scheme to get the clean energy target,” the premier said. “We didn’t want to be bloody-minded about it just because it was something we had been promoting.” But Weatherill said he was concerned the Turnbull government was now intent on watering down the Finkel mechanism to include “clean” coal in the mix, which made him less wedded to the clean energy target proposal. The premier said it was important for the prime minister to stare down the current internal pressure to include coal in the clean energy target, because if Turnbull ceded ground on that point, it would be the first of many concessions. “What the prime minister needs to understand is this: you can’t do business with these people,” the premier said. “If you move away from an emissions intensity scheme to a clean energy target then they’ll want to change that to allow coal in. If you gave them that, the next question would be tear up Paris, and if [he] tore up Paris then they’d ask him to call a press conference and deny that he believes in climate change – they are insatiable. “There is no benefit for the prime minister in trying to placate his right wing, because they are incapable of being placated. “So what we need to do is just get on with the business of putting in the right energy policy.” Weatherill’s comments, in an interview with Guardian Australia’s politics live podcast, follow a decision by the Labor states and the Australian Capital Territory in July to ask the Australian Energy Markets Commission to conduct work on how they could go it alone in the event the Turnbull government dumped the clean energy target, or pursued a suboptimal policy. The Coalition has greenlit 49 of the 50 recommendations from the Finkel review but not the clean energy target because of internal divisions. The fight over energy policy is expected to return to the federal Coalition party room in September, once the government gets advice it has sought from the Australian Energy Market Operator about how to ensure the dispatchable power requirements of the electricity grid can be met when ageing coal-fired power stations leave the system. Weatherill said the best outcome remained a national approach to determining climate and energy policy, but the “national interest” also demanded a solution to the problem. The premier, who has been in the top job in the state since October 2011, is also facing a state election next March, with network reliability and high power prices a significant local issue. Labor has been office in SA since 2002. Weatherill said the Turnbull government’s decision to have a public spat with South Australia over its high proportion of wind energy had transformed the looming state political contest into a referendum on renewables. “On any view of it, this next state election is going to be seen as a referendum on renewable energy, because the prime minister has conditioned the South Australian experience as being idiocy and ideology and a dangerous experiment,” the premier said. “If we were to fail in the election it would be seen as a referendum and a cross against renewable energy.” Weatherill said Australia’s renewable energy industry was acutely conscious that the political contest in the SA state election was high-stakes. “I think a lot of people in the renewable energy sector, and people more generally who want to promote policies tackling climate change, understand that. We think that will be an important fulcrum in the state election.” Weatherill was asked whether, given the acute political sensitivity about high power prices, he felt he could prevail if the election was a referendum on the future of low-emissions energy. “Yes, absolutely, because people believe renewable energy is the future. “They also believe, in the long term, renewables put downward pressure on prices and I think they’ve seen the early evidence of that.”"
"Deaths from weather disasters could increase 50-fold in Europe by the start of the next century if no action is taken to reduce greenhouse gas emissions or protect citizens, researchers have warned. A new study estimates a toll of 152,000 deaths a year between 2071 and 2100 as a direct result of hazards relating to extreme weather, with those living in southern Europe likely to be the hardest hit.   “Governments and policies should be focused more on designing suitable adaptation measures,” said Giovanni Forzieri, a co-author of the study from the European Commission Joint Research Centre in Italy. “If no adaptation measures [are] taken, these estimates are really alarming.” Writing in the journal Lancet Planetary Health, Forzieri and colleagues describe how they used state-of-the art predictions to explore how often and where seven types of weather disasters – including heatwaves, wildfires and floods – are likely to occur across Europe in the coming years if no action on global warming is taken.  The analysis also used large datasets from disasters in recent years to calculate a fixed value of human vulnerability for different weather events, and incorporated projections on how populations were likely to change. Looking at the impact on Europeans over 30-year intervals, the team found that two in three people in Europe could be affected by weather-related disasters annually by the period 2071-2100 – an estimated 351 million people. By contrast, between 1981 and 2010, 25 million people were exposed – just 5% of Europe’s population.  What’s more, the number of deaths is expected to increase 50-fold by 2100, reaching an estimated 152,000 deaths a year – up from 3,000 a year between 1981 and 2010. Those living in southern Europe, including Italy, Spain and the south of France, are predicted to be the hardest hit with about a 64-fold increase in deaths.  This rise, say researchers, is largely down to heatwaves, with the phenomenon expected to account for 99% of the additional deaths.  Overall, more than 90% of the increased risk to Europeans, the authors say, is down to an increase in the frequency and severity of weather events as a result of climate change. The remaining 10% is a result of population growth and migration; for example, increased numbers living in coastal regions likely to flood – a problem particularly in Slovenia, Ireland and Norway.  “Population change will play only a marginal role compared to climate change [in increasing risk],” said Forzieri, adding that historically the reverse was true. But, Forzieri notes, the analysis does not take into account indirect effects on public health, warning that problems ranging from cardiovascular disease to mental health disorders could become more prevalent, while pressures on health services and other resources could also take their toll.  Weather-related disasters, the authors add, are also likely to disproportionately affect the sick, poor and elderly – a factor they say is a concern given the ageing population across Europe. Indeed, Forzieri says, the reality could be even more dire. “Our scenario is not the worst one we could choose – it is the medium scenario of greenhouse gas emissions,” he said.  The authors stress that the research highlights the importance of the Paris climate agreement, adding that improved city planning and public awareness are crucial. But David Alexander, professor of risk and disaster reduction at University College, London, said the study took too simplistic a view. “I don’t think we are in any way capable of predicting what death tolls as a result of weather-related hazards will be by the end of the century, because there are so many other factors, which in this study are not taken into account, that will have a direct bearing on the figures,” he said. In particular, Alexander pointed out the study assumed a straightforward relationship between the number of people exposed to a disaster and the number of deaths, to calculate vulnerability. “Whether you are in the way or not doesn’t actually determine whether [an event] kills you or not,” said Alexander. “[Vulnerability] is dependant on a whole mass of things.”  Paul Wilkinson, professor of environmental epidemiology at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, described the study as a “thought experiment” but welcomed the research. “While the analysis only considered extreme events, and assumed no reduction in human vulnerability over time from adaptation, it is yet another reminder of the exposures to extreme weather and possible human impacts that might occur if emissions of greenhouse gases continue unabated,” he said."
"The global effort to confront climate change was hobbled for many years by the mistaken idea that only national governments and international rules could solve the problem. The Paris agreement, which recognizes and supports voluntary carbon-reduction efforts by cities, regions and businesses, was an important step in the right direction. Ironically, no one has done more to demonstrate the agreement’s strengths than its most prominent critic: Donald Trump. Last week, the Trump administration formally notified the UN of its intention to withdraw from the Paris agreement. It was an empty gesture, because no party can actually withdraw until November 2020 (right after the next US presidential election). What matters is this: the US is on pace to reach the commitment we made under the agreement – and there is nothing Washington can do to stop us. Over the past decade, the US has led the world in reducing carbon emissions. In that time, the US Congress has never passed a single law directly aimed at climate change.  The central climate-related regulation adopted by the Obama administration – a carbon emission standard for power plants – was put on hold by the courts and never even went into effect. And yet we are already about halfway to our Paris goal of reducing carbon emissions by at least 26% by 2025. That progress has happened because cities, states, business and citizens all recognize the health and economic benefits of action. And they are not slowing down now. In fact, the biggest impact of Trump’s withdrawal from the Paris agreement has been to accelerate those efforts and improve public understanding of their central role in fighting climate change.  Take cities, which are home to the majority of the world’s people for the first time in human history. Mayors understand that the same steps that reduce carbon emissions also make cities better places to live and work – and where people want to live, businesses want to invest. Mass transit, parks and trees, and less traffic congestion all reduce air pollution and carbon emissions, while helping cities to grow.  Globally, cities account for about 70% of carbon emissions. That makes them the bulk of the problem, but they are also the source of the most effective solutions. In New York City, we were able to reduce emissions by 19% in just six years, while also outpacing the nation in job growth. Mayors around the world, from across the political spectrum, are increasing their use of clean energy sources, such as wind and solar, which is now often cheaper than fossil fuels.  Since the Trump administration announced its intent to withdraw from the Paris agreement, more than 2,500 US cities, states, businesses and universities have signed a letter reaffirming their commitment to the agreement’s goals. Bloomberg Philanthropies is helping lead an effort – we call it “America’s Pledge” – to measure the collective potential of all these groups to reduce their carbon emissions.  Just as every nation has done, we will create a clear and transparent report to account for these efforts, and show how they help us to fulfill the pledge we made in Paris. These reports will be made available to the UN and the parties to the Paris agreement. We’ll also work with our partners to draw up a blueprint for how each group can accelerate their progress, despite current inaction by the federal government. That includes helping cities access financing for green infrastructure and developing regional policies that encourage investment in clean energy.  Under the leadership of Governor Jerry Brown, the state of California – by itself the world’s sixth-largest economy – recently announced a commitment to getting 60% of its energy from clean sources and strengthened its cap-and-trade system for carbon emissions. Other states can follow suit. There is also more action coming from the private sector. Until recently it has been hard for businesses to measure the potential financial impacts they face from climate change, which makes them difficult to prevent and reduces incentives to address the problem. It also makes it hard for investors to know which companies are most vulnerable to climate risk and which are taking action.  Last year, I was asked by the Bank of England governor, Mark Carney, to chair a global Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures to help close this data gap, by creating financial standards for measuring and reporting climate risks. We recently released a set of recommendations and are working to help more companies adopt them.  National pledges under the Paris agreement assume involvement from national governments – but the fact is, in the US, progress on climate change has always been driven from the bottom up. More help from Washington would be helpful and welcome, but cities, states and businesses aren’t waiting for it.  The benefits of action – and the risks of inaction – are too great."
"Night herons are among the most mysterious of birds, and for the first time in recorded history they have been spotted breeding in the UK. Long-distance photographs captured an adult pair of black-crowned herons and one of their two offspring at the Westhay Moor national nature reserve, run by Somerset Wildlife Trust. The young birds have recently fledged, having been born either on Westhay Moor or the nearby Avalon Marshes.  The night heron (Nycticorax nycticorax) is unusual among the heron family in hunting for fish and frogs at night. They roost during the day and can only usually be spotted at dawn and dusk.  “This is incredible news,” said Stephen Moss, president of Somerset Wildlife Trust. “To put it in perspective, when I was a young birder in the 1970s, just two species of heron bred in Britain – the grey heron and the bittern. But these night herons are now the seventh member of their family to nest in the Avalon Marshes.” These include both cranes and glossy ibis.  “I am sure climate change has drawn them north, but equally wetland restoration has been a massive success,” he said. “We have created an incredible habitat.” Ornithologists will now wait to see if the night heron becomes established in the UK. “They may hang around, if there is enough food. If not they will probably nip back to France or Spain,” Moss said. Roger Dickey, chairman of Somerset Ornithological Society, said: “This is obviously terribly exciting news. Night herons are one of southern England’s rarer summer visitors and only a dozen or so have been reported in Somerset since 1800. Prime breeding areas do not happen by accident and all organisations and individuals that help to manage this type of habitat are [to be] congratulated.” Purple herons were first reported as successfully breeding in the UK in 2010, on the Dungeness peninsula, Kent, and have since been seen in Essex. Although global warming appears to be beneficial for herons in the UK, a recent report found it is harming sea birds, such as puffins, fulmars, terns and razorbills, as the fish they rely on are driven north or deeper as waters warm."

"George Monbiot’s call to reconsider how we name things (Forget ‘the environment’. Fight for our living planet, 9 August) is a timely contribution to a confusing world. But one word that both he and the majority of online contributors have ignored is “prosperity”. That, after all, is why humans engage in economic activity: they believe it will make things better. There is, however, a fundamental problem with the way we have arranged our economic affairs. By treating the natural world as an infinite thing, “external” to the economy (except as a never-ending supply of resources) we have built a massive endeavour to take natural resources and make them into things that are then disposed of, generally after a fairly brief period of human enjoyment. Everyone I speak to readily accepts that under this system the planet must eventually “run out”, but they cannot see an alternative to “prosperity”. The conversation we need to have is not how we name things but how we do things.  Margaret Thatcher’s speech to the UN general assembly in 1989 recognised that human economic activity was having a fundamental impact on our planet but somehow failed to recognise that all these activities are driven by incentives. In the rich, polluting world the survival incentive has long been replaced by the prosper incentive, but our rules of economy still behave as if we can have it all despite a population level almost 20 times that of when the rules were derived. Earth Overshoot Day for 2017 fell on 2 August. For the rest of this year our economy is using up the reserves of the natural world, yet we continue to subsidise the use of fossil fuels to the tune of $5tn (Climate Consensus – the 97%, theguardian.com, 7 August). Adam Smith observed that man’s desire to improve his lot is a powerful one: aspiration is a real human need. But if the economy really is going to deliver prosperity, we need one that can work with the natural world rather than one that consumes it, whatever it is called.Harold ForbesWareham, Dorset • George Monbiot has issued a timely reminder that we need new words to describe our natural world and the growing threats to it. The incessant use of impenetrable language risks spawning public apathy instead of reverence for nature and passion to act. Nowhere is this greater than in a post-EU world where the names of the vital tools that protect our air, water and wildlife – directives, preambles and statutory instruments – mean little to most of us. The government’s long-awaited 25-year environment plan and parliamentary bills on farming and fisheries provide an early opportunity to change the narrative. Will they seize this generational opportunity to set us on a new path of reconnection with our natural world, or will they see us retreat into the familiar bastion of techno-speak? I’m hoping for the former.Ruth ChambersLondon  • One way to encourage a language full of “natural wonder” would be to move the wonderful Country Diary from the back of the paper to the editorial pages, where more readers would encounter it.Alison LeonardHebden Bridge, West Yorkshire • For once I find myself in total agreement with the Trump administration (US federal workers are told: stop saying ‘climate change’, 8 August). Phrases such as “climate change” and “global warming” are scientifically misleading, giving an entirely inaccurate impression. I would certainly ban them and insist on the use of phrases such as “global overheating”, “climate crisis”, “world on fire” and “impending disaster” as giving a much truer representation of what’s really going on.Charles HarrisLondon • Re the US Department of Agriculture’s instruction to avoid “climate change” in favour of “weather extremes”, this brings back memories of when, some years ago on the TV show Three of a Kind, Lenny Henry commented that, as part of the attempt to rebuild the appalling reputation of Windscale, it was to be renamed Sellafield “because it sounds nicer. And in future, radiation will be known as magic moonbeams.”Danny TanzeyThornton Cleveleys, Lancashire • Trump’s government is not alone in its use of euphemisms. In England the government’s project to introduce a scheme of private health insurance is labelled “NHS reform”. And the associated project to slash, trash and privatise our health service has to be called “sustainability and transformation partnerships”. Just this morning I’ve seen an advertisement for a health conference where colleagues from Cumbria will describe “improving patient journeys across their STP footprint”. I assume that the ambulance service across the fells will be improved, though I worry about a surge in fractured metatarsals.Kevin DonovanBirkenhead, Merseyside • Instruction to all government departments: Replace “cuts in services” with “efficiency savings”.Leslie GilbertLondon  • Join the debate – email guardian.letters@theguardian.com • Read more Guardian letters – click here to visit gu.com/letters"
"In a global first, Australian mum-and-dad shareholders Guy and Kim Abrahams have launched a case against the Commonwealth Bank, arguing that the bank has breached the law by not disclosing the risks climate change poses to its business. Buying their shares over 20 years ago, Guy and Kim were making “an investment in their children’s futures”. A climate-changed world of financial risk, social upheaval and environmental degradation is clearly not the future they signed up for. Climate change is an immediate threat to the entire global financial system. This was the ominous warning that came from the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority earlier this year. And they’re taking it seriously, declaring that they’ll be stress-testing the Australian financial system to force the financial sector to do more to transition to a clean economy. They’re right to do so. Climate change is the “tragedy of the horizon,” governor of the Bank of England Mark Carney warned in a landmark speech in Berlin last year.  “We don’t need an army of actuaries to tell us that the catastrophic impacts of climate change will be felt beyond the traditional horizons of most actors – imposing a cost on future generations that the current generation has no direct incentive to fix”, he said. As Mr Carney predicted, despite the scale and urgency of the climate crisis and popular support for climate action, governments and financiers are failing to act.  However, international pressure and momentum is growing for corporations to declare and appropriately deal with the risks that climate change presents to the value of their assets and their future profitability. The Asset Owners Disclosure Project (AODP), which I chaired, has led the world debate by surveying, rating, and ranking the world’s 500 largest investors on climate-risk management with the AODP global climate index over the last decade.  Funds are rated from AAA through to D grade, with an extra X category being added for those funds at the bottom that appear to be doing absolutely nothing to manage this critical risk. This year, the fifth AODP global climate 500 index found that the scales have finally tipped. A 60% majority of asset owners, including pension funds, sovereign wealth funds, insurance companies, foundations and endowments, and half of asset managers, including Deutsche Asset Management and HSBC Global Asset Management, are now taking action to manage the risks and opportunities posed by climate change. Institutional investors are growing increasingly impatient with companies dragging their heels. Earlier this year BlackRock Inc, the world’s largest asset manager with about US$5.1tn under management announced, “Investors can no longer ignore climate change”.  “Ultimately the board is responsible for protecting the long-term economic interests of shareholders and we may vote against the re-election of certain directors where we believe they have not fulfilled that duty” BlackRock said. This echoes statements by APRA’s Geoff Summerhayes earlier this year that directors will be individually responsible for failing to appropriately manage climate change risks, following the release of an influential opinion by barrister Noel Hutely SC. Mr Hutely found that company directors who fail to properly consider and disclose foreseeable climate-related risks to their business could be held personally liable for breaching their statutory duty of due care and diligence under the Corporations Act, warning it’s “only a matter of time” before we see this sort of litigation against a director. And at the G20 summit last month, Bank of England governor Mark Carney released the final report of the Michael Bloomberg-led task force on climate-related financial disclosure. “Warming of the planet caused by greenhouse gas emissions poses serious risks to the global economy and will have an impact across many economic sectors,” Bloomberg said to Carney in a letter that introduced the report. “It is difficult for investors to know which companies are most at risk from climate change, which are best prepared, and which are taking action.” National regulators in the US and UK are weighing in too, investigating large companies for failing to disclose the risk of climate change to their businesses.  In 2015, the New York attorney general launched an investigation into ExxonMobil. Attorney generals in numerous US states and the US Securities and Exchange Commission have since joined this investigation or launched their own. In the UK, the Financial Reporting Council has opened an examination into whether two oil and gas exploration companies listed on the London Stock Exchange have made adequate risk disclosures in their annual reports. As public outrage continues to intensify over the Commonwealth Bank’s refusal to rule out funding the Adani mine, we should hope that with this case the bank will finally start taking climate change seriously. Not with blustering statements or carefully stage-managed greenwashing, but with real decisive action to protect its shareholders – and the broader community – from the devastation that will come if they fail to do so. This case should come as no surprise to the boards or CEOs of banks, or indeed anyone who’s been paying attention to which way the wind is blowing in the financial sector. Banks, investors and super funds have a choice: step up on climate change today and become leaders, or face similar action as more shareholders step forward to take them on over their failure to act. By stepping up on climate risk, the financial sector has the opportunity to ensure the smooth transition of our economy to prepare it for the oncoming threat of climate catastrophe.  By doing so, we may just avert the financial chaos that will come if action is left too late."
"Adani’s proposed Carmichael coalmine in Queensland would be the largest Australia has ever seen and the federal and state governments are keen to offer it financial support. Adani has said that over a 60-year lifetime, the company expects to extract 2.3bn tonnes of coal, which would make it equivalent to the biggest mine in the US. It is proposed to have six open-cut pits as well as five underground mines, with a disturbance area more than 30km long. The company initially obtained approval to remove 60m tonnes of coal each year, but has scaled back its ambition to an initial production rate of 25m tonnes a year. But building the mine would have a much wider indirect effect. Carmichael would be the first mine in the giant untapped Galilee coal basin. The infrastructure that would be built to allow extraction of coal from the Carmichael mine could serve at least 10 more. If all the mines mooted for the basin were built and reached their proposed maximum output at the same time, they would be producing 330m tonnes of coal a year – more than Australia’s entire coal industry does now. Industry consultant Wood Mackenzie has estimated that about half that might actually be extracted in any one year. The government’s Northern Australia Infrastructure Fund is considering an A$900m subsidised loan and Matt Canavan, who was responsible for that fund until stepping aside as resources minister last month, has repeatedly stated his strong support for the project. The Queensland state government has made a deal with Adani, offering it a break on its royalty payments for the coal it extracts – but the details are secret.  A wide range of groups are opposed to the project for different reasons. Climate: If the mine does extract all the coal Adani says it plans to, the average emissions from burning that coal will amount to about 77m tonnes of CO2 each year. And if the mine reaches its touted peak production rate of 60m tonnes a year, it will be responsible for more than 120m tonnes of CO2 emissions in those years – more than the annual emissions of many countries. If the mine goes ahead and that leads to the development of other mines in the basin, their potential combined maximum output would result in more than 705m tonnes of CO2 being emitted each year. That’s about 1.3 times Australia’s total current emissions. If even half that were produced it would result in emissions larger than those of most nations. If the world wants to have a 50% chance of keeping global warming at less than 2C above pre-industrial levels, 88% of the world’s known coal reserves need to stay in the ground. In the Asia-Pacific region, more than 90% of coal needs to stay in the ground, according to research published in Nature. Coal burned in other countries is not counted in Australia’s emissions – coal from Carmichael would be exported to India – but many scientists and commentators have pointed out that producing those emissions runs counter to Australia’s commitment in the Paris climate agreement to work to keep global warming at “well below” 2C. Water: Among the most pressing environmental concerns with the Carmichael mine, aside from climate change, is its reliance on water, a precious resource in Australia. Coal mining uses a lot of water for everything from cooling cutting equipment in underground mines through to transporting coal as a slurry in pipelines. About 250 litres of freshwater is used for each tonne of coal produced. In April the Queensland government granted Adani a highly unusual water licence to extract unlimited amounts from a water body that feeds into the underground Great Artesian Basin. Adani itself has estimated it will use 12bn litres of water a year – or 13 Olympic swimming pools a day. The licence acknowledges this will “have an impact on the underground water levels in the region of the mine” both during and after the mine’s planned years of operation. As that water level drops, farmers’ bores could run dry and unique ecological communities in the region that rely on the natural springs may be destroyed. Environmentalists and farmers have complained that there are no “trigger thresholds” that will force mining to stop if Carmichael uses too much water. Impacts on the Great Barrier Reef: Environmental groups have worked hard to link the development of the Carmichael mine to the destruction of the reef. Over the past two years, half the coral on the reef has been killed in bleaching events caused by rising water temperatures, mostly a result of climate change. Scientists have said that for coral reefs to have any chance of a future, global warming must be stopped at 1.5C. Even if that could be achieved, coral reefs would be severely degraded. So to the extent that coal from the mine contributes to global warming, it is a threat to the reef. But the mine will also have a more direct impact, since the coal will be exported to India via a shipping terminal on the Queensland coast at Abbot Point, opposite the reef, increasing the risks of collisions, spills and excessive coal dust harming corals. The terminal will be expanded to accommodate coal from the Carmichael mine, which will involve dredging. This is notoriously problematic for surrounding coral, since it stirs up sediment, which degrades water quality and starves coral of sunlight. Adani’s reputation: A report by Environmental Justice Australia detailed a long list of allegations of environmental damage caused by Adani Enterprises and its subsidiaries around the world. And a more recent report by the same group detailed evidence in support of allegations of illegal business dealings, which EJA says points to involvement in large-scale illegal mineral exports and violations of Indian environmental laws that harmed the environment and communities. The most common reason given by Australian politicians for supporting the Carmichael mine is jobs – but other arguments are raised in support of it too. Jobs: Queensland’s unemployment rate is at 6.4%, and higher in some regional areas. So 10,000 jobs, as Adani, Australian prime minister Malcolm Turnbull and others have said the project will provide, are a strong motivation to support the project. But that “10,000 jobs” figure is pulled from Adani’s publicity material, and is contradicted by testimony in a Queensland court, given by consultants for Adani. Jerome Fahrer from ACIL Allen Consulting submitted an analysis on behalf of Adani estimating the project would create just 1,464 jobs. And that figure is an estimate over the lifetime of the project, assuming it reaches maximum capacity, extracting 60m tonnes of coal a year. But according to Wood Mackenzie, the jobs in Queensland would come at the expense of mining jobs elsewhere. In a report for the Infrastructure Fund, which has coal investments in the neighbouring state of New South Wales, it found coal-producing basins in NSW and southern Queensland would cut their production by more than a third, due to a drop in coal prices, if Carmichael opened. It also found 10 new projects that would otherwise go ahead in NSW would no longer be profitable. Alleviating poverty: Australian ministers have argued that coal from Adani’s Carmichael mine will help lift people in India out of poverty, since it will be used to generate electricity in a country where many people have no access to power. Australia’s minister for the environment and energy, Josh Frydenberg, has said the mine will help “lift hundreds of millions of people out of energy poverty, not just in India but right across the world”. It is true that about 75m rural households and 6m urban households in India have no power. But burning more coal won’t help the vast majority of those people, since they don’t have a connection to the electricity grid. Access to the grid is too expensive for most of those people, making off-grid renewable generation a much more realistic option for alleviating energy poverty. The Indian government is aware of this, with plans to stop importing coal altogether. And its energy policies have been driving the cost of solar to record lows."
