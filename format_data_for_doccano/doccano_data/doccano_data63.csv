UPDATE 4 Oct 2019: https://www.climatedepot.com/2019/10/04/watch-aoc-duped-by-climate-trolls-unbelievable-plea-to-eat-the-babies/
==============================
There’s little doubt among the many cooler skeptic heads that the global climate change movement has gone off the rails in terms of sanity, and continues to do so in a spectacular fashion.
The madness has arrived.
The latest example is presented to us by Ryan Saavedra of the Daily Caller. One of AOC’s constituents hysterically claims that eating humans, as suggested by one Swedish professor, isn’t going to cut it when it comes to rescuing the planet. Her solution:
“We need to eat the babies!”

One of Ocasio-Cortez's constituents loses her mind over climate change during AOC's townhall, claims we only have a few months left: ""We got to start eating babies! We don't have enough time! …  We have to get rid of the babies! … We need to eat the babies!"" pic.twitter.com/uVmOnboluI

First, if I were a policeperson, I’d certainly would look to see if that insane woman might be missing any kids, or if her neighbors are missing any – seriously. If not, that poor woman needs psychiatric care very quickly.
One thing we note when we scan the faces in the crowd, is that they don’t show even an inkling of happiness at all. They are all frozen in depression, frustration and anger. If you’re in a good, happy mood, then standing less than 30 seconds in that room will change that. The hysterical woman shows that things are progressing from depression and anger to insanity.
How can people allow themselves to be talked nto depression, and later a level of insanity put on display by Ms. Baby-Eater?
It shouldn’t surprise us that when people like Greta and the lunatic media spread all the panic and fan the flames of irrationality, it’s just a question of time before those already on the fringes start falling off the deep end and potentially become a real danger.
Ms. Baby-Eater herself likely used to be one of those depressed, angry faces in the crowd. Then enter Greta and the media.
It’s also astonishing that AOC fields the question and comments as if it were a legitimate one. She should have simply just called the woman’s rant for what is was: utter lunacy. But then again, we live in times where very-late term abortions are okay!
I suspect this is just the beginning. Never underestimate the potential of human insanity, especially when it’s claimed to be backed by “science”. History is filled with such monumental tragedies.
It’s time to take the kooks out of the solution-making and handing that responsibility over to cooler heads.

Share this...FacebookTwitterInstead of inundation from sea level rise, 80% of assessed Florida Bay (USA) islands grew in area during 1953-2014, prototyping a global-scale trend in island resistance to rising seas.

Image Source: Zhai et al., 2019
Back in 1989, the United Nations issued a dire warning: either reverse the ongoing global warming by the year 2000, or “entire nations could be wiped off the face of the Earth by rising sea levels” and “coastal regions will be inundated“.
The U.N. specifically referenced Bangladesh’s looming fate, forecasting coastal flooding will dispace 23 million Bangladeshi people.
Now, forty years later, we can assess the effect global warming has had on Bangladesh.
From 1985 to 2015, not only did the coastal regions avoid inundation from rising sea levels, Bangladesh’s coastal land area grew at a pace of 7.9 km² per year during this span!

Image Source(s): AP News (1989) and Ahmed et al., (2018)
The trend in stable or growing coastal land area amid rising seas has not just been limited to Bangladesh. Indeed, the overall expansion of coastlines for both islands and mainlands has been global in scope.

Between 1985 and 2015, for example, satellite observations indicated the world’s coasts gained 13,565 km²  more land area than they had lost to the seas. This surprised scientists, as they “expected the coast would start to retreat due to sea level rise,” but instead they observed “coasts are growing all over the world.”

Image Source(s): Donchyts et al., 2016 and BBC (press release)
An analysis of 709 islands from across the globe revealed that no island larger than 10 ha (~25 acres) – which includes the “vulnerable” Maldives, Tuvalu, Fiji, etc. – has decreased in size since the 1980s. In fact, 89% of islands assessed are stable or growing.

Image Source: Duvat et al., 2019
A new paper assessing the area of 15 Florida Bay islands between 1953 and 2014 finds 12 of the 15 grew in size during this timespan, which is consistent with the global trend.
The authors are keen to point out that much of this expansion can be attributed to heavy mangrove forest growth. They apparently don’t view mangrove expansion as a positive development (an “unhelpful resiliance”) due to the tendencies for mangroves to crowd out non-mangrove habitats.
Regardless, Zhai et al. (2019) adds to the growing body of evidence indicating rising seas haven’t been the inundation disaster threat they’ve been made out to be for the last 40 years.
Zhai et al., 2019
Remote sensing of unhelpful resilience to sea level rise caused by
mangrove expansion: A case study of islands in Florida Bay, USA
“To estimate the resilience influences on 15 islands in Florida Bay (Florida, U.S.), our study used indicators (areas of the 15 islands and their mangrove forests) by analyzing 61-yr high-resolution historical aerial photographs and a 27-yr time-series of Landsat images.”
“Comparative spatial analysis of the historical aerial images showed that the island area significantly increased from 1953 to 2014. For example, Joe Kemp Key had the largest area increase from 0.34 km2 to 0.37 km2. Moreover, the similar increased patterns of island area were found for annual total areas of the 15 islands from 1984 to 2011 by analysis of Landsat images. The total areas showed a significant increasing pattern with time. Therefore, results from the analysis of both aerial and satellite images revealed increases in island area, which indicate the island resilience to inundation caused by SLR. However, three islands […] decreased in area.”
“The long-term island area increases estimated by our analysis supported the resilience of Florida Bay islands to SLR inundation. Moreover, both the positive relationship between the increases of island area and mangrove expansion, and previous field studies in the Florida Bay and nearby Caribbean mangroves suggested the contribution of the mangrove expansion were at the expense of non-mangrove habitats.”

Image Source: Brown et al., 2019
This new paper  is an expansion of the research conducted by the same lead author in 2011 (Brown et al.). Brown and colleagues concluded a growth in coral cover is positively correlated with rising sea levels. The authors further suggest “the overall picture for these shallow coral reefs is a positive one” due to rising sea levels and rapid recovery rates.

Image Source: Brown et al., 2011
Another new study (Zinke et al., 2019) indicates there is no correlation between coral growth rates (calcification, skeletal density) and long-term (since 1910) changes in sea surface temperatures. In other words, a regional warming trend in the tropical Atlantic has not been associated with a decline in coral cover.

"Australia’s greenhouse gas emissions continue to rise despite the Morrison government claiming it is taking “sensible, responsible action” to address the climate crisis, the latest official data shows. National emissions increased by 3.1m tonnes in the year to March to reach 538.9m tonnes, a 0.6% jump on the previous year, the report released on Friday revealed. Carbon dioxide emissions from electricity generation continue to decrease, reflecting the falling cost of solar and wind energy, but this is being more than cancelled out by the growth in emissions from the liquefied natural gas (LNG) export industry, mostly in northern Western Australia. Emissions from LNG were up 4.7m tonnes over the year. The report, published by the environment department, does not include a graph that shows the change in annual emissions over time, preferring instead analyses that suggest Australia’s carbon footprint is improving based on per capita and per dollar of GDP calculations. The graphs below are independently derived from the official data. Total national emissions have increased each year since the government abolished a national carbon price in 2014. The increase in emissions according to official data was not as great as forecast by the private emissions-tracking organisation Ndevr Environmental, which suggested electricity emissions had started to increase again. The emissions reduction minister, Angus Taylor, said emissions fell by 0.4% in the March quarter compared with the previous quarter. Taylor said if LNG exports were excluded Australia’s emissions would have declined by 0.3% over the year and stressed the economic benefit of the LNG industry. Gas exports increased by 18.8% last year and were estimated to be worth $47.8bn. Taylor also repeated his claim that Australia’s LNG emissions have the potential to cut global emissions by up to 152m tonnes a year by replacing coal for electricity generation in parts of Asia. As the Guardian has reported, this figure is based on a back-of-envelope calculation and not an analysis of whether gas is being used to replace coal. The evidence that is available suggests gas is often not replacing coal. The government’s office of the chief economist last month advised that in Japan, Australia’s biggest LNG market, gas is increasingly competed with zero-emissions nuclear and renewable power. The report shows emissions increased in most parts of the economy. They were up from stationary energy (including manufacturing, construction and commercial sectors), transport, fugitive emissions from coal seams and natural gas production, industrial processes, the waste industry and land use including forestry. They were down in electricity generation and agriculture, the latter mostly due to a decline in livestock caused by the drought. Labor’s climate change spokesperson, Mark Butler, said the increase in emissions was no surprise given the government’s plan to address it was to spend another $2bn on the “failed” emissions reduction fund introduced under former prime minister Tony Abbott. He said government projections showed emissions were expected to increase until 2030 under current policies. “Australians have come to expect this from a government that is not serious on taking real action on climate change,” he said. Greens climate change spokesperson, Adam Bandt, said Australia was “on a collision course with climate disaster”. “When excluding unreliable land use data, it is the highest twelve months of pollution in Australia’s history,” he said. Matt Rose, an economist with the Australian Conservation Foundation, said burning coal and gas was the main driver of the climate crisis and Australia was now the number one exporter of both. He said Australia’s stance was completely inconsistent with the global energy transition needed to meet targets met at the 2015 Paris summit. “The federal government will need to explain to the world how it intends to meet its Paris targets when the international community meets in New York in September for the UN secretary-general’s summit on climate action,” he said."
"This year marks the 200th anniversary of the birth of Eunice Foote, a pioneer in climate research of whom few people have heard. She showed that water vapour and carbon dioxide helped to heat Earth’s atmosphere, and realised that when the atmosphere had higher levels of carbon dioxide it made the climate much warmer.Her work was presented in August 1856 at a prestigious scientific conference in the US, but had to be given by a male colleague because women were not allowed to give talks at the meeting. Her study was not even included in the conference proceedings, although a summary of the talk appeared in a report about the meeting a year later.In 1859, the renowned physicist John Tyndall, working in London, demonstrated how certain gases such as carbon dioxide and water vapour in the atmosphere warmed the climate – what later became known as the greenhouse effect. He made no mention of Foote in his research and whether he did not know of her work or deliberately ignored it remains unknown. But Tyndall’s experiments became widely accepted as a cornerstone of work on the greenhouse effect. Despite Foote’s insights, her contribution to climate research became a footnote in history and is only now starting to come to light.  "
"Kimberley Mullings has seen a lot of hurricanes. In 2016 the roof of her family’s home, in Grand Bahama, was torn off by Hurricane Matthew. But she has never experienced anything like Hurricane Dorian. “There is no way you can compare this to any storm I’ve been through before,” she said over the phone from Grand Bahama, where she is holed up at her mother’s house waiting for the storm to pass. “The wind speed is ferocious. It’s vicious, that’s the only way I can describe it. You can’t sleep because you don’t want something to happen to you in your sleep.” Dorian has the strongest landfall wind speed of any Atlantic hurricane on record and crashed across the island of Grand Bahama, east of Florida, more than 24 hours ago before settling over the island. As of the early hours of Tuesday morning, it had not moved for more than 12 hours, meaning for that entire time the same communities had been lashed relentlessly by winds of up to 155mph (250km/h), enduring storm surges of up to 5.5 metres (18ft) above normal tide level. “Think about one of your worst nightmares and that there is nothing you can do,” said Mullings, 27, who lives in North Carolina, but travelled home to be with her mother and niece when she heard about the storm. “There is nothing you could have done to have prepared for a storm like this.” Her family did what they could to prepare for Dorian’s arrival. They have a generator so still have electricity, though their water has also been cut off. They have provided shelter to 12 people, including family friends. They put down sandbags and tied down anything they thought could have become a missile. Even with all all these preparations, they are still not sure if their home will bear up against the unprecedented winds. “We’ve seen trees snap, literally snap,” said Mullings. “We’ve seen pots with plants that are really heavy – 80lbs [36kg] – moving. We have seen cars crash into each other because of the wind speed and the flooding.” Despite their garage being classified as being able to withstand hurricanes, she can hear and see it flex in the wind. “You know how you breathe in and out, imagine a door coming in and out like that. We can see that, we can hear it. We have hurricane impact doors and windows and we can still see the blinds move. The doors are shut, these lock in five places … they’re properly insulated and they’re still moving.” Mullings is lucky. Her home is in one of the few parts of Grand Bahama that hasn’t experienced flooding. She has friends who live in two and three-storey homes on the island, where the water has risen so high they have been forced to wait out the storm in their roof spaces. “Some of them have babies, newborn babies, children, who are in the roof with them. Their entire families are waiting it out with them. Some of them are wet.” Several shelters, including one for people with special needs, have been compromised, she said, forcing people to take shelter in the hospital, which she has heard has also experienced serious flooding. “The police can’t do anything. Their vehicles are all under water. Fire trucks are under water. It’s a pretty scary situation to be in. No one can come to help and you can’t leave to get anywhere.” Mullings is already thinking ahead to what this hurricane, the latest in a run of devastating storms, will mean for the Bahamas. “I have great concerns about what it means for the country moving forward,” she said. “Every time we try to make a comeback we have another storm.” For now all she, and the other 52,000 people on Grand Bahama, can do is wait for Dorian to finally move on."
"Being arrested in the Italian port of Lampedusa drew a lot of media attention on me personally this summer as a young woman and a sea captain whose vessel, the Sea-Watch 3, had rescued 40 people from the Mediterranean and taken them to safety. My arrest came after two weeks at sea attempting to secure a political solution so we could legally land these refugees from the civil war in Libya. My ship entered Italian waters despite an order from Matteo Salvini, the far-right interior minister, so in the media I became the woman who defied the right in Italy and Europe.  I’m still under investigation by the Italian authorities (although a judge overturned my arrest because I was trying to save lives) but am I worried? Honestly, no, because my actions were justified. What I’m really scared of is the damage we are doing to our planet, and the hostility that may be unleashed against those fleeing drought, famine, fires and storms. To me, the dangers of climate breakdown and the need to help those trying to cross the Mediterranean are intimately linked. A lot of people are understandably worried about discussing the links between migration and the climate crisis, fearing it will lead to more xenophobia and even tougher border policies. The thing is, this xenophobia and these hard border policies are already here. I have seen them with my own eyes, in the people I’ve pulled from the sea – and in those I was too late to save. Climate breakdown exacerbates the reasons people already have for needing to migrate, such as desperate socioeconomic conditions or political oppression. In situations where people already struggle to survive, climate breakdown intensifies the pressure, whether through rising sea levels, water shortages, storm damage or crop failures. People living in the most disadvantaged places on Earth – who have contributed the least to the climate crisis – are also the first to face its effects. The devastating storms in Mozambique, the droughts in Somaliland that have killed most of the livestock, and the heatwaves in India are just a taste of things to come if we continue to pump greenhouse gases into the atmosphere. More and more people will have to move just in order to survive. In the next few decades, millions will be forced to migrate to avoid ever-changing, ever-worsening environmental conditions. So far most of them are migrating internally, from rural to urban areas, or are moving to neighbouring countries. Only a handful travel longer distances. They are then stranded in front of the walls of countries that are often in part responsible for the conditions – both environmental and political – that they are fleeing. The global north conquered and plundered during its colonial heyday, and still holds those countries hostage for debt, but it is also now depriving people of life’s necessities through its own addiction to high-carbon luxury. Yet we are seeing a rise of rightwing rhetoric across rich nations. This has terrible consequences for those affected, whether it is people taking their own lives in Australia’s notorious Manus and Nauru detention centres, dying in Immigration and Customs Enforcement custody on the US-Mexico border, or drowning in the Mediterranean – right now the world’s deadliest border. Politicians justify these horrendous conditions on the grounds that they will deter more people from coming. But the numbers of migrants and refugees who keep coming suggest that this strategy is not working. Of course, not all migration is linked to climate breakdown, but the climate emergency will make any “migrant crisis” we have now look like a tea party. A report by the UN special rapporteur on poverty and human rights warned recently of a future “climate apartheid”, where the global poor will suffer the worst consequences of climate breakdown while the rich buy their way to relative security. “Human rights might not survive the coming upheaval,” the report concludes gloomily. My greatest fear is that this dystopian vision of our future may come true. That the erosion of human rights was already well under way was very clear to me in Italy. What the Sea-Watch crew and I did was a relatively small thing. A moment of solidarity with those facing an immediate threat to their lives. It’s only as an afterthought that I would agree to call it symbolic. It shows the hypocrisy of the EU’s stance on migration, but also states boldly what kind of future we want: a future of global equality, solidarity and justice. Working on polar research vessels, I have seen the effects of global heating on nature first-hand. But while volunteering for Sea-Watch, I’ve seen a glimpse of what the future could hold for millions – even billions – of people. There are always those who either manufacture disaster or take advantage of it to gain wealth and power. The climate crisis will cause disasters that could help tyrants and fascists seize the reins. We need to do what we can to stop them from getting a foothold in Europe. It is not enough for Europeans to applaud those who challenge the Fortress Europe ideology. We will not change anything through passive support – we must all be active in demanding and creating the future that we want. Join activist movements to demand action on climate breakdown. Reduce your personal carbon footprint – dramatically. Help migrants and refugees already in your country to integrate into your society. Support organisations such as Sea-Watch however you can. And speak up against – and vote against – the politics of hate and division. As a German citizen, I have the privilege of risking arrest without fear of being deported to a dangerous place or being left to drown in the sea. But as a German I have another thought, too. Most of us wonder what we would have done in the 1930s, as racist rhetoric turned into racist policies and, eventually, genocide. My actions with Sea-Watch, I hope, tell me what I would have done had I been alive back then. The question I have for you is: what will you do now? • Carola Rackete is a German ship captain who volunteers for the sea rescue organisation Sea-Watch"

Share this...FacebookTwitterMore than 1200 publications show the Medieval Warm Period (MWP) was global – an embarrassment to global warming alarmists who claimed it was regional
Global warming alarmist scientists like claiming that the well documented Medieval Warm Period (MWP) was mostly a regional, North Atlantic phenomenon, and was not global, and so we just move along and stop questioning man-made global warming.
For example, the online Britanica entry on the Medieval Warm Period written by John P. Rafferty writes that it occurred “predominantly in the Northern Hemisphere from Greenland eastward through Europe and parts of Asia.”
Britanica does state that the claim of a global extent is highly controversial, though it really isn’t as we are about to see.
More than 1200 papers evidence it was global
Indeed the claim that it was global is now backed up by a huge body of scientific studies meticulously compiled by Dr. Sebastian Lüning of Die kalte Sonne and presented at Google Maps here.

So far the site is proving to be a valuable resource as it has been accessed over 125,000 times. Not bad for a project that was financed entirely on a shoestring by small, private donations.
Natural forces at work
When asked about the reaction to this resource, Dr. Lüning replied:
We run this study fully open-minded and without any result that we try to prove. We screen through all available data and then simply let the data talk. We begin to see a connection of the Medieval Climate Anomaly to the long-term changes of the ocean cycles, such as AMO and NAO. The same patterns that are known from the last 100 years (multidecadal) seem to operate on a multicentennial time frame. Most ocean cycles were really just discovered in the 1990s and it is only now that we integrate them into the longterm pre-industrial climate changes as well. By better understanding natural pre-industrial climate change, we may help answer a key question for modern climate change, related to attribution: How much of the warming of the last 150 years is anthropogenic, and how much is natural? This attribution question is certainly not trivial:

Taken as a whole, for the alarmists the 1200+ papers are an extremely inconvenient body of facts and knowledge, so don’t be surprised if efforts are made to make them disappear from the Google platform in the future.

Share this...FacebookTwitterModelled data by the Danish Meteorological Institute (DMI) show that Arctic sea ice stopped shrinking 13 years ago, defying earlier predictions made by climate scientists and models. 
By Kirye
and Pierre Gosselin
A few days ago we showed how Antarctica’s coastal stations were in fact cooling somewhat rather than warming. This came as a surprise to many.
And now that it’s June 1st, with the Arctic melt season starting in earnest, it is a good time to check Arctic ice volume. Here as well we find an equally surprising trend. Instead of shrinking rapidly — as is often claimed by the .global warming by alarmist scientists and the click-sleaze media — Arctic sea ice volume has not shrunk in 13 years!


Surprise. Arctic sea ice volume has not fallen in 13 years. Data source: Danish Meteorological Institute (DMI).
As the above chart shows, the ice has in reality even grown a bit!

The figures are based on calculations using DMI’s operational ocean and sea ice model HYCOM-CICE.
This is why today it’s more important than ever to keep the focus on the real data and not the hysterical headlines that currently dominate the hype-filled media.
And when we look at Arctic sea ice volume each year for June 1st this decade and plot it, we get the following:

June 1st Arctic ice volume on June 1st has increased so far this decade. Data: DMI.
Lo and behold: the chart above shows that early June ice volume has trended up over the current decade.
How can anyone say the Arctic ice has been rapidly melting recently? The answer is that they can’t. Anyone claiming otherwise is just plain lying.

"The former US secretary of state John Kerry has warned that humanity risks marching off a cliff unless governments take immediate action to fight the climate emergency. In a keynote address to the Global Table food and agriculture conference, Kerry made veiled swipes at the Australian government’s lack of climate and energy policy. He also weighed in on the heated debate about the massive Adani coalmine proposed for north Queensland.  “We just can’t sit on our asses and leave the political process to neanderthals who don’t want to believe in the future,” Kerry told the audience in Melbourne. “We have a dearth of leadership, but this will turn.” The former US Democratic presidential candidate said it was not a choice between taking action on the climate emergency and securing jobs and growth. “They are not separate. And anybody who persists in putting forward that notion that you have to make the choice – you can either have jobs plus prosperity or you can protect the environment and the future. That’s a lie. “We’ve got a whole bunch of people running around trying to save the status quo – when the status quo is actually feeding a lot of jobs that don’t make sense.” He said the transition to carbon emission-neutral economies would create better jobs and noted that the fastest growing employment opportunities in the US were for solar power and wind power turbine technicians. He contrasted the growing US solar workforce of 300,000 people with the declining coal workforce of 50,000. Two years ago 75% of new electricity coming online in the US was renewable energy compared with 0.2% coal. “We have to make better choices,” Kerry said. @JohnFKerry, 68th Secretary of State, delivering the opening keynote at Global Table x @SEEDSandCHIPS. Discussing the need for leadership, facts and vision during tough times. #GlobalTableAus #SaCGlobalTable pic.twitter.com/QhV03PNUSB He cast doubt over continued investment in the coal sector, acknowledging the controversy surrounding the Adani coalmine in Australia. “I got to tell you, we should not be moving to coal, we should not be encouraging coal, we should not be building infrastructure around coal,” he said to rousing applause from the audience. He talked up the future of small-generation nuclear power, citing its safe use by the US Navy. But experts have cast doubt on the technology because of cost, technical limitations and its failure to be deployed commercially anywhere in the world. Kerry said people arguing that the cost of action to fight the climate emergency was too great were not factoring in the massive storm and disaster damage bills. In 2017 the category five hurricanes Irma and Maria and the category four hurricane Harvey cost $265bn to clean up. “Wait and see what happens with Dorian,” Kerry said. He likened the money needed for climate action to the scale of the Marshall plan to rebuild Europe after the second world war. The Australian government has resisted calls to invest more cash in the UN’s Green Climate Fund. Australia has previously pledged $200m to the fund to help developing countries adapt to the impacts of climate change and cut their own greenhouse gas emissions. “It’s to help those developing nations leapfrog the mistakes and get modern technology,” Kerry said. “We said we would put $100bn in that fund to help these smaller nations do this transition … But do you know how much money is in that fund? Less than $5bn. Come on, folks, that’s not serious.” He compared the global response to “lemmings marching off the cliff into the sea”. Kerry was critical of the Trump administration’s decision to pull the US out of the Paris climate change action pact but said state governors and mayors across the country were stepping up to the plate. The Global Table conference continues until Friday."

Share this...FacebookTwitterAccording to the German online Tagesspiegel here, retired alarmist climate researcher Prof. John Schellnhuber is open to accepting a minister position in the state government in Brandenburg.
Panic in Germany
The former director of the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research thinks the planet “is in a sort of emergency” and so he is prepared “to advise the democratic parties concerning overcoming the climate crisis,” he said an interview with the “Potsdamer Neuesten Nachrichten”.


Schellnhuber says we are living in “unusual times”. Germany has pledged to shut down its coal power plants by 2038, which environmentalists and climate alarmists say is too long and that it has to happen much sooner.
As the coal industry is a key energy supplier to the state of Brandenburg, and the current Brandenburg government coalition made up of the socialists and leftists has been reluctant in scaling back coal power, fearing a fierce backlash from coal-related workers.

Earth slipping into a “Hot Age”
Schellnhuber warns, however, that action needs to be taken more aggressively and that “we really don’t have much time left to prevent the earth from slipping into a Hot Age”.
Potsdam recently declared a climate emergency and a citizens’ initiative is demanding that it be declared state-wide, the Tagesspiegel reports.
Schellnhuber also attacked the hard right, climate skeptic AfD Party, which the Tagesspiegel reports “denies climate change”. Schellnhuber says their “climate lies sound seductive because you don’t need to change behavior over the short term.”
Skepticism “endangers our entire civilization”
Schellnhuber calls this type of science skepticism “dangerous because it endangers our entire civilization” and says that in parties like the AfD there are “many bitter old gentlemen” who would lose their importance.

"Teen climate activist Greta Thunberg was joined by swelling and excited crowds of American teenagers at a protest outside the UN headquarters in New York on Friday, in a further blossoming of the youth environment movement given extra thrust by the Swede’s transatlantic boat crossing. Some US children said they were at their first ever climate demonstration; others said they had been passionate about the environment for a while but had been galvanized to act by Thunberg’s rising profile. On Friday afternoon, Thunberg and two young activists were spontaneously invited inside the UN for a meeting with a senior leader, described as “very supportive”. Just two days after Thunberg disembarked from a yacht in New York, following two weeks on rough seas crossing from the UK, young protesters dominated the crowd of up to 1,000 outside the United Nations skyscraper in Manhattan. They came together to demand politicians and older generations take urgent and comprehensive action to reverse the climate crisis. Carrying hand-drawn placards with messages such as “United behind the science” and “Act now or we will”, children and young people of all ages surged into a park in front of the flags of the world outside the UN on Friday morning. Thunberg sat cheerfully but pensively in the middle of the rally, which had a rather more earnest than festive atmosphere. Young speakers gave spontaneous speeches or led chants of “System change, not climate change” and “Don’t just watch us, join us”. Alexandria Villaseñor, 14, who has been protesting every Friday outside the UN since December, was in her usual spot and said she had been inspired by Thunberg’s school strike campaign. She said: “Greta being here will really galvanise students just because of how much of an inspiration she is. Everyone who’s been striking on Friday was really empowered by Greta and the action she was taking.” Thunberg held her trademark “skolstrejk för klimatet” (Swedish for “school strike for climate”) sign, which she was seen carrying from the racing yacht on Wednesday, after refusing to take a flight to the US because of the polluting emissions.  For Dana Henao, 16, from Brentwood, Long Island, Friday marked her first climate protest.  “The government isn’t taking enough action to protect the environment and all they care about is the money they make with corporations polluting the planet and I think we should put a stop to it,” she said. “The young people are the only ones taking action and we want to call attention to this.” She added: “She [Greta] is really popular and she’s, like, the face of the movement.” On Friday afternoon, Thunberg, Villaseñor and Xiye Bastida Patrick, 17, a Fridays for Future organiser, went inside the UN for an impromptu meeting with general assembly president María Fernanda Espinosa after receiving an invitation during the protest. The trio were given a tour – including a preview of the general assembly podium, at which Thunberg will speak during next month’s climate action summit, and had a meeting with Espinosa, where they spoke about the summit, global heating, forest fires around the world, the Amazon fire and single-use plastics. Villaseñor said the president was “very supportive”. She said: “I said I want to see world leaders take climate action to reduce global greenhouse emissions and stay in line with the Paris agreement and also September 20 we will continue pushing and demanding that they do.” Thunberg told the Guardian in an interview shortly after disembarking from the special “zero emissions” yacht that she wanted “a concrete plan, not just nice words” from leaders about taking urgent and comprehensive action to head off the climate crisis.  Villaseñor, who is thought to be America’s first school striker to join the movement and has been exchanging tips with Thunberg online, had been among the group of American climate activists who welcomed her to the US when her yacht docked at North Cove Marina.  She said: “What’s really important about Greta being here today is it’s the start of something new. Because with the climate summit coming up it’s the way for all the youth to unite here and send a message to world leaders at that climate summit. So even though Greta’s voyage on Malizia ended a couple of days ago, the climate action we will take on this continent has really just begun.” On Wednesday, Thunberg said her generation is having to “clean up” the climate crisis. She also told Donald Trump, who denies there is a climate crisis, to “listen to the science”. On Friday, Almy Batis, 21, a student at Arizona State University, said she saw Friday as a landmark moment for America’s climate movement. “This is a huge moment that Greta is finally here and there are Fridays for Future events scattered across the US. Her movement is going to be amplified in North America … and grow a lot.” Esme Ruiz, eight, from New York, attending with her father, said: “The world is literally melting right in front of our eyes and no-one even realises it. We need to teach them..It’s hard to make changes sometimes, but if you need to save the world, I’d do it rather than die.” Meanwhile, a Brooklyn teacher said she has seen a “Greta effect” in her school. With her coincidental name, but with different spelling, Gretta Reed, 28, said: “In the last two years I’ve seen a big surge in kids really vocalising. Now that they’re organising together, I think it’s really powerful.”"
"This summer, as rain relentlessly poured down on the Great Lakes region, Detroit declared a rare state of emergency. The swollen Detroit River had spilled into the low-lying Jefferson Chalmers neighborhood – an event not seen near this scale since 1986. Volunteers sandbagged the area as the city’s overwhelmed sewer system spilled raw sewage into the river, which connects Lake Huron and Lake Erie. Across the channel from Jefferson Chalmers, water damaged the historic boathouse on Belle Isle, a 982-acre island park that remains partly shut down because of flooding.  Meanwhile, in Duluth, Minnesota, the city is rebuilding after a powerful storm over Lake Superior damaged a popular pedestrian path, eroded acres of lakefront property and ravaged infrastructure along the shore. About 800 miles to the east, floods hit Buffalo, New York, on Lake Erie in two of the last three years, while Lake Michigan’s historically high waters inundated parts of Chicago throughout the spring and summer months. The havoc wreaked on communities bordering the Great Lakes is a result of their water level steadily rising over the last five years and spiking to record levels this spring and summer. In 2019, the lakes’ depths ranged from 14in to nearly 3ft above long-term averages, according to data from the US army corps of engineers. In June, water in the Lakes St Clair, Ontario, Superior and Erie set records for monthly mean levels, while Lake Michigan-Huron rose to 1in from its recorded peak. That is leading to widespread damage in coastal cities, eroded shorelines and beaches and many other issues. The record levels come just five years after the lakes experienced historically low levels in 2014, and climate scientists say it is clear what’s fueling the drastic swing: the Earth’s rising temperatures. “Bigger picture, it’s climate change,” said Richard B Rood, a professor in the University of Michigan’s department of climate and space sciences and engineering. “There’s no doubt that we are in a region where climate change is having an impact.” Rood said the Great Lakes basin, which holds 90% of the nation’s freshwater, can expect similar shifts in the coming decades as world temperatures increase. Climate scientists say a confluence of climate crisis-related issues resulted in this year’s levels. Warmer air over the Gulf of Mexico caused more evaporation, and that moisture pushed into the region during the spring and summer. Higher temperatures give the atmosphere more capacity to hold evaporated water, Rood said, which is why storms are dumping more rain than 50 years ago. “When you’re in wet periods, you start to get persistent, basin-wide extreme precipitation,” he said. The numbers back that up. By May, Cleveland, Ohio on Lake Erie’s shore saw more rainy days than any year since 1953. Muskegon, on Lake Michigan’s shore, experienced 7.45in more rainfall than average throughout the first eight months, while Sault Ste Marie on Lake Superior tallied about 9in more than average for the same period. Buffalo saw 34% more rain than typical. The moisture rained down on ground and lakes already more saturated than usual because a January polar vortex brought frigid temperatures that prevented wintertime evaporation crucial to keeping water levels in check. Meanwhile, a heavy snow pack melted. pushing up levels even further. “We’re seeing all these things that have an effect on the water cycle converge, which is why we’re having these enormous water volumes,” Rood said. Though the region finally dried out a bit in August and water levels are slightly receding, the Great Lakes’ fall storm season is fast approaching. Fall is a time of high winds and the agency’s six-month forecast predicts levels will remain very high, thus there’s a strong likelihood for even more damage this year. Coastal communities need to give the storms and fluctuating lake levels stronger consideration when building near the shoreline, said Richard Norton, an urban and regional planning professor at the University of Michigan. There’s still an inclination to build as close to the water as possible, which was especially a problem as levels began dropping in the early 2000s. “People want to build in the most beautiful, fragile and dangerous places, and that’s challenging because of the way the lakes go up and down over time in a weird way … and it’s not a good idea,” Norton said. The changes have an impact on the lakes’ ecosystems and natural environment, but it’s a mixed bag. While erosion is an issue, the basin is resilient and has withstood similar variability in the past, said Mark Breederland, an extension director with the environmental agency Michigan Sea Grant. He said extreme fluctuations can benefit the coastal wetlands and some species, while other species, such as the endangered piping plover, face new threats. Meanwhile, the impact of continued climate change on the Great Lakes’ ecosystem is still unknown, Breederland said. However, there is more certainty with water levels. Long-term, as temperature increases continue, the region will see levels “bouncing from low extreme to high extremes”, Rood said, though the lakes will eventually start to disappear if temperatures aren’t brought under control. “If we don’t mitigate our emissions … and the temperature gets to a certain level, then it does become evaporation dominant,” he said. • This article was corrected on 3 September 2019 to situate Buffalo, New York, on Lake Erie rather than Lake Ontario."

Several new temperature reconstructions indicate there were millennial-scale periods with multiple degrees Celsius greater warmth than today (410 ppm CO2) during this glacial period.

Tree remains dated to this period have been discovered 600-1000 meters atop the modern treeline in the Russian Altai mountains.  With lapse rate and tectonic changes considered, this suggests surface air temperatures were between 3°C and possibly up to 5.9°C warmer than today (Ganyushkin et al., 2018) at this time.

Modern sea surface temperatures of 15.5°C and 10°C have been recorded in the subpolar North Atlantic (Tobago Basin and Bonair Basin, respectively). Between and about 10 and 15 thousand years ago, temperatures reached 23°C and 17°C, respectively, which is ~7°C warmer than today). Temperatures were 2-4°C warmer than today between 20 and 30 thousand years ago (Reißig et al., 2019).

Today’s North Atlantic’s bottom-water temperatures are about 4°C. They averaged ~5°C during the last glacial, with anomalies reaching 10°C both 13 and 16 thousand years ago and about 7°C both 15 and 19 thousand years ago (Yasuhara et al., 2019).

Modern annual temperatures at a California lake average 18°C. Between 31 and 24 thousand years ago, temperatures averaged 22°C to 23°C, which is about 4-5°C warmer than today (Feakins et al., 2019).

The modern temperature in the subarctic North Pacific ranges beween 3 to 4°C.  About 14,500 years ago, the region had warm peaks of 5 to 9°C, as well as 4 to 7°C between 18 and 20 thousand years ago (Lohmann et al., 2019).

Sea surface temperatures near the Peruvian coast have plummeted in the last 50 years, with catfish remains in northern Peru suggesting this region was 4°C warmer than today during the Early Holocene. One reconstruction shows the region was ~2°C warmer than today about 15 to 16 thousand years ago (Salvatteci et al., 2019).

The “present observed temperatures” appear to be less than 24°C in the South Atlantic. This region was about 2°C warmer than today from about 10 thousand years ago to the Roman Warm Period, but it also reached similar or slightly (~1°C) warmer temperatures around 52 to 60 thousand years ago (Dauner et al., 2019).

Between 9000 to 6000 years ago, when global temperatures were 4-6°C warmer than they are today, the Sahara was a tree- and lake-covered haven teeming with megafauna and human civilizations (Manning and Timpson, 2014).

During this same period, the Earth’s sea levels were also multiple meters higher than they are now, as there was much less water locked up on land in the form of ice.
In the Persian Gulf region, for example, the biblically-mentioned city of Ur was once located on the sea coast.
Today, Ur’s ruins are located about 200 kilometers inland.

“The strongest melt in the mass change curve […] occurs between the 1930s and 1960s, with the beginning of this negative trend occurring in the early 1920s. The imagery from 1922 by Odencrants support this likely start of a melting trend, as almost no snow is present on top of Storglaciären, and other glaciers show tendencies of retreat. Between 1920 and 1970, 76% of the mass loss seen from 1910 to 2015 occurred while only constituting 48% of those years. This considerable melt, compared to the subsequent years, is also reflected in the retreat of the terminus, where it retreated approximately 370 m between 1929 and 1959 (Karlén 1973). The mass change of Storglaciären stabilized in the following years, even containing periods of increases in mass, and its mass was almost the same in 2001 as in 1970.”
“Various weather parameters from Tarfala Research Station, a kilometre north east of Storglaciären, exist since 1945, measuring average summer and winter temperatures of +5.5°C and −8.9°C, respectively.  From 1900 to 1920, the mean June–August temperature in Karesuando was 9.88°C, while it rose to 11.63°C for the period 1930–1950.”
“[G]enerally lower ELA between 1880 and the 1930s, with occasional high values, and the ELA reaches comparable lows during the late 1970s and 1990s, corresponding with positive mass balance. The curve thus suggests similar conditions in the late 1800s to, for example, the 1990s.”

A West Greenland glacier that had previously been the “single largest source of mass loss” to sea level rise (a staggering contribution of 9/100ths of a cm during 2000-’10) has recently begun “dramatic thickening” after an abrupt reversal to cooling (-2°C) since 2014.

Image Source: Khazendar et al., 2019
“Jakobshavn Isbrae has been the single largest source of mass loss from the Greenland Ice Sheet over the last 20 years. During that time, it has been retreating, accelerating and thinning. Here we use airborne altimetry and satellite imagery to show that since 2016 Jakobshavn has been re-advancing, slowing and thickening. We link these changes to concurrent cooling of ocean waters in Disko Bay that spill over into Ilulissat Icefjord. Ocean temperatures in the bay’s upper 250 m have cooled to levels not seen since the mid 1980s. Observations and modelling trace the origins of this cooling to anomalous wintertime heat loss in the boundary current that circulates around the southern half of Greenland.”
“Over the past several years, ocean temperatures have cooled on the continental shelf in the vicinity of Jakobshavn Isbrae . We find that ocean temperatures in Disko Bay below about 150 m cooled by nearly 2 °C between 2014 and 2016.”

Image Source: Khazendar et al., 2019
“The data then show cooling in the first half of 2016 of a normal magnitude (~2 °C) acting on water at already below-average temperatures cooling it to 1 °C, which is ~2–2.5 °C colder than the 2009–2015 values. The mooring data also show that temperatures remain significantly below average through summer 2017.”

Image Source: Khazendar et al., 2019
“Since the late 1990s, Jakobshavn developed Greenland’s largest cumulative ice discharge anomaly, contributing the equivalent of ~0.9mm [9/100ths of a cm] to global mean sea-level rise between 2000 and 2010.”
“To explain the cooling observed in Davis Strait and in Disko Bay in 2015 and 2016, we first note that anomalous wintertime heat loss lowered ocean temperatures across the entire North Atlantic subpolar gyre since 2011 by about 0.6 °C on average in the top 300m of the water column (Supplementary Fig. 13). In the northern Irminger Sea where Atlantic Water first enters the East Greenland Current, ECCO shows that average temperatures have cooled by 0.75 °C over the same time period with the greatest cooling occurring during the winter of 2015. This 0.75 °C cooling of waters far upstream in the Irminger Sea explains part of the 2 °C cooling observed in Davis Strait and in Disko Bay.”

Image Source: Khazendar et al., 2019
“Most prominently, the sharp drop in ocean temperatures in 2016 and 2017 by 2 °C relative to the peak temperature in 2014 corresponds to the slowing and dramatic thickening of the glacier in 2017 and 2018. The higher melting in 2014 simulated in our plume model is not reflected in flow acceleration and thinning, which we cannot explain.”

"‘Tree planting ‘has mind-blowing potential’ to tackle climate crisis.” That’s how the Guardian reported findings from the Crowther Lab in Switzerland two months ago. Billions more trees, scientists claimed, could remove two-thirds of all the carbon dioxide created by human activity. Forest restoration “isn’t just one of our climate change solutions, it is overwhelmingly the top one,” said the lead scientist, climate change ecologist Tom Crowther. Such a programme might take 100 years to be fully effective, but along the way it would reduce the consequences of the climate crisis – protecting soil from erosion, reducing the risk of flooding and providing habitats for a vast range of animals and other plant species.  Some baby steps are already being taken, such as the Bonn Challenge, a global attempt to reforest 350m hectares by 2030. In the UK, tree-planting initiatives include the Northern Forest, which will be made up of 25m trees, spanning the north of England from Liverpool to Hull. But we need to do much, much more. Another study led by Crowther, published in Nature in 2015, estimated that while there are more than 3 trillion trees in the world, that number had fallen by 46% since the dawn of human civilisation. In Brazil, the Amazon rainforest continues to shrink by the equivalent of three football fields every minute as land is turned over to cattle ranching, soya-bean production and mining. In August alone, an area the size of Hong Kong disappeared, not including losses from fires. If you want to do your bit, here are some answers to the big questions. In its recent report Net Zero: the UK’s contribution to stopping global warming, the Committee on Climate Change says the UK needs to increase its woodland from 13% of land area to 17% (the European average is around 35%). We need to be planting 30,000 hectares annually. “In the 2018-19 season, we did just under 13,000 hectares, of which 11,000 were in Scotland,” says John Tucker, director of woodland outreach at the Woodland Trust. “If you looked at England, we probably need six times more tree-planting. We are way off where we should be.” In order to hit the target, says Jon Stokes, director of trees, science and research at the Tree Council, “we need a radically different approach in terms of funding, incentives, land availability, harnessing people power and private-public involvement. Existing woodlands are also valuable habitats and an essential source of carbon capture, however they are not always managed effectively. Improving the management of existing woodlands could maximise their ability to store and capture carbon, and should therefore be a key part of any plan to increase tree numbers or canopy cover.” Can people planting trees in their garden make much of a dent? “One individual tree might not make a difference but if 10m people put one tree in, that would,” says Tucker. “If people feel they want to do something, then planting a tree in the right place is a good thing to do … Get trees that are produced from seed that is sourced from the UK and grown in the UK. We want to avoid encouraging people to buy trees that have been imported because that brings with it a risk of disease.” It isn’t simply a case of filling every available space with trees. Species need to be chosen carefully to ensure they grow well – especially on deforested or degraded land – and fit into the existing ecosystem. “There are other landscapes – such as grasslands and peatlands – which are rich in biodiversity and can also lock up lots of carbon dioxide in their own right. These must be protected and here it might not be appropriate to plant trees,” says Stokes. Isabella Tree, author of Wilding, who, with her husband Charles Burrell, turned a 1,400-hectare farm in West Sussex into one of the country’s biggest “rewilding” projects, is not in favour of plantations. “The advantages of natural regeneration are absolutely huge and haven’t really been taken seriously,” she claims. Creating forest plantations, she says, would require first spraying the area with a weedkiller, such as glyphosate. “Then you’re transporting people in by car, with saplings that have been grown in nurseries in an artificial high-carbon system. They may have been imported, so you’ve got a disease risk there. They also won’t have all the mycorrhizas [beneficial fungi] that they would have had if they were grown in the wild. It’s a human choice what tree is planted where, and we’re not always the best judge of that.” Saplings are usually protected with a plastic tube that doesn’t biodegrade, and also creates “a micro-environment that can encourage a buildup of condensation, so those saplings are often prone to rot and disease buildup. They also encourage the saplings to grow fast and tall, so they are etiolated stems. That may be fine if you’re a forester and you want to grow trees with great tall trunks, but not if you want to get a natural landscape back.” The alternative is to let nature do it. “You allow thorny scrub to grow up, and that happens with birds and wind dispersing seed across your landscape – it’s one of the most biodiverse habitats there is, but in the UK we have zero tolerance for it.” A single jay, for instance, can plant thousands of acorns in a month, she says. “That thorny scrub becomes essentially nature’s barbed wire, to protect that sapling as it grows, so deer and rabbits can’t get at it. The sapling is instantly plugged into all the fungi associates of the scrub and the trees around it, so it’s like getting an intravenous injection of nutrients and minerals from the get-go. That tree will be much healthier and much more resilient than a tree that has been artificially planted. At the end, what you’ll get is an open woodscape, with lateral branches, which is a huge habitat for birds and bats, and a scrubby landscape where you’ve got the next generation of trees coming up. It sequesters carbon in a much more dynamic way than a closed-canopy, single-generational plantation.” One of the obstacles, she says, is funding. It is simple to request funds for, say, 500 oaks in a certain area. It is less easy to say we want to allow trees to regenerate naturally, but can’t say how many that will be. “The funding paradigm doesn’t fit natural regeneration – and that’s one of the big problems.” You don’t need permission, but you do need to think about what species will grow where you live, and also how big it could get. “It’s no use planting an oak tree two feet outside your back door – it will damage your house,” says Tucker. “You need to think about house foundations, underground drains, overhead power lines and make sure the tree is going to be in a place where it can grow and not have any adverse impact.” Think about the effect on your neighbours, too. Smaller species include apple trees or rowan. “The act of planting must not be seen as the end of this process,” Stokes adds. “Aftercare is absolutely vital for young and newly planted trees; without aftercare, we could plant many trees that simply die or don’t grow to a size where they can provide benefits such as capturing carbon.” You can’t plant on waste ground or in your local park without permission from the landowner – that could well be the local council and, says Tucker: “They might be interested in people approaching them and asking them if they can plant trees on their land.” Other good places to try may be school or hospital grounds. If you’re planting more than two hectares of forest (less if it’s a “sensitive area”), you may need to contact your local Forestry Commission office “about whether you need what is, in effect, planning permission to create a new woodland”. There may also be funding available. “We need more trees everywhere, but they perform different functions,” says Tucker. Leaving aside carbon sequestration, “In the rural situation, soil erosion is a real problem and trees in the right place, because their roots help improve water infiltration, can reduce runoff. In our cities, trees can be really good for improving air quality. As the climate warms up, shading in our towns and cities is going to become increasingly important and trees can perform that role. Surface-water flooding is a big problem in cities now and trees can help alleviate some of those flash-flooding episodes.” “Not many of the recent planting grants have been for urban trees, so it’s great to see the Urban Tree Challenge Fund promising to plant 130,000 new urban trees,” adds Stokes. The Tree Council has a national network of volunteers called tree wardens, who help conserve trees in their community. There may also be local tree-planting groups. If there aren’t, you could set up your own (the Woodland Trust offers free planting packs for community groups). Trees for Cities is another organisation that runs tree-planting projects. Donate money or volunteer. There are numerous reforestation charities operating around the world, such as the International Tree Foundation, and TreeSisters, which plants 2.2m trees across the tropics, including in India, Kenya and Brazil, every year. Beyond that, support international organisations that promote the rights of indigenous people, whose land stores nearly a quarter of the carbon stored in tropical forests, and who are best placed to protect forested areas by monitor and report illegal logging. In the UK, lobby the government to take reforestation seriously. “Tree planting rates in the UK in the past probably eight years have been the lowest for a generation, so we are miles off where we should be,” says Tucker. “Stopping deforestation is really important, because about 10% of carbon dioxide emissions come from deforestation,” adds Dominick Spracklen, professor of biosphere-atmosphere interactions at the University of Leeds. Many products we wouldn’t even think of contribute to the problem. “Ask questions,” says Stephen Donofrio, from the organisation Forest Trends. Ask the supermarkets where the palm oil in their products comes from, or the soya feed used to farm their meat. Ask sportswear companies where the leather in their trainers was sourced. Ask the person responsible for your pension fund how much deforestation its investments are causing. “Even if that person doesn’t know the answer, you’ve asked the question and hopefully others will, too, to the point where this comes on to their radar.” Simon Lewis, professor of global change science at University College London, says we should “support the rewilding forest restoration schemes. Lobby companies – and to get legislation – so that the food production chain is deforestation-free. On a personal level, reducing your meat and dairy consumption will take pressure off the land to allow the possibility of having more forest.” Above all, we mustn’t get complacent. “There are people who think we can keep using fossil fuels, and plant a few trees, and it’s all going to be all right,” says Spracklen. “That’s not going to solve climate change on its own.”"

The new study states that many published analyses show that lightning activity is responsive to temperature on time scales ranging from the diurnal to the decadal and that the hiatus in global warming earlier this century can be seen in several global datasets.
Scientists found that the statistically flat behavior of the global lightning record from the NASA Lightning Imaging Sensor over the same decadal period is consistent with this hiatus in global warming.
What follows is the paper’s abstract:
Multiple records of global temperature contain periods of decadal length with flat or declining temperature trend, often termed a ‘hiatus’. Towards assessing the physical reality of two such periods (1940–1972 and 1998–2014), lightning data are examined. Lightning activity is of particular interest because on many different time scales it has been shown to be non-linearly dependent on temperature. During the earlier hiatus, declining trends in regional thunder days have been documented. During the more recent hiatus, lightning observations from the Lightning Imaging Sensor in space show no trend in flash rate. Surface-based, radiosonde-based and satellite-based estimates of global temperature have all been examined to support the veracity of the hiatus in global warming over the time interval of the satellite-based lightning record. Future measurements are needed to capture the total global lightning activity on a continuous basis.”
So much for settled science.

"In December the president of the World Medical Association, Dr Leonid Eidelman, said reversing climate change could be the greatest health accomplishment of the 21st century. Eidelman said if doctors want to fully uphold the Declaration of Geneva’s creed that “the health and wellbeing of my patient will be my first consideration”, they needed to take an active role in defending their patients from the adverse effects of climate change.  Doctors around the world take climate change seriously. We are not interested in the politics. We focus on the science. The evidence. The facts. The American Medical Association and the British Medical Association have both declared a climate emergency regarding human health. Other medical associations and groups around the world are also in agreement. Our decision to call climate change a health emergency is informed and considered and is the natural progression of our long-held policy. The AMA has had formal policy on climate change and health since 2004. We update this policy regularly to reflect contemporary science, reports and evidence of the effects on human populations and the environment. The AMA recognises that human health is ultimately dependent on the health of the planet and its ecosystem. Climate change is having significant impacts on human health and health systems, and these impacts will increase in severity as the planet warms. The serious direct and indirect health impacts of climate change include mortality and morbidity resulting from heat stress and extreme weather events; an increase in the transmission of vector-borne diseases; food insecurity; mental ill-health; and negative effects from adverse changes in air pollution. There is inequity in the distribution of these impacts both within and between countries. Although there is an acknowledgement of the environmental harms associated with climate change, the connection between climate change and human health is less understood. National leadership and national coordination are required to draw attention to this issue and to implement interventions to mitigate the health impacts of climate change. The health impacts of climate change will place increasing demand on the health system over time. Australians of all ages need to be confident that they can continue to receive good quality timely access to their family doctor, and other health and medical professionals. This will be especially important in emergency situations, where good communication and organisation in the health sector is paramount. The government must take the lead in developing and coordinating a national strategy for climate change and health so Australia can respond effectively to the health impacts of climate change, extreme events, and to people’s medium- to long-term recovery needs. Not every doctor will agree with our stance on climate change and health but there is a groundswell of support from the future leaders of the medical profession. Doctors in training and medical students rate climate change as one of the greatest challenges facing them as future doctors. Our position on the climate health emergency may divide opinion and create debate – but it is a debate we have to have. • Tony Bartone is president of the Australian Medical Association"

Canada’s CBC here recently cited “a leaked report” which claimed Canada is “warming at twice the global rate.”
According to the “leaked report”, Canada’s annual average temperature over land has warmed 1.7 C when looking at the data since 1948. But that claim is misleading when recent data is considered.
Over the past 25 years, since scientists began to warn that the planet was warming in earnest, there has not been any warming when one looks at the untampered data provided by the Japan meteorology Agency (JMA) that were measured by 9 different stations across Canada. These 9 stations have the data dating back to around 1983 or 1986, so I used their datasats.
Looking at the JMA database and plotting the stations with longer term recording, we have the following chart:

Data source: JMA.
Though temperatures over Canada no doubt have risen over the past century, there has not been any real warming in over 25 years. Rather, there’s been slight cooling, though not statistically significant. Clearly there hasn’t been any Canadian warming recently.
So it is misleading — to say the least — to give the impression that Canada warming has been accelerating.

"Unprecedented pressure exerted by young activists will push world leaders to address the unfolding climate crisis, even with a recalcitrant US under Donald Trump, Greta Thunberg has told the Guardian.  Thunberg, the teenager whose school climate strikes have ignited a global youth-led movement, said that her journey to New York on a zero-carbon yacht was symbolic of the lengths young people will take to confront the climate crisis. She said: “It’s insane that a 16-year-old has to cross the Atlantic in order to take a stand, but that’s how it is. It feels like we are at a breaking point. Leaders know that more eyes on them, much more pressure is on them, that they have to do something, they have to come up with some sort of solution. I want a concrete plan, not just nice words.” Thunberg’s vessel – fitted with solar panels and underwater turbines to generate its on-board electricity – emerged from the mist of an unseasonably drizzly day to be met by a throng of supporters and media at a marina near the southern tip of Manhattan on Wednesday. Her arrival was heralded by a flotilla of 17 sailboats, charted by the UN, that intercepted her vessel near the Statue of Liberty. Supporters chanted “welcome Greta” as the Swedish teenager stepped off the yacht, shook some outstretched hands and said that it felt like the ground was shaking beneath her feet. Thunberg told the Guardian: “It’s so overwhelming. I’ve gone from nothing but me and the ocean to this.” Despite the adulation from the crowds, Thunberg said she didn’t relish being cast as the global figurehead of the climate movement. She said: “My role is to be one of many, many activists who are pushing for climate action. I don’t see myself as a leader, or icon or the face of a movement.” • This article was amended on 13 September 2019 to clarify a reference to the yacht being solar-powered. The main power source was wind."

The Sun in April 2019

By Prof. Fritz Vahrenholt and Frank Bosse
(German text translated/edited by P. Gosselin)
If we speak of an average of the last 23 cycles in the months of the minimum, our only significant energy source at the center of the solar system was below average active last month as well.
The sunspot number (SSN) was 9.1, which was thus only 42% of the average of the cycles for month no. 125. Some cycles (No. 21, 18, 16, 15, 8 ) were already completed in month no. 125.

Fig. 1: The monthly sunspot activity of the current solar cycle (SC 24) since December 2008 (red) compared to the mean value of all previously systematically observed cycles since the beginning of SC 1 in March 1755 (blue) and the very similar SC 5 (black).
Figure 1 clearly shows that the latest cycle was quite below-normal, especially at the beginning and after the second peak which had an SSN of over 140 towards the end. Since February 2014 (the maximum of the entire cycle 24 with SSN = 146 in cycle month 63), it only reached 2/3 of the average activity.
What are the effects? The total radiation (TSI for total solar irradiance) is only moderately influenced:

Since the maximum, we have seen a decrease of about 1.5 W/m². On the ground this drop decreases to 25% because the earth is not perpendicular to the sun (like the satellite’s sensor) and it rotates. This leaves only a boost of 0.38W/m² in effective radiant power, or 0.1%, which is comparatively little.
Another magnitude may have more influence: During high activity, the sun keeps the galactic cosmic radiation (actually less electromagnetic radiation, but more particles) away from the interior of the solar system. It performs this shielding less effectively with reduced solar activity.

Fig. 3: Galactic radiation since the 1960s. The series has been measured in Moscow. Source. Note: Upper peaks show strong cosmic radiation.
Since the beginning of the 2000s, a decrease of up to 16% compared to the 90s can currently be seen. Also in the maximum of SC24 around 2014 cosmic rays were about 8% stronger than in the maxima since 1980.
We had reported about the connections, which Hendrik Svensmark postulates, in the book and also in the blog (last here) several times.
Next we look at the comparison of the cycles among each other:

Fig. 4: The sunspot activity of the cycles in comparison. The numbers in the diagram are obtained by summing the monthly differences between the observed SSN and the mean (blue in Fig.1) up to the current cycle month 125. 
Also the coming cycle 25 – with a probable start in August 2020 (here we showed how we came to this view) – will again be below average with a high degree of certainty. The peak phase of solar activity from 1935 to about 2005 (SC 17…SC23) is over.

Share this...FacebookTwitterSales of so-called environmentally friendly electric cars have been slumping, despite all the Friday protests and loud cries for cleaner mobility.
Citing a report released by PricewaterhouseCoopers, German news portal t-online.de here reports how “suddenly demand is in the basement: even in China – the world’s largest market for e-cars – sales figures are collapsing”.
It turns out electric cars, with their long charging times, short range and surprisingly high CO2 lifetime budget, are still not attractive enough to consumers in these times of “climate crisis”.
Though sales have picked up in Germany somewhat, but that it’s still “at a very low level,” T-Online reports.
Climate protests, hysteria, fail to sway
Germany is one of the leading Fridays For Future protest countries worldwide, with tens of thousands of protesters turning out weekly. Yet that has not translated into any meaningful change in terms of electric car sales. People have not been swayed by all the climate hysteria and remain uncomfortable with all the technical and environmental drawbacks of plug-in electric cars. Read here.
Big markets dive
T-Online sees the really big trouble for electric cars elsewhere, that is in the markets where they have been traditionally strong: China, Norway and the USA. The German news site reports: “And that’s where the wind has changed, according to a report by management consultants PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC).”

Global: plug in electric fell 23.8%!
“According to the report, 321,573 battery-powered electric cars were sold worldwide in the third quarter of 2019. This is a decline of 2.8 percent compared to the previous year. Sales of plug-in hybrids even fell by a quarter (23.8 percent) to 102,097 units sold. There are various reasons for this,” reports T-Online.
Huge sales drop in China
T-Online reports that the world’s largest market for electric cars, China, “collapsed drastically between July and September 2019.” Adding: ” Sales of electric cars fell by 15.7 percent, of hybrid cars by 20 percent and of plug-in hybrids by as much as 27.3 percent.”
20% Q3 drop in US
Things are not better in the USA. Recently S&P Global reported: “Sales in the US plug-in vehicle market in Q3 2019 were down roughly 20% compared with Q3 2018, but year-to-date sales for 2019 were slightly ahead of sales through the third quarter in 2018.”
Future of electric plug-ins uncertain
Overall there’s growing uncertainty when it comes to the future of mobility and as to which technology will emerge as the most viable, and when.
Countries worldwide are woefully lagging behind in the installation of electric car infrastructure. Policymakers are thus uneasy about investing hundreds of billions into an electric car infrastructure, knowing that it may well be made obsolete by other fuels, such as hydrogen. Investment delays in turn lead to delays in sales.

"There will always be people who call for additional review or scrutiny of science when the results of a rigorous process don’t yield the outcomes they want. Effectively they want incontrovertible evidence, and anything less is unacceptable to them. Incontrovertible evidence is rare in science, so it is easy to pick some cherry and use it to seed controversy and delay action. History shows how effective the strategy has been. It also shows why the notion of the precautionary principle is so important. The principle requires that precautionary measures should be taken if the risk or threats of harm to (say) the environment are significant. It can mean taking action in the face of uncertainty. But when the available evidence is developed through a rigorous scientific process (and especially when it draws on multiple lines of evidence), suitable precautionary actions can be introduced with confidence.  Take the 2017 scientific consensus statement on “Land use impacts on Great Barrier Reef water quality and ecosystem condition” to illustrate the point. The consensus statement is a comprehensive analysis of the science underpinning the processes and management actions designed to improve water quality and their outcomes. It follows a statement released in 2013 which in turn followed one from 2008. To arrive at the most recent scientific consensus statement, some 1,600 relevant peer-reviewed papers and reports, published over the past few decades, were identified. Each had been circulating and available to the scientific community and other interested readers for more than 30 years. They were produced by some hundreds of authors from diverse institutions in Australia and overseas. They had been published in multiple outlets. They were subject to the usual intense scrutiny that follows publication. The point of the consensus statement was to determine whether there was evidence converging on any particular point. The papers and reports were therefore picked apart and the results analysed by about 50 authors with internationally recognised expertise in Great Barrier Reef and coastal science, particularly water quality science and management. For three of the chapters in particular, the authors drew on additional experts; and all chapters were seen by external reviewers. The whole process was carried out under the watchful scrutiny of the Reef Water Quality Independent Science Panel. The final output is a multidisciplinary analysis and covers the condition of coastal and marine ecosystems, sources of pollutants, risk, catchment scale management priorities, governance, monitoring and modelling aspects, and gaps in knowledge to be addressed. And there was a convergence. There is a consensus: Key Great Barrier Reef ecosystems continue to be in poor condition. This is largely due to the collective impact of land run-off associated with past and ongoing catchment development, coastal development activities, extreme weather events and climate change impacts such as the 2016 and 2017 coral bleaching events. Current initiatives will not meet the water quality targets. To accelerate the change in on-ground management, improvements to governance, program design, delivery and evaluation systems are urgently needed. This will require greater incorporation of social and economic factors, better targeting and prioritisation, exploration of alternative management options and increased support and resources. Two recently published reports add further weight to the evidence: The Reef 2050 Water Quality Improvement Plan Report Card 2017 and 2018 and the Outlook Report produced by the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority both point in the same direction – the reef ecosystem overall is deteriorating. There are encouraging patches showing signs of regeneration; and some of the Great Barrier Reef is in excellent condition. The challenge is to use the evidence to develop policy that will sustain the best parts of the Great Barrier Reef while giving any “green shoots” a chance to survive, even in the face of global warming. The balance of evidence is important. The scientific consensus statement (2017) involves the work of some hundreds of independent scientists. There is a small handful of scientists who have argued that the overwhelming majority are wrong, notwithstanding that the most prominent concedes that he is “not the authority on the issue”. If there is evidence that leads to an alternative conclusion, it should be put into the public domain and be subjected to the same scrutiny as the work critiqued in the consensus statement. There has been plenty of time for the work to be done. This is no time for hunches; it is time for evidence. When scientists seek to understand the world they make predictions and then test them. And they publish their results through appropriate channels. Nobody argues that science is perfect. Mistakes can be made and sometimes are. The evidence provided by science at any point in time, however, is the accumulated knowledge that survives after rigorous challenge, scrutiny and testing. We can be confident that decisions made on the basis of evidence derived from the processes of science will continue to provide benefits across society. It has done so for decades notwithstanding well documented diversionary tactics. As a nation, science has been an essential part of making us what we are. There is no reason to stop now. • Ian Chubb is the former Australian chief scientist. He is chair of the Reef Water Quality Independent Science Panel"

Share this...FacebookTwitterA new paper indicates the rise in CO2 concentration occurred well after the Northern Hemisphere’s ocean circulation changes drove the abrupt warming (~11,700 years ago) that ended the last ice age – a lag that effectively leaves no causal role for CO2 during deglaciation.

Ice core evidence from Antarctica also affirms no causal link for CO2 during deglaciation.

The Holocene record itself also contradicts the narrative that says CO2 increases drive climate warming. For the last ~10,000 years, ocean temperatures, surface temperatures, and sea levels fell as CO2 concentrations rose.

Share this...FacebookTwitterI’ve always wondered why alarmists blame storms on climate change, but then go totally silent when storms are absent. Just weather?
Yesterday at WeatherBELL Analytics Saturday Summary video, 40-year veteran meteorologist Joe Bastardi focused on global tropical storm activity.
Western Pacific typhoon activity near record low
On the western Pacific front, Bastardi says: “Normally this time of the year we’ve had 5 typhoons; this year we’ve only had one. And since March first this has been an almost record breaking low activity in the western Pacific.”
Quieter than normal August outlook for hurricanes
Looking at the Atlantic hurricane zones, here we see natural factors at work hampering hurricane development. One of them is dust blowing off the horn of Africa. Here Bastardi believes this area will remain quiet through most of August.

“Very very bearish” development conditions for hurricanes in the MDR
Another factor hampering hurricane formation in the main development region (MDR), Bastardi says, is the current Atlantic sea surface temperature pattern, which leads to “sinking” over the development region. Sea surface temperatures at the latitudes above the tropics are warm, and this helps to keep the lid down on hurricanes.
Dry conditions
In the tropical main development region (MDR), dry conditions are forecast for the next two weeks, and so hurricanes will have a tougher time developing. Joe Bastardi characterizes the conditions for hurricane development in the MDR as “very very bearish”, i.e. lower than normal development potential.
But the veteran meteorologist does warn that this doesn’t mean hurricanes won’t develop in the MDR. So we need to stay on the look out for “in-close development” where storms form just off the mainland.
All in all, good news so far – especially for the Atlantic – in terms of hurricane season intensity. Let’s hope it remains that way for the rest of the season.

Wind turbines lead to property value loss
RWI – Leibniz-Institut für Wirtschaftsforschung
A study by the Germany-based RWI Leibniz Institute for Economic Research shows that wind turbines can lead to falling prices for single-family homes in the immediate vicinity.
The value of a house one kilometer away from a wind turbine drops by an average of a good 7 percent. For the study, RWI evaluated almost 3 million sales offers on the Immoscout24 online portal.
The most important results:
– The effect decreases with increasing distance from the wind turbine. At a distance of eight to nine kilometres, wind turbines no longer have any effect on property prices.

– The researchers attribute the loss in value of the properties to the negative effects of wind turbines on their immediate surroundings – such as noise and disturbance of the landscape.
– As the RWI study shows, not all properties suffer the same loss in value: old houses in rural areas are hardest hit. Here, the loss in value within the one-kilometer radius can even amount to 23 percent. In contrast, houses on the outskirts of cities hardly lose any value at the same distance from a wind turbine. This could be due to the fact that in urban areas disturbances of the landscape or noise are less noticeable than in rural areas.
“Even if wind power plays an important role in the success of the energy system transformation, the effects for property owners can be serious in individual cases,” says Manuel Frondel, head of the “Environment and Resources” competence area at RWI. “Installing a wind turbine can cost homeowners tens of thousands of euros.“
For the study, RWI evaluated almost 3 million sales offers that appeared on the Immoscout24 online portal between 2007 and 2015. The effects on real estate prices were estimated using a hedonic price model that takes into account the exact distance between the wind turbines and the single-family houses in question, as well as the many properties of the houses and the socio-economic environment.

Share this...FacebookTwitterAnother new paper, which of course will be ignored by the government-funded IPCC because it contradicts claims CO2 drives climate, shows that natural factors dominated the earth’s climate variability.
A team of scientists led by Jerome Goslin have published a paper titled Decadal variability of north-eastern Atlantic storminess at the mid-Holocene: New inferences from a record of wind-blown sand, western Denmark in the journal Global and Planetary Change, suggesting climate variability is driven naturally.

Climate change driven by solar and oceanic cycles
Not surprisingly, as evidenced by hundreds of other publications (which are entirely ignored by the IPCC), climate variability is indeed tied to solar activity and “internal atmospheric and oceanic modes”.
The authors report they found “periods of high storminess activity to be significantly correlated with solar minima and relative pluri-decadal lows in the NAO.”

In layman terms: solar and oceanic cycles play the major roles in climate variability.
Co2 as sole driver is pathetic unscientific nonsense
Taking it a step further: suggesting that these powerful natural cycles stopped driving climate some 100 years ago and claiming a few extra molecules of CO2 have since taken over the climate driver’s seat is pathetic nonsense, one that could only be sustained by a government-funded mega-billion-dollar disinformation/scare campaign.
The paper’s abstract:




Disentangling the external and internal forcing responsible for the variability of the Earth’s climate and associated extreme events over the Holocene is crucial for producing reliable scenarios of adaptation to the effects of ongoing climate change. At mid-latitudes, significant relationships between westerly storminess, solar activity and internal atmospheric and oceanic modes of variability have been repeatedly evidenced to exist over millennial and centennial time scales. However, at shorter (decadal) scale, it is still challenging to establish clear control links between the forcing mechanisms and the spatio-temporal variability of past extra-tropical storms. This probably owes to the existence of complex multi-scale relationships and feedback loops, as well as to the difficulty of producing proxy-records of sufficiently high-resolution and wide spatial significance.
Here we present a reconstruction of westerly storminess in western Denmark between 4840 and 2300 yrs. cal. B·P. Past-storminess is retrieved from an organic-rich sedimentary succession by combining markers of aeolian sand influx, μ-XRF geochemistry and plant macrofossils. Particular focus is paid to the c. 4840–4350 yrs. cal. B·P. period for which our record is characterized by a pluri-annual resolution. We evidence concurrent pluri-decadal shifts in storminess and humidity regime at our site that we interpret as relocations of the mean westerly storm-track over the North-Atlantic. The signal is dominated by ≈ 90, ≈ 50–80 and ≈ 35-yr periods, evoking possible links with solar activity, the North-Atlantic Oscillation (NAO), the Atlantic Multidecadal oscillation (AMO) and the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC) modes of variability, respectively. The ≈ 35-yr periodicity found in our record is especially strong and stationary, suggesting that storminess could have been closely linked with the AMOC over the study period. Our records of storminess indeed show some great similarities with a record of deep overflow of a branch of the AMOC. Opposite to some model outputs, the strength of the AMOC seems to have often co-varied with storminess at pluri-decadal scales over the study period. We also find periods of high storminess activity to be significantly correlated with solar minima and relative pluri-decadal lows in the NAO. We suggest that small lowering in the strength of the NAO in an otherwise positive NAO context may have caused southward relocations of the mean westerly storm-track from subpolar latitudes to northern Europe. This invites to reconsider the importance given to using the NAO as a binary index.
Finally, an attempt is made to explore the temporal lead-lag relationships between storminess and different potential forcing agents such as the Total Solar Irradiance, the NAO and the AMOC. Unfortunately, the insufficient chronological precision of the proxy-records available for the TSI, the NAO and the AMOC over the study period prevents us from deriving any robust interpretations regarding potential teleconnections at a decadal-scale between past north-Atlantic westerly storminess activity, solar forcing, the NAO and north-Atlantic surface and deep oceanic circulation.”

"Kudos to Stephen Buranyi for drawing attention to the growth of air conditioning worldwide and the accompanying taste for cold in a time of global warming (Blowing cold and hot, The long read, 29 August). Having lived and worked in the American south, I can attest there are even more pernicious dimensions to this addiction to cold. Restaurants and bars are kept uncomfortably chilly, thus encouraging higher levels of consumption (heat dampens the desire to eat), fuelling not only profits but the obesity crisis. Cold has become a mark of prestige: the fancier the establishment, be it office block or shopping mall, the colder it is likely to be. Anecdotally, moving between these absurd temperature extremes several times a day seems to increase the incidence of colds. When I requested that the AC in my workplace (a public university) be set to a warmer level, the response of the facilities staff was to provide a heater for my office. Here in New York, a hotel on my street keeps a roaring fire in the lobby – in August – while the ambient indoor temperature is freezing. All this amounts to what Richard Seymour has recently called “climate sadism” – a form of masochism outwardly and ostentatiously directed, consumptive and destructive madness. May we find ways not to get caught up in its drive.Emanuela BianchiNew York  • When I was a legal adviser to the Export Credits Guarantee Department back in the 1970s I was told by an architect that he had been retained by the ruler of one of the Gulf states to build a tower office block along the lines of those now disfiguring the City of London. He asked his client where he would like the power station as the block would consume inordinate amounts of electricity for air conditioning. The architect pointed out to his client that it would be more sensible to keep to traditional styles of building, like the medieval souks, which are kept relatively cool by judicious circulation of air. It seems that the architect’s advice was not heeded. We now have extraordinary developments such as Dubai, which must be consuming energy at a prodigious rate.Dr Anthony J CooperGreat Shelford, Cambridgeshire • Stephen Buranyi says “the warmer it gets, the more we use air conditioning”. He is right for the richest of us. Others have to cope with such temperatures, or die. The 1995 Chicago heatwave led to 739 heat-related deaths over five days, of the mainly elderly poor who could not afford air conditioning and did not open windows for fear of crime. Comfort really is a social construct. People adapt to those conditions they normally occupy, and if they become uncomfortable, they change themselves, or their environment, to return to comfort.  In a world of rising energy prices, tanking economies, grid failures and more extreme weather events we have to think differently. Imagine a future where buildings are run for as much of the day and year as possible, on local natural energy, from sun and wind, and only when absolutely necessary are they heated and cooled. This is a revolutionary idea in societies where people fear crime and modern buildings are designed with too much glazing, and no natural ventilation and consequently overheat. For you, in your own home, my advice is to insulate your roof, shade and open your windows, and get security grilles for them. Only when this strategy fails, move rooms, locations or, in extremis, use mechanical cooling. Simples.Susan Roaf(Emeritus professor of architectural engineering, Heriot Watt University), Oxford • Your article does not mention the decades of scientific experiments proving we do not need AC, if we design or add the right construction. The Building Research Station in Watford has an experimental, comfortable, office block with no AC. It works by having a construction of exposed “high thermal mass”, solid plaster on concrete ceilings, floors, walls. At night cool air flows through to build up a store of “coolth”, so no noise, or bad air problem in daytime with windows closed. Usual office and modern home construction has the opposite of high thermal mass. The sun’s heat comes in and has nowhere to go but to raise the air to stifling temperatures. In the experimental building the windows are shaded to reduce over-heating, and the lesser heat soaks away into the heavy construction, leaving air at moderate temperature. The same effect is felt in solid brick or concrete homes. My own 1900 flat has been very cool all night and day with heavy construction, sucking away the heat. My son’s modern flat has been far too hot, with very high winter insulation, covered with only 1cm of plasterboard, nowhere for heat to soak away. Regulations are going to be changed to make low winter energy buildings cooler in summer.Anthony EdwardsRetired architect, London • Stephen Buranyi’s article did not cover modern developments. In summer air conditioning can easily be powered directly by the sun via solar panels. In winter solar power stored in an electric car’s batteries can extract two and a half times more heat from the outside as used to power the air conditioner, thus reducing carbon dioxide emissions from gas central heating units.Donald HawthornRuddington, Nottinghamshire  • Join the debate – email guardian.letters@theguardian.com • Read more Guardian letters – click here to visit gu.com/letters • Do you have a photo you’d like to share with Guardian readers?

"A craft distillery in Scotland could become the greenest gin and whisky producer in the world as part of the government’s plans to cut industrial climate emissions. The Orkney Distillery has secured a slice of the government’s £390m fund to help develop low-carbon technologies that could reduce carbon emissions from industry. It hopes to use the funds to become the first gin distillery in the world to run on hydrogen made from renewable energy rather than liquid petroleum gas.  The Orkney gin project will use renewable electricity to run an electrolyser that splits water into hydrogen and oxygen. A spokesman for the distillery, which plans to make whisky in the future too, said it does not believe there is another distillery in the world capable of producing spirits with a smaller carbon footprint. The project could reduce emissions from the plant by about 86 tonnes of carbon every year, equivalent to the emissions from 10 homes or 18 cars. The same technology, at a much larger scale, could create “green” hydrogen to replace traditional high-carbon gases used in industry, or for transport fuels and heating. Lord Duncan, the climate change minister, said developing hydrogen technology means the UK will be able to reduce climate emissions from industry as it shifts to a cleaner economy. “It’s great to know we can all enjoy an environmentally friendly tipple while helping our planet as we press towards a net zero emissions economy by 2050,” Duncan said. The government expects hydrogen to play a major role in meeting the 2050 target because it can take the place of more polluting fuels. It plans to spend almost £400m on reducing industrial emissions, including plans to develop hydrogen technologies, most of which will be channelled into the steel and iron sector. The Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy laid out plans for a £250m Clean Steel Fund to help cut emissions from the iron and steel industry, which make up a sixth of the UK’s total greenhouse gas emissions. It is seeking views on the design of the fund through an industry consultation that runs until late November. The department will also spend £100m to support a competition to find new ways for businesses to use low-carbon hydrogen, and £40m on a nationwide green technology fund."

As the EU and Australia prepare for the next round of FTA negotiations in October, Guardian Australia understands the issue of Australia’s poor fuel quality, which prevents the sale of a range of European vehicles with higher standard engines, has already been raised at a bureaucratic level as a “technical barrier to trade”. Europe will also be using the EU-Australia free trade agreement to cement Australia’s support for emissions reduction targets agreed to under the Paris accord, with Europe flagging it wants the “respect and full implementation of the Paris agreement” underscored in the text of the agreement. The issue of fuel quality is one of a raft of industrial barriers that Europe is pushing Australia to consider as part of a wide-ranging new free trade agreement, along with the removal of a 5% industrial tariff and changes to Australia’s luxury car tax, which overwhelmingly hits European vehicles. Australia ranks 66th in the world for its fuel quality, the lowest of all developed countries, with an allowable sulphur content up to 15 times higher than countries like China. Australia’s most popular unleaded petrol – 91 unleaded – allows sulphur levels of up to 150 parts per million compared to the 10ppm allowed by the European Union, and the government has indicated this will not change until 2027. This means some of the best and cleanest European cars cannot be exported to Australia, leaving some manufacturers to either export older generation engines on certain models, or to not export them at all. The federal chamber of automotive industries has said that without Australia’s fuel quality being brought into line with other developed countries, the “latest-technology, low-emission engines cannot be supported in the domestic market”. The Fcai has also told a parliamentary hearing into electric vehicles that improving Australia’s fuel quality would offer a “3% to 5%” improvement on CO2 performance “overnight”. In 2015, the Coalition set up a ministerial forum on vehicle emissions aimed at addressing three proposals for improving fuel standards that were outlined in a 2018 discussion paper. But the forum has been criticised over its inaction, and before the May election the government quietly postponed fuel standard improvements for Australian refiners until 1 July 2027, in line with the petroleum industry’s demand. The trade minister, Simon Birmingham, said the issue of Australia’s fuel standards would be considered as part of the bilateral negotiations. “As part of the free trade negotiations we will consider everything that is put on the table. Whether we agree to it is a different matter,” Birmingham told Guardian Australia. “It is not Australian practice to simply adopt European standards – we urge and encourage common adoption of international standards where possible. “But we will work through in a practical way any of these issues and see what may be possible in the Australian context, but ultimately we will only be doing any agreement if it is in the overall benefit of Australia.” Sign up to receive the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning On the likelihood that Australia’s commitment to the Paris climate agreement will need to be enshrined in the new FTA, Birmingham said Australia would be happy to comply. “Our commitment to Paris is firm and resolute and we are happy to reinforce that commitment in any forum.” Along with industrial and environmental concerns, Australia and the EU are attempting to negotiate through a host of agricultural barriers, with Australian farmers hoping to gain further access to Europe’s highly protected market. Tariffs on imported lamb and beef to the EU are as high as 50%, but Europe is considering a boost to the low tariff quota allowed to Australian exporters for high-quality produce. Europe is pushing for Australian action on so-called “geographic indicators”, which would prevent Australian producers using a suite of brand names it deems to be its intellectual property, such as feta, gruyere and gorgonzola. Australian cheesemakers have expressed concern that the proposed ban on product names could require expensive rebranding and cost jobs. Asked about the progress being made on the FTA, negotiations for which began in June 2018, the prime minister, Scott Morrison, said it was “complex”. “It is just step by step by step by step,” he said. “But there is a real keenness to engage with Australia.”"

When it comes to the Sun’s influence on climate, one conclusion is certain: there is no widespread scientific agreement as to how and to what extent solar activity and its related parameters (i.e., galactic cosmic rays, geomagnetic activity, solar wind flux) impact changes in the Earth’s temperature and precipitation.
The disagreement is so chasmic and the mechanisms are so poorly understood that scientists’ estimates of the influence of direct solar irradiance forcing between the 17th century and today can range between a negligible +0.1 W m-2 to a very robust +6 W m-2 (Egorova et al., 2018; Mazzarella and Scafetta, 2018).
“There is no consensus on the amplitude of the historical solar forcing. The estimated magnitude of the total solar irradiance difference between Maunder minimum and present time ranges from 0.1 to 6 W/m2 making uncertain the simulation of the past and future climate.”  (Egorova et al., 2018)
“According to the IPCC (2013), solar forcing is extremely small and cannot induce the estimated 1.0–1.5 °C since the LIA. However, thesolar radiative forcing is quite uncertain because from 1700 to 2000 the proposed historical total solar irradiance reconstructions vary greatly from a minimum of 0.5 W/m2 to a maximum of about 6 W/m2 (cf..: Hoyt and Schatten 1993; Wang et al. 2005; Shapiro et al. 2011). Moreover, it is believed that the sun can influence the climate also via a magnetically induced cosmic ray flux modulation (e.g.: Kirkby 2007) or via heliospheric oscillation related to planetary resonances (e.g.: Scafetta 2013, 2014b; Scafetta et al. 2016, and others). Since solar and climate records correlate quite significantly throughout the Holocene (cf: Kerr 2001; Steinhilber et al. 2012; Scafetta 2012, 20104b), the results shown herein may be quite realistic, although the exact physical mechanisms linking astronomical forcings to climate change are still poorly understood.”  (Mazzarella and Scafetta, 2018)
Thus far in 2019, 55 scientific papers have been located that link solar forcing to climate changes.  This is an incomplete compilation and it is likely to swell to about ~100 papers by year’s end or upon further review.
Such a large volume of research devoted to finding connections between the Sun’s variability and its effect on the Earth’s climate system would seem to contradict the conclusion that there is widespread consensus that the Sun’s climate impact is negligible.
Below are the first 12 papers on the list. For the rest of the compilation, click here.

Scafetta and Willson, 2019     The consistent downward trending of the PMOD TSI composite is negatively correlated with the global mean temperature anomaly during 1980–2000. This has been viewed with favor by those supporting the CO2 anthropogenic global warming (CAGW) hypothesis since it would minimize TSI variation as a competitive climate change driver to CO2, the featured driver of the hypothesis during the period (cf.: [IPCC, 2013, Lockwood and Fröhlich, 2008]). .. Our summary conclusion is that the objective evidence produced by all of the independent TSI composites [3,5, 6, 9] agrees better with the cycle-by-cycle trending of the original ACRIM science team’s composite TSI that shows an increasing trend from 1980 to 2000 and a decreasing trend thereafter. The continuously downward trending of the PMOD composite and TSI proxy models is contraindicated. … PMOD’s modifications of the published ACRIM and ERB TSI records are questionable because they are based on conforming satellite observational data to proxy model predictions. … ACRIM shows a 0.46 W/m2 increase between 1986 and 1996 followed by a decrease of 0.30 W/m2 between 1996 and 2009. PMOD shows a continuous, increasing downward trend with a 1986 to 1996 decrease of 0.05 W/m2 followed by a decrease of 0.14 W/m2 between 1996 and 2009. The RMIB composite agrees qualitatively with the ACRIM trend by increasing between the 1986 and 1996 minima and decreasing slightly between 1996 and 2009. … ACRIM composite trending is well correlated with the record of global mean temperature anomaly over the entire range of satellite observations (1980–2018) [Scafetta. 2009]. The climate warming hiatus observed since 2000 is inconsistent with CO2 anthropogenic global warming (CAGW) climate models [Scafetta, 2013, Scafetta, 2017]. This points to a significant percentage of the observed 1980–2000 warming being driven by TSI variation [Scafetta, 2009, Willson, 2014, Scafetta. 2009]. A number of other studies have pointed out that climate change and TSI variability are strongly correlated throughout the Holocene including the recent decades (e.g., Scafetta, 2009,  Scafetta and Willson, 2014, Scafetta, 2013, Kerr, 2001, Bond et al., 2001, Kirkby, 2007, Shaviv, 2008, Shapiro et al., 2011, Soon and Legates, 2013, Steinhilber et al., 2012, Soon et al., 2014). .. The global surface temperature of the Earth increased from 1970 to 2000 and remained nearly stable from 2000 and 2018. This pattern is not reproduced by CO2 AGW climate models but correlates with a TSI evolution with the trending characteristics of the ACRIM TSI composite as explained in Scafetta [6,12, 27] and Willson [7].

Pei et al., 2019     During the period of 0–10,000 yr BP, China’s temperature has closely followed the solar forcing. The correlation is as high as 0.800 (p < 0.01) for the EOF-based reconstruction. … Similar to the North Atlantic SST, AO also plays an important role in China’s temperature (Zuo et al., 2015). NAO and AO are both suggested to influence the climate in East Asia by modifying the strength and location of the 200 hPa jet stream (Yang et al., 2004). The AO record of Darby et al. (2012) is based on sea-ice drift, which has a high resolution of 10–100 years and shows a close connection with solar activities.

Jiao et al., 2019     Regional climate change is affected by large-scale climate-forcing factors, such as solar activity and atmospheric–oceanic variability (Fang et al., 2010; Linderholm et al., 2015; Rydval et al., 2017). On the one hand, based on the MTM analysis results, the temperature changes in the study area are mainly influenced by the solar activity via the mean minimum temperature within approximately 11-year periods (Li et al., 2006; Wang et al., 2015). The tree-ring chronology was developed by samples of Schrenk spruce collected from the National Nature Reserve of the Western Tianshan Mountains. The mean minimum temperature in the growing season is the main and stable limiting climate factor. Therefore, the mean minimum temperature series in the growing season during 1680–2012 was reconstructed based on the STD chronology. In the past 333 years, the mean minimum temperature has roughly experienced three relatively cold periods and relatively warm stages (relatively cold periods: 1680–1707, 1802–1911 and 1935–1997; relatively warm periods: 1708–1801, 1912–1934 and 1998–2012). By analyzing similar trends in regional temperature changes in our reconstruction series with drought events, large volcanic eruptions and other reconstruction series around the study regions in Xinjiang and even large-scale regions, we found that the mean minimum temperature of the reconstruction was accurate and reliant. Moreover, the mean minimum temperature was influenced by solar activity (sunspots) and large-scale atmospheric–oceanic fluctuations (NAO, WPO, ENSO, TBO) based on the MTM and spatial correlation analysis.

Zharkova et al., 2019     Recently discovered long-term oscillations of the solar background magnetic field associated with double dynamo waves generated in inner and outer layers of the Sun indicate that the solar activity is heading in the next three decades (2019–2055) to a Modern grand minimum similar to Maunder one. On the other hand, a reconstruction of solar total irradiance suggests that since the Maunder minimum there is an increase in the cycle-averaged total solar irradiance (TSI) by a value of about 1–1.5 Wm−2 closely correlated with an increase of the baseline (average) terrestrial temperature. … These oscillations of the baseline solar magnetic field are found associated with a long-term solar inertial motion about the barycenter of the solar system and closely linked to an increase of solar irradiance and terrestrial temperature in the past two centuries. This trend is anticipated to continue in the next six centuries that can lead to a further natural increase of the terrestrial temperature by more than 2.5 °C by 2600.
Deke et al., 2019     The results provide robust evidence for synchronous ~500-yr cyclical changes in monsoon climate, human activity and prehistoric cultural development in the East Asian Monsoon (EAM) region during the Holocene. Six prosperous phases of Neolithic and Bronze Age cultures correspond approximately to warm-humid phases caused by a strengthened EASM, except for the first expansion of the Hongshan culture, which corresponds to the phase of strongest EASM in the middle Holocene. We suggest that humans responded to climatic fluctuations with different social strategies, leading to the rise and fall of early complex societies in the region.
(press release)      The climate theory casting new light on the history of Chinese civilisation … Researchers say that when 500-year-long sun cycles brought warmth, communities flourished, but when the Earth cooled, ancient societies collapsed. … Scientists say they have found evidence beneath a lake in northeastern China that ties climate change and 500-year sun cycles to ups and downs in the 8,000 years of Chinese civilisation. According to the study by a team at the Institute of Geology and Geophysics in Beijing published in the science journal Nature Communications this month, whenever the climate warmed, Chinese civilisation prospered and when it cooled, it declined.
Jin et al., 2019     We show that a strong 11-year solar cycle can excite a resonant response of the intrinsic leading mode of the AWM [Asian winter monsoon] variability, resulting in a significant signal of decadal variation. The leading mode, characterized by a warm Arctic and cold Siberia, responds to the maximum solar irradiance with a peculiar 3 to 4-year delay. We propose a new mechanism to explain this delayed response, in which the 11-year solar cycle affects the AWM via modulating Arctic sea ice variation during the preceding summer. At the peak of the accumulative solar irradiance (i.e., 4 years after the maximum solar irradiance), the Arctic sea ice concentration reaches a minimum over the Barents–Kara Sea region accompanied by an Arctic sea surface warming, which then persists into the following winter, causing Arctic high-pressure extend to the Ural mountain region, which enhances Siberian High and causes a bitter winter over the northern Asia.
Horikawa et al., 2019     The Mg/Ca-derived SST record clearly represented five warmer periods at 6200–6000, 4900–4500, 4200–3800, 2600–2100, and 900–400 cal. year BP, almost consistent with previously published diatom records. These warmer events also corresponded to the periods in which warm molluscan assemblages increased at the northern end of the TWC, suggesting that periods of higher SST can be seen as reflecting the increased volume transport of the TWC. We interpreted the results of a model study showing that higher solar irradiance provoked positive Arctic Oscillation (AO)-like spatial patterns and the negative phase of the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO) to mean that increased (reduced) TWC volume transport on the multi-centennial to millennial time scales was caused by high (low) solar insolation via a potential link between AO and PDO.
Kossobokov et al., 2019     On the Diversity of Long-Term Temperature Responses to Varying Levels of Solar Activity at Ten European Observatories … In the present paper, we propose a short but in-depth overview of a very specific topic, i.e., the statistical testing of hypotheses related to solar influence on regional temperature regimes at the time scale of several decades. … These new observations lead us to conclude that the climate in different regions presents different responses to variations in solar activity. Moreover, the distributions of the lower, middle, and higher quartiles of the temperature and pressure indices in solar cycles with high versus low activity are significantly different, providing further robust statistical confirmation to this conclusion (confidence level higher to much higher than 99% using the Kuiper test).
Wu et al., 2019     On the centennial to millennial time scale, the results of wavelet analysis and band‐pass filtering show that the occurrence and development of El Niño have also promoted a weaker EAWM after ~6.0 ka cal. BP, which is inversely correlated with the variation of the ca. 500‐year cycle originated from changes in solar output. These results imply that the climate transition in the mid‐Holocene is caused by the change of variations in solar activity and amplified by ocean circulation El Niño‐Southern Oscillation to influence the East Asian Monsoon system, especially the EAWM, and finally change the vegetation in Great Khingan Mountain Range.
(press release)     Lead scientist Dr Wu Jing, from the Key Laboratory of Cenozoic Geology and Environment at the Institute of Geology and Geophysics, part of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, said the study had found no evidence of human influence on northern China’s warming winters. … The study found that winds from Arctic Siberia have been growing weaker, the conifer tree line has been retreating north, and there has been a steady rise in biodiversity in a general warming trend that continues today. It appears to have little to do with the increase in greenhouse gases which began with the industrial revolution, according to the researchers. As a result of the research findings, Wu said she was now more worried about cooling than warming.
Wang et al., 2019     Here we present the first high-resolution stable isotope (δ13C and δ18O) speleothem record from northern Laos spanning the Common Era (∼50 BCE to 1880 CE). The δ13C record reveals substantial centennialscale fluctuations primarily driven by local water balance. Notably, the driest period at our site occurred from ∼1280 to 1430 CE, during the time of the Angkor droughts, supporting previous findings that this megadrought likely impacted much of Mainland Southeast Asia. In contrast, variations in stalagmite δ18O reflect changes in rainfall upstream from our study site. Interestingly, the δ18O record exhibits a positive correlation with solar activity that persists after 1200 CE, contrary to the findings in previous studies. Solar-forced climate model simulations reveal that these δ18O variations may be driven by solar-forced changes in upstream rainout over the tropical Indian Ocean, which modify the δ18O of moisture transported to our study site without necessarily affecting local rainfall amount. We conclude that future rainfall changes in Mainland Southeast Asia are likely to be superimposed on multi-decadal to centennial-scale variations in background climate driven primarily by internal climate variability, whereas solar forcing may impact upstream rainout over the Indian Ocean.
Misios et al., 2019     The Pacific Walker Circulation (PWC) fluctuates on interannual and multidecadal timescales under the influence of internal variability and external forcings. Here, we provide observational evidence that the 11-y solar cycle (SC) affects the PWC on decadal timescales. We observe a robust reduction of east–west sea-level pressure gradients over the Indo-Pacific Ocean during solar maxima and the following 1–2 y. This reduction is associated with westerly wind anomalies at the surface and throughout the equatorial troposphere in the western/central Pacific paired with an eastward shift of convective precipitation that brings more rainfall to the central Pacific. We show that this is initiated by a thermodynamical response of the global hydrological cycle to surface warming, further amplified by atmosphere–ocean coupling, leading to larger positive ocean temperature anomalies in the equatorial Pacific than expected from simple radiative forcing considerations. The observed solar modulation of the PWC is supported by a set of coupled ocean–atmosphere climate model simulations forced only by SC irradiance variations. We highlight the importance of a muted hydrology mechanism that acts to weaken the PWC. Demonstration of this mechanism acting on the 11-y SC timescale adds confidence in model predictions that the same mechanism also weakens the PWC under increasing greenhouse gas forcing.
Bhargawa and Singh, 2019     Since the Sun is the main source of energy for our planet therefore even a slight change in its output energy can make a huge difference in the climatic conditions of the terrestrial environment. The rate of energy coming from the Sun (solar irradiance) might affect our climate directly by changing the rate of solar heating of the Earth and the atmosphere and indirectly by changing the cloud forming processes. … In our investigation, we have observed that the impact of solar irradiance on the global surface temperature level in next decade will increase by ∼4.7% while the global mean sea level will increase about 0.67%. In the meantime, we have noticed about 5.3% decrement in the global sea-ice extent for the next decade. In case of the global precipitation anomaly we have not observed any particular trend just because of the variable climatic conditions. We also have studied the effect of CO2 as anthropogenic forcing where we have observed that the global temperature in the next decade will increase by 2.7%; mean sea level will increase by 6.4%. Increasing abundance in CO2 will be responsible for about 0.43% decrease in the sea-ice extent while there will not be any change in the precipitation pattern.
Zaffar et al., 2019     This study shows that every value of El Nino-southern oscillation (ENSO) Cycles and Sunspot Cycles are strongly correlated to preceding values in both the self-similar and self-affine cases. Unit root test is applied to the tail parameter and the strength of long range-correlation of El Nino-southern oscillation (ENSO) and Sunspot Cycles confirms stationary behavior of the parameters. The variation of earth climatic has a strong influence in Sunspots Cycles and El Nino-southern oscillation (ENSO) Cycles. Sunspots and El Nino-southern oscillation (ENSO) have strong correlation with each other (Asma et  al. 2018). The El Nino-southern oscillation (ENSO) cycles influence on the variation of the parameter of local climate which depends on the changes in solar activity.

Share this...FacebookTwitterNew research indicates that coral reef ecosystems off the coasts of Hawai’i (Terlouw et al., 2019) and in the Great Barrier Reef (Lønborg et al., 2019) are a net source of CO2 to the atmosphere.
Presuming that higher CO2 emissions lead to global warming, it can consequently be said that coral reefs are heating up the planet.

In addition to emitting CO2 (and adding to global CO2 emissions), coral reef communities are “acidifying” themselves.  Corals pump more CO2 into the water in which they live as they grow.

Counterintuitively, then, the rampant and ongoing “self-acidification” in coral reef communities is an indication that the reefs are healthy and thriving.

Image Source: New Scientist
Andreas Andersson of the Scripps Institution of Oceanography in San Diego, California, and his colleagues carefully monitored a coral reef in Bermuda for five years, and found that spikes in acidity were linked to increased reef growth.
“At first we were really puzzled by this,” says Andersson. “It’s completely the opposite to what we would expect in an ocean-acidification scenario.”
The researchers observed the chemistry of the water on the reef between 2007 and 2012. During that time, there were two sharp spikes in acidity – once in 2010 and again in 2011.
The team found that coral growth itself made the water more acidic as the corals sucked alkaline carbonate out of the water to build their skeletons. The corals also ate more food during these high-activity periods and pumped more CO2 into the water, increasing acidity further.

Perhaps the only way to prevent corals from acidifying the oceans, growing their carbon footprint, and heating up the planet is to foster increased incidences of coral bleaching events.
Peak bleaching decades, however, occurred in the 18th and 19th centuries.

Yes, coral reef communities pump CO2 into the atmosphere, acidify the oceans, and heat up the planet.
It’s important to emphasize, though, that just because coral reef ecosystems do it does not mean that humans should follow corals’ lead and do the same.

Share this...FacebookTwitterGerman wind park protest group MenschNatur posted here explaining how even adding more wind and solar capacity does not make Germany’s energy supply any more reliable, but in fact may even make it less so.
Time and again the proponents of the Energiewende (transition to green energies) promote the idea that we must invest massively in more wind and solar power plants and that only an accelerated expansion can save the transformation to green energies.
Thus the wind energy protest group MenschNatur has taken a closer look at the increase in installed nominal capacity over the past years and compared it to what actually gets fed into the grid.
How increases in wind generator capacity affects the feed-in power is described in the following diagram. MenschNatur plotted the installed capacity of all German onshore wind turbines from 2014 to 2018, along with what actually got fed in.

Figure 1: Expansion of rated installed wind power capacity and the power that actually got fed into the grid in Germany. Chart: MenschNatur, by Rolf Schuster. 
From the beginning of 2014 until the end of 2018 we saw an increase in wind generator capacity in Germany from 33,114 MW to 52,422 MW, i.e. 19,308 MW (red line above the light blue field).
The dark blue, jagged field is the wind power that got fed-in. For better comparability, they averaged the added wind generator capacity data and the average feed-in values for each year. As you can see, the increased added wind generator capacity (red dotted lines) increased at a more or less steady rate each year. However, the average wind power that got fed in (yellow line) does not keep pace with the rate of added capacity.
More installed capacity, yet less output!
For example there was an average of 35,869 MW of installed capacity in 2014 and only 5718 MW (15.9%) was fed in on average. In 2016, over 3,500 megawatts of wind capacity was added, yet the amount that got fed into the grid dropped fed by more than 500 MW due to calm weather conditions!

We can can conclude: Despite the addition of state-of-the-art wind turbines, the feed-in capacity can still fall. The output depends heavily on the year-to-year weather conditions.
In fact in real time, the power that gets fed-in by wind and sun in Germany can come close to zero in times of no wind and sun, as the following chart below shows for January 2019:

Chart: MenschNatur, by Rolf Schuster
The upper horizontal line represents total installed sun and wind capacity = 105,000 MW. Yet, for example on January 25, There was a night where almost nothing got fed in by wind and sun. Not once was the 105,000 MW of installed capacity able to even come close to supplying Germany’s peak power demands of 75,000 MW.
Another stark example is September, 2017:

Dark blue field is the power that got fed into the grid. Source: www.vernunftkraft.de/, Chart by Rolf Schuster
In September, 2017, the 53,000 MW of installed wind power capacity was able to deliver almost nothing for days.
MenschNatur adds that even tripling Germany’s current installed capacity to over 300,00 megawatts would still not be able to fill in the gaps, and often would produce huge surpluses of power that would totally throw the energy markets out of whack.

Share this...FacebookTwitterIn a new information video at FMD’s TV-Channel, man-made climate warming skeptic Günther Aigner analyzes winter temperatures at four German mountain stations over 1000 m altitudes at different locations in Germany.
Hat-tip: Die kalte Sonne here.
The stations are located at Feldberg (1493 m) in southwest Germany, Brocken in northern Germany (1152 m), Fichtelberg in eastern Germany (1215 m) and Großer Arber in southeast Germany (1456 m). These 4 stations are sited well away from urban influences.
Oscillating trend
Aigner clearly highlights the strong variability of temperatures, which we see do not correlate at all with rising atmospheric CO2 concentrations.

The clearly oscillating trend seen at the four stations over the past decades likely have much more to do with the natural AMO and NAO ocean cycles, which directly impact Western Europe’s winter weather patterns.
Today as cool as 40 years ago!
The chart presented below shows the mean winter temperature of the 4 stations combined. The green curve is the 10-year smoothing.

Chart cropped here. 
Today we see that Germany’s winter temperatures are just as cool as they were 40 years ago and that the linear trend showing a slight warming is “statistically insignificant”.
German mountains cooling over past 30 years
Aigner concludes that over the past 30 winters, the four mountains stations have shown a cooling of 0.8°C. The Feldberg station in the Black Forest has seen no winter trend at all over the past 50 years.
Aigner notes that climate change has not been impacting the German ski industry and that there has been “a growing gap between the public perception and the official data and that this needs to be investigated.
German warming due to more sunshine hours
Aigner does remind, however, that Germany’s annual mean temperature indeed has been rising, but that the phenomenon is due to hotter summers that are correlated with considerably more sunshine hours.
Germany hasn’t warmed because of CO2, but because naturally changing weather patterns have led to more sunshine in a country that is otherwise known for its gray, dreary weather. Most Germans would welcome that change and see no catastrophe there.

Share this...FacebookTwitterWhen a paper dealing with ocean heat absorption was found to have errors and in need of correction, the BBC reported it to the public. The German media, however, were perfectly content to leave its viewers and readers misinformed.

Controversial paper was forced to be corrected. 
====================================================
Dangerous Groupthink
By Die kalte Sonne
(German text translated by P. Gosselin)
At the end of October 2018, Resplandy et al. published a study on ocean heat in Nature. Nic Lewis quickly discovered errors in the calculations (we reported here in the blog). The authors acknowledged the error and are now working on an improved version. On the publisher’s side a corresponding note was added:
19 November 2018: Editor’s Note: We would like to alert readers that the authors have informed us of errors in the paper. An implication of the errors is that the uncertainties in ocean heat content are substantially underestimated. We are working with the authors to establish the quantitative impact of the errors on the published results, at which point in time we will provide a further update.”
That’s how science works. A good example of how to deal professionally with a mistake.
The BBC reported on the incident in a transparent manner. The German press, on the other hand, preferred to withdraw into its shell and conceal the incident.

"The Bahamas, for those who live there, is simply a place to call home. For many Americans, it’s a dream vacation spot. But Hurricane Dorian turned that dream into a nightmare. And the worst part is this is only the beginning. Because unless we confront the climate crisis, warming will turn more and more of our fantastic landscapes, cities we call paradise and other dream destinations into nightmarish hellscapes.  While the science has yet to come in on the specifics of just how much worse climate change made Dorian, we already know enough to say that warming worsened the damage. Because it’s not a coincidence that Dorian was one of the strongest landfalling storms ever recorded in the Atlantic, with the strongest sustained peak winds east of Florida, and the strongest ever to hit the Bahamas. This comes less than a year after Florida withstood the first landfalling category 5 hurricane in decades, on 5 October – the latest ever in the season for a storm that strong. On a basic physics level, we know that warm waters fuel hurricanes, and Dorian was strengthened by waters well above average temperatures. The fact that climate change has heated up our oceans means Dorian was stronger than it would have been had we not spent the past 150 years dumping carbon pollution into the atmosphere. Sea surface temperatures were more than 1C warmer in the region where Dorian formed and strengthened than they were before we started burning fossil fuels. Empirically, there is a roughly 7% increase in maximum sustained wind speeds of the strongest storms for each 1C of warming. Since destructive potential is proportional to the third power of the wind speed, that corresponds to a 23% increase in potential wind damage. We saw that wind damage in the heartbreaking scenes of total devastation that have come in from the Bahamas. We know that the warmer air gets, the more moisture it can hold – and then turn into flooding rains in a storm like this. And we know that as climate change has melted glaciers and ice around the world, that water has gone into the oceans. The extra water, along with the expansion of water as it’s warmed, means that sea levels have been raised. That means when a storm like Dorian makes landfall, there’s more water for its storm surge, already bolstered by stronger winds, to push further inland. All that extra water makes hurricanes even more deadly, since it’s generally not the wind but the water that kills people. So although Dorian’s 220mph gusts were incredibly dangerous (and sped up thanks to climate change), it was the 20-plus feet of storm surge and torrential rains that were the most destructive elements. But there are two other ways that warming has probably worsened Dorian’s damage. One is that all that warm water allowed for the storm to ramp up quickly, undergoing what is known as rapid intensification as it exploded from a moderate category 2 to extreme category 5 over just two days. A recent study has shown that this is getting more common because of climate change, and indeed the past few years have seen many similar examples of this effect in action. Dorian was the fourth category 5 storm in just the last four years. So while climate change is making it so hurricanes can spin up quickly, it may also be slowing down how fast hurricanes move. Instead of moving across a coast and dissipating as normal, in recent years these storms are lingering longer in place, which means more flooding as the water piles up. For example, that’s exactly what we saw in Houston during Harvey, and in North Carolina during Florence. Had Dorian been moving at a regular pace of a few miles an hour, the devastation in the Bahamas would have been much less severe. But because it sat in place, basically stationary, the damage has been catastrophic. Again, Dorian is far from unique in moving slowly, as a study last year found a 10% decrease in speed for storms like this globally, while a similar study found a 17% decrease along the east coast of the US. While neither of these studies directly tie that slowdown to climate change, the theory that climate change is changing the jet stream in ways that would lead to stalling storms (a phenomenon one of us has researched) is growing increasingly convincing. When all these factors combine in one storm, as it has for Dorian, it is truly a nightmare scenario – and a preview of the climate crisis to come. The only question is whether we have the foresight to address it. Michael Mann is distinguished professor of atmospheric science at Pennsylvania State University.

"The Seventh-day Adventist church in the US adheres historically to vegetarianism, in large part to the teachings of a co-founder of the church – Ellen G White – who advocated for meat-free diet habits following a prophetic vision. Mrs White apparently thought eating animal flesh would “excite and strengthen the lower passions” and had “the tendency to deaden the moral powers”. For almost a decade from the late 19th century a slice of America was marketed and brought up on meat substitutes such as Nuteena, a peanut-based loaf, along with Wham, Tuno, FriChick and Big Franks. While there has always been a market for growing numbers of vegetarians and vegans worldwide, the cause of meat-free diets has been given in recent years a rocket boost, not by religion but by reason. Diet is among lifestyle changes urgently needed if developed nations are to have a hope of meeting targets for reduced carbon emissions, a must to halt global heating. Every environmentalist and a great many ordinary people – including plenty of non-vegetarians – know that grains, vegetables and pulses including soya ought to soon form a far larger share of the typical western diet than they do at present. Industrialised agriculture and livestock farming are massively carbon-intensive activities. While the UN estimates they cause 23% of global emissions, critics believe this is an underestimate and the true total is far higher.  Last week KFC (formerly Kentucky Fried Chicken) became the latest fast food giant to announce that it is working on new products based on meat substitutes: in this case, “Beyond Fried Chicken”, a vegan nugget developed in partnership with California-based company Beyond Meat. Following Burger King’s launch this year of the meat-free Whopper, with ingredients supplied by Beyond Meat’s main competitor, Impossible Foods, the KFC announcement confirms what was already clear: there is real momentum, and money, behind the growth of plant-based alternatives to meat. Veganism in the UK is nothing new. But for some people it is changing our food landscape too fast. Last year the bakery chain Greggs faced criticism for selling a vegan sausage roll filled with meat-free Quorn. When a row between food writer Selene Nelson and Waitrose magazine editor William Sitwell exploded into headlines after Mr Sitwell sent such a rude reply to a proposal for a vegan recipe series, he resigned. It is ridiculous to treat shoppers for pastry snacks as warriors in a culture war. The structural shifts required to address the climate crisis will not be made in bakeries. The countries that drove the global rise in the consumption of animal products in the past are not the ones that will do so in future. But that doesn’t mean the rich world can go on eating beef and lamb with impunity, any more than we can continue to fly around the world without thinking about the harm that air traffic entails. Instead, we should take heart from the instances in which behaviour change is a message that consumers are willing to consider (the reduction in plastic bag use is another). Greggs’ shares jumped more than 13% between February and March this year, and the company is working on a vegan version of its steak bake. Bring it on. "
"According to research published last week by US scientists, hajj is set to become a danger zone. As soon as next year, they say, summer days in Mecca could exceed the “extreme danger” heat-stress threshold. The news comes just weeks after over 2 million people completed their journey of a lifetime. The environmental threat to the holy pilgrimage is a panic button for British Muslims like me, signaling that the climate crisis is endangering an age-old sacred rite. Hajj is a pillar of Islam that I’ve yet to undertake, and the physical endurance required will only become more gruelling in coming decades – scientists predict that heat and humidity levels during hajj will exceed the extreme danger threshold 20% of the time from 2045 and 2053, and 42% of the time between 2079 and 2086.  Environmental stewardship may well be advocated by my faith – the Quran states that humans are appointed as “caretakers of the Earth” and the prophet Muhammad organised the planting of trees and created conservation areas called hima – but it hasn’t mobilised Muslims on a mass scale for what the world needs now: a global eco-jihad. Fazlun Khalid, founder of Islamic Foundation for Ecology and Environmental Sciences and author of Signs on the Earth: Islam, Modernity and the Climate Crisis, has been on a green mission for over 35 years, but his biggest challenge has been to motivate Muslims. “Islam is inherently environmental, but modernity has induced all of us to distance ourselves from nature. The reason I don’t give up is my grandchildren – what kind of planet will they inherit? How can they perform hajj under those conditions?” Khalid previously gathered a team of scholars and academics who drafted the Islamic declaration on climate change adopted at the International Islamic climate change symposium in Istanbul in 2015 (an event co-sponsored by Islamic Relief, a global charity that is again calling on Muslims to take action now if they want to safeguard the pilgrimage for future generations). Maria Zafar of Islamic Relief UK said: “Hajj has physically demanding outdoor rituals which can become hazardous to humans. It isn’t only Mecca, other sacred sites will be at risk too, like the religious sites in Jerusalem, the Golden Temple in India – it will affect what we hold dear to our hearts. We think that climate change is distant from us, but there is no area of life that it won’t touch.” If we are truly to tackle a catastrophe as huge as the climate crisis, we have to make it personal. Without a personal stake, it remains an abstract and we unite in perpetuating it. So if money is the only form of emotional investment for some, and if economics wields more power than the will to save our planet, we must use it. Next year Saudi Arabia is hosting the G20 summit, so let’s pressure the country to consider the financial threat due to a loss of religious tourism. Hajj is lucrative: economic experts have said revenues from hajj and umrah (a lesser pilgrimage undertaken any time of year) are set to exceed $150bn by 2022. “For the Saudis, hajj is more precious than oil,” says Dr Husna Ahmad, CEO of Global One, who’s been campaigning for a greener hajj for years. Ahmad created a green guide to hajj in 2011, and is now working on a green hajj app, which she plans to launch next year if funding is secured. With approximately 100m plastic bottles left behind each year after the pilgrimage ends, it’s clear that action is desperately needed. Slowly, Saudi authorities are beginning to implement a more environmentally friendly hajj by installing recycling points around the holy sites, and they aim to cut waste volumes by two-thirds by 2030. Pushing for change has been a struggle in the kingdom, but apathy is a wider problem. It’s bound up in socio-economic deprivation, and too often “saving the planet” is seen as something for the rich, a kind of green elitism. “Right now in the UK it feels like middle-class white women – and Sadiq Khan – are the only ones taking up the baton,” says Ahmad. “We know that climate change started with the European industrial revolution and poverty is inextricably linked to that. “People are trying to survive, you can’t blame them if climate change is not their priority. This is why achieving the UN sustainable development goals are high on my agenda.” The climate crisis does not exist in and cannot be tackled in isolation. While the big dogs must green-up their institutions and businesses, grassroots activists need better relations with governing bodies, more Muslims need to get involved with the broader debate and we all need to rethink our lifestyles – cut down on meat consumption, use less packaging and step back from throwaway consumerism. We all have a part to play – institutionally, socially, morally, economically and religiously. Whether it’s through the lens of our conscience, faith or finance, it’s imperative to find our own catalyst for action. If the threat to hajj can motivate Muslims, then that’s all for the good. • Remona Aly is a journalist and commentator"

Problems with the climate problem

Image source: BoD – Books on Demand
At the end of July Eike Roth published a book titled “Problems with the climate problem: A myth crumbles“.  The book’s description:
The climate is changing in a threatening manner. It has already become a degree warmer. It is man’s fault. Its CO2 releases endanger its existence. We have only a few years left to fundamentally change our behavior, otherwise the consequences will be catastrophic. Science agrees on this.
That is what we hear every day from every direction.
In this book precisely this is questioned in the this book. The situation, severity and breadth of the climate optimum, the climatic and non-climatic effects of CO2, the increase in extreme weather events, the strength and speed of anthropogenic climate change, the accuracy of climate models and their agreement with observed climate developments, the possibility or probability of other causes of observed climate change and the effectiveness, prospects of success and side effects of the initiated or required countermeasures are carefully examined.
The result shows that there is general agreement on the principles of the greenhouse effect and its anthropogenic intensification. However, it also identifies a whole series of points on which there is no consensus, at least not yet, and in some cases even serious dissent. For each of these points, it is explained in an understandable way what is specifically controversial and what significance this has for the climate problem as a whole.
All in all, the picture of the climate problem is very different from the one portrayed above. In view of the importance of the problem, it is necessary to clarify the outstanding issues as quickly as possible. Suggestions are made for further action.”
The book costs € 9,50 and can be ordered via BoD or Amazon.

"The Clark county death investigator Jill Roberts vividly recalls the sunny 115F (46C) afternoon last summer when she entered a Las Vegas home with no functional air conditioning. The indoor heat felt even worse than the broiling temperature outside. She climbed up the stairs, through thick, stifling air, landing in a third-story bedroom where the resident had died in sweltering conditions. The room had no fan and the door was shut. It felt as if it couldn’t get any hotter. “Our elements are unforgiving. Especially on those 115F days, it doesn’t take a lot,” Roberts told the Guardian. “In that situation I’ll go stand in the sun in the 115F heat to do my paperwork as opposed to staying in the house because it’s that hot.” The coroner’s office in Clark county, which encompasses Las Vegas, often records heat as a contributing factor to accidental deaths. There are hikers succumbing to lethal temperatures in the surrounding desert and heat-related deaths in cars and homes when occupants forgo cooling. Roberts has seen homeless people with post-mortem burns from collapsing on hot streets. And it will get worse. Las Vegas is the fastest-warming city in the United States, its temperatures having risen 5.76F since 1970. A June study of coroner data by the Las Vegas-based Desert Research Institute found a correlation between heatwaves and heat-related deaths in southern Nevada, both of which, they say, are on the rise. And a recent Union of Concerned Scientists (UCS) report warns that without global action to reduce carbon emissions, the city will probably experience 96 days of heat above 100F by the end of the century, including 60 days over 105F, and seven “off the chart” days that would break the current heat index. Every city has its own challenges in adapting to climate change, even those that are supposedly accustomed to severe heat. In Las Vegas, a laissez-faire attitude toward growth has allowed high temperatures to become even more deadly, and the scorching heat now threatens the city’s basic functionality. Like the tourist guzzling alcohol by the resort pool, smiling and flirting until he faints from dehydration, southern Nevada has welcomed unfettered development since the 1930s – the advent of the home cooling era – when its population began to double in size nearly every decade despite limited water resources and increased drought. The resorts have long been the economic driver. Over a third of the area’s workforce is supported by the 40 million visitors a year who descend on their gargantuan hotel towers, bustling casinos and massive convention halls. And as tourism grows, so does the population. During the boom years before the 2008 housing crisis, hundreds of miles of desert landscape were paved over with heat-absorbing asphalt and concrete, worsening a “heat island” effect in the cauldron-like valley. Outward growth also led to vehicles motoring further across the sprawling metropolis, increasing heat-trapping carbon emissions. Now, with growth having continued each year since 2011, and new home developments returning to boom-era levels, Sin City is reckoning with a future that looks downright hellish. “The thing about Vegas is, we always do feast and famine,” said Tick Segerblom, a former state senator who now sits on the Clark county commission, which governs the Las Vegas Valley. “We never bother to say, ‘Where are we going? What are we doing?’” During summer months, when Las Vegas city buses break down notoriously often, many pedestrians carry umbrellas to protect their skin, and those without cover often “shadow walk”, following the shade of palm trees, signs and buildings to avoid direct exposure to a sunshine that can cause humans to overheat. The city’s poorest residents are most at risk. Fans and cooling systems can save lives, said Jill Roberts, the coroner office investigator, “but some people just don’t have the funds to fix their air conditioning or have working equipment”. Hundreds of homeless people living in the city choose to camp in storm drains rather than sleep above ground – another dystopian irony to the city’s reputation for glitz and glamor. Those who dislike the tunnels often have to work hard to stay cool. Marcy Averett, 49, and her husband spend 15 hours a day collecting recyclables. But each day before they set off, they buy ice. “I have to have cold water. I don’t know how people do it with hot water,” she told the Guardian on an August afternoon as she dragged a shopping cart filled with aluminum cans out of the blistering sun, into the shade of a highway overpass. An orange cooler hung from the side of her cart. Averett had a spray bottle to mist her face and neck, and applied lip balm as we spoke. “I put medicated moisturizer on my lips constantly, all day every day, and my lips are still cracked. It’s this heat.” Like many other rapidly warming cities across the United States, Vegas has only recently begun to reckon with its future. “The real question is, do we want a place where we just go from our houses to our cars to our offices, and never go outside because it’s too hot?” Segerblom, the former state senator, asked. “How many months of the year is that tenable?” Rachel Licker of the Union of Concerned Scientists warned that southern Nevada’s productivity and essential services will become increasingly stressed as temperatures rise – construction projects will slow or stop more frequently to ensure worker safety; police and postal workers may be affected; and since studies show schoolchildren perform worse as temperatures rise, teachers may need to adjust testing schedules and standards for days if not months at a time. Meanwhile, power surges may become more common if increased demand overwhelms electrical grids, leaving the people most sensitive to heat illness such as children and the elderly without a cooling system when it’s needed most. “Even though people in Las Vegas might be used to high levels of heat, it’s going to get even hotter, and we don’t know how much they’re going to be able to withstand,” Licker said. As Las Vegas Valley reaches its limits, many in the community believe now is an opportune time to contemplate the future of the city. “What do we want to be when we grow up?” said Segerblom. “Is there a way to manage this valley that’s good for the quality of life of the citizens of Nevada, not just for the tourists and hotels?” He noted that while state and federal policies get the most media attention, municipal governments can affect the environment just as well. Planting more native trees and shrubs, enforcing energy-efficient building standards, zoning to promote upward rather than outward growth, and developing alternatives to blacktop roads and concrete sidewalks are all policies that could have a major impact. To lessen its own carbon footprint, the city of Las Vegas began powering all government buildings and streetlights with renewable energy in 2016. The state’s largest energy consumers, the multi-thousand room hotels and casinos on the Strip, have also made environmental sustainability a priority in recent years. MGM Resorts has over 20 acres of solar panels atop the Mandalay Bay convention center, and much of the electricity flowing through properties like the Bellagio, Luxor and New York, New York comes from a solar array in the Mojave Desert. “We do feel it’s our responsibility to find innovative ways to use less energy and procure clean energy for our resorts,” said Mark Campbell, MGM Resorts’ executive director of sustainability. The company also donates unserved banquet food to a local food bank and uses smart thermostats to avoid cooling vacant rooms. For their part, Nevada voters passed a ballot initiative requiring state utilities to get 50% of their electricity from renewable sources by 2030. As a constitutional amendment, the proposal needs to pass a second time to take effect. But state lawmakers made that vote moot by adopting the standards on their own, on Earth Day 2019, through a legislative bill that received unanimous support. Nevada is rare state now in which reducing carbon emissions has become a bipartisan concern. In seeking more access to clean energy sources, the state hopes to get ahead of the dilemma posed by longer and more intensive air conditioning seasons that amount to more greenhouse gas emissions spewed into the air. “Heat is currently the top killer for weather-related hazards in the United States,” said Licker. “Those kinds of numbers would just get worse if we’re headed toward really significant climate change.”"

Share this...FacebookTwitterA new paper appearing in the journal Earth Sciences here authored by Hermann Harde of the Helmut-Schmidt-University, Hamburg Germany, is stirring up more controversy among the climate science community, which generally claims humans have been responsible for rise in atmospheric CO2 concentrations since the mid 19th century.
The opposite is true
According to Harde, it is not the added CO2 that is causing the global temperature to rise, but just opposite: “The temperature itself dominantly controls the CO2 increase. Therefore, not CO2 but primarily native impacts are responsible for any observed climate changes.”
Harde claims this is backed up by and “in agreement with all observations.”
The paper is expected to generate much opposition in a science whose claimed consensus has increasingly come under fire.
What follows below is the paper’s abstract:
The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change assumes that the inclining atmospheric CO2 concentration over recent years was almost exclusively determined by anthropogenic emissions, and this increase is made responsible for the rising temperature over the Industrial Era. Due to the far reaching consequences of this assertion, in this contribution we critically scrutinize different carbon cycle models and compare them with observations. We further contrast them with an alternative concept, which also includes temperature dependent natural emission and absorption with an uptake rate scaling proportional with the CO2 concentration. We show that this approach is in agreement with all observations, and under this premise not really human activities are responsible for the observed CO2 increase and the expected temperature rise in the atmosphere, but just opposite the temperature itself dominantly controls the CO2 increase. Therefore, not CO2 but primarily native impacts are responsible for any observed climate changes.”
The study builds on a previous controversial paper published in 2017: Scrutinizing the carbon cycle and CO2 residence time in the atmosphere in the journal Global and Planetary Change.
Hermann Harde is not alone in backing the hypothesis that temperature drives CO2, and not the other way around. Other scientists in Harde’s camp include, among others, Dr. Murry Salby. formerly of the Macquarie University in Sydney.

In climate models, the Earth continues to be flat
By Kalte Sonne
(German text translated by P Gosselin)
Did you know that all climate models assume a flat earth? Hard to believe, but unfortunately true. A study by Michael Prather and Juno Hsu in PNAS explains that this simplification causes powerful distortions in computer simulations.:

A round Earth for climate models
Sunlight drives the Earth’s weather, climate, chemistry, and biosphere. Recent efforts to improve solar heating codes in climate models focused on more accurate treatment of the absorption spectrum or fractional clouds. A mostly forgotten assumption in climate models is that of a flat Earth atmosphere. Spherical atmospheres intercept 2.5 W⋅m−2 more sunlight and heat the climate by an additional 1.5 W⋅m−2 globally. Such a systematic shift, being comparable to the radiative forcing change from preindustrial to present, is likely to produce a discernible climate shift that would alter a model’s skill in simulating current climate. Regional heating errors, particularly at high latitudes, are several times larger. Unlike flat atmospheres, constituents in a spherical atmosphere, such as clouds and aerosols, alter the total amount of energy received by the Earth. To calculate the net cooling of aerosols in a spherical framework, one must count the increases in both incident and reflected sunlight, thus reducing the aerosol effect by 10 to 14% relative to using just the increase in reflected. Simple fixes to the current flat Earth climate models can correct much of this oversight, although some inconsistencies will remain.
Significance
Early climate and weather models, constrained by computing resources, made numerical approximations on modeling the real world. One process, the radiative transfer of sunlight through the atmosphere, has always been a costly component. As computational ability expanded, these models added resolution, processes, and numerical methods to reduce errors and become the Earth system models that we use today. While many of the original approximations have since been improved, one—that the Earth’s surface and atmosphere are locally flat—remains in current models. Correcting from flat to spherical atmospheres leads to regionally differential solar heating at rates comparable to the climate forcing by greenhouse gases and aerosols. In addition, spherical atmospheres change how we evaluate the aerosol direct radiative forcing.
The authors stress that the resulting errors are in the order of magnitude of the greenhouse gas forcing. Thus the solar irradiation and the aerosol forcing are falsified.
So in the future, when someone insults annoying climate critics again as “flat-world supporters”, the answer is basically clear: The real “flat earthers” are climate modelers who still simulate flat worlds due to their limited computer computing power, and who have not yet been able to simulate the real world…

Share this...FacebookTwitterAs reported in 4 separately-published papers, scientists have discovered a mechanism whereby islands can build themselves up naturally, thwarting the threat of sea level rise.  Tuck et al. (2019) affirm the “implications of island building are profound, as it will offset existing scenarios of dramatic increases in island flooding.”
Earlier this year, Duvat (2019) identified a global trend in island shoreline net growth despite recent sea level rise.
The welcome news is that none of the islands larger than 10 ha – and just 1.2% of the 334 islands larger than 5 ha – have decreased in size since the 1980s. Nearly 90% of the world’s islands have been stable to expanding in coastal area during recent decades.

Image Source: Duvat, 2019
In four other new papers, 3 of them with Auckland University Ph.D candidate Megan E. Tuck as lead author, scientists have discovered a mechanism whereby islands have the capacity to “morphodynamically respond to rising sea level” via wave-driven “overwash processes”.
The implications are profound. The most concerning impacts of sea level rise may effectively be thwarted by natural processes and consequently “many islands are less vulnerable to inundation than currently perceived.”
Positive developments in marine science like this are indeed worth reporting in 4 papers and 3 separate scholarly journals within the same calendar year.
This good news also deserves much more coverage than the public is likely to see.

1. Tuck et al., 2019
“Here, we present evidence from physical model experiments of a reef island that demonstrates islands have the capability to morphodynamically respond to rising sea level through island accretion. Challenging outputs from existing models based on the assumption that islands are geomorphologically inert, results demonstrate that islands not only move laterally on reef platforms, but overwash processes provide a mechanism to build and maintain the freeboard of islands above sea level. Implications of island building are profound, as it will offset existing scenarios of dramatic increases in island flooding. Future predictive models must include the morphodynamic behavior of islands to better resolve flood impacts and future island vulnerability.” 
2. Kench and Beetham, 2019
“Coral reef islands are unconsolidated deposits of reef-derived sand and gravel that are considered vulnerable to the impacts of global sea-level rise because of their low elevation (< 3 m) and exposure oceanic wave energy. Previous research has shown that sea-level rise will drive an increase in wave overtopping on reef island shorelines, which will be an increasing hazard for atoll island communities. Here, we show that wave overtopping on reef islands is a geomorphically important process that facilitates sediment deposition on the island surface and vertical building. Field evidence from 26 overwash deposits show that vertical island accretion can be driven by king tides, long-period swell, local storms, tropical cyclones and tsunami. Deposit depths ranged between 0.06–1.93 m and increased island elevations by between 4–400%. Recognition that overwash processes can contribute to vertical island building is instructive in considering the potential for islands to adjust to future increases in sea-level and to incorporate this critical morphodynamic response in future flood risk modelling for low islands.”
3. Tuck et al., 2019
“[R]esults show that the rate and magnitude of physical adjustment is strongly dependent on the rate and magnitude of sea-level rise and wave conditions. Results challenge existing models of future island susceptibility to wave driven flooding, demonstrating that washover processes can provide a mechanism to build and potentially maintain island freeboard above sea level. These insights highlight an urgent need to incorporate island morphodynamics into flood risk models in order to produce accurate assessments of future wave-driven flood risks and better resolve island vulnerability.”
4. Tuck et al., 2019
“Low-lying coral reef islands are considered extremely vulnerable to the impacts of climate change. However, future island morphodynamic adjustments in response to anticipated sea level rise and changing wave conditions are currently poorly resolved. Assertions of island vulnerability are based on outputs from flood risk models that simulate sea level rise on present day island topography despite evidence that many reef islands are highly dynamic landforms. Utilizing a physical modelling methodology, three experiment programs were undertaken to model gravel island morphodynamics in response to increasing sea level and changing wave conditions. Modelling outputs present new insights into the modes and styles of island change, primarily the first experimental evidence that reef islands can keep pace with sea level rise through island building driven by washover processes. Results suggest that many islands are less vulnerable to inundation than currently perceived and may endure on reef platforms despite sea level rise.”

I. The insignificance of modern “global warming”
Today’s ocean temperatures average about 16°C. CO2 levels hover around 400 parts per million (0.04%).
The oceans have warmed at a rate of just 0.015°C per decade since 1971 in the 0-700 m layer according to the IPCC (2013). This warming rate isn’t detectable when considering overall long-term changes in this layer (Rosenthal et al., 2017) during the Holocene.

Image Source: IPCC (2013), Rosenthal et al., 2017
The global oceans have only warmed 0.09°C in the 0-2000 m layer since 1955 (Levitus et al., 2012). This less than one-tenth of a degree Celsius thermal change represents 93% of the modern “global warming” manifestation.

Image Source: Levitus et al., 2012
The oceans have warmed merely 0.021°C since 1994 (Wunsch, 2018), with a cooling trend in the abyssal waters.

Image Source: Wunsch, 2018
In the near-surface layer of the ocean (0-20 m), temperatures rose more than 5 times faster from 1900 to 1945 (~1.2°C, 0.27°C/decade) than they did during 1945 to 2010 (~0.3°C, 0.046°C/decade), which is the opposite of what would be expected if CO2 emissions were driving thermal changes in the ocean (Gouretski et al., 2012).

II. The astounding warmth of the distant past – when marine species thrived
A year ago, Henkes et al. (2018) determined marine animals “thrived” in water temperatures that averaged 35-40°C in “widespread regions of the oceans,” which is more than 20°C warmer than today’s average ocean surface temperature (~16°C).
The authors note that today’s tropical temperatures (25-30°C) can be equated to the “icehouse” conditions of the Carboniferous.
Further, when marine animals thrived in waters >20°C warmer than today, this warmth was accompanied by CO2 levels “5-10x higher than present-day values” – about 2000 to 4000 ppm.

Image Source: Henkes et al., 2018
In a new paper published in Science, Voosen, 2019 uses the data compiled by Henkes et al. (2018) to further reiterate
“Some 450 million years ago, ocean waters averaged 35°C to 40°C, more than 20°C warmer than today. Yet marine life thrived, even diversified”
and to construct a graphical representation of global ocean temperatures from the Paleozoic onwards. Voosen affirms “marine life diversified in extreme heat” and “mammals evolved during a warm period.”

Image Source: Voosen, 2019
In sum, coupling the 1) insignificant thermal ocean changes during modern times and the 2) extreme warmth (and high CO2 levels) of the distant past would seem to support the contention that marine animals are not currently in any sort of obvious danger from either rapid warming or high CO2 levels.

Share this...FacebookTwitterDutch farmers are angry – so much so that hundreds of them have mobilized their tractors and are blocking highways and creating havoc across the Netherlands.
The German language agraraheute.de (Agriculture Today) reports here: “Farmers in the Netherlands are fed up always being the whipping boy of the nation.”
Shutting down modern agriculture
According to agrarheute journalist, Eva Eckinger, all this was triggered by “radical demands made by the leftist liberal D66 government party.” The party is demanding the elimination of half of the country’s livestock!
D66 parliamentarian Tjeerd de Groot said: “There’s no future for intensive animal farming in the Netherlands.”
With their tractors, the angry farmers have wreaked havoc on traffic throughout the Netherlands. According to Germany’s Spiegel, the protesting farmers in the Netherlands have “caused hundreds of kilometers of traffic jams.”
“They blocked the access roads to The Hague with tractors.”
Fox News here reported that the farmers clogged “700 miles of highway” during the protest over emissions rules.
Demanding farmers make extraordinary sacrifices
According to De Groot, nitrogen emissions by agriculture is causing great damage, and a large proportion of Dutch nitrogen emissions comes from intensive livestock farming and so need to be curbed quickly.

De Groot is calling on farmers farmers to practice “closed-loop farming”, where there is a significant reduction in the number of animals and that its implementation should start quickly.
Spreading discontent
Dutch agricultural associations reacted angrily to De Groot’s proposal and said “the agricultural sector had already done a lot to improve sustainability” and so “the sector deserves a compliment – not a halving.”
The Dutch protests come at the heels of the French yellow vest protests, which are aimed at the high fuel taxes imposed on French citizens and businesses, and are the latest, clear signals that citizens are not going to take draconian environmental regulation and harsh climate protection policies quietly.
Growing chasm between ecological and economic interests
The Dutch protests highlight the economic difficulty governments have when they try to pass eco-friendly laws and reducing emissions. Despite the dubious claims that the two can go hand in hand, it is not the case as recent protests are showing. Across Europe there is a rapidly growing chasm between economic interests and radical environmental aims.
“A lot at stake”
As the New York Times reports: “There is a lot at stake: According to the Dutch farmers’ organization, LTO, exports from the Netherlands’ nearly 54,000 farms and agriculture businesses were worth 90.3 billion euros ($98.3 billion) last year.”
That’s just one sector in a small European country. Imagine the things to come should major continentwide industries like petroleum, tourism and airlines, etc. be hit – or the German auto industry.
The radical environmentalists are keeping their social-economic powder kegs awfully dry.

"Last fall, as I landed in New Orleans, a seed of existential anxiety lodged itself deep in my gut. It was my fifth flight in just over a week. I was in the middle of a tour to promote a book on how coastal communities around the US were already responding to the climate crisis in surprising, often radical ways. Outside, the bayou shimmered below, the city itself barely distinguishable from the water that surrounds it. I could see the landscape that my air travel would play a role in diminishing – the additional CO2 in the atmosphere melting Arctic sea ice and Antarctic glaciers, causing sea levels to rise. What am I doing here? I wondered.  I posted an anxious tweet, asking if anyone had any bright ideas about what to do when your work – expanding the public conversation around the climate crisis – requires that you consume fossil fuels at a rate at odds with your values. I received a host of responses – fly less for vacations, purchase carbon offsets, use Skype instead. All of the options, save for one, focused on things I could do at an individual level, many of which I already did. It seemed to me the suggestions sought to assuage my personal feelings of shame and so fell short of whatever intelligence I was hoping the gaping maw of the internet might offer up. Since 2010, I have been researching and writing about sea-level rise. During that time the predictions for just how high the water might reach by 2100 have, in many places, more than doubled. Meanwhile, from 2010 to 2017 nearly  500,000 Americans filed flood insurance claims, and hundreds of thousands more experienced flooding first-hand. When you compare the claims filed during, say, the eight years of Reagan’s presidency to those mentioned above the numbers more than double. Which is to say for many living in low-lying areas the climate crisis is already here. One of the things I remember most clearly from my early research trips to rural flood-prone communities is that residents told me how alone they felt. Most knew of no other place whose suffering was somehow analogous to their own, or other people they might consult to learn how to tackle their flooding problem. Sometimes people tried to safeguard their homes themselves, building retaining walls out of brick, sandbags and stone. As Harvey bore down on Houston, Kristin Massey attempted to wrap her ranch in heavy-duty plastic sheeting after shelling out $130,000 to repair it in the wake of the floods that swamped the city the two years prior. But despite Massey’s efforts, her home still filled with water, displacing her family for the third time in three years. She would learn what many already knew: that overwhelmingly these individual fixes fail. As I have watched the US inundated, again and again, by record-breaking storms, another equally powerful phenomenon has begun to unfold. Across the country, community-led flood-survivor groups are popping up. There’s Residents Against Flooding in Houston, and Groundswell in Charleston, the Just Florence Recovery Coalition and Horry County Rising. Many begin online, in advance of a storm, and serve as information-sharing networks around where to get sandbags, the location of local shelters, and the latest weather predictions. Once the flood waters recede, the focus shifts to the process of recovery, covering everything from how to file a flood claim to which contractors are least likely to rip you off. But when one flood turns into two, then three or four or five, residents’ focus often shifts from how to weather individual storms towards identifying causes and advocating for community-wide solutions. The scale of concern shifts from the singular to the systemic. This summer, Higher Ground, the largest coalition of flood survivors in the country, started a nationwide campaign of their own. In addition to empowering frontline communities by connecting them to pro-bono legal and scientific counsel, the group began disrupting city council meetings by unfurling banners that read: The United Flooded States of America. Member groups have filed lawsuits against unlawful wetland development and the unjust use of flood pumps during storm events. They have started local taskforces to inform people of the underlying infrastructure problems that exacerbate flooding, what resources to demand elected officials provide, and the role that climate change has played in amplifying their pre-existing vulnerability. Some have filed for temporary injunctions against floodplain development, while others even advocated for managed retreat, the only mitigation strategy that moves residents permanently away from risk. Allison Sedatol Reviere, whose home in Lafayette, Louisiana flooded for the fifth time in five years during Hurricane Barry, recently joined forces with Higher Ground. “No one, no one would buy my home. I have five flood claims since 2014. I felt trapped. But through this flood survivor network I found out that I was not alone, and that there was help available, that a buyout of my home was possible.” As Barry spun in the Gulf, Sedatol Reviere went through the motions of elevating her furniture and evacuating, but this time with the knowledge that this flood would likely be her last. At the end of my presentation last year in in New Orleans, an audience member asked me whether I still have hope? The hope that I do have does not revolve around individual choices (often framed through the lens of consumption). The hope that I do have is not about buying LED lightbulbs and electric cars; it’s not about eating vegan or bringing a canvas bag to the supermarket. These things can signal a shift in consumer habits (and those signals are extremely important), but they also frame the climate crisis as something that ought to be combated at the individual level, which, as Mary Annaïse Heglar of the Natural Resource Defense Council recently pointed out, leads those who cannot afford such decisions to feel paralyzed while simultaneously letting the fossil fuel industry off the hook. The hope I do have resides in the fact that as the climate crisis comes home to us in deeply unsettling ways – in the form of heatwaves and freak storms, wildfires, and permafrost melt, twisting the world we know into new and disturbing shapes – it is also building unlikely coalitions amongst people who might not appear to share affinities at first glance. Since 2017, the US has endured the single costliest hurricane season in its history, meanwhile Higher Ground’s membership has ballooned to over 50,000 people. With a rise in risk has also come an awareness that our vulnerability to those risks is shared, if unevenly distributed. A recent study suggests that as many as 41 million Americans live in a home at risk to flooding – roughly 13% of the population. From this place it is much easier to identify the root of the problem: that unjust development and the fossil fuel industry have made our communities less safe while super-charging the storms to come. Elizabeth Sawin, the director of Climate Interactive, recently recommended that we begin to shift our focus away from what we alone cannot accomplish, away from our profoundly individualist society, and towards the kind of thinking that helps us to glimpse what is possible when people come together to demand change. Her words helped me to connect what I had seen: that the only personal action that can slow the tide of the climate crisis is to create a coalition bigger and more powerful than the individuals of which it is comprised. All around the globe members of various environmental groups – enter the Extinction Rebellion, 350.org, Fridays for the Future and the Sunrise Movement – are already making good on Sawin’s suggestion. A week after returning home, I attended a Nationalize Grid meeting in Rhode Island. As I glimpsed all the other people that were organizing to influence how energy is derived and distributed in that state, at last I felt some of my climate anxiety dissipate. It isn’t my first round of environmental activism, nor my last, but it is the first time that I recognize these actions as their own kind of carbon offset. But better. Because instead of marrying guilt to redemption, they strive to make cheap fossil fuels a thing of the past. Elizabeth Rush is the author of Rising: Dispatches from the New American Shore, a finalist for the Pulitzer prize in general nonfiction • This article was amended on 30 August and 2 September 2019 to correct the spelling of Elizabeth Sawin’s surname, and because an earlier version misnamed the Natural Resource Defense Council as the National Resource Defense Council.

"A mayor in the French alps has urged Emmanuel Macron to take action against “wackos” climbing Mont Blanc, after incidents including a British tourist abandoning a rowing machine on western Europe’s highest peak.  Jean-Marc Peillex, mayor of Saint-Gervais, who for years has sounded the alarm against overcrowding on Mont Blanc, said a member of the British “Royal Commandos”, thought to mean the Royal Marines, hauled up the exercise machine for a stunt on Saturday.  But he did not have the strength to bring it back down and left it in an emergency hut situated at 4,362 metres (14,300 feet). The man gave his name as Disney, said Peillex in an open letter published on Sunday, adding “with a name like that, you’d think he thought he was at an amusement park”. Also over the weekend, he said, a German tourist made the ascent with his dog, despite warnings not to do so from police brigades who patrol Mont Blanc during the busy summer season. He had promised he would leave his dog at a refuge before attempting the summit, said Peillex. Instead, he left in the middle of the night for the summit with the dog, which survived but returned with bloodied paws, according to photos posted on Peillex’s Twitter account. The incidents over the weekend came after two Swiss climbers landed a small plane east of Mont Blanc’s summit in June and started hiking to the top. Intercepted by mountain police, they were handed a fine of €38 and allowed to fly off, since technically they had only broken 1960s’ laws designating landing sites in the area. “This situation has gone on long enough,” Peillex said. He called on Macron to “write and pass laws without delay that from 2020 would severely punish all these wackos who break the law, and restore peace to Mont Blanc”. Officials are struggling to cope with a huge influx of climbers hoping to scale the 4,810-metre (15,774ft) peak, heightening the security risks as well as environmental impact. Warmer temperatures in recent years have melted the permafrost, raising the risk of rock falls on the most popular routes. Retreating glaciers, which are melting under the effect of global heating, are also leaving the granite slopes more vulnerable and prone to erosion. In May, officials banned climbers from scaling Mont Blanc unless they had booked a room in one of the three official shelters. The Alpine peak attracts nearly 25,000 climbers every year, but the daily crowds have led to flaring tempers among teams jockeying for position, and rampant illegal camping. So far this season, at least three climbers have died on Mont Blanc."

Share this...FacebookTwitterFor the perceived destruction of the planet, angry teenage activist Greta Thunberg puts the blame on economic growth and capitalism. Yet she doesn’t talk much about any alternative system that could provide for our needs.
The question arises: Is it even possible for human society to progress without economic growth?
An ecological Chinese-style global economy
One chief editor at German WDR public television thinks it is possible: People will just have to get used to austerity.
In an interview, Ulrich Ueckerseifer told the WDR that it would be possible for a global economy to function without growth “in the form of a managed market economy, for example. In a nutshell: a bit like China, but ecologically”.
Ueckerseifer said to do this there would have to be very strong targets and limits and that “no more environmental pollution would be allowed to be produced”.

The WDR chief business editor said this would require “a high level of willingness on the part of the population to do without.”
Dictatorship “the most socially just”
A growing number of activists and political leaders are seeing growth and sustainability as being incompatible, and many are calling for a system of rigid regulation. For example, German Green Party leader Annalena Baerbock sees regulatory measures as a central element for better climate protection.
According to German weekly FOCUS here: “Yes, for me regulatory law is the central element, because it is also the most socially just. This is also the instrument in environmental policy that has always helped us,” Baerbock told Deutschlandfunk radio.
How nice. All our climate “problems” can be solved – with just a little bit of dictatorship!
Already again authoritarian ideas and dreams are in vogue in the German political discourse.

Sun follows planets’ rhythm
New study corroborates the influence of planetary tidal forces on solar activity

Images: NASA (public domain)
One of the big questions in solar physics is why the Sun’s activity follows a regular cycle of 11 years. Researchers from the Helmholtz-Zentrum Dresden-Rossendorf (HZDR), an independent German research institute, now present new findings, indicating that the tidal forces of Venus, Earth and Jupiter influence the solar magnetic field, thus governing the solar cycle. The team of researchers present their findings in the journal Solar Physics (doi: 10.1007/s11207-019-1447-1).
In principle, it is not unusual for the magnetic activity of a star like the Sun to undergo cyclic oscillation. And yet past models have been unable to adequately explain the very regular cycle of the sun. The HZDR research team has now succeeded in demonstrating that the planetary tidal forces on the Sun act like an outer clock, and are the decisive factor behind its steady rhythm. To accomplish this result, the scientists systematically compared historical observations of solar activity from the last thousand years with planetary constellations, statistically proving that the two phenomena are linked. “There is an astonishingly high level of concordance: what we see is complete parallelism with the planets over the course of 90 cycles,” enthused Frank Stefani, lead author of the study. “Everything points to a clocked process.”
As with the gravitational pull of the Moon causing tides on Earth, planets are able to displace the hot plasma on the Sun’s surface. Tidal forces are strongest when there is maximum Venus-Earth-Jupiter alignment; a constellation that occurs every 11.07 years. But the effect is too weak to significantly perturb the flow in the solar interior, which is why the temporal coincidence was long neglected. However, the HZDR researchers then found evidence of a potential indirect mechanism that may be able to influence the solar magnetic field via tidal forces: oscillations in the Tayler instability, a physical effect that, from a certain current, can change the behavior of a conductive liquid or of a plasma. Building on this concept, the scientists developed their first model in 2016; they have since advanced this model in their new study to present a more realistic scenario.
Small trigger with a major impact: tides utilize instability

In the hot plasma of the Sun, the Tayler instability perturbs the flux and the magnetic field, itself reacting very sensitively to tiny forces. A small thrust of energy is enough for the perturbations to oscillate between right-handed and left-handed helicity (the projection of the spin onto the direction of momentum). The momentum required for this may be induced by planetary tidal forces every eleven years – ultimately also setting the rhythm at which the magnetic field reverses the polarity of the Sun.
“When I first read about ideas linking the solar dynamo to planets, I was very skeptical,” Stefani recalled. “But when we discovered the current-driven Tayler instability undergoing helicity oscillations in our computer simulations, I asked myself: What would happen if the plasma was impacted on by a small, tidal-like perturbation? The result was phenomenal. The oscillation was really excited and became synchronized with the timing of the external perturbation.”
Solar dynamo with an added touch
In the standard scenario of a dynamo, the rotation of the Sun and the complex motion of the solar plasma create a cyclically changing magnetic field. Two effects interact here: the plasma rotates more quickly at the Sun’s equator than at the poles. This leads to the omega effect: the magnetic field lines frozen in the plasma stretch around the Sun and convert the magnetic field into a field aligned almost parallel to the Sun’s equator. The alpha effect describes a mechanism that twists magnetic field lines, forcing the magnetic field back into a north-south direction.
What exactly causes the alpha effect, however, is a subject of dispute. Stefani’s model indicates that the Tayler instability is partly responsible for this. The researchers consider the most plausible scenario to be one in which a classic solar dynamo is combined with the modulations excited by the planets. “Then the Sun would be a completely ordinary, older star whose dynamo cycle, however, is synchronized by the tides,” summarized Stefani. “The great thing about our new model is that we are now easily able to explain effects that were previously difficult to model, such as ‘false’ helicities, as observed with sunspots, or the well-known double peak in the Sun’s activity curve.”
Besides influencing the 11-year cycle, planetary tidal forces may also have other effects on the Sun. For example, it is also conceivable that they change the stratification of the plasma in the transition region between the interior radiative zone and the outer convection zone of the Sun (the tachocline) in such a way that the magnetic flux can be conducted more easily. Under those conditions, the magnitude of activity cycles could also be changed, as was once the case with the Maunder Minimum, when there was a strong decline in solar activity for a longer phase.
In the long term, a more precise model of the solar dynamo would help scientists to quantify climate-relevant processes such as space weather more effectively, and perhaps even to improve climate predictions one day. The new model calculations also mean that, besides tidal forces, potentially other, hitherto neglected mechanisms would have to be integrated into the solar dynamo theory, mechanisms with weak forces that can nevertheless – as researchers now know – have a major impact. To be able to investigate this fundamental question in the laboratory, too, the researchers are currently setting up a new liquid metal experiment at HZDR.

PETITION ON GLOBAL ANTHROPGENIC HEATING (Anthropogenic Global Warming, human-caused global warming)
The undersigned, citizens and scientists, send a warm invitation to political leaders to adopt environmental protection policies consistent with scientific knowledge.
In particular, it is urgent to combat pollution where it occurs, according to the indications of the best science. In this regard, the delay with which the wealth of knowledge made available by the world of research is used to reduce the anthropogenic pollutant emissions widely present in both continental and marine environmental systems is deplorable.
But we must be aware that CARBON DIOXIDE IS ITSELF NOT A POLLUTANT. On the contrary, it is indispensable for life on our planet.
In recent decades, a thesis has spread that the heating of the Earth’s surface of around 0.9°C observed from 1850 onwards would be anomalous and caused exclusively by human activities, in particular by the emission of CO2 from the use of fossil fuels in the atmosphere.
This is the thesis of anthropogenic global warming [Anthropogenic Global Warming] promoted by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) of the United Nations, whose consequences would be environmental changes so serious as to fear enormous damage in an imminent future, unless drastic and costly mitigation measures are immediately adopted.
In this regard, many nations of the world have joined programs to reduce carbon dioxide emissions and are pressured by a intense propaganda to adopt increasingly burdensome programs whose implementation involves heavy burdens on the economies of the individual member states and depend on climate control and, therefore, the “rescue” of the planet.
However, the anthropogenic origin of global warming IS AN UNPROVEN HYPOTHESIS, deduced only from some climate models, that is complex computer programs, called General Circulation Models .
On the contrary, the scientific literature has increasingly highlighted the existence of a natural climatic variability that the models are not able to reproduce.
This natural variability explains a substantial part of global warming observed since 1850.
The anthropogenic responsibility for climate change observed in the last century is therefore UNJUSTIFIABLY EXAGGERATED and catastrophic predictions ARE NOT REALISTIC.
The climate is the most complex system on our planet, so it needs to be addressed with methods that are adequate and consistent with its level of complexity.
Climate simulation models do not reproduce the observed natural variability of the climate and, in particular, do not reconstruct the warm periods of the last 10,000 years. These were repeated about every thousand years and include the well-known Medieval Warm Period , the Hot Roman Period, and generally warm periods during the Optimal Holocene period.
These PERIODS OF THE PAST HAVE ALSO BEEN WARMER THAN THE PRESENT PERIOD, despite the CO2 concentration being lower than the current, while they are related to the millennial cycles of solar activity. These effects are not reproduced by the models.
It should be remembered that the heating observed since 1900 has actually started in the 1700s, i.e. at the minimum of the Little Ice Age , the coldest period of the last 10,000 years (corresponding to the millennial minimum of solar activity that astrophysicists call Maunder Minimal Solar ). Since then, solar activity, following its millennial cycle, has increased by heating the earth’s surface.
Furthermore, the models fail to reproduce the known climatic oscillations of about 60 years.

These were responsible, for example, for a warming period (1850-1880) followed by a cooling period (1880-1910), a heating (1910-40), a cooling (1940-70) and a a new warming period (1970-2000) similar to that observed 60 years earlier.
The following years (2000-2019) saw the increase not predicted by the models of about 0.2 ° C  [two one-hundredths of a degree]per decade, but a substantial climatic stability that was sporadically interrupted by the rapid natural oscillations of the equatorial Pacific ocean, known as the El Nino Southern Oscillations , like the one that led to temporary warming between 2015 and 2016.
The media also claim that extreme events, such as hurricanes and cyclones, have increased alarmingly. Conversely, these events, like many climate systems, have been modulated since the aforementioned 60-year cycle.
For example, if we consider the official data from 1880 on tropical Atlantic cyclones that hit North America, they appear to have a strong 60-year oscillation, correlated with the Atlantic Ocean’s thermal oscillation called Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation .
The peaks observed per decade are compatible with each other in the years 1880-90, 1940-50 and 1995-2005. From 2005 to 2015 the number of cyclones decreased precisely following the aforementioned cycle. Thus, in the period 1880-2015, between number of cyclones (which oscillates) and CO2 (which increases monotonically) there is no correlation.
The climate system is not yet sufficiently understood. Although it is true that CO2 is a greenhouse gas, according to the IPCC itself the climate sensitivity to its increase in the atmosphere is still extremely uncertain.
It is estimated that a doubling of the concentration of atmospheric CO2, from around 300 ppm pre-industrial to 600 ppm, can raise the average temperature of the planet from a minimum of 1° C to a maximum of 5° C.
This uncertainty is enormous.
In any case, many recent studies based on experimental data estimate that the climate sensitivity to CO2 is CONSIDERABLY LOWER than that estimated by the IPCC models.
Then, it is scientifically unrealistic to attribute to humans the responsibility for warming observed from the past century to today. The advanced alarmist forecasts, therefore, are not credible, since they are based on models whose results contradict the experimental data.
All the evidence suggests that these MODELS OVERESTIMATE the anthropogenic contribution and underestimate the natural climatic variability, especially that induced by the sun, the moon, and ocean oscillations.
Finally, the media release the message according to which, with regard to the human cause
of current climate change, there would be an almost unanimous consensus among scientists that the scientific debate would be closed.
However, first of all we must be aware that the scientific method dictates that the facts, and not the number of adherents, make a conjecture a consolidated scientific theory .
In any case, the same alleged consensus DOES NOT EXIST. In fact, there is a remarkable variability of opinions among specialists – climatologists, meteorologists, geologists, geophysicists, astrophysicists – many of whom recognize an important natural contribution to global warming observed from the pre-industrial period and even from the post-war period to today.
There have also been petitions signed by thousands of scientists who have expressed dissent with the conjecture of anthropogenic global warming.
These include the one promoted in 2007 by the physicist F. Seitz, former president of the American National Academy of Sciences, and the one promoted by the Non-governmental International Panel on Climate Change (NIPCC), whose 2009 report concludes that “Nature, not the activity of Man governs the climate”.
In conclusion, given the CRUCIAL IMPORTANCE THAT FOSSIL FUELS have for the energy supply of humanity, we suggest that they should not adhere to policies of uncritically reducing carbon dioxide emissions into the atmosphere with THE ILLUSORY PRETENSE OF CONTROLLING THE CLIMATE.

Share this...FacebookTwitterGerman DLR model computations show each year 1.2 trillion insects are killed by wind turbine rotors in Germany alone.
Wind energy shows there is no free lunch. Some major drawbacks of this “green energy” supply include blighting of the landscape, health damage from infrasound, and bird killing. Now insect killing is another that is currently emerging.

=================================
DLR studies interactions between flying insects and wind farms
Main points:

In a study, DLR researchers have investigated the interactions between flying insects and wind farms.
The model calculation used in the study indicates that the numbers of affected flying insects could be relevant for the stability of the flying insect population and thus influence species protection and the food chain.
The study does not conclude whether wind farms are the main cause of insect extinction or whether they have an impact on it.
The study recommends an empirical review of the losses theoretically calculated in the study in order to better understand the relationship between insect migration and wind farm operation, and to develop and implement measures to monitor and prevent insect strikes.

For 25 years, Franz Trieb has worked in the Energy Systems Analysis Department of the German Aerospace Center (Deutsches Zentrum für Luft- und Raumfahrt; DLR). The department of the same name at the DLR Institute of Engineering Thermodynamics in Stuttgart is investigating energy technologies with the idea of achieving comprehensive sustainability that takes into account ecological, economic and social factors, and has thus made a major contribution to the success of renewable energy sources in Germany and worldwide. Franz Trieb and his colleagues want to create a factual picture that will support discussions and decision-making processes. With its energy research, DLR is committed to developing technologies and scenarios for a sustainable energy system that meets the energy needs of industry and society.
Dr Trieb, how does one come up with the idea of investigating the impact of wind farms on flying insects?
Franz Trieb: A comprehensive assessment of German energy scenarios based on a large number of indicators, which we carried out in 2017[1], revealed that the compatibility of wind farms and flying insects during the migration of insects to new breeding grounds was still an open question. Initial research has shown that the remains of flying insects on rotor blades can lead to large reductions in the efficiency of wind turbines and have motivated the establishment of a global cleaning industry for rotor blades. For this reason, we conducted a study on the subject, drawing on interdisciplinary expertise in the fields of entomology, atmospheric physics, wind energy, aerodynamics and DNA barcoding – a method of species identification based on DNA sequencing.
What was the starting point for your study?
Trieb: An extensive body of technical literature currently shows that large swarms of flying insects also seek high, fast air currents. They allow themselves to be carried by the wind to distant breeding grounds. Observations and measurements have been able to detect high insect concentrations worldwide at altitudes between 20 and 220 metres above the ground – the very same altitudes occupied by the rotors of wind turbines. The phenomenon of insect strikes can reduce the power output of wind turbines by up to 50 percent – this has been the subject of extensive research in both theory and practice. So far, however, the consequences of insect collisions with wind turbine rotors on the insect population and the ecosystem have not been investigated.
What approach was used in your study? How did you proceed?

Trieb: First, we conducted extensive research, collecting and evaluating existing scientific data. Based on this data, we created our own model calculation. On the one hand, this model calculation is based on an average insect density of around three creatures per 1000 cubic metres of air at the level of the wind turbine rotors. This figure was based on regular insect catches over Schleswig Holstein by entomologists between 1998 and 2004[2]. On the other hand, for our model calculation, we extrapolated the volumetric flow, that is, the ‘air throughput’ of all the wind farms in Germany. Here, there are around 30,000 wind turbines with a total rotor area of around 160 square kilometres, which with a nominal wind speed of 50 kilometres per hour reach an average of 1000 nominal full load hours during the insect flying season from April to October. By simply multiplying these numbers, we calculated a seasonal air flow rate of about eight million cubic kilometres – that is more than 10 times the total German airspace up to a height of two kilometres. If one multiplies the insect density and airflow rate, then around 24,000 billion airborne insects fly through the rotors in Germany each year.
A simple approximation of the resulting damage can be derived from studies by Sandia National Laboratories on the contamination of rotor blades by flying insects. Four factors are multiplied with each other: the ratio (five percent) between the blade surface visible from the wind’s direction and the circular area swept by the rotor blades; the average proportion of the polluted blade area on both sides of the rotor blades totalling around 80 percent relative to the visible blade area; the so-called collection efficiency for winged insects averaging 40 percent; and a ratio between median relative blade speed (45 metres per second) and nominal wind speed (14 metres per second) of about 3.2. According to the figures, on average, about five percent of the creatures flying through a running rotor get hit. This amounts to approximately 1200 billion insects per year. These figures only consider creatures that leave visible residues on the rotor blades.
What conclusions can be drawn from your model calculation?
Trieb: Our model calculation points to an aspect of wind energy that has not yet been comprehensively researched. Approximately 1200 billion flying insects are struck each year as they fly through the rotors of wind farms in Germany. Such a large number of affected insects could be a relevant factor for the stability of the insect population and could thus influence species protection and the food chain.
What conclusions does the model calculation explicitly rule out? In other words, where do you as a researcher need additional data or more investigations?
Trieb: We cannot make any reliable statements as to what contribution the loss of approximately 1200 billion flying insects calculated in the study makes to the reduction of insect numbers. The reason for this is that we simply do not know how big the total population is or the amount of insect population reduction in hard numbers. In addition, there are as yet no absolute figures on other negative impacts on the insect population such as pesticides, intensive agriculture, climate change or urbanisation, so we cannot compare our numbers with other influences.
What further action would you suggest, based on the study results?
Trieb: From the currently available figures and the DLR model calculation, we cannot conclude either that wind energy plays a significant role in the reduction of insect numbers, or that it has no impact. From a scientific point of view, an empirical examination of the losses theoretically calculated in our study would be very useful as a next step. The goal must be to better understand the relationships between insect migration and wind farm operations. With this study we are offering our knowledge and expertise based on a one-year project, so that researchers from different disciplines, together with industry, operators and decision-makers can develop and implement measures to reduce potential environmental damage caused by wind farms in the future.
One idea would be, for example, an automatic swarm detection system that controls the rotors of wind turbines accordingly. A simple way to identify affected species would be a regular DNA analysis of insect residues on rotor blades. One potential source of damage that leaves no visible residue, and one that has not yet been investigated, is flying through the low pressure region on the forward side of the rotor blades. The effects of the corresponding barotrauma on the trachea and other organs should be examined.

===============================
Ladies and Gentlemen,
New climate model is useless
Over 80(!) authors, led by Jean Christophe Golaz of Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, have recently developed a new climate model (produced for the upcoming IPCC 6th Assessment Report). While so far the models have been parameterized on the basis of a period of pronounced warming (mostly between 1976 and 2005), the current work of Golaz et al (2019) takes a different approach: the pre-industrial conditions around 1850 were taken as the starting point.
Until around 1955 the model did well with the “tuning” of 1850, even though it did not reflect the warming of around 0.4°C between 1925 and 1945. After that, however, it literally goes out of control. We see a reduction in the temperature level of up to 0.5°C until about 1996, then a warming rate of over 0.5°C/decade. The observations do not show this:

The evolution of global surface temperatures in observations ( blue, green, grey) and in models ( red).  Source: Fig. 23 from Golaz et al. (2019).
The paper also explains how this happens: The aerosols (they cool by shading the solar radiation) have far too great an effect in the model and the climate sensitivity to greenhouse gases is also clearly too high. Björn Stevens of the Max Planck Institute for Meteorology Hamburg (MPI) also addresses the problem that models compensate too high a sensitivity to greenhouse gases by too much (negative) aerosol forcing.
Natural variability not taken into account
It seems to be a fundamental problem of all models that do not sufficiently take natural variability into account and want to explain temperature development solely by anthropogenic influences. In the end, Golaz et al. (2019) comes to the conclusion that both the (negative) aerosol propulsion and climate sensitivity to greenhouse gases (especially CO2) must be reduced in models in order to simulate the recent past from 1960 onwards with the necessary precision.
“Little to do with reality”
For the declared purpose (the development of scenarios up to 2100 – i.e. the next 80 years), even the latest “sophisticated” models turn out to be unsuitable. They predict a catastrophic development because of faulty modeling that has little to do with the reality of the last 50 years.
Greta and the world of models

Greta and her German followers derive their demands for an immediate end to our lifestyle from this very false model world. In fact, climate researchers who are familiar with the unreliability of climate models should steer the children’s crusade to a sensible direction, for example with reference to the contribution by Jochem Marotzke, who recently came to the conclusion in Spiegel that “our remaining CO2 budget for the 1.5 degree target is probably at least twice as large as we thought it would be“.
Yet the very same Marotzke now supports the Fridays for Future demands for a short-term coal phase-out in Germany by 2030, bot in China where the annual CO2 increase is about as high as Germany’s total emissions. And Marotzke is assisted by climate researchers Claussen, Schellnhuber, Rahmstorf, Latif, Mosbrugger, Stocker and Anders Levermann (this is the one who claimed in the scientific committee of the German Bundestag that CO2 is an angled molecule and therefore a greenhouse gas).
He probably missed too many chemistry classes on Friday as well.
New headlines on environmentally friendly alternatives
The number of wind turbines is to be doubled to tripled in the course of the Energiewende [transition to green energies] energy revolution, one wind turbine every 2.7 km. But now there are new warnings about the environmental impact.
According to a DLR model analysis carried out at the end of 2018, flying insects (e.g. the admiral, ladybirds) seek high rapid air currents shortly before laying their eggs in order to be carried by the wind to distant breeding sites. The currents are above 60 -100 m and hit a rotor area of 200 million m². An air throughput of 10 million km³, which is more than ten times the German airspace (up to 200 m height), will be sucked in by the rotors.
1200 tonnes of insects to be destroyed
1200 tons of insects will be destroyed by the rotors, which is 1200 billion insects. One of the authors estimates that this corresponds to the size of the insects destroyed by 40 million cars. Remarkably, the decline of flying insects and the expansion of wind turbines over a total height of 100 m to 200 m coincided 15 years ago. Coincidence? We do not know.
“Shut down wind turbines from April to October”!
The scientists demand a shut down the wind turbines from April to October at temperatures above 10°C. For our parliamentarians in the German Bundestag: The Federal Agency for Nature Conservation has so far rejected an investigation.
Green Energies’ “Silent Spring”
Maybe our striking students should take a look at this topic in class. Because if the fear turns out to be true, it’s not just about flying insects, but also about the whole ecosystem. Silent Spring – without chemicals – simply through the transition to0 green energies without technology assessment. It started with corn crops and biogas and ends with wind turbines.

Share this...FacebookTwitterTwo more additions to the steadily accumulating evidence CO2 plays an insignificant to negligible role in climate change have recently been published in the scientific literature.
Last year, Dr. Rex J. Fleming, a former  NOAA climate scientist who earned both his Master’s and Ph.D in meteorology, published a paper (Fleming, 2018) in the Environmental Earth Sciences journal that detailed the lack of an identifiable causal relationship between CO2 concentration changes and Earth’s temperature.
Fleming theorized that the Earth has warmed in the modern era as a consequence of the strong solar activity during the 20th century  (the Modern Maximum) shielding cosmic ray intensification and thus reducing decadal-scale cloud cover, which leads to warming via an increase in absorbed surface solar radiation as illustrated here by Ogurtsov et al., 2012 and detailed by Avakyan, 2013, McLean, 2014, Herman et al., 2013, Goode and Palle, 2007, Loeb et al., 2018, Pokrovsky, 2019, and others.
Fleming has now published an expanded version of his 2018 paper in a Springer© book entitled The Rise and Fall of the Carbon Dioxide Theory of Climate Change.
He reaches the same conclusion: CO2 has “no role” in the process of influencing climate.

Another climate sensitivity paper (Krainov and Smirnov, 2019) published in the journal Atomic and Molecular Radiative Processes finds a negligible (0.02 K) warming contribution from human emissions.
Physicists Dr. Vladimir Krainov, atomic physicist, and Dr. Boris Smirnov, author of over a dozen physics textbooks – conclude “injections of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere as a result of combustion of fossil fuesls is not important for the greenhouse effect.”

"The Australian Medical Association has formally declared climate change a health emergency, pointing to “clear scientific evidence indicating severe impacts for our patients and communities now and into the future”. The AMA’s landmark shift, delivered by a motion of the body’s federal council, brings the organisation into line with forward-leaning positions taken by the American Medical Association, the British Medical Association and Doctors for the Environment Australia. The American Medical Association and the American College of Physicians recognised climate change as a health emergency in June 2019, and the British Medical Association the following month declared a climate emergency and committed to campaign for carbon neutrality by 2030. The World Health Organisation has recognised since 2015 that climate change is the greatest threat to global health in the 21st century, and argued the scientific evidence for that assessment is “overwhelming”. The AMA has recognised the health risks of climate change since 2004. Having now formally recognised that climate change is a health emergency, the peak organisation representing doctors in Australia is calling on the Morrison government to promote an active transition from fossil fuels to renewable energy; adopt mitigation targets within an Australian carbon budget; promote the health benefits of addressing climate change; and develop a national strategy for health and climate change. The AMA president, Tony Bartone, argues the scientific evidence is clear. “There is no doubt that climate change is a health emergency. The AMA accepts the scientific evidence on climate change and its impact on human health and human wellbeing,” he says. Bartone says the climate science suggests warming will affect human health and wellbeing “by increasing the environment and situations in which infectious diseases can be transmitted, and through more extreme weather events, particularly heatwaves”. Sign up to receive the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning “Climate change will cause higher mortality and morbidity from heat stress,” the AMA president says. “Climate change will cause injury and mortality from increasingly severe weather events. Climate change will cause increases in the transmission of vector-borne diseases. Climate change will cause food insecurity resulting from declines in agricultural outputs. Climate change will cause a higher incidence of mental ill-health. “These effects are already being observed internationally and in Australia.” Bartone told Guardian Australia the motion adopted by the federal council had followed an ongoing discussion among stakeholders, and medical practitioners within the AMA membership. Health and medical groups, including Doctors for the Environment, the Climate and Health Alliance, the Royal Australian College of Physicians, and the Australian Medical Students’ Association wrote an open letter to all political parties in April pointing out the “significant and profound impacts climate change has on the health of people and our health system”. The AMA president said the decision to pass the motion followed on from those events both domestically and internationally, and was “pretty much unanimous” internally. “I don’t recall anyone speaking against it,” he said. Asked whether the current government was pursuing ambitious enough policy action to combat the risks of climate change, whichthe Morrison government argues it is, Bartone said “it’s really difficult to say because this issue is clouded in conjecture and conflicting reports”. He said all of the political groups in the Australian parliament had a responsibility to move past the toxic partisan politics that had characterised the debate and find durable solutions to a difficult public policy challenge. Bartone said the AMA would continue to assess the evidence about climate change as it emerged and update its stance to reflect the science. The latest official data released last week confirms that greenhouse gas emissions continue to rise in Australia. National emissions increased by 3.1m tonnes in the year to March to reach 538.9m tonnes, a 0.6% jump on the previous year. Emissions in Australia have increased every year since the Abbott government repealed a national carbon price after taking office in 2013."
"“You’re a black tree hugger, interesting.” When I told my grandparents that I was moving back to Detroit to work as an environmental justice organizer for the Sierra Club they chuckled and called me a tree hugger. This quip was understandable, their interactions with the environmental movement were not particularly positive; they contended that, in their time, most environmentalists cared more about protecting remote habitats than protecting their black neighbors from discrimination and violence. Today, to fight our climate crisis effectively, we have to transcend cultural, racial and political differences and build a broader coalition of engaged citizens. We have to engage all citizens, some who may not care about conservation but certainly care about the safety of their drinking water, the cleanliness of their air and the safety of their homes. This requires all of us, from journalists and politicians to activists and voters, to engage with communities in a culturally competent manner. We must bring to the table an understanding that we don’t have to agree on every political issue to work together towards building a better future for all of us.  Whether it be in Detroit, Birmingham or Houston, my lived experiences tell me that contrary to what has become a popular narrative, communities of color care about addressing the climate crisis. Our interests may not fit neatly into what has been deemed “environmental” thus far; nonetheless, we’re frustrated by injustices that permeate in the aftermath of natural disasters, we’re frustrated that our communities are littered with asthma because we stand on the fence lines of polluting industries, and we’re frustrated that, in the wealthiest nation on Earth, access to clean water seems ever so scarce. Learning how to connect to different communities, meeting people where they are and communicating in a way that brings people together, are cornerstones of culturally competent communication. It’s incumbent on activists, politicians, media figures and academics to embrace culturally competent communication to engage diverse communities in the climate crisis. When Kanye West proclaimed “George Bush doesn’t care about black people” in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina, it resonated within many parts of the African American community and whether it was incompetence or negligence, it resonated for a reason. I was 10 at the time, living in Birmingham, Alabama, watching the horror unfold on TV with my mom. We watched images on our screen of black families stranded on rooftops and huddled into the Superdome, we saw racist coverage describe black residents as “looters” while describing others searching for food and supplies as “families desperate for help”, and we watched as all levels of government failed to take adequate steps to prepare and protect residents. In Houston, the most diverse city in the country, 11 years after Katrina, I witnessed similar disparities firsthand in the aftermath of Hurricane Harvey. In my work as an organizer, I traveled to historic black neighborhoods, where blue tarps that were used to cover badly damaged roofs still line blocks as if they were a part of the architectural design of the neighborhood. At community health fairs in predominantly Hispanic neighborhoods of the city, I met countless families fighting tears because the mold that had overtaken their home had still not been adequately removed over a year after the storm. And as Hurricane Maria demonstrated to a wider audience, these systemic barriers to an equitable recovery are more widespread than we may like to acknowledge. These experiences have made it clear to me that our communities do care about climate’s role in driving natural disasters, we yearn for having a livable future for generations to come, and we want our lawmakers to take active steps to address climate change so that these disparities are no longer perpetuated. Since moving back to Detroit to continue my work as an environmental justice organizer, I have learned how to better communicate issues involving the climate crisis to communities often overlooked in these discussions. Access to clean air and water is a fundamental human right. Algae blooms, driven by the climate crisis, contaminate our freshwater supplies. However, when I talk to residents about the climate crisis’ detrimental effects on access to water, I talk about how these rights have been violated in Flint, I talk about Detroit’s mass water-shutoffs, and I talk about lead exposure in Detroit public school water. Climate change will only further entrench existing inequalities when it comes to access to water. When I talk about the relationship between the climate crisis and the fossil fuel industry, I talk about their proximity of oil refineries to our neighborhoods and the fact that this proximity impacts our ability to live healthy productive lives free from disease. The fact is, many oil refineries, coal plants and other industrial sites locate themselves adjacent to low-income communities of color. The lack of political, economic and social capital in our communities often render us helpless to fight back against these forces and this is why we organize. This is a racial justice, residential segregation and human rights issue that anyone involved in the environmental movement must learn to speak to. But improving our communications and outreach to communities often left out of the conversation is not enough. We need to fully shift and challenge how we group and categorize what environmentalism and “climate change issues” look like. When our climate crisis threatens the global economy, drives mass migration creating climate-linked refugees, and risks the health and wellbeing of countless communities there is no such issue that is solely related to the environment and climate. In poll after poll evaluating what voters care about, many voters place increasing access to economic opportunity, addressing racism and discrimination, and fixing our healthcare system above the environment and climate. The reality is, the climate crisis intersects all of these issues and failing to acknowledge this, whether in a poll, a news article or in a political debate, greatly diminishes the scale of the crisis we face. Why? Because instead of making investments in the economy of the future, particularly in green tech and manufacturing we have made investments in publicly financed stadiums, jails and tax cuts. Our communities stand on the edge of industrial zones not out of preference but out of redlining and racial segregation policies that packed us into those neighborhoods. And yes, we need to dramatically transform our broken healthcare system, but we also must recognize environmental injustice’s role in driving health disparities. There are many moments that we have come together in our nation’s history to build movements that meet the scale of the challenges we face: the civil rights movement, battling the Great Depression, the women’s right’s movement. The climate crisis is such an unprecedented threat because it compounds the challenges that we’ve faced: racial inequality, economic opportunity, access to a healthy environment. Unprecedented challenges require unprecedented approaches so it’s imperative that we all adjust the way we communicate and think about the environmental crisis. Our challenges may be many, but our struggles are linked, and we are capable of rising to this challenge."

"Sometimes it’s the students who teach. This week, 16-year-old Greta Thunberg arrived in New York City in a zero-emissions yacht, en route to the United Nations climate change summit. The purpose of the trip? Let’s call it a teachable moment. Over the past year, Greta and more than 2 million teens around the world have led school strikes for climate justice, demanding that their leaders end the age of fossil fuels. Now these young people have declared 20 September 2019 a historic day for a global climate strike by all people, young and old.  As college professors, we’ve learned much over the past 15 years from our Middlebury and Swarthmore students about standing up for climate justice. On the forefront of the climate movement, they’ve launched the worldwide fossil-fuel divestment campaign and gone on to found 350.org and the Sunrise Movement. Young brown, black and indigenous activists who have courageously stood up to powerful fossil fuel companies have taught us how all fights for justice intersect. So on 20 September, we plan to join youth everywhere, cancel our classes and strike. With seven colleagues, we’ve just released an open letter appealing to fellow educators everywhere: put aside your teaching notes and join your students at a climate strike event near you. As Greta puts it, “Our house is on fire – let’s act like it.” We understand that some educators – and their bosses – might object to striking. It’s true that school time is precious, and to teach is a revered responsibility. Some students’ families might take issue with a full day of cancelled classes. And let’s not forget those students who may not want to strike (even with the prospect of a day off from homework). To not teach, one might argue, is to reject learning. We disagree. To strike in the name of climate justice is a resounding endorsement of learning: it turns out the world’s youth have been listening to their teachers all along. They understand the science of climate disruption; they take in the lessons of history; they grapple with the complexity of market forces and the true costs of polluting. In their humanities and social science courses, they hear the voices of those at the margins and then honor their dignity and humanity through the arts. Yet it’s also undeniable that our students – all of us – have much more to learn about climate disruption and injustice. As educators worldwide plan our fall semester courses, we have, alas, plenty of new material to teach. July was the hottest month on record, the 415th straight month warmer than the 20th century average. Europe baked this summer, while Arctic and Greenland ice melted at record paces. Legacies of colonialism and global inequality continue to put black, brown and other marginalized people in harm’s way – in June, hundreds of Indian villages were evacuated in the face of historic drought – even though they are least responsible for the crisis. Alarm bells continue to toll, louder every year. That’s why, above all, we educators need to help strengthen the climate movement, and the start of this school year is an important moment. The eyes of the world are on young people, who are demonstrating the kind of vision and determination that has not yet taken hold in halls of power the world over. Our students love to declare, “We are the change we have been waiting for.” In fall 2019, they could not be more correct. No educator is able to join Greta Thunberg as she continues her bold Atlantic crossing, but all of us can follow her lead. We risk losing credibility with an entire generation of students if we cannot take action in support of the defining cause of their generation.

May snowfall “unusual”
Bild reports that freezing temperatures are expected overnight into Sunday morning. A spokesman for the German DWD national weather service in Munich said that may snowfall in the lowlands is “quite unusual”.
Also the online NTV reports of snowfall in the central German state of Hesse, and the cold and wet weather is expected to linger for a couple of more days.
Winter road crews deployed
The online Der Spiegel wrote: “Snow? In May?” and reported that in some areas winter road crews had to be put into operation.

"Ian Duncan, the UK’s minister for climate change (Letters, 31 August), vaunts our achievements and “ambitions to become one of the cleanest and most innovative energy systems in the world”. He allows a generous 30 years before a “net-zero emissions economy is achieved”, when the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change has made it clear that real change must be evident in fewer than a dozen years. How can he hope to realise his longer-term targets while pursuing fracking as a transitional fuel? Investment in the hugely expensive development of fracking denies proper support to cheaper renewables, and delaying the switch ties the operator and investor into the production of a fossil fuel until a return is achieved. That exposes communities to the harms already documented, and contributes – by combustion, extraction and transportation – to the climate change the government hopes to mitigate.  The De Pfeffel Johnson government is a prey to the same “cognitive dissonance” as characterised previous governments, its fracking agenda running openly against the spirit of its commitments.David Cragg-JamesStonegrave, North Yorkshire • Ian Duncan omits to mention the government’s environmentally damaging actions. Why is fracking still being encouraged? And airport expansion? And why is several times more given in subsidies supporting fossil-fuel industries such as North Sea oil than renewables, which have seen a reduction? And why was car tax changed so that smaller engined cars now pay the same as larger ones, thus leading to an increase in the sale of SUVs? Any why remove the grant towards the purchase of plug-in electric hybrids and charge them the same vehicle tax as diesel or petrol cars? I’m sure there are many more examples of failure to have a coherent, consistent and powerful regime to address the climate crisis.Michael MillerSheffield • Carol Blumenthal says peaceful civil disobedience and personal sacrifice are perhaps the only effective tools to bring about system change (Letters, 31 August). She misses one other: voting. In the 1945 general election it brought about one of the most far-reaching changes in our society: the welfare state. For better or for worse, it was voting – in 2010, 2016 and 2017 – that created and sustained the Brexit crisis. If every voter who believed in the importance of saving our environment voted for a party that unreservedly supported it, the political climate would be transformed overnight.

A new paper (Axford et al., 2019) reveals NW Greenland’s “outlet glaciers were smaller than today from ~9.4 to 0.2 ka BP” (9,400 to 200 years before 1950), and that “most of the land-based margin reached its maximum Holocene extent in the last millennium and likely the last few hundred years.”
The authors conclude:
“We infer based upon lake sediment organic and biogenic content that in response to declining temperatures, North Ice Cap reached its present-day size ~1850 AD, having been smaller than present through most of the preceding Holocene.”
Furthermore, the authors assert Greenland was 2.5°C to 3°C warmer than modern on average during the Holocene Thermal Maximum, and peak temperatures were 4°C to 7°C warmer.

Image Source: Axford et al., 2019
Another new paper ( Schweinsberg et al., 2019) indicates the most pronounced glacier expansion in West Greenland has occurred during the last 2,000 years.
“Our records reveal asynchronous regrowth of GIC between ~4.3 and 2 ka emphasizing the variable responses of individual glaciers to late Holocene climate changes on Nuussuaq. The subsequent millennia were characterized by gradually increasing glacier size in accordance with gradual declining summer insolation. Superimposed on the progressive increase in glacier growth are frequent, high-amplitude GIC fluctuations throughout the late Holocene; the most significant periods of GIC expansion occurred at ~3.7 and 2.8 ka, and throughout the past ~2 ka.”

The authors cite a Greenland Ice Sheet temperature reconstruction showing modern temperatures (extending through 2015) are not unusual in the context of the last 10,000 years.

The source for the Schweinsberg et al. (2019) Greenland temperature reconstruction is Kobashi et al., 2017, who concluded a) Greenland was about 2.9°C warmer than today during the Early Holocene, b) there has been no obvious net warming since the 1930s, and a c) slight cooling trend since 2005 (in accord with North Atlantic cooling).

What follows is a field report from Hanover, Germany, by AGW skeptic organization KlimaKontroverse, who have attempted on multiple occasions to seek a rational dialogue with FridaysforFuture (FFF) demonstrators. Though some demonstrators were civil and polite, others harassed, defamed and even brought in Antifa.
Intolerant times
Taking a different view at a political demonstration in Germany is a risky affair, and could get you a bloody nose, or worse. So it really is an act of courage for these climate skeptic KlimaKontroverse citizens to go out to present their non-conforming views at these FFF demonstrations – especially when one considers how emotionalized and radical some have become.
As Greta has demonstrated herself, there’s lots of pent-up anger, impatience and intolerance out there.
Staying calm and respectful
Personally, as author of this blog, I’m actually considering showing up and joining KlimaKontroverse at an upcoming event. I’m a bit familiar with the KlimaKontroverse people, and I can assure you they are calm, friendly, respectful and go the extra mile to avoid provocation and confrontation.
=============================================
FridaysForFuture – and dealing with alternative opinions
by Klaus Öllerer
(German text translated, edited by P. Gosselin)
The FridaysForFuture movement has strict targets that would mean drastic consequences for all of the people living here. But what if you disagree? What if, after an intensive study of these issues, completely different conclusions emerge? Of course, it is obvious to go and discuss them – as is customary in democracy. Or perhaps better – should be usual again.First we began with e-mails and telephone calls offering discussion. No reaction. No willingness to talk to each other. FridaysForFuture did not react.
Some polite, respectful demonstrators
So we went to the climate strike meetings at Kröpcke, distributed our “Open Letter” and tried to get into conversation. Some conversations with participants were constructive and in the spirit of mutual respect. We listened to each other. That was nice.
“Stalking” and intimidation

But some leading persons and FFF orderlies reacted very differently. They stalked us and demanded we leave the square as they grew increasingly angry. We insisted on our democratic right to express our opinion freely in public space. At some point they also approached the police – but the officers agreed with us. We distributed our flyers and discussed with demonstrators (15 February 2019).
“Climate lies”
But at the next demonstration, the FridaysForFuture orderlies thought of something special, and it looked like this: The FFF orderlies brought a bag with the inscription “Klimalügen” (climate lies) and spoke to the passers-by and demonstrators who had taken our flyers. If they managed to convince a passer-by to surrender the flyer, they threw it in the “climate lies” bag. The finale: Our flyers were demonstratively torn in front of our eyes. (15 March 2019).

 

“Bomb” threat
At one of the next demonstrations, we had set up our stand just across from the Hanover main station. The demonstration passed by. The left picture below shows leftist autonomists and Antifa marching up front. They called out aggressively: “Climate deniers! Climate deniers! …”.
Then suddenly someone from the march charged towards our stand (middle picture), threw something under our table and shouted “Bomb!” before quickly running away and rejoining the marchers (right picture). The thrown object turned out to be harmless (5 July 2019).

But even so, KlimaKontroverse.de’s offer to enter a dialogue and to discuss in the truly democratic tradition remains open.

By Die kalte Sonne
(German text translated in the English by P Gosselin)

Image Source: Lüning et al. 2019
For a long time it has been said that the Medieval Warm Period was a purely North Atlantic phenomenon. This has proved to be wrong.
On 29 June 2019, a paper by Lüning et al. 2019 on the Medieval Warm Period in Antarctica appeared in the trade journal Palaeogeography, Palaeoclimatology, Palaeoecology. Here is the abstract:
The Medieval Climate Anomaly in Antarctica
The Medieval Climate Anomaly (MCA) is a well-recognized climate perturbation in many parts of the world, with a core period of 1000–1200 CE. Here we are mapping the MCA across the Antarctic region based on the analysis of published palaeotemperature proxy data from 60 sites. In addition to the conventionally used ice core data, we are integrating temperature proxy records from marine and terrestrial sediment cores as well as radiocarbon ages of glacier moraines and elephant seal colonies. A generally warm MCA compared to the subsequent Little Ice Age (LIA) was found for the Subantarctic Islands south of the Antarctic Convergence, the Antarctic Peninsula, Victoria Land and central West Antarctica. A somewhat less clear MCA warm signal was detected for the majority of East Antarctica. MCA cooling occurred in the Ross Ice Shelf region, and probably in the Weddell Sea and on Filchner-Ronne Ice Shelf. Spatial distribution of MCA cooling and warming follows modern dipole patterns, as reflected by areas of opposing temperature trends. Main drivers of the multi-centennial scale climate variability appear to be the Southern Annular Mode (SAM) and El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) which are linked to solar activity changes by nonlinear dynamics.
With the publication of this paper, the Medieval Climate Anomaly (MCA) has now been confirmed on all four continents of the southern hemisphere. While the largest part of the southern hemisphere apparently experienced a warm phase during the MCA, there were also isolated areas that cooled down. To the latter regions belong, for example, coasts, where cold water from the depth rose increasingly. In other areas so-called climate seesaws or dipoles were active, as we know them from today’s climate. One end of the “seesaw” heats up, the other end cools down.

Another result of the studies is that the medieval climate history of huge areas in the southern hemisphere is simply unknown. A task force urgently needs to be set up to fill in this climatic “empty space” with information on pre-industrial temperature development. This information is urgently needed to calibrate the climate models on the basis of which far-reaching socio-political planning is currently taking place.

Share this...FacebookTwitterA new paper published in the Journal of Weather and Climate Extremes by Dittus et al confirms what many skeptics has strongly suspected all along: There’s no trend in precipitation extremes and there isn’t much predictability either.
Hat-tip: Reader Mary Brown.
 

What follows is the paper’s abstract:
The oceans are a well-known source of natural variability in the climate system, although their ability to account for inter-annual variations of temperature and precipitation extremes over land remains unclear. In this study, the role of sea-surface temperature (SST)-forcing is investigated for variability and trends in a range of commonly used temperature and precipitation extreme indices over the period 1959 to 2013. Using atmospheric simulations forced by observed SST and sea-ice concentrations (SIC) from three models participating in the Climate of the Twentieth Century Plus (C20C+) Project, results show that oceanic boundary conditions drive a substantial fraction of inter-annual variability in global average temperature extreme indices, as well as, to a lower extent, for precipitation extremes. The observed trends in temperature extremes are generally well captured by the SST-forced simulations although some regional features such as the lack of warming in daytime warm temperature extremes over South America are not reproduced in the model simulations. Furthermore, the models simulate too strong increases in warm day frequency compared to observations over North America. For extreme precipitation trends, the accuracy of the simulated trend pattern is regionally variable, and a thorough assessment is difficult due to the lack of locally significant trends in the observations. This study shows that prescribing SST and SIC holds potential predictability for extremes in some (mainly tropical) regions at the inter-annual time-scale.”

Share this...FacebookTwitterTree-ring evidence reveals recent cooling and glacier thickening in Central Asia as well as flat temperatures throughout the last 432 years.


Tree rings were the proxy used by Dr. Michael Mann to invent the orignal hockey stick graph.
Twenty years later, yet another reconstruction (1580 to 2012 AD) indicates modern warmth in Central Asia is not unusual in the context of the last 432 years.
In fact, there was a recent cooling period, in line with natural variability, that was accompanied by regional glacier mass gains.
Byambaa et al., 2019
“[T]he recent cool-moist period from 1985 to 2000 has been related to the Arctic Oscillation (this study, Robock, 1984, He et al., 2017). The recent cooling could have been caused by volcanic aerosols of the El Chichón eruption (VEI5, 1982) in Southern Mexico, which impacted atmospheric wind patterns, including a positive phase of the Arctic Oscillation (Robock, 1984). No large volcanic-induced cooling was observed at this time due to the simultaneous warming ocean temperature caused by El-Niño (Robock, 2002). Also, the positive AO competing with ElNiño could reinforce the anomalous westerlies in the midlatitudes (He et al., 2017). During this recent cool-moist period, ice mass accumulation of the glaciers in the Russian Altai Mountains was observed and Narozhniy and Zemtsov (2011) connected this phenomenon to annual precipitation increased by 8% – 10% especially in winter and spring (April-May) as a result of a strengthening of the zonal circulation over the Altai Mountains.”

This could result in “a significant contribution of ice melt to the ice-drainage system of Greenland” (Artemieva et al., 2019).
Evidence of more than 100,000 formerly or currently active volcanic vents permeate the Earth’s sea floor (Kelley, 2017).
Active volcanoes spew 380°C sulfuric acid and “metal-laden acidic fluids” into the bottom waters of the world ocean on a daily basis. In other words, literal ocean acidification is a natural phenomenon.
The carbon dioxide concentrations present in these acidic floods reach “astounding” levels, dwarfing the potential for us to even begin to appreciate the impact this explosive geothermal activity has on the Earth’s carbon cycle (Kelley, 2017).

Geothermal heat “explains the observed melting of the ice sheet’s base”
Just as impacts of sea floor volcanism may be largely unheralded, the ice-melt significance of high geothermal heat flux beneath the polar ice caps may still be in the early stages of exploration.
The geothermal heat contribution to the basal melt rates of Antarctic glaciers is substantial.

Significant melting at the base of the north-central and northeastern Greenland ice sheet occurs in close proximity to high geothermal heat flux regions, and “several thousands” of 55-62°C hot springs have been identified “all over Greenland.”

High geothermal heat flux has “dramatic consequences” for ice basal melting in central-eastern Greenland
In a new paper, Dr. Irina Atemieva employs a new method to assess the accelerated basal melting occurring across wide swaths (extending 500 kilometers inland) of the Greenland ice sheet associated with high geothermal heat flux.
“Huge” near-surface temperature anomalies reaching amplitudes of 800–1000 °C have been spotted.
Geothermal heat flux is suggested to be “an important contributor to the Northeast Greenland Ice Stream in Central Greenland.”
Artemieva, 2019
Lithosphere thermal thickness and geothermal heat 
flux in Greenland from a new thermal isostasy method
“East Greenland has anomalous crustal structure, thin (50-100 km) lithosphere, high mantle temperatures and a strong GHF [geothermal heat flux] anomaly of >100 mW/m2 centered in the Fjordland region. … High GHF [geothermal heat flux] promotes basal ice melting. The moderately high GHF anomaly (>70 mW/m2 and possibly >90 mW/m2), where intensive ice melting may occur, extends inland below the ice sheet, and its western and northern boundaries cannot be established with the present data coverage on the Moho depth.”
“In East Greenland this anomalous belt merges with a strong GHF anomaly of >100 mW/m2 in the Fjordland region. The anomaly is associated with a strong lithosphere thinning, possibly to the Moho, that requires advective heat transfer such as above active magma chambers, which would accelerate ice basal melting. The anomaly may extend 500 km inland with possibly a significant contribution of ice melt to the ice-drainage system of Greenland.”
“The present results also show a huge temperature anomaly in the upper mantle of central-east Greenland (Domain 3) with the amplitude of ca. 800–1000 °C with respect to the cratonic stations. Such a temperature anomaly cannot be explained by conductive nor radiogenic mechanisms.”
“A high heat flux from the Earth’s interior enhanced by a hot fluid percolation above active magma chambers at the edge of the ice cap may have dramatic consequences for ice basal melting in the central-eastern Greenland, and may be an important contributor to the Northeast Greenland Ice Stream in Central Greenland.”

Share this...FacebookTwitterRecently many readers may have noticed how alarmists and activists have been using the so-called stripe chart (see following chart) to illustrate the warming the planet has recently experienced.
The popular stripe chart was created by “lead scientist” Ed Hawkins of the National Centre for Atmospheric Science, University of Reading, NCAS, UoR.

Source here.
Pretty colors sway dimwitted alarmists
The stripe chart depicts the global temperature trend, but only since 1850, and is designed of course to make the recent warming look dramatic through the use of darkening fire red stripes on the right side.
But note that the real temperature difference between dark blue and dark red is ONLY about 1°C!
Naturally a regular, boring old line curve is all one needs, but it just doesn’t produce the dramatic panic reaction propagandists love to see from their gullible followers.

For the very easily duped masses among us, who skipped too much school and whose low intellect allow them to be easily swayed by pretty colors, the red stripes of the present are all it takes to mislead and create the desired panic.
The colored 150-year stripe chart is a classic propaganda tool for brainwashing the many dimwitted among us.
2000-year stripe chart
If colors work well to drive home a point, then let’s use them to illustrate global temperature trends going back 2000 years. So, what happens when we create a stripe chart going back 2000 years:

The above rough stripe chart is based on R.W. Spencer 2007, going back 2000 years. Clearly we see the long Medieval Warm Period in the middle and today’s warm spell on the right side.
Suddenly all the drama disappears and the propaganda is exposed for what it is. Today’s warming is in reality nothing new.
So the next time someone shows you this cherry-picked, only back to 1850, propaganda stripe chart, then show them what it looks like going back 2000 years. Imagine what a stripe chart of the entire Holocene would look like. Be my guest. I’d be happy to post it.
Note that the 2000-year one I created above is rough only. You’re welcome to improve on it.

AMO cycle on the downward side: Red Sea to cool in the coming decades
By Die kalte Sonne
(German text translated by P Gosselin)
Seven years ago, in our book “The Forgotten Sun”, we proposed using ocean cycles for medium-term forecasts. At the time, the climate establishment was strictly opposed to this. Today fortunately times have changed.
On March 15, 2019, a team led by George Krokos analyzed the temperature development of the Red Sea in Geophysical Research Letters, which has become noticeably warmer in recent decades. The researchers put this into a long-term context and found a strong correlation with the 70-year ocean cycle of the AMO (Atlantic Multidecade Oscillation).
Now that AMO has reached its peak, Krokos and colleagues expect the Red Sea to cool in the next three decades. Abstract:
Natural Climate Oscillations may Counteract Red Sea Warming Over the Coming Decades
Recent reports of warming trends in the Red Sea raise concerns about the response of the basin’s fragile ecosystem under an increasingly warming climate. Using a variety of available Sea Surface Temperature (SST) data sets, we investigate the evolution of Red Sea SST in relation to natural climate variability. Analysis of long‐term SST data sets reveals a sequence of alternating positive and negative trends, with similar amplitudes and a periodicity of nearly 70 years associated with the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation. High warming rates reported recently appear to be a combined effect of global warming and a positive phase of natural SST oscillations. Over the next decades, the SST trend in the Red Sea purely related to global warming is expected to be counteracted by the cooling Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation phase. Regardless of the current positive trends, projections incorporating long‐term natural oscillations suggest a possible decreasing effect on SST in the near future.”

"Barnacle geese are shifting their migratory patterns northward in response to global heating, new research has found, in a stark indication of how wildlife is being affected by the changes in climate. In their spring journey from the UK to their breeding grounds on Svalbard, one population of the geese has been forsaking a traditional feeding stop in Norway’s Helgeland, south of the Arctic circle, in favour of a stop further north in Vesterålen, far into the Arctic circle. The move has happened as spring has come earlier to the region. Over the period studied, from 1975 to 2017, the onset of grass growth in Vesterålen has come sooner by about half a day each year, making a big difference in the availability of food for the birds. Significantly, younger birds have been quicker to make the switch. The study follows other research which has found bird species migrating earlier, land-based wildlife moving their habitats, and fish shifting polewards in response to climate change.  This is the first to show migratory animals learning new routes, with individuals changing from old migration routes that they learned earlier in life in favour of the new routes, which are then transmitted to others – for instance, by offspring following their parents. The study, published in Global Change Biology, analysed 45 years of observations by the Norwegian Institute for Nature Research, the University of St Andrews in Scotland, the University of Groningen in the Netherlands, BirdLife Norway and the British Waterfowl and Wetlands Trust. In the case of these geese, the effects of the change appear to have been mostly benign, as the amount of digestible biomass available for them increased and the population studied roughly doubled in size in the past quarter century. However, the shift has opened them up to an unexpected new danger from climate change: predation from polar bears, which have started to rely on eating bird eggs now that the ice floes from which they used to hunt seals are disappearing. “[The geese] have an amazing capacity to react to climate change, and actually adjusted very fast,” said Thomas Oudman, of the school of biology at St Andrews, co-author of the study. “This was only possible because alternative feeding areas have become available, also because of climate change. For many other species, this might not be the case, [so] climate change might threaten their existence. Other migratory animals, particularly less social ones, may be less capable of finding and colonising newly available areas.” Many other birds, for instance, have few or no viable alternative areas to visit, he noted, or may find it harder to transmit new routes to offspring. “There are many bird [species] that appear to be in trouble,” he told the Guardian. “That’s why we are trying to find out how birds develop their migratory behaviour, and how changes come about. We have found a clue in geese, showing that they can change routes during their life, especially young geese. But this change is probably speeded up by the fact that geese travel in groups. This points at the possibility that individually migrating birds are generally more vulnerable to climate change, especially those that rely on very specific feeding areas, such as many shorebirds that rely on intertidal areas.”"

German ultra-alarmist climate and energy site klimareporter here has posted a road map outline of what alarmists say has to be done in order to rescue the planet from the approaching climate Armageddon (the one that keeps getting postposed every 10 years).

Franz Alt (right) meets the Dalai Lama. Image: Bigialt in Wikipedia, CC BY-SA 3.0
Dubbed “The 12 Commandments To Stop Global Heating”, the one-page plan authored by leading climate activist Franz Alt at first glance may appear to be Germany’s version of a Green New Deal, but it goes far beyond that. While Alexandria Ocasio Cortez’s Green New Deal is a shallow-thought laundry list of actions written by a group of activist sophomores having pizza one evening, Franz Alt’s deal could serve as one of the cornerstones of the coming Green Religion.
“The ecological Jesus”
It’s little wonder that someone like Alt is taking on this role. According to Wikipedia, Alt made ecology an extension of his Christian faith over his long career, even authoring a book titled: “Der ökologische Jesus“, in English: The ecological Jesus.
I’ve summed up Alt’s “The 12 Commandments To Stop Global Heating” in English.
The 12 Holy Climate Commandments
1. Thou shall roll back greenhouse gases to zero by 2050!
2. Thou shall permit only renewable energy power plants – beginning immediately!
3. Thou shall permit and register only electric cars beginning in 2025!
4. Thou shall permit only CO2-free industrial complexes and plants beginning in 2025!

Share this...FacebookTwitterOur skeptic in Japan…
Many readers have surely read articles by Japanese blogger/contributor Kirye here at NoTricksZone since about a year and a half.

Japanese climate blogger Kirye thinks Japan will be the last developed country to ever question climate change.
Kirye, who wishes to remain anonymous, lives in Tokyo and has answered some questions about her blogging and climate science in Japan.
Interview
When and how did you become a skeptic?
It started back in 2013, I think. I read Dr. Kiyohiko Ikeda‘s books, and what he said was a surprise to me. So I started reading other books about climate change, like Svensmark’s “Chilling Stars”. It wasn’t long before I realized that we weren’t being told the whole truth about climate.
Are you a scientist or an expert?
Of course not. I’m just a layperson, like many other bloggers, who happened to notice some things were not making any sense. I got interested in it and realized that there are many serious scientists who have very different views. The main media in Japan never tell us that. In fact, they are ignoring the record cold in North America right now. As a writer, I feel we need journalists who actually do the job of investigating.
Are many people in Japan skeptical about climate science?
I don’t like the expression ‘skeptics’. They are in fact climate realists. If the question is: Are there many climatic realists in Japan, then I would answer as follows: Unfortunately not. Most people simply believe what they are told by the media. Japan is rather culturally and media isolated. Many people here do not understand English well enough to read dissenting material from abroad. The information they receive gets filtered beforehand. It’s not like in the US, or Britain, where people get to hear both sides.
When do you think people in Japan will become more skeptical about climate science?

Not in the foreseeable future, I think. As I said, Japanese people are rather isolated from the outside world, and so rely on the mainstream media for their information. There are some very good realist scientists in Japan, but they are shut out by the media. Climate realism will reach Japan only after alarmism ends in US and Europe.
The planet has warmed over the past century. What’s behind it?
I’m not a scientist, just a layman. Nobody really knows. We only know that there are many different scientists with many different explanations – many having to do with the natural oceanic and solar cycles, and not CO2. Well, I agree with Dr. Lindzen’s opinion. And as you can see from past posts, I even checked the Japanese countryside stations. Many of them have not warmed for about 20 or more years.
Much of the manmade component is probably the urban heat island effect and poor land use.
What are the most convincing facts that tell us there’s no alarm?
That’s easy to answer. Just look at the temperature of the Holocene. It was often much warmer than it is today over the past 10,000 years. The temperature of the last 30 years is nothing unusual. What’s 30 years compared to the last 10,000?
Also typhoons, hurricanes etc. show in fact a downward trend. And the tide gauges at coastlines show no alarming story.
And if you haven’t noticed, the science is so politicized.
Why do you check temperature data?
I simply believe in searching for the truth. I can’t stand it when honest scientists who are simply trying to get to the truth get attacked and hurt. Some scientists say it’s all trace gas CO2. I can’t overlook such absurdity.
So, I think laymen have to do journalism now because major media have abandoned journalism in Japan. This world is far from perfect, but we can work to make it better.
Fortunately, I can check the data and present the results with charts. I will keep doing this.

Share this...FacebookTwitterAccording to a comprehensive (305 locations in 10 countries) 2018 study, deaths attributed to extreme heat have been stable to declining in recent decades (1985-2012).  In contrast, deaths attributed to cold weather show “no clear patterns” – neither increasing or decreasing.

Across the globe, recent cold spells have become more and more deadly.
In the UK, for example, there were 50,100 excess deaths due to “a prolonged spell of extreme cold” during the winter of 2018, which is the highest mortality number since 1976 for this region.  In contrast, deaths associated with summer heat waves usually only reach into the hundreds or less.

Image Source: The Guardian
Despite Australia’s relatively warm climate, there were about 6 times more attributable cold-related deaths (61.4%) than heat-related deaths (10.6%) during the first decade of the 21st century.

Image Source: Cheng et al., 2019
In Southwest China, like Australia, there were 6 times more deaths attributable to cold weather (4.08%) than to hot weather (0.67%) during the 2009-2016 period, when global temperatures were often said to be “the hottest on record”.

Image Source: Deng et al., 2019
Even for warm-weather India, moderately and extremely cold temperatures had an attributable mortality risk many times greater than moderately and extremely hot temperatures during 2001-2013.

Image Source: Fu et al., 2018
In Spain, the frequency of cold days increased slightly during 1983-2013.  While heat-related deaths decreased in frequency during this time span, cold-related mortality has been increasing.
The authors (Díaz et al., 2019) suggest that increased energy poverty and the high costs to heat homes are a significant reason why cold-attributable deaths have risen in Spain.

Image Source: Díaz et al., 2019
Considering the death toll for cold weather events hasn’t been declining in recent decades, and that cold weather is far more deadly than hot weather, perhaps there should be more of an emphasis on policies and practices that keep citizens safe during cold weather events in this “global warming” era.

"The Western Australian Labor government says it will back the federal government’s 2030 climate targets, rejecting attempts by the state’s Environmental Protection Authority to introduce tougher measures for new major projects.  Proponents of major projects will be given the freedom to propose their own timelines for cutting carbon emissions as well as setting their own targets.  The WA energy minister, Bill Johnston, said the state would have an “aspirational” target of net zero emissions by 2050. He said WA acknowledged the federal government’s 26%-28% reduction target by 2030 and would commit to “working with the commonwealth to achieve this goal”. The policy announcement, made in parliament on Wednesday, has been welcomed by the state’s gas industry, which has been the main driver of Australia’s rising emissions. But environment groups see it as another preemptive strike on the WA EPA, which has been consulting on new guidelines for greenhouse gas emissions. Submissions as part of that process close on Monday. A spokeswoman for Woodside Energy said the government had “listened to industry” and “taken an important step toward providing certainty” for major investments. She said the WA EPA “must take the same approach as it consults on its proposed new guidelines on greenhouse gas emissions”. The state government’s position puts it at odds with federal Labor, which wanted to strengthen Australia’s emissions target to 45% if it had won the May election. The WA EPA’s original proposal for the state, published in March, was that developers of new or expanded major projects would be required to offset all direct emissions associated with the project. At the time, it said it wanted to set a “higher bar” for assessing the impacts of major projects on climate because a lack of federal policy meant Australia was not on track to meet its obligations under the Paris agreement. But the EPA withdrew the guideline and opened up further consultation with industry after an outcry from gas companies and following a call from the state’s premier, Mark McGowan. McGowan denied he had put pressure on the independent body. The director of the Australia Institute’s climate and energy program, Richie Merzian, said the timing of Wednesday’s announcement looked like another attempt to override the EPA before it had had a chance to consider submissions from the fresh round of consultation. “At the behest of the WA government, it’s revisited and consulted on this policy and before it can even report back to the minister for the environment, the minister for mines comes back with carte blanche for the gas companies,” Merzian said. Merzian said while the goal of net zero emissions by 2050 was a “silver lining”, that target was still aspirational and “there’s no interim target and it’s not clear what they actually expect from these major emitters”. “What is clear is Australia can’t afford to allow such huge projects to continue to pollute with no limit,” he said. The director of the Conservation Council of WA, Piers Verstegen, said a target of net zero emissions by 2050 was welcome, but the government also had to deliver “immediate reductions” rather than increases in WA’s carbon pollution. “At present, WA is the only state with rising pollution. Emissions growth in the WA LNG industry is cancelling out the gains that have been made in all other states,” he said.“The key test of this policy is whether it will permit further short or medium-term pollution increases. The suggestion that industry will be able to nominate their own short-term targets under this policy is concerning.” Johnston said the policy was “sensible and balanced” and that the aspirational target for 2050 “provides the certainty needed for future major projects”. “Government will always respect the independence of the EPA,” he said. “The EPA has historically called for more clarity from government about its policy on greenhouse emissions – this policy provides that clarity going forward.” But Labor’s federal climate and energy, Mark Butler, said it was well known Australia’s 2030 targets were not strong enough. He did not directly criticise WA’s policy, but said “the advice of scientists, the UN and the Climate Change Authority is clear; a 2030 emissions reduction target of 26% is simply not consistent with achieving the Paris agreement targets”. “It is good to see WA join Queensland, Victoria, Tasmania and NSW in having a target of net zero emissions by 2050 – consistent with the Paris agreement – and it is past time the Morrison government adopted this long term target,” he said. The Greens’ federal climate change spokesman, Adam Bandt, said the federal Labor leader, Anthony Albanese, should “condemn” the WA policy. “Anthony Albanese needs to stomp on WA Labor and join the Greens in fighting the Liberals,” he said. “We are in a climate emergency, yet WA Labor has capitulated to the fossil fuel giants and adopted the weak climate targets of the coal-loving Liberals”."
"Nearly 40% of UK greenhouse gas emissions, to use a figure architects love to bandy, are caused by the built environment. Or a bit more, depending on the definitions used. It’s an arresting figure. It suggests that the design of buildings and the planning of cities can do much to counter climate crisis.  Architects like to think of themselves as public-spirited, well-intentioned people. The profession tends to attract people who want to change the world for the better. And what could matter more than the prevention of environmental and societal collapse? It makes squabbles about architectural style or form seem trivial by comparison. So what would architecture look like – more importantly, what would it be – if all involved really and truly put climate at the centre of their concerns? Would there be no more concrete, given the material has been fingered as particularly destructive? Or an end to towers clad in panels that have to be replaced every 30 years? Or much less building altogether?  It is a question raised earlier this year by the launch of Architects Declare, in which 17 winners of the Stirling prize proclaimed a set of principles by which they and – they hoped – others would from now on work, and by the debate that followed. How serious could these architects really be, went one of the reactions, given that a number of them are designing major airports? A more radical version of the question will be put by the young curators of the Oslo Architecture Triennale, Maria Smith, Phin Harper, Cecilie Sachs Olsen and Matthew Dalziel, which opens later this month. “Just fiddling around with what the market gives us is not enough,” says Harper. What is considered sustainable differs wildly depending on who you ask. The World Green Building Council, an organisation supported by members from the construction industry, holds up the seemingly surprising example of Barangaroo, a huge high-rise development on the Sydney waterfront. Harper and Smith cite traditional earth-building techniques and ingenious experiments in building structures without cement or steel. Somewhere in between is a building like the Stirling prize-shortlisted Cork House in Eton, about which nobody has a bad word to say. The argument of Architects Declare – which might be called the sensible middle ground – goes something like this: architects (and for that matter contractors, clients, engineers and everyone else involved in making buildings) have no excuse for not giving their utmost to make their work have as little impact on the environment as possible. They have to consider everything – how far stone might have to travel from quarry to site, for example, and whether or not a building’s components will end up as landfill when it is demolished. It is not enough to reduce what are called the “in-use” costs – heating, ventilation, lighting, water, waste, maintenance – but also the “embodied energy” that goes into construction and demolition: quarrying cement, smelting steel, firing bricks, shipping materials to site, putting them in place, taking them down again and disposing of them. Until recently the construction industry has concentrated on in-use costs. The British building regulations, for example, set reasonably high standards for the performance of buildings, but are silent on embodied energy. This makes no sense – there’s little point building something that performs magnificently in use, if it takes decades or centuries to pay back the expenditure of energy that went into its construction. Painful choices may be required – giving up some dearly beloved brutalist-style concrete or a favourite brick. It might mean some genuinely difficult dilemmas: concrete, if used right, slows the rates at which a building cools down and warms up (good) but is made with cement, a material that singlehandedly accounts for about 8% of the world’s carbon dioxide emissions (not good). Sustainable design shouldn’t be seen as just a technical fix, a matter of paying the right consultant enough money to make sure the building ticks enough boxes, or of buying the most magical available piece of cooling technology. It should rather be integrated into the art of architecture. The ideal is that it should help buildings be all round better, longer-lasting, more pleasurable, more beautiful – “generosity, quality of materials, what people want – it kind of makes them endure” is how Alison Brooks, one of the Architects Declare signatories puts it. It could mean more natural stone, more timber. This is why the Cork House appeals – its material is lovely stuff, which also happens to be renewable, recyclable and highly insulating. Slightly more radically, the architectural profession needs to reconsider its value systems, what is considered good and what bad. Architects are still trained from studenthood to perform in what Steve Tompkins, one of the driving forces behind Architects Declare, calls a “competitive and individualistic profession”. They get more glory for designing a singular new building than they would if they worked out a good way of insulating old houses. Yet, as most of the building stock of the future is already with us, and as demolition and rebuilding entails the chucking away of whatever went into making the original building, the latter is likely to be more useful than the former. All of which, if every architect pursued it with full commitment, would be a significant advance. This collection of good principles, however, doesn’t answer the airport question, which highlights the limits on architects’ powers: it is not up to them to decide how much air travel there is in the world, which leaves them with the choice of refusing the commission to design airport buildings, or helping them to be as “green” as they possibly can be. Grimshaw Architects, Foster and Partners and Zaha Hadid Architects, signatories of Architects Declare, have opted for the latter. They are working on terminals in Heathrow, Mexico City and Beijing, respectively. For Jeremy Till, head of Central Saint Martins school of art and design, these architects’ choice is a “farce.” “You can’t have a carbon-neutral airport,” he says. Architects have to do more than be well-intentioned instruments of what he calls “an extractive industry.” They have to be activists as well as designers. Maria Smith and Phin Harper believe drastic times call for drastic actions. If, as the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change said last autumn, there were only 12 years left to limit climate change catastrophe (make that 11, as nearly a year has passed since then), the conventional processes of architecture are too slow to make any difference. By the time a well-considered, carefully calculated development has successfully traded off the inputs and outputs that went into its construction, it will be too late. Rather the whole attitude to construction has to change now. Which also requires the economic system behind it – that is to say, capitalism – to change. Their Triennale in Oslo, a series of displays and performances starting on 26 September, will apply to architecture the economic and political idea of degrowth – the beliefs that an alternative has to be found to the continuously rising GDPs that are fundamental to capitalist economies. For Smith and Harper it is about using resources that already exist and, rather than serving “utilitarian goals of investment and profit”, concentrating on “what really makes life worth living”. “All the ingredients for a good life exist somewhere in the world,” they say – it’s just a question of enabling everyone to have access to them. For architecture this might mean learning from indigenous building techniques based on using renewable materials close at hand, such as mud walls or thatch, enhanced with modern technology. Smith and Harper give as examples machines for making bricks out of mud, wall panels made of hemp and lime, materials made from compressed recycled denim or from ground-up pine needles mixed with pine resin. There is a technique for building columns by filling heavy duty fabric with sand or rubble. There is mycelium, a form of fungus that can be made into bricks. A practical example of this thinking is the Ilford community market, a project by Smith’s practice, Interrobang, which is due to open next year. Here there will be no concrete foundations, but a timber structure stabilised by rocks in metal cages that can be demounted and reassembled with minimal waste or impact. It should also be possible to make a humble kitchen extension, argue Smith and Harper, using materials dug up from the ground around it, “rather than importing steel reinforcement from China”. It would only require a different idea of what a kitchen extension should look like. There are a few gaps in the thinking articulated by Smith and Harper. If action on climate is urgent, we probably can’t wait for the entire economic and social basis of the modern construction industry to change first. It’s also not obvious how some of the experimental techniques they mention can be developed at speed and realised at sufficient scale to make a meaningful impact. They themselves don’t pretend to have all the answers. But then, it’s also clear that more moderate members of the profession don’t have all the answers, either. What is clear is that everyone involved in the design and making of buildings has to do everything they can to mitigate their effect on climate. Which, if we’re really lucky, will also lead to better architecture. Barangaroo, SydneyA large-scale commercial development that tries to modify conventional processes rather than replace them; for example, by reducing the amount of cement in concrete, or using water from an adjoining bay to help cool the towers of homes and offices. Its approach has won awards. Sandbag columnsThe Canadian architectural practice YYYY-MM-DD are developing what might be called super sandbags: structural columns made by containing sand or rubble in the type of heavy-duty fabric used for shipping construction materials. In principle, it means you could build using whatever is available on a building site, but it’s still at a speculative stage. Radical recyclingMa-tt-er, a London-based “materials research design studio”, are pushing the possibilities of natural and recycled materials – plaster made from mussel shells, floors made from seaweed, denim from old jeans compressed into a load-bearing material. MyceliumThe fungal substance that gives mushrooms their structure is now touted as both an organic substitute for plastic and a vegetarian substitute for beef. Architects are exploring its possibilities too, most conspicuously with temporary towers built outside MoMA’s PS1 gallery in New York. Engineered timberThe processing of wood such that it’s strong enough to build multistorey buildings is proof that experimental techniques can become mainstream. Engineered timber is now frequently used as an alternative to concrete, at large scales. The only snag, as the engineer Mark Skelly points out, is that there isn’t enough sustainably sourced timber in the world to make all buildings out of it. The simplest way to build green is not to build at all: existing building stock is a vast store of carbon and of resources that are lost when a building is demolished. Re-use is usually seen as less glamorous than building new, but it’s a good use of architects skills to find ways to adapt rather than replace."
"Their style could hardly be more different, though their aims are the same: as Greta Thunberg sailed into New York last week on a low-carbon high-tech yacht to highlight the climate crisis, Prince Harry faced flak for taking private jets for short-hop breaks while campaigning against global heating. But the contrast between the two reflects broader dilemmas in the environmental movement. On Tuesday, the Duke of Sussex invited further ridicule as he flew into Amsterdam – a direct Eurostar train from London takes three hours and 41 minutes – to unveil an initiative for the tourism industry, Travalyst, which aims to reduce the impact of holidaymakers but encourages travel.  Harry defended his flying record on the basis that “nobody is perfect”, and that “occasionally [there is] a unique circumstance to ensure that my family are safe”. The Guardian recently calculated, using data from the German NGO Atmosfair, that a UK citizen taking a single flight can have the same impact on the climate in a few hours as a person in one of the world’s least developed countries does in a whole year. For the prince, travel by private plane for his family is likely to generate as much as an entire village. But not everyone can solve their travel problems like Thunberg, as there is unlikely to be a transatlantic sailing boom to replace flying. Tony Juniper, one of the UK’s most prominent environmentalists who has worked with Prince Charles and now chairs Natural England, said the prince was not alone in facing green dilemmas. “Prince Harry does a great deal of good work raising awareness and helping to make progress on conservation questions,” he said. “Like anyone else, however, he has to deal with the circumstances of the real world, and the fact that we don’t yet have zero-emissions planes. Flying less is certainly a key message we all need to hear but quite a lot of environmentalists use planes to make their work possible, and in his position he often has no alternative but to fly, including for reasons of security.” The irony of encouraging tourism, despite its potential damage to pristine or struggling environments, and the emissions involved in getting to remote places, is also one that the green movement must grapple with, Juniper said. “Ecotourism is one of the ways that wildlife can be rendered worth more alive than dead, and it is something the conservation community needs to embrace as one strategy alongside others,” he said. “Take the example of Costa Rica, where deforestation has been reversed, in large part because of the economic benefits that come with tourists visiting to see the wonderful wildlife there.” The royals’ fellow feeling for other endangered creatures is certainly valued by the organisations they work with. Mark Jones, the head of policy at Born Free, which campaigns for wildlife, said: “The interest the royal family, and particularly princes William and Harry, have shown in global wildlife conservation has undoubtedly helped bring the plight of wildlife to the attention of a truly global audience, from decision-makers to the wider public. We are grateful for their interest in and support for our efforts to reverse global biodiversity loss and provide a secure future for the wildlife with which we share our world.” Greenpeace says it would like to see a frequent flyer levy, tax on aviation fuel, an end to airport expansion and most of all moves to rein in demand, because strategies such as offsetting – donating cash to programmes that reduce greenhouse gas emissions in other areas – are not enough. John Sauven, executive director of Greenpeace UK, said: “Offsetting works over an extremely long timeframe. Maybe as a way of raising money for reforestation it works, but that’s charity. We should call it what it is.” Justin Francis, a co-founder of the travel firm Responsible Travel, said: “Voluntary [offsetting] initiatives are not enough – the cost of flying must increase. Carbon offsets are no substitute for carbon reduction.” Anna Hughes, who runs the campaign group Flight Free UK, said: “The answer is simply not to fly.” Flying has expanded rapidly in recent years, partly owing to tax breaks and incentives compared with less carbon-intensive travel, and last year accounted for 2.6% of energy-related emissions. On Friday, new details of the Sussexes’ forthcoming Africa tour will be revealed by Buckingham Palace. It is believed that conservation and green issues will be among the top priorities for the couple’s first major overseas programme of engagement, as well as gender equality, education and development, where the duchess has already made a mark. The British royal family is not alone in striving to save the planet, as monarchies across Europe have taken to espousing environmental programmes as a way to bring their influence to bear on intractable problems – and incidentally to maintain high-profile roles and win popular support without courting political controversy. The Dutch royal family campaigns on water scarcity and flooding, Prince Albert of Monaco has taken a leading role in marine conservation, including battling plastic pollution, and the Nordic royals highlight the dangers to the Arctic from global heating. There have been missteps along the way, though, and not just for Harry – in 2014 his elder brother, William, was roundly criticised for shooting wild boar and deer with Spanish royals the day before launching a wildlife appeal."
"Queensland’s most influential farm lobby group, AgForce, has backed calls for a review of consensus science on the Great Barrier Reef, as the state’s agricultural sector intensifies its campaign against proposed water quality regulations. On Friday the release of two key reports painted an alarming picture of the state of the reef. The Queensland-led water quality report – which rated the water quality at inner reefs as “poor” – highlighted the impact of land management practices that contribute to the degradation of the reef due to sediment and nutrient run-off. The findings were released at a critical point in debate about the Queensland government’s proposed regulations, which would set variable pollution limits in separate reef catchments. Agricultural groups say those regulations will have a significant impact on farmers; particularly graziers, sugarcane growers and tropical horticulture. Some farmers accept the consensus science, but claim the regulations are ill thought out and will have unintended consequences for primary producers. This is also the formal position of the LNP opposition. But increasingly, sober debate about the impact of the regulations has veered into science scepticism; pushed by the controversial scientist Peter Ridd, some of the larger peak industry bodies, backbench LNP MPs and opaque front groups. The AgForce chief executive, Michael Guerin, in a statement to Guardian Australia sent before the release of the latest reef reports, said the organisation agreed with Ridd’s calls for the science “to be more thoroughly examined and tested”. Last week Guardian Australia revealed that an expert panel led by the former chief scientist Ian Chubb had warned ministers that Ridd is misrepresenting robust science about the plight of the reef, and compared his claims to the strategy used by the tobacco industry to raise doubt about the impact of smoking. Guerin said there “was no absolute consensus” on the reef. “We are not scientists and have no position on the science. However, when eminent reef scientists call into question the research conducted by their peers, we as a community would be foolish not to listen. “We are simply asking the government to make sure of the science before it implements such momentous changes with potentially devastating consequences for so many.” The AgForce general president and ABC board member Georgie Somerset will speak at a protest rally of famers in Townsville on Tuesday to coincide with a sitting of the state parliament. The event is being promoted by the opaque front organisation Farmers United, with flyers quoting Ridd and featuring the AgForce logo. Sign up to receive the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning The industry argues regulation is not necessary, and that “best management practice” measures, led by agricultural groups and funded by government, were the best method to address water quality issues. Earlier this year, in protest against the proposed regulations and citing privacy concerns, AgForce deleted a decade of data from its BMP database. The Queensland environment minister, Leeanne Enoch, said on Friday that the reef water quality report showed that voluntary BMP programs were not working quickly enough, and that urgent action was needed to address the health of the reef. “The report … shows land-based run-off still remains a problem and that urgent changes are needed if we are going to meet our targets,” Enoch said. “The report also shows that many farmers have been doing good work to help improve the quality of run-off, but unfortunately the science is showing that uptake has not been fast enough. “For example, we want 90% of sugarcane land across the reef catchments managed using best management practice systems by 2025. But, the results show this was happening on only 9.8% of land so far. “Overall water quality modelling showed only a 0.3% reduction in dissolved inorganic nitrogen and a 0.5% reduction in sediment in 2017-2018 across all regions. “This simply isn’t enough. There are also a lot of scores that are poor, or very poor.” As large agricultural groups seek to question the science, largely on the basis of a single opinion rejected by scores of other reef scientists, questions have grown about whether they can continue to manage millions in grants allocated for reef water quality measures. AgForce jointly manages Queensland-funded BMP programs. AgForce last year lobbied in support of the controversial $433m federal grant to the Great Barrier Reef Foundation, and at the time noted that “agricultural land is one of many factors which can affect water quality and the long term health” of the reef. The Greens senator Peter Whish-Wilson has written to the federal environment minister, Sussan Ley, suggesting groups that receive reef foundation grants to improve water quality, but who otherwise seek to question the underlying science, have a conflict of interest. He cited support for Ridd’s recent lecture tour from regional branches of the peak organisation Canegrowers. “On the face of it, this is a conflict of interest. The activity of Queensland Canegrowers (as a subcontractor) is impairing the ability of the foundation to improve water quality in the reef.”"

Heat and cold zero-sum
First at the European Institute for Climate and Energy (EIKE), Klaus Öllerer reported how the Sahara heat ended up being a “zero-sum” event for the northern hemisphere region of Europe and Asia.
Öllerer wrote last week that despite the heat that took place in large parts of Europe, it was cooler than usual in other neighboring parts. Only a certain area in Central Europe (purple area) was particularly hot. Around it, it was less warm (yellow) and cooler than usual (blue):

“Even large parts of the Sahara are cooler than usual (blue). This is no wonder, as the heat is now in Europe and cooler air flows into the Sahara,” Öllerer wrote.

“The above-average warm areas balance out with the above-average cold areas,” he concluded. “The current warming is a zero-sum game! Historically, such events have occurred again and again.”
“It is even the case that in cooler times – such as the Little Ice Age – warm summer extremes were more frequent than in the last one hundred years and more,” Öllerer added.

As is the case with modern reports claiming all new “unprecedented events” written by the climate ambulance chasing media, we usually find out days later that such events have in reality happened before and were in fact far worse.
This is the case with the last week’s French “record-breaking” heat wave.

French online Le Parisien here looks back at the “crushing”, “almost uninterrupted” heat wave of 1911, which dragged 70 tortuous days from early July to mid September.
Le Parisien writes how Paris “cooked” under the scorching heat and how “thousands of babies were lost”.

Not only Paris was “burning”, but so were other locations across western Europe. Le Parisien reports how temperatures soared to 40°C in Lyon, Bordeaux and London.

15 days long the thermometer refused to go below 30°C
The French say that when July is hot, a cool August usually follows. But that was not the case in 1911. August was even worse: “For fifteen days in a row, the Parisian thermometer refused to go below 30°C!”
Le Parisien describes how the public turned sour against meteorologists, who had predicted the heat would soon recede and the heat nightmare would end. But that did not happen until mid September.
41,072 dead, record mortality rate
In total the heat wave claimed more than 40,000 lives, Le Parisien reports. Parts of Paris ran out of water and the dailies reported “the list of victims, mowed down by heat or its consequences” and how “from July 23 to 29, then from August 13 to 19, mortality reached record highs.”
Le Parisien summarized: “In total, the 1911 heat wave, which lasted until mid-September, caused 41,072 deaths in France” and that most of the victims were either the elderly or babies under two years of age. Overall the tragedy saw infant mortality increase 20%.
“This year will have to be marked with a black cross,” wrote a doctor in his diary. In contrast, the French heat wave of 2003 killed 15,000.
500,000 dead in 1636
There were also other “murderous summers” in France, Le Parisien writes that thanks to the work of Emmanuel Le Roy-Ladurie, “we know that a terrible heat wave in 1636 killed 500,000 of King Louis XIII’s subjects.” Many of the deaths resulted from epidemics of dysentery as water supplies dwindled and soured.
700,000 deaths, swarms of locusts in 1718-19
Le Parisien also cites the three-volume “Histoire humaine et comparée du climat” (Human and Comparative History of Climate), which describes how the the summers of 1718-19 saw “700,000 deaths recorded” and how the Paris region had been “transformed into the Sahara” and even saw “the appearance of swarms of locusts!”

Share this...FacebookTwitterMay normally is a month that sees rapid snow melt in Alps. But this year May was an unusually cold month across Central Europe and parts of the Alps saw heavy snow accumulation.
A week ago, on May 25, BR public broadcasting reported here how May snow levels at Germany’s tallest peak, Zugspitze, reached a 20-year high at just over 6 meters of depth. The article wrote that experts thought the depth would not rise further.
But that turned out to be wrong.
Highest level since February, 1981
Four days later, on May 29, another 35 cm were added and pushed the depth to 6.40 meters, according to wetteronline.ch here. the website wrote: “Zugspitze: Never so much snow since 1981.” The website added that the snow depth there was “higher than it has been since February 1981.”
What follows is a webcam image of the Zugspitze peak from May 29th:

Gained 190 cm in May
The following is a chart depicting snow levels at Germany’s highest peak for the month of May. Clearly we see that snow accumulated during the month rather than melted.

Wetterline wrote: “In May, the last time there was a similar amount was in 1980. The previous snow record of the Zugspitze also dates from this year: 7.80 meters of snow were registered on April 26, 1980.”

"Dear Greta, Thank you for travelling across the Atlantic to north America to help us do the most important work in the world. There are those of us who welcome you and those who do not because you have landed in two places, a place being born and a place dying, noisily, violently, with as much damage as possible. It has always been two places, since the earliest Europeans arrived in places where Native people already lived, and pretended they were new and gave them the wrong names. You can tell the history of the United States – which are not very united now – as the history of Sojourner Truth, the heroine who helped liberate the enslaved, as that of the slaveowners and defenders of slavery, as a place of visionary environmental voices such as Rachel Carson and the corporate powers and profiteers she fought and exposed. Right now the US is the country of Donald Trump and of Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, of climate destroyers and climate protectors. Sometimes the Truths and the Carsons have won. I believe it is more than possible for Ocasio-Cortez and the Green New Deal to win, for the spirit of generosity and inclusion and the protection of nature to win – but that depends on what we do now. Which is why I’m so grateful that you have arrived to galvanize us with your clarity of vision and passionate commitment. To be a climate activist anywhere on Earth now is to stand at a crossroads: heaven on one side and hell on the other Not long ago I talked to a powerful climate organizer who began her work when she was only a little older than you, and she told me that her hope right now is that people recognize that this is a moment of great possibility, of openings and momentum, and a growing alarm and commitment to what the changing climate requires of us. Something has changed, thanks to you and to the young people who have brought new urgency and vision to the climate movement. Many people have become concerned and awake for the first time, and the conversation we need to have is opening up. People are ready for change, or some of us are. This is what’s being born in the US and around the world: not only new energy systems, but new social systems with more room for the voices of those who are not white or male or straight or neurotypical. The old energy system was about centralized control and the malevolent power of Gazprom and BP, Shell and Chevron, and the governments warped into serving them rather than humanity. The new system must not only be about localized energy, but democratized decision-making, about the rights of nature and the rights of the vulnerable and the future, over profit. Some of this is already here: not only the larger groups you’re surely heard of – the Sunrise Movement, 350.org, the Sierra Club, Rainforest Action Network – but countless local and tribal groups that have arisen to stop this pipeline or that coal port or these fracking projects, to protect this forest or this mountain or these waters. They are not visible the way the United Nations or the US Congress or European Union is, but their work matters, and perhaps we will build a lot of this transition out from below – but we need the big policy agendas set from above as well. Everywhere I see remarkable things happening. No matter how much you see of this big country, this huge continent, there is more than you can see. I hope you have a chance to see some of the beauty of the American landscapes, from rainforests to deserts; there is also beauty in the passionate commitment around the country. Coalminers in Kentucky have been blocking a coal train track for a month, because their bankrupt company stiffed them on wages, and coalminers elsewhere recently spoke to this newspaper about their clarity that coal is over and that the Green New Deal and its jobs are welcome. The gigantic coal-burning, sky-polluting Navajo Generating Station in Arizona will shut down later this year, and, Scientific American reported, “Its average annual emissions over that period are roughly equivalent to what 3.3 million passenger cars would pump into the atmosphere in a single year. The Navajo Generating Station isn’t alone. It’s among a new wave of super-polluters headed for the scrap heap,” including giant plants in Kentucky and Pennsylvania.” Last year, US coal plants with annual emissions of 83 million tonnes of carbon were shut down. Several states – California, New York, Hawaii, New Mexico – have made commitments to 100% renewable electricity in the near future, and while the federal government tries to push us backward, many states lean forward. This summer Texas began to get more energy from wind than from coal. Iowa in the midwest now gets 37% of its electricity from wind, not because of idealism alone, but pragmatism: wind is cheaper. Science magazine reported last month, “Solar plus batteries is now cheaper than fossil power,” and a Connecticut newspaper recently announced that Chubb, the largest commercial insurer in the USA, will stop insuring coal plants and coal mining. Worldwide, we are in the midst of an energy revolution that dwarfs the industrial revolution: human beings will for the first time not use fire, will not release carbon into the sky, to get most of our energy. We will inevitably transition away from fossil fuels as a primary energy source, and the question is only when. If we do it swiftly, we minimize damage to the climate; if we wait, we maximize it. The damage is here, and it’s not only destroying nature, it’s killing us. When the California town of Paradise burned down last November, at least 86 people burned to death or choked on smoke; millions suffered from the smoke that spread across the region. Heat deaths are up in the south-west, where 235 people died in Arizona alone from this cause during 2017. But we also know that there are so many uncounted deaths from poisonous fossil fuels. We know that many of the refugees on the USA’s southern border are climate refugees, driven out of their homes in Central America by the failure of agriculture from unpredictable and violent weather, heat, and drought. We know that Alaska was this month for the first time ice-free all along its coast, and the hot dry weather inland led to horrific wildfires. “Starting on the fourth of July and lasting multiple days, temperatures across Alaska were 20 to 30 degrees above average in some locations,” reported National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. To be a climate activist anywhere on Earth now is to stand at a crossroads: heaven on one side and hell on the other. Heaven because the transition we need to make and are making – just not big enough or fast enough – is not only an power-generation revolution, but a decentralization of political power, a shift away from the big energy companies who used governments to make wars and make profits for them, a shift away from the poisonousness of fossil fuel. Hell because the destruction of what it took nature millions of years to create – the exquisite balance of ecosystems, of bird migration in harmony with seasons, of symbioses between species, of the great Himalayan and Andean glaciers whose waters feed so many people, of rainforests and temperate forests – is hideous as well as terrifying. The Amazon is burning because of one rightwing leader and a system that rewards agricultural products but not forest protection, even though we need rainforests more than we need the soybeans and beef raised on the land stolen from the rainforest and its indigenous inhabitants. I’ve mentioned a bit of what is going on in my troubled, complicated country, the US, but of course these are global conflicts and global situations, and the solutions are advancing almost everywhere, because they are good solutions to terrible problems. You have come to help us choose the former over the latter, and more of us thank you than you will ever be able to see or hear. More than that, we’re with you, trying to realize the goals that the climate demands of us, to make a sustainable world for those who are young now, those yet to come, and for the beauty of the world that is still with us. • Rebecca Solnit is a journalist and author."

"On a sweltering Thursday evening in Manhattan last month, people across New York City were preparing for what meteorologists predicted would be the hottest weekend of the year. Over the past two decades, every record for peak electricity use in the city has occurred during a heatwave, as millions of people turn on their air conditioning units at the same time. And so, at the midtown headquarters of Con Edison, the company that supplies more than 10 million people in the New York area with electricity, employees were busy turning a conference room on the 19th floor into an emergency command centre. Inside the conference room, close to 80 engineers and company executives, joined by representatives of the city’s emergency management department, monitored the status of the city power grid, directed ground crews and watched a set of dials displaying each borough’s electricity use tick upward. “It’s like the bridge in Star Trek in there,” Anthony Suozzo, a former senior system operator with the company, told me. “You’ve got all hands on deck, they’re telling Scotty to fix things, the system is running at max capacity.”  Power grids are measured by the amount of electricity that can pass through them at any one time. Con Edison’s grid, with 62 power substations and more than 130,000 miles of power lines and cables across New York City and Westchester County, can deliver 13,400MW every second. This is roughly equivalent to 18m horsepower. On a regular day, New York City demands around 10,000MW every second; during a heatwave, that figure can exceed 13,000MW. “Do the math, whatever that gap is, is the AC,” Michael Clendenin, a company spokesman, told me. The combination of high demand and extreme temperature can cause parts of the system to overheat and fail, leading to blackouts. In 2006, equipment failure left 175,000 people in Queens without power for a week, during a heatwave that killed 40 people. This year, by the evening of Sunday 21 July, with temperatures above 36C (97F) and demand at more than 12,000MW every second, Con Edison cut power to 50,000 customers in Brooklyn and Queens for 24 hours, afraid that parts of the nearby grid were close to collapse, which could have left hundreds of thousands of people without power for days. The state had to send in police to help residents, and Con Edison crews dispensed dry ice for people to cool their homes. As the world gets hotter, scenes like these will become increasingly common. Buying an air conditioner is perhaps the most popular individual response to climate change, and air conditioners are almost uniquely power-hungry appliances: a small unit cooling a single room, on average, consumes more power than running four fridges, while a central unit cooling an average house uses more power than 15. “Last year in Beijing, during a heatwave, 50% of the power capacity was going to air conditioning,” says John Dulac, an analyst at the International Energy Agency (IEA). “These are ‘oh shit’ moments.” There are just over 1bn single-room air conditioning units in the world right now – about one for every seven people on earth. Numerous reports have projected that by 2050 there are likely to be more than 4.5bn, making them as ubiquitous as the mobile phone is today. The US already uses as much electricity for air conditioning each year as the UK uses in total. The IEA projects that as the rest of the world reaches similar levels, air conditioning will use about 13% of all electricity worldwide, and produce 2bn tonnes of CO2 a year – about the same amount as India, the world’s third-largest emitter, produces today. All of these reports note the awful irony of this feedback loop: warmer temperatures lead to more air conditioning; more air conditioning leads to warmer temperatures. The problem posed by air conditioning resembles, in miniature, the problem we face in tackling the climate crisis. The solutions that we reach for most easily only bind us closer to the original problem. The global dominance of air conditioning was not inevitable. As recently as 1990, there were only about 400m air conditioning units in the world, mostly in the US. Originally built for industrial use, air conditioning eventually came to be seen as essential, a symbol of modernity and comfort. Then air conditioning went global. Today, as with other drivers of the climate crisis, we race to find solutions – and puzzle over how we ended up so closely tied to a technology that turns out to be drowning us. Like the aqueduct or the automobile, air conditioning is a technology that transformed the world. Lee Kuan Yew, the first prime minister of independent Singapore, called it “one of the signal inventions of history” that allowed the rapid modernisation of his tropical country. In 1998, the American academic Richard Nathan told the New York Times that, along with the “civil rights revolution”, air conditioning had been the biggest factor in changing American demography and politics over the previous three decades, enabling extensive residential development in the very hot, and very conservative, American south. A century ago, few would have predicted this. For the first 50 years of its existence, air conditioning was mainly restricted to factories and a handful of public spaces. The initial invention is credited to Willis Carrier, an American engineer at a heating and ventilation company, who was tasked in 1902 with reducing humidity in a Brooklyn printing factory. Today we assume that the purpose of air conditioning is to reduce heat, but engineers at the time weren’t solely concerned with temperature. They wanted to create the most stable possible conditions for industrial production – and in a print factory, humidity curled sheets of paper and smudged ink. Carrier realised that removing heat from the factory air would reduce humidity, and so he borrowed technology from the nascent refrigeration industry to create what was, and still is, essentially a jacked-up fridge. Then as now, air conditioning units work by breathing in warm air, passing it across a cold surface, and exhaling cool, dry air. The invention was an immediate success with industry – textile, ammunition, and pharmaceutical factories were among the first adopters – and then began to catch on elsewhere. The House of Representatives installed air conditioning in 1928, followed by the White House and the Senate in 1929. But during this period, most Americans encountered air conditioning only in places such as theatres or department stores, where it was seen as a delightful novelty. It wasn’t until the late 1940s, when it began to enter people’s homes, that the air conditioner really conquered the US. Before then, according to the historian Gail Cooper, the industry had struggled to convince the public that air conditioning was a necessity, rather than a luxury. In her definitive account of the early days of the industry, Air-Conditioning America, Cooper notes that magazines described air conditioning as a flop with consumers. Fortune called it “a prime public disappointment of the 1930s”. By 1938 only one out of every 400 American homes had an air conditioner; today it is closer to nine out of 10. What fuelled the rise of the air conditioning was not a sudden explosion in consumer demand, but the influence of the industries behind the great postwar housing boom. Between 1946 and 1965, 31m new homes were constructed in the US, and for the people building those houses, air conditioning was a godsend. Architects and construction companies no longer had to worry much about differences in climate – they could sell the same style of home just as easily in New Mexico as in Delaware. The prevailing mentality was that just about any problems caused by hot climates, cheap building materials, shoddy design or poor city planning could be overcome, as the American Institute of Architects wrote in 1973, “by the brute application of more air conditioning”. As Cooper writes, “Architects, builders and bankers accepted air conditioning first, and consumers were faced with a fait accompli that they merely had to ratify.” Equally essential to the rise of the air conditioner were electric utilities – the companies that operate power plants and sell electricity to consumers. Electric utilities benefit from every new house hooked up to their grid, but throughout the early 20th century they were also looking for ways to get these new customers to use even more electricity in their homes. This process was known as “load building”, after the industry term (load) for the amount of electricity used at any one time. “The cost of electricity was low, which was fine by the utilities. They simply increased demand, and encouraged customers to use more electricity so they could keep expanding and building new power plants,” says Richard Hirsh, a historian of technology at Virginia Tech. The utilities quickly recognised that air conditioning was a serious load builder. As early as 1935, Commonwealth Edison, the precursor to the modern Con Edison, noted in its end-of-year report that the power demand from air conditioners was growing at 50% a year, and “offered substantial potential for the future”. That same year, Electric Light & Power, an industry trade magazine, reported that utilities in big cities “are now pushing air conditioning. For their own good, all power companies should be very active in this field.” By the 1950s, that future had arrived. Electric utilities ran print, radio and film adverts promoting air conditioning, as well as offering financing and discount rates to construction companies that installed it. In 1957, Commonwealth Edison reported that for the first time, peak electricity usage had occurred not in the winter, when households were turning up their heating, but during summer, when people were turning on their air-conditioning units. By 1970, 35% of American houses had air conditioning, more than 200 times the number just three decades earlier. At the same time, air-conditioning-hungry commercial buildings were springing up across the US. The all-glass skyscraper, a building style that, because of its poor reflective properties and lack of ventilation, often requires more than half its electricity output be reserved for air conditioning, became an American mainstay. Between 1950 and 1970 the average electricity used per square foot in commercial buildings more than doubled. New York’s World Trade Center, completed in 1974, had what was then the world’s largest AC unit, with nine enormous engines and more than 270km of piping for cooling and heating. Commentators at the time noted that it used the same amount of electricity each day as the nearby city of Schenectady, population 80,000. The air-conditioning industry, construction companies and electric utilities were all riding the great wave of postwar American capitalism. In their pursuit of profit, they ensured that the air conditioner became an essential element of American life. “Our children are raised in an air-conditioned culture,” an AC company executive told Time magazine in 1968. “You can’t really expect them to live in a home that isn’t air conditioned.” Over time, the public found they liked air conditioning, and its use continued to climb, reaching 87% of US households by 2009. The postwar building spree was underpinned by the idea that all of these new buildings would consume incredible amounts of power, and that this would not present any serious problems in the future. In 1992, the journal Energy and Buildings published an article by the British conservative academic Gwyn Prins, arguing that the American addiction to air conditioning was a symbol of its profound decadence. Prins summarised America’s guiding credo as: “We shall be cool, our plates shall overflow and gas shall be $1 a gallon, Amen.” During the time that air conditioning was reshaping America’s cities, it had little effect elsewhere. (With some exceptions – Japan, Australia and Singapore were early adopters.) Now, however, air conditioning is finally sweeping across the rest of the world. If the march of air conditioning across the US tracked its postwar building and consumption boom, its more recent expansion has followed the course of globalisation. As the rest of the world adopts more Americanised ways of building and living, air conditioning follows. In the 1990s, many countries across Asia opened up to foreign investment and embarked on an unprecedented urban building spree. Over the past three decades, about 200 million people in India have moved to cities; in China, the number is more than 500 million. From New Delhi to Shanghai, heavily air-conditioned office buildings, hotels and malls began to spring up. These buildings were not only indistinguishable from those in New York or London, but were often constructed by the same builders and architects. “When you had this money coming in from the rest of the world for high-end buildings, it often came with an American or European designer or consultancy attached,” says Ashok Lall, an Indian architect who focuses on housing and low-energy design. “And so it comes as a package with AC. They thought that meant progress.” As the rate and scale of building intensified, traditional architectural methods for mitigating hot temperatures were jettisoned. Leena Thomas, an Indian professor of architecture at the University of Technology in Sydney, told me that in Delhi in the early 1990s older forms of building design – which had dealt with heat through window screens, or facades and brise-soleils – were slowly displaced by American or European styles. “I would say that this international style has a lot to answer for,” she said. Just like the US in the 20th century, but on an even greater scale, homes and offices were increasingly being built in such a way that made air conditioning indispensable. “Developers were building without thinking,” says Rajan Rawal, a professor of architecture and city planning at Cept University in Ahmedabad. “The speed of construction that was required created pressure. So they simply built and relied on technology to fix it later.” Lall says that even with affordable housing it is possible to reduce the need for air conditioning by designing carefully. “You balance the sizes of opening, the area of the wall, the thermal properties, and shading, the orientation,” he says. But he argues that, in general, developers are not interested. “Even little things like adequate shading and insulation in the rooftop are resisted. The builders don’t appear to see any value in this. They want 10- to 20-storey blocks close to one another. That’s just how business works now, that’s what the cities are forcing us to do. It’s all driven by speculation and land value.” This reliance on air conditioning is a symptom of what the Chinese art critic Hou Hanru has called the epoch of post-planning. Today, planning as we traditionally think of it – centralised, methodical, preceding development – is vanishingly rare. Markets dictate and allocate development at incredible speed, and for the actual inhabitants, the conditions they require to live are sourced later, in a piecemeal fashion. “You see these immense towers go up, and they’re already locking the need for air conditioning into the building,” says Marlyne Sahakian, a sociologist who studies the use of air conditioning in the Philippines. Over coffee recently in London, the influential Malaysian architect Ken Yeang lamented what he viewed as the loss of an entire generation of architects and builders to a dependency on fossil fuels to control the environment. “So much damage has been done by those buildings,” he says, “I have entirely lost hope in my generation; perhaps the next one can design a rescue mission.” To its proponents, air conditioning is often presented as a simple choice that consumers make to improve their lives as they climb the economic ladder. “It’s no longer a luxury product but a necessity,” an executive at the Indian branch of the Japanese air-conditioner manufacturing giant Daikin told the Associated Press last year. “Everyone deserves AC.” This refrain is as familiar in Rajasthan now as it was in the US 70 years ago. Once air conditioning is embedded in people’s lives, they tend to want to keep it. But that fact obscures the ways that consumers’ choices are shaped by forces beyond their control. In her 1967 book Vietnam, Mary McCarthy reflected on this subtle restriction of choice in American life. “In American hotel rooms,” she wrote, “you can decide whether or not to turn on the air conditioning (that is your business), but you cannot open the window.” One step towards solving the problem presented by air conditioning – and one that doesn’t require a complete overhaul of the modern city – would be to build a better air conditioner. There is plenty of room for improvement. The invention of air conditioning predates both the first aeroplane and the first public radio broadcast, and the underlying technology has not changed much since 1902. “Everything is still based on the vapour compression cycle; same as a refrigerator. It’s effectively the same process as a century ago,” says Colin Goodwin, the technical director of the Building Services Research and Information Association. “What has happened is we’ve expanded the affordability of the air conditioner, but as far as efficiency, they’ve improved but they haven’t leaped.” One scheme to encourage engineers to build a more efficient air conditioner was launched last year by the Rocky Mountain Institute (RMI), a US-based energy policy thinktank, and endorsed by the UN environment programme and government of India. They are offering $3m to the winner of the inaugural Global Cooling prize. The aim is to design an air conditioner that is five times more efficient than the current standard model, but which costs no more than twice as much money to produce. They have received more than a hundred entries, from lone inventors to prominent universities, and even research teams from multibillion-dollar appliance giants. But, as with other technological responses to climate change, it is far from certain that the arrival of a more efficient air conditioner will significantly reduce global emissions. According to the RMI, in order to keep total global emissions from new air conditioners from rising, their prize-winning efficient air conditioner would need to go on sale no later than 2022, and capture 80% of the market by 2030. In other words, the new product would have to almost totally replace its rivals in less than a decade. Benjamin Sovacool, professor of energy policy at Sussex University and a lead author on the next Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) report, describes this ambition as not impossible, but pretty unlikely. “This idea of technology saving us is a narrative that we want to believe. Its simplicity is comforting,” he says. It has proven so comforting, in fact, that it is often discussed as if it is our first and best response to climate change – even as the timeframe for inventing and implementing such technologies becomes so narrow as to strain credulity. New air-conditioner technology would be welcome, but it is perhaps “the fourth, or maybe fifth thing on the list we should do” to reduce the emissions from air conditioning, says Diana Ürge-Vorsatz, a professor of climate change and energy policy at Central European University, and a lead author on the forthcoming IPCC report. Among the higher priorities that she mentions are planting trees, retrofitting old buildings with proper ventilation, and no longer building “concrete and glass cages that can’t withstand a heatwave”. She adds: “All of these things would be cheaper too, in the long run.”  But while these things are technically cheaper, they require changes in behaviour and major policy shifts – and the open secret of the climate crisis is that nobody really knows how to make these kind of changes on the systematic, global scale that the severity of the crisis demands. If we are not about to be rescued by technology, and worldwide policy changes look like a distant hope, there remains a very simple way of reducing the environmental damage done by air conditioning: use less of it. But, as the ecological economist and IPCC author Julia Steinberger has written, any serious proposals to change our lifestyles – cutting down on driving, flying or imported avocados – are considered “beyond the pale, heretic, almost insane”. This is especially true of air conditioning, where calls to use it less are frequently treated as suggestions that people should die in heatwaves, or evidence of a malicious desire to deny other people the same comforts that citizens in wealthy countries already enjoy. This summer, the publication of a New York Times article asking “Do Americans need air conditioning?” touched off a thousand furious social media posts, uniting figures from the feminist writer and critic Roxane Gay (“You wouldn’t last a summer week in Florida without it. Get a grip”) to the conservative professor and pundit Tom Nichols (“Air conditioning is why we left the caves … You will get my AC from me when you pry it from my frozen, frosty hands”). Despite this backlash, there is a reasonable case to be made that we are over-reliant on air conditioning and could cut back. The supposedly ideal indoor temperature has long been determined by air-conditioning engineers, using criteria that suggest pretty much all humans want the same temperature range at all times. The underlying idea is that comfort is objective, and that a building in Jakarta should be the same temperature as one in Boston. In practice, says Leena Thomas, this means that the temperature in most air-conditioned buildings is usually “low-20s plus/minus one”. But not everyone has accepted the notion that there is such as thing as the objectively “right” temperature. Studies have suggested that men have different ideal temperatures from women. In offices around the world, “Men toil in their dream temperatures, while women are left to shiver,” argued a 2015 article in the Telegraph, one of many suggesting that the scientific research had simply confirmed something millions of women already knew. Researchers have also shown that people who live in hotter areas, even for a very short time, are comfortable at higher indoor temperatures. They contend that, whether it is a state of mind or a biological adjustment, human comfort is adaptive, not objective. This is something that seems obvious to many people who live with these temperatures. At a recent conference on air conditioning that I attended in London, an Indian delegate chided the crowd: “If I can work and function at 30C, you could too – believe you me.” Adding to the weight of evidence against the idea of the “ideal” temperature, Frederick Rohles, a psychologist and member of the American Society of Heating, Refrigerating and Air-Conditioning Engineers, has conducted studies showing that subjects who were shown a false thermometer displaying a high temperature felt warm, even if the room was cool. “These are the sorts of things that drive my engineering colleagues crazy,” he wrote in 2007. “Comfort is a state of mind!” Ashok Lall points out that once people are open to the idea that the temperature in a building can change, you can build houses that use air conditioning as a last resort, not a first step. “But there is no broad culture or regulation underpinning this,” he says. At the moment, it is the deterministic camp that has control of the levers of power – and their view continues to be reflected in building codes and standards around the world. How, then, can we get ourselves out of the air-conditioning trap? On the continuum of habits and technologies that we need to reduce or abandon if we are to avoid the worst effects of the climate crisis, the air conditioner probably falls somewhere in the middle: harder to reduce than our habit of eating meat five times a week; easier than eliminating the fossil-fuel automobile. According to Nick Mabey, a former senior civil servant who runs the UK-based climate politics consultancy E3G, air conditioning has – like many consumer products that are deeply embedded in society and, in aggregate, drive global warming – escaped the notice of most governments. There is little precedent for top-down regulation. “There is no department that handles this, there’s no guy you can just go talk to who controls air conditioning,” he says. The key, Mabey says, is to find the places it can be controlled, and begin the push there. He is supporting a UN programme that aims to improve the efficiency – and thus reduce the emissions – of all air conditioners sold worldwide. It falls under the unglamorous label of consumer standards. Currently, the average air conditioner on the market is about half as efficient as the best available unit. Closing that gap even a little bit would take a big chunk out of future emissions. At the local level, some progress is being made. The New York City council recently passed far-reaching legislation requiring all large buildings in the city to reduce their overall emissions by 40% by 2030, with a goal of 80% by 2050, backed with hefty fines for offenders. Costa Constantinides, the city council member spearheading the legislation, says it is “the largest carbon-emissions reduction ever mandated by any city, anywhere”. The Los Angeles mayor’s office is working on similar plans, to make all buildings net-zero carbon by 2050. Other cities are taking even more direct action. In the mid-1980s, Geneva, which has a warmer climate than much of the US, the local government banned the installation of air conditioning except by special permission. This approach is relatively common across Switzerland and, as a result, air conditioning accounts for less than 2% of all electricity used. The Swiss don’t appear to miss air conditioning too much – its absence is rarely discussed, and they have largely learned to do without. In countries where air conditioning is still relatively new, an immense opportunity exists to find alternatives before it becomes a way of life. The aim, in the words of Thomas, should be to avoid “the worst of the west”. Recently, the Indian government adopted recommendations by Thomas, Rawal and others into its countrywide national residential building code (“an immensely powerful document” says Rawal). It allows higher indoor temperatures based on Indian field studies – Indian levels of comfort – and notes the “growing prevalence” of buildings that use air conditioning as a technology of last resort. Cutting down on air conditioning doesn’t mean leaving modernity behind, but it does require facing up to some of its consequences. “It’s not a matter of going back to the past. But before, people knew how to work with the climate,” says Ken Yeang. “Air conditioning became a way to control it, and it was no longer a concern. No one saw the consequences. People see them now.” • This article was amended on 29 August 2019.
