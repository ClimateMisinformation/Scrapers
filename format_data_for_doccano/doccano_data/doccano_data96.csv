"A new paper published in the journal Nature Climate Change provides encouragement that people can be motivated to act on climate change. The title of the paper is, “Co-benefits of Addressing Climate Change can Motivate Action Around the World.” Lead author Dr. Paul Bain and his colleagues wanted to know if emphasizing co-benefits when talking about climate change would motivate people to take action. They found that in many cases, the answer is yes.   First of all, what are co-benefits? Pulitzer Prize-winning cartoonist Joel Pett provided some good examples in this cartoon. Let’s say that you design a city so that there are green spaces and parks in a hope that you will reduce pollution. You might find out that the green spaces and parks cool the city, provide places of recreation and exercise, and generally improve the quality of life beyond merely pollution. These would be called co-benefits; they are extra benefits you get from your action.  The authors of this new study surveyed more than 6,000 people in 24 different countries to find out whether emphasizing co-benefits would make people more likely to act on climate. They classified co-benefits into four categories: development, benevolence, dysfunction, and competence.  Economic development is an example of a potential development co-benefit. For instance, installing wind turbines would lower greenhouse gas emissions and create jobs (jobs are a co-benefit). Benevolence relates to the how caring and moral people are in society and competence relates to whether people are skilled and/or capable. Dysfunction deals with negative effects such as pollution and disease. For instance, decreased disease and airborne pollution are a co-benefits. The authors then asked how these co-benefits would influence peoples’ motivation to act on climate. People can act in a variety of ways, through citizenship (public action or voting for instance); they can act through personal choices (using energy more wisely, purchasing clean energy for example); or by donating to non-polluting causes and organizations.  When the authors reviewed the results of the surface, they found a consistent story. Motivations to act on climate change were clearly related to beliefs about co-benefits, especially for economic and scientific development (development co-benefit) and for building a more caring community (benevolence co-benefit). So, how can this information be used? The authors wrote,  Communicating climate science and co-benefits of action should be complementary, not competing, strategies ... Crucially, addressing co-benefits can motivate action independently of views about climate change importance, even for those unconvinced climate change is real.  When I communicated with Dr. Bain for further comment, he responded,  Our research shows that some co-benefits of addressing climate change can motivate public support and action around the world. Critically, the influence of these co-benefits did not depend on believing climate change is real or important or people’s political ideology, showing the potential of co-benefits in overcoming ideological hurdles that are currently holding back widespread action. This can help in targeting climate change policies and communication more effectively, so that climate change initiatives can not only address climate change but also achieve the broader social benefits people value."

"With India’s plan for curbing carbon emissions now in, most of the major developing economies have responded to the UN’s requests for the commitments on climate change that will form the keystone of an agreement to be signed in Paris this December. Those commitments – to make absolute cuts in future emissions levels, in the case of developed countries; to curb future emissions growth, in the case of less industrialised nations – will not add up to the cuts that scientists say are needed to avoid more than 2C of warming above pre-industrial levels. This is significant, because the 2C threshold is regarded as the limit of safety, beyond which the changes in the climate are likely to become catastrophic and irreversible.  On current commitments, warming is still likely to exceed 2C or even 3C , with potentially severe consequences in the form of an increase in extreme weather, heatwaves, droughts, floods and rising sea levels, that could wreak havoc across the globe. But this is not the end of the story. In Paris, governments are expected to sign up to a new global agreement on the climate that would come into effect from 2020, when current national commitments on emissions expire. But while world governments debate their role in avoiding dangerous warming, other commitments are also likely to be significant. For instance, cities are expected to play an increasing part in driving down carbon dioxide emissions, and many of these commitments are not included in the national government targets. Businesses, too, are coming forward with plans to reduce their emissions, which could have a major impact. Paris is also not an end point but the beginning of a new process by which emissions could be ratcheted down in future, in the form of five-yearly reviews of targets. Taken together, these factors could add up to enough to meet scientific advice in the coming decade. India’s announcement is an important step forward in climate diplomacy, too: the country was the only one to stand alongside China in 2011 in rejecting the UN roadmap that has led to the Paris talks.  Last year, China made a historic move by agreeing, at a meeting with US president Barack Obama, that it would cause its emissions to peak by 2030, the first time Beijing had set such a date. India’s pledge is less clear, with the centrepiece a commitment to derive 40% of its electricity from renewables and other low carbon sources. With its announcement, however, one of the last obstacles to a landmark agreement has now been cleared. All of the world’s biggest economies are now publicly in favour of a deal in Paris, after French president Francois Hollande earlier said that a miracle would be needed to get agreement among nearly 200 countries. With less than 60 days to go before the Paris conference, things could still fall apart. Just last month Hollande warned of the risk of failure. Finance will be key. Developed countries agreed at the last landmark climate conference, in Copenhagen in 2009, that at least $100bn in financial assistance would be provided to poor nations annually by 2020 to help them cut emissions and cope with the effects of global warming. Evidence that this will happen has still not been formally accepted, though countries including the UK have recently stepped up their pledges of assistance. There is also the vexed question of what should be the legal form of any Paris agreement, a subject likely to keep negotiators up late into the night at the conference, and some anxiety among the hosts over whether the text of a deal can be formulated in due time. Any agreement will have to satisfy the poorest nations of the world, which have less economic power than India and China. They are likely to be the worst equipped to cope with climate change, and plans on how they will be helped to adapt are still in the making. The UN is the only forum in which the least developed countries have an equal voice with the richest, and they will have their say at Paris."
"More companies are making climate change one of their top sustainability priorities, according to a survey released this week by nonprofit Business for Social Responsibility, which counts big brands like consumer goods giant Unilever and food and beverage maker Coca-Cola among its members.  The annual survey, which polled 440 sustainability workers from nearly 200 companies around the world, aims to provide a snapshot of what environmental and social issues are important to businesses over the coming year.  Two-thirds of respondents said climate change would be a focus over the next 12 months, more than a 5% jump from last year. Human rights and workers’ rights rounded out the top three sustainability priorities for companies.  “[Prioritizing] climate change has been on a steady decline since 2011, so it’s quite a noticeable increase this year,” said BSR vice president Laura Gitman. “There’s been a much greater focus on what risks and opportunities climate change poses to businesses.” It marks a difference from a PwC report back in January, in which climate change ranked so low on the risk of chief executives’ list of concerns that it didn’t even make the survey. The threat of climate change to the global economy has come to the fore in the past year, with various reports from governments and business leaders estimating the damage from natural disasters and rising sea levels to be in the hundreds of billions of dollars.  On Tuesday, Mike Carney, the governor of the UK’s Bank of England, warned that climate change carried potentially “huge” financial risks, stating that, “once climate change becomes a defining issue for financial stability, it may already be too late”. According to the BSR survey, companies are starting to heed the call to action and are making sustainability part of their core business. Almost seven in 10 companies said that sustainability was at least “fairly well-integrated” in areas like products and strategic planning, marking a change from previous years, according to Gitman.  “This year, quite a number of spontaneous responses talked about internal changes, [like] a number of leadership commitments that helped set a platform for sustainability, or the establishment of key goals and KPIs,” she said. “This was consistent across industries.”  On issues of climate change, more than 80% of respondents said reducing their carbon footprint in their operations was a priority, while almost half are looking to do the same in their supply chains. Companies in all markets, including North America, Europe and Asia, called for more regulations on climate change, while North American companies were more concerned about budget constraints to implement climate change measures than businesses in other countries. Companies are also looking to international policy agreements to guide their sustainability decisions. One third of respondents said they planned to use the recently adopted UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and the upcoming COP21 climate change conference to inform their sustainability efforts, specifically when setting targets like cutting carbon emissions or zero deforestation.  Some companies will focus on a particular goal, like gender equality or zero hunger, said Gitman, while others will look at all 17 goals and start to map which ones make the most sense to pursue for their business.  “Companies in general have struggled to demonstrate impact, but [the SDGs] will enable the corporate community to align towards a common way of talking about impact,” she said.  While it’s promising that businesses are showing a commitment to “real change” and prioritizing issues like climate change and human rights abuses, more work needs to be done, Gitman added.  “We still have all of the same issues that have come up every year since 2010,” she said. “We need to really scale up solutions and collaborations to address these issues so that they drop in importance.” "
"It won’t show up in any biodiversity assessment, or make it into a State Of The World report. But alongside tuna stocks, tropical rainforests, and the white rhino, there is another finite resource being ruthlessly squandered through unsustainable practices. Trust – the invisible but crucial glue that holds communities together and social contracts in place – is a precious commodity. And every time a corporation poisons our atmosphere (with this year’s villainous cameo coming courtesy of the car manufacturer Volkswagen), they are doing something else that is just as destructive: poisoning the well of public opinion.  With important UN negotiations in Paris looming at the end of 2015, the focus of campaigners and politicians has turned to the steps necessary to secure a political agreement on climate change. But at root, the challenge posed abruptly and joltingly by climate change is about negotiation of a different kind: how we should live, work, play and prosper in a carbon-constrained world. And negotiating this new path is fundamentally about trust. In an insightful paper published last year, Chloe Lucas and her colleagues at the University of Tasmania argued that climate change is difficult for people to fully accept and engage with because it threatens so many social processes and institutions that we implicitly trust. Taking climate change seriously means re-evaluating almost every aspect of modern life, and as Lucas puts it: …(I)t is not surprising that, when asked to question our trust in global markets and consumer-led development, many of us react by distrusting messengers of the need for urgent climate action. Denial of discomforting messages is one of the psychological defence mechanisms we use to protect ourselves from anxiety, uncertainty and fear. Set against this backdrop, Volkswagen’s dodgy emissions tests take on new meaning. Not only do they chip away at the public’s trust in businesses to act in good faith (and in accordance with the law), they also play into a wider sceptical narrative: the climate scientists are cooking the books to get grant funding, the campaigners are exaggerating the risks to rake in supporter income, and the private sector is using greenwash to keep the profits rolling in.  For businesses operating transparently, the Volkswagen revelations are a major headache. Climate and sustainability initiatives from the corporate world are already treated with suspicion by many (and often with good reason). Scandals like this simply reinforce cynicism about the ability of the private sector to act in good faith, but also speak to wider issues faced by climate change campaigners. It is now well-understood that climate change has something of an image problem: most people do not readily identify with typical environmentalists, and so there has been growing interest in identifying individuals and institutions who can reach beyond the usual suspects, and tell a more compelling story on climate change. The pope’s recent encyclical on climate change was noteworthy not only because he is a high-profile and influential figure, but also because it opens the door for conversations about climate change that are framed around a different set of values (ie those of the Catholic faith). For many Catholics across the world, Pope Francis is a much more trusted figure than any environmental campaigner could ever be. Corporate brands may not inspire such devotional loyalty as the pope, but they are revered and influential nonetheless. Companies like Apple and Google promote their own plans for decarbonisation, but there is a more important role to play in shaping the wider conversation about sustainability. They are respected voices to their followers in the same way that Catholics pay attention to the pope. But when businesses abuse this respect (as Volkswagen so brazenly did) their potential for credible climate advocacy is diminished – and that is a problem for everyone. The executive secretary of the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), Christiana Figueres, has repeatedly emphasised the importance for a chorus of voices on climate change – leaders who speak to different audiences, with different sets of values. And research has shown that these “elite cues” (what people in positions of power do or don’t say about climate change) matter.  Trusted voices on climate change and sustainability are in short supply. It is much easier to pour scorn on the claims of environmentalists than to engage with the implications for the way we live. And if corporations are fiddling the figures on their sustainability claims, why should individuals bother to take the issue seriously either? The bottom line is that undermining the trust in the institutions and organisations who have to deliver sustainability targets is bad news for everyone – and that’s the real scandal of the Volkswagen emissions tests."
"Bill Shorten says his goal to source 50% of Australia’s power from renewables by 2030 is a “declaration of intent”, to be achieved by Labor’s yet-to-be-detailed policies including an emissions trading scheme, as well as increased consumer demand for clean energy.  The Labor leader says the change in prime ministership meant Australia could now have a “referendum” as to which party had the best policies to shift to a low pollution economy. In a speech apparently aimed at increasing pressure on Malcolm Turnbull to specify any changes he will make to the Coalition’s climate policy, Shorten does not announce any new policy detail of his own, saying his 50% goal was “not a matter of locking in specific technology or mechanisms.” “Like you, I welcome the fact that the Liberal leadership no longer see wind turbines as a horrifying blight on the landscape, a creeping menace lurking on the horizon,” Shorten planned to tell the All Energy Council in Melbourne on Wednesday, according to a copy of his speech provided to the media. “The muzzling of the far-right’s ideological attack dogs in the clean energy debate is long overdue. And it’s a gesture I’m prepared to accept in good faith. “I’m hopeful our parliament, our politics, can move past the basic binary argument of whether renewable energy is ‘good’ or ‘bad’… the test is no longer a matter of competing rhetoric. Instead it becomes a policy contest, a battle of ideas.” Turnbull has announced no significant changes to the coalition’s policy although he did not reappoint climate change sceptic Maurice Newman to the prime minister’s advisory council and he has taken a different approach to the Clean Energy Finance Corporation and the Australian Renewable Energy Agency. He has said he will stick with the current Direct Action policy, but he could make changes to it. Early last year Shorten announced Labor would go to the election promising an emissions trading scheme but has not given details. Labor is also likely to announce a longer term mandatory renewable energy target for large scale renewable projects. Shorten said Australia had fallen behind in renewable energy investment under the coalition government, citing figures showing that last year clean energy investment grew by 8% in the United States, 12% in Japan and 35% in China, but fell by 35% in Australia. He said investment in large scale renewables fell by 88% here. Citing figures that predicted already falling costs of renewables and battery storage would halve again in the next five years, Shorten predicts “consumers not governments” would drive the energy change. He said Labor’s policy would ensure “affected workers” were “redeployed, retrained and supported through the transition."

"When and how should we start to talk to children about climate change? The Unicorn and Filskit theatre company’s Breaking the Ice, for two-to-five-year-olds, gently presents the issue through the tale of a friendship between a husky and a polar bear – though only the oldest children would pick up its environmental message. The Little Angel’s The Journey Home, adapted from Frann Preston-Gannon’s book and directed by Steve Tiplady, explores the subject for a much broader age range (four to 11). The challenge is to ensure a show that’s entertaining no matter how earnest its message, and that stimulates kids at both ends of that range.   When I arrive at the theatre with Aggie (five and a half), the audience is noticeably sparser than at past Saturday morning performances. In a crowded marketplace of colourful, riotous shows this might be a tricky sell. We haven’t read the book it’s based on, so when Aggie asks what the show is about, I tell her it’s the tale of a polar bear who loses his home. She looks sad. “Are we definitely having an ice-cream?”  Wisely, it all starts with some pratfalls, as our polar-bear hero slips and slides around on three giant ice cubes at the centre of the stage. Like Breaking the Ice, the show finds a simple way of conjuring the Aurora Borealis of the Arctic and quickly establishes the strange sadness of the landscape. Aggie likes the torchlit puppets, including a shimmering fish, and the birds that fly into the audience. And the haunting folk songs and music by Arran Glass, who is also on puppeteering duties with Rachel Leonard, bring a sense of calm to the audience.  But this largely wordless 40-minute show requires children to really pay attention to those lyrics. It’s only when we later go to the library and read the book – in which the animals have clear, explanatory dialogue – that Aggie understands the ins and outs of the story.  When his home begins to melt, the polar bear heads off on a journey in a boat, gradually joined by a panda and an orangutan whose lollypop-stick homes are being chopped down. To depict this destruction, Glass plays a devil-may-care logger, sporting a hard hat and blowing a kazoo whose buzz resembles a chainsaw. It breaks with the show’s predominantly solemn tone and the kids roar with laughter. The last one into the boat is an elephant, and a subtle series of silhouettes are used to explain the threat of poaching to the species. Older children might read the significance of the crosshair viewpoint in this sequence but Aggie doesn’t register it. When we talk about the show afterwards she doesn’t understand what the elephant is doing in the boat. Anyway, isn’t there at least a little fun to be had with the notion of these eclectic animals sharing a boat, and the nature of their journey itself?  It’s no surprise that this Little Angel production has beautiful puppets. Designed by Sally Todd and made by Michael Fowkes, they look strikingly delicate up close and really do reflect the collage-like illustrations in Preston-Gannon’s book. But the animals never really emerge as individual characters. We don’t care enough about them.  This means the warning struck at the end of the show doesn’t quite chill as it should. The animals are told: “You can go home when the trees grow back and when the ice returns and when the cities stop getting bigger and when the hunting stops.”  The applause dies down and the lights go up. Aggie sighs. “Can we have an ice-cream now?”"

"From backroom deals between European leaders to the burying of the bad news of 23,000 premature UK deaths on the day Jeremy Corbyn was elected Labour leader, the scandal that has engulfed the diesel car is a startling tale. It is a story of good intentions being relentlessly undermined and has a nasty twist in the tail: even the real rationale for Europe’s drive for diesel – to curb global warming – has run into the wall.  The story begins in the early 1990s, when the diesel car was the noisier, clunkier and largely unloved cousin of the petrol car. But with climate change a growing concern, diesel’s lower carbon dioxide emissions caught the attention of politicians looking for easy ways to cut carbon. Sales of diesels in Europe crept up from 15% of new cars in 1990 to 25% by 1995, as politicians cut the taxes levied on diesels.  But the slow-burn rise of diesels accelerated into a boom after 1998, thanks to the arrival of a new quieter and more powerful engine – called the common rail – and a landmark agreement between Europe’s leaders and its car industry to drive down CO2. By 2008, half of all new cars taking to Europe’s roads were diesel powered. It was known right from the start that diesel engines produced more lung-clogging soot and irritating nitrogen oxides. But it was believed that problem could be neutralised.  “The policy priority was climate change, [but] it was thought that air pollution regulations on vehicles would work,” said Martin Williams, who headed the UK government’s Air Quality Unit for 20 years and is now at King’s College London. “People said ‘sure, diesels emit more particulates and nitrogen oxides (NOx) but we have really stringent regulations”. Twenty years on, we have found out we were wrong.” “Everyone expected the new standards to deliver improvements in air quality,” said Greg Archer, at campaign group Transport & Environment. “But the motor manufacturers found ways to circumvent the tests.” The tiny particles of pollution pumped out of diesel exhausts have long been known to be very harmful to health, working their way deep into lungs and leading to heart attacks, strokes and cancers. Filters that became mandatory in exhausts in 2010 have heavily reduced that problem, although some unscrupulous garages still offer to remove them and give the car’s performance a tiny boost. But, lurking in amongst the soot, were NOx. “People knew NOx were harmful. There were reports going back to the 1990s that NOx were associated with asthma, but it wasn’t as clear as the health hazards of particulates,” says Archer. “What is clear today is that NOx has at least as harmful an effect as particulates.” A key step forward in the understanding of the health effects of NOx came with a WHO report in 2013, which indicated for the first time that the chemicals were dangerous by themselves and were not simply an irritating accompaniment. This mattered because, out in the real world, NOx emissions were stubbornly failing to obey the commands of the politicians’ regulations and fall. In 2010, Williams and his team showed why, by standing by the side of British roads and watching 84,239 vehicles putter by. As each passed, beams of infrared and ultraviolet light took a snapshot its exhaust fumes, while a camera recorded the registration plate, which could be used to look up the make and model.  When the numbers were crunched, the conclusion was stark: there was a chasm between the levels of NOx that the vehicles were actually emitting and what they should have been emitting according to the regulatory tests they had passed. This chasm was exposed most luridly this month, when VW was caught in the US using “cheat devices” to cut emissions drastically when the car’s computer detected it was being tested. But the discrepancy between real-world driving and regulatory test results – if not outright illegal cheating – had been known for years, and it was getting worse. In 2000, diesel cars on the road pumped out double the NOx they did under test conditions, according to the ICCT, the group who rumbled VW’s cheating in the US. In 2005, the test limit was halved, but road performance of the diesel cars was three times worse.  The NOx limit shrank again in 2009 and in 2014, but now the cars were over seven times worse on the road than in test labs as motor manufacturers refined their techniques for gaming the tests. Few people believe VW are the only company doing so, legally or otherwise. “VW appear to have been caught red-handed, but it would seem highly likely that others have also played dubious games to pass emissions tests,” said Professor Alastair Lewis, an air pollution expert at the University of York. This gaming explained why NOx air pollution would not fall: the regulations were in place but were as useful as a smoke alarm with a dead battery. In 1999, a European Union directive set strict air pollution limits for NO2 (the toxic gas formed from NOx emissions) and gave member states just over a decade to get ready. The UK, like others, assumed the ever-stricter emissions regulations on diesel cars would strangle the NO2 problem.  The choking truth was revealed in 2010, when London used up its annual allowance for NO2 in the first three weeks of monitoring. “The breaches were colossal,” said Alan Andrews at environmental lawyers, Client Earth. They quickly started pursuing the government through the courts to force them to deal with the illegally high air pollution. A long battle ensued but in April, Client Earth won: ministers would have to present a plan to tackle the problem. This plan was sneaked out by the Department of Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) on the morning of 12 September, the Saturday when the entire nation’s media was transfixed by Jeremy Corbyn’s election as leader of the Labour Party. “That tells you everything you need to know about the government’s attitude to this issue,” said Andrews. “They were embarrassed at how little they had to offer.” The Defra document put out that Saturday stated the problem starkly: “The failure of the Euro standards to deliver the expected emission reductions under real world driving conditions means that road transport is by far the largest contributor to NO2 pollution.” But it also contained a bombshell. For the first time anywhere in the world, UK officials had used the WHO data to calculate the toll of premature deaths caused by NO2: the figure was 23,500 every year, on top of the 29,000 still dying from particulate pollution. “The combined impact of these two pollutants represents a significant public health challenge,” said the officials, with some understatement. With the NOx tests long known to be useless in the real world and the toll of the pollution slowly being realised, the question was why did politicians ignore it for so long? Simple lobbying, says Andrews: “It’s driven by big business, industry, farming. They are worried about the costs to them, but they completely ignore the costs to society. The UK government itself estimates that air pollution costs the country £12-18bn a year.” Glimpses of the high-stakes deals done over emissions regulations – whether NOx or CO2 – are occasionally seen. In 2013, Germany was reported to have gone “rogue” in attempts to sideline greener car regulations that would impact its huge car industry, threatening Ireland over its Euro bail-out, Hungary with car plant closures and the Netherlands with cuts in plant investment. A month earlier, Germany had offered to derail an EU cap on bankers’ bonuses, which the UK opposed, in return for UK support in sidelining the stricter car regulations. Those regulations were duly kicked into the long grass and the lobbying has not stopped. Germany, France and the UK have all lobbied recently against reforms to flawed emissions tests. “If ‘dieselgate’ has taught us one thing, it is that you need regulations that are robust, transparent, enforceable and not designed by industry for industry,” says Andrews. A new emission test that actually reflects real-world driving has been proposed by the European Commission.  Williams says: “That needs to happen fast. The EC wants 2017, though some would say that is too late. But the industry is on record as saying nothing can possibly be done before 2020.” The final bitter note in the smoggy tale of diesel’s rise is that it did not even achieve its overarching goal. The emissions of carbon dioxide from diesels are indeed lower than those of petrol cars, but other efficiency improvements to cars in the last decade, such as lighter bodies, have been 10 times more effective.  And the sooty particles diesels pumped out in great volumes turned out to be excellent at absorbing sunlight and warming up the atmosphere. The scientists Michel Cames and Eckard Helmers sum it up simply in their analysis: “The European diesel car boom did not cool down the atmosphere.”"
"Two dozen people have already died from hunger and drinking contaminated water in drought-stricken Papua New Guinea, but the looming El Niño crisis could leave more than four million people across the Pacific without enough food or clean water. The El Niño weather pattern – when waters in the eastern tropical Pacific ocean become warmer, driving extreme weather conditions – may be as severe as in 1997-98, when an estimated 23,000 people died, forecasters believe.  In Papua New Guinea’s Chimbu province in the highlands region, a prolonged drought has been exacerbated by sudden and severe frosts which have killed off almost all crops. The provincial disaster centre has confirmed 24 people have died from starvation and drinking contaminated water. Provincial disaster co-ordinator Michael Ire Appa told RadioNZ he feared the death toll could even be higher. “The drought has been here for almost three months now and in areas that were affected by the drought there’s a serious food shortage, including water, and some of the districts have not reported, so there may be more [deaths] than that,” he said. Two highlands provinces have already declared a state of emergency. Oxfam Australia’s climate change policy advisor Dr Simon Bradshaw said many parts of PNG would run out of food in two or three months, but in some areas there was as little as a month’s food left, and few ways to get more in.  “In the highland areas people are almost exclusively reliant on subsistence farming, farming of sweet potatoes. We do know that water is becoming very scarce, that’s of course impacting food production, and PNG is almost entirely dependent on its own food – I think 83% of its food is produced in-country – so any hit on food production poses immediate challenges in terms of food security.” Over the coming months, the El Niño pattern will bring more rain, flooding and higher sea levels to countries near the equator, raising the risk of inundation for low-lying atolls already feeling the impacts of climate change. At the same time, the countries of the Pacific south-west – which have larger populations – will be significantly drier and hotter. El Niño years typically have a longer, more destructive cyclone season. “El Niño has the potential to trigger a regional humanitarian emergency and we estimate as many as 4.1 million people are at risk from water shortages, food insecurity and disease across the Pacific,” Sune Gudnitz, head of the Pacific region office of the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs said. “Countries including Papua New Guinea, Fiji, Tonga and the Solomon Islands are already feeling El Niño’s impact with reduced rainfall affecting crops and drinking-water supplies. Drought conditions would further complicate the humanitarian situation in countries that are just emerging from the devastation caused by tropical cyclones Pam, Maysak and Raquel.” Many countries across the region are entering the El Niño period in a vulnerable state. Drought has been officially declared in 34 provinces in Indonesia, while in Vanuatu – still recovering from the devastation of cyclone Pam, which struck in March – authorities are warning reduced rainfall will damage food security, health and livelihoods. In some parts of Fiji, water is already being trucked into villages that have run out. And Tonga, which has suffered a drought for nearly a year, has been forced to ship water supplies to the country’s outer islands. Countries where food insecurity affects large proportions of the population were of special concern, Bradshaw said.  “With an El Niño event, you usually get about one-fifth less rainfall across the country as well as significant changes to the timing of the rainy season, a lot more rain concentrated in January, and that, combined with deforestation, increases the risk of landslides, flash floods, damage to infrastructure and destruction of crops. Timor Leste is somewhere we’re watching particularly closely because of the existing challenges, and the effect the El Niño will have on top of that.” Bradshaw said the impact of the El Niño would compound the difficulties faced by Pacific countries struggling to cope with the effects of climate change. He said recent research suggested El Niño patterns – usually seen every three to seven years – could now occur twice as frequently, and that “normal” conditions might become more similar to those of El Niño. “We’ve had two unusually hot years, and now we’ve got a very strong El Niño event, so I think it would be fair to say, unfortunately, that we’re in uncharted waters. What we’ve seen is somewhat unprecedented and climate change is increasingly going to put us in that position.”  The countries most affected by the combined effects of climate change and El Niño are – for reasons of geography, economy, governance and remoteness – often the least equipped to deal with their impacts. “We’ve seen an unprecedented run of extreme and erratic weather, which has had very real impacts,” Bradshaw said. “Of course, those impacts are felt first and hardest by the world’s poorest communities, but these countries are also the least responsible for climate change. They’ve contributed negligibly to global greenhouse emissions. “I think it drives home the fact that climate change affects us all; it affects poorer countries first and hardest, but we have a responsibility as a wealthy, developed nation to be both doing far more to reduce our own emissions, but also to be providing greater support with adaptation and resilience-building to poorer countries.” Bradshaw said the effects of the El Niño, combined with climate change, should drive all countries towards a strong agreement at climate change talks in Paris in December."

"As the world warms, it leads to very obvious results such as a reduction in snowpack in various parts of the world. While this seems intuitive, there are some caveats. A warmer world is also a wetter world because there is more moisture in the air. Therefore, there is a potential for more snow.  So which effect will win out? Will snow melt because of warming, or will snow grow because of more moisture? Often it depends on where you are in the world. But, regardless, changes to snowpack can have big consequences on water availability.  A new study just out in Nature Climate Change look at the long term changes to snowpack in the Sierra Nevada mountains. This region is very important because these mountains act as a water storage system for California, where rain doesn’t fall during much of the year.  The authors estimated the Snow Water Equivalent, which is a measure of the amount of water stored as snow. While they noted that this spring, it was only 5% of its historical average, what they really wanted to know is, how often does it get this low? They noted other low-snow years such as 1934 and 1977. Was this episode like those? Is it just a natural fluctuation?  The authors found that this current episode was unsurpassed in the record and exceeded the 95% confidence interval for a 500 year period. The authors combined instrumental measurements (back to about 1930) with measurements from tree growth records. The tree records allowed them to obtain information back to 1500. The current drought exceeded their entire 500-year record. The record decrease in snowpack coincided with very warm temperatures in California, which have been shown to be a primary cause of the current drought. I contacted the lead author (Soumaya Belmecheri), who told me,  The snowpack in the Sierra Nevada mountains plays a critical role in water resource management. It serves as a natural water storage system. In our study, we put the 2015 snowpack low in a longer-term context and demonstrate that it was unprecedented over the last 500 years. We estimated the return interval for the 2015 record low and found it be beyond 1000 years (95% interval) at low elevations in the Sierra Nevada, where temperature plays an important role in the snowpack variability. She confirmed my comments about the importance of temperatures as well as snowfall amounts, saying, With ongoing human-caused warming, this kind of hot drought is likely to occur and the return interval (frequency) of the snowpack low in 2015 might become shorter. We are all anxiously awaiting this El Niño to bring rainfall relief to the Western USA. With hope, much of it will fall as snow so that it can melt throughout the year and provide a more consistent water source. If it falls as rain and in large events, the risk of mudslides and flooding will rise and the continuous availability of water will not occur. We are keeping our fingers crossed."
"The Turnbull government has promised a full review of the so-called “safeguards” mechanism in its climate policy within a year of it starting, amid doubts that it can achieve the greenhouse emission reductions the Coalition is banking on. On Thursday the environment minister, Greg Hunt, quietly gazetted the long-awaited final detail of the mechanism, which is designed to ensure increasing industrial emissions do not undo the greenhouse gas abatement that the government buys through its $2.55bn emissions reduction fund.  The mechanism begins on 1 July next year, but after discussions with independent senator Nick Xenophon, the government has said it will start a promised review on 30 June 2017, and complete it within five months. It has specified that the review will consider whether the “baselines” or benchmarks set for emissions from the 140-odd businesses covered by the scheme should be tightened to make sure Australia’s policies can meet the promised 2030 emissions reduction target. It will also look at the rules that allow businesses exceeding their baseline to buy pollution “credits” from other firms – which could set up a form of emissions trading scheme. Those rules are already part of the mechanism, but the baselines have been set to ensure no business is ever likely to exceed them and find itself in a position where it needs to buy credits. It appears the government intends to adjust the mechanism in the 2017 review, after the next federal election. In a recent interview with Guardian Australia, Hunt revealed the 2030 emissions reduction target Australia will take to the Paris talks in December – a cut of between 26% and 28% of 2005 levels – is based on an assumption that the safeguards mechanism will deliver 200m tonnes of emission reductions between 2020 and 2030, or almost a quarter of the total cuts required. Experts have been clear that a 200m tonne cut to Australia’s emissions could not be achieved without much tougher safeguard rules than those in the government’s draft, which have not been substantially changed in the final gazetted version. “There is still a yawning gulf between what this policy will deliver and what Australia has promised. The government can’t bluff their way through that. This policy will have to be toughened,” said the chief executive of the Climate Institute, John Connor. “The draft rules we have seen would not deliver that,” said Bret Harper, head of research at Reputex. “Most new plants, we should assume, would be built using best practice in any event, so they aren’t likely to deliver much abatement. To get that result would require much tighter baselines.” Elisa de Wit, who heads the climate law practice at law firm Norton Rose Fulbright, said: “The only way to get substantial cuts like that would be to change the baselines so they reduce over time. “We assume this will happen after the review in 2017-18. But the safeguards, as they are currently designed, won’t drive any significant emission reductions.” The chief executive of the Australian Industry Group, Innes Willox, said: “To date the safeguard has been designed to catch ‘rogue emitters’, not as a constraint on ordinary business activities. The draft rules certainly reflect that. “If the government wishes to evolve the safeguard over time into a major driver of abatement, that will be complex and need deep consultation, particularly on dealing with trade competitiveness issues and avoiding excessive administration and compliance costs.” Analysts such as Reputex say the very lenient baselines proposed could even allow big emitters such as brown coal-fired power stations to significantly increase emissions. And major business groups have complained they cannot see how the government can meet the new target, and have been privately assuming that the government must be intending to use a 2017 review to toughen the rules. The mechanism gazetted on Thursday makes clear the government’s intention that no business should find itself exceeding the new limits. “The safeguard mechanism will send a signal to businesses to avoid significant increases in emissions beyond business-as-usual levels. It will do so in a light-touch way that supports economic growth and allows businesses to continue normal operations,” the explanatory memorandum says. Baselines for existing facilities “will reflect the highest level of reported emissions over the historical period from 2009-10 to 2013-14, and will be adjusted to accommodate economic growth, natural resource variability and other circumstances where historical baselines are not representative of future emissions performance”. “To support economic growth, baselines will be permanently increased if a facility undertakes a significant expansion” and “to accommodate incremental growth, baselines will be temporarily increased in any year where expanding production is accompanied by an emissions intensity improvement”. “Baselines can be adjusted to accommodate emissions variability associated with the extraction of a natural resource or reserve. To accommodate other circumstances where historical emissions are not representative of future business-as-usual emissions performance, baselines can be adjusted if facilities expect to exceed their baseline in the safeguard mechanisms first year.” Hunt has declined to indicate whether the baselines would have to be tightened after the 2017 review. “I would not want to bind the hand of future governments,” he said. The government is also setting “best practice” baselines for new businesses and a sector-wide baseline for electricity generators, and has pledged to complete the first of them by the end of the year. The 2017 review will also look at the treatment of the electricity sector. Xenophon had initially criticised the safeguards mechanism for being “toothless”, saying it had been “neutered” and vowing to try to disallow the new rules unless the government made significant changes. “Direct Action has no point if it does not have an effective safeguards mechanism ... There is no point in the government spending $2.55bn if there is no requirement to cap or reduce emissions from industry,” he said then."
"Plans submitted by 140 nations to limit their greenhouse gases would go some way towards tackling climate change, but not enough to prevent the planet from warming by well over 2C compared to pre-industrial times, experts say.  The plans by countries from Albania to Zimbabwe, led by top emitters China and the United States, were submitted by an informal United Nations deadline on Thursday as building blocks towards a climate accord that negotiators will try to clinch at a summit in Paris in December.   A Climate Action Tracker (CAT) by four European research groups projected the plans, if implemented, would limit average temperature rises to 2.7C above pre-industrial times by 2100, down from 3.1C estimated last December.  That is still clearly above the 2C level that governments have accepted as the threshold beyond which the Earth would face dangerous changes including more droughts, extinctions, floods and rising seas, which could swamp coastal regions and entire island nations.  “We’re below three degrees for the first time,” Bill Hare of Climate Analytics, which is part of CAT, told Reuters. “We’re obviously far from where we need to be, but this is a signal that the process can work.“  He said the main contributor was Beijing’s plan, issued in June, to get emissions from burning coal, oil and natural gas to peak by around 2030.  A top priority for the Paris talks, six years after the failure of a previous summit in Copenhagen, will be to find ways to toughen the plans in order to meet the 2C target.  “What the negotiations are looking to do is build not just that first step but the entire staircase,” said Taryn Fransen, of the World Resources Institute think-tank.  Experts said the wide participation was welcome. “It takes away one of the possible stumbling blocks for Paris,” said Frank Melum, a senior analyst at Thomson Reuters Point Carbon.  He said every emitter accounting for more than one percent of global emissions met the 1 October deadline except India, Iran and Saudi Arabia, which is fearful of a shift from fossil fuels.  Together the plans cover almost 80% of global greenhouse gas emissions. The UN climate changesecretariat says it will add up them all up in coming weeks to estimate their effect in slowing climate change. It has privately told countries that they have a few days’ leeway.  India, the biggest emitter yet to submit, plans to outline its plan for action on Friday to coincide with the birthday of independence leader Mahatma Gandhi.  Earlier this week, Climate Interactive, a not-for-profit group in Washington, using different assumptions from CAT, projected the national plans would curb temperature rises to 3.5C, compared with 4.5C if no action was taken.  Expected warming in 2100 from national contributions to Paris climate talks is 3.5°C (6.3°F) https://t.co/pTSY0FdSa0 pic.twitter.com/lZDnJwgLpi"
"Australia is calculating that its big industrial emitters will be forced to reduce greenhouse pollution by 200m tonnes between 2020 and 2030, an assumption experts say will require major changes to the Direct Action policy which is not designed to force cuts from existing plants. The environment minister, Greg Hunt, has revealed the 2030 emissions reduction target Australia will take to Paris in December – a cut of between 26% and 28% of 2005 levels – is based on an assumption that the so-called “safeguards” mechanism will deliver 200m tonnes of emission reductions between 2020 and 2030, or almost a quarter of the total cuts required.   The confirmation that Australia’s long-term target will require cuts to industrial emissions stands in contrast to the current stated objective of the “safeguards” mechanism, which is to impose caps that stop “rogue” companies from dramatically increasing emissions, but not to force them down.  Analysts like Reputex say the very lenient baselines proposed will allow big emitters such as brown coal-fired power stations to significantly increase emissions. Major business groups have complained they cannot see how the government can meet the new target, and have been privately assuming that the government must be intending to use a 2017 review to toughen the rules. Given that the policy also allows businesses who exceed their baselines to buy permits from businesses who come in under their limits, this would also potentially set up a version of an emissions trading scheme. But Hunt refused to say whether achieving 200m tonnes of greenhouse gas cuts from the companies covered by the safeguards scheme would require tougher rules than those he has on the table for existing plants. He said the government would “allow for adjustment of the best practice rules [which say new plants must use best available technology] and technological change” but “any other changes would be a matter for future governments”. “I would not want to bind the hand of future governments,” he said. Asked whether tougher baselines could usher in a type of emissions trading scheme, he said: “We are not mandating an ETS. I do not see any circumstances in which this government would create an ETS.” Under the safeguard rules, companies which exceed their baseline can pay a penalty or buy carbon offsets from other companies. Hunt said that “what private companies do is entirely a matter for them within the law. By definition they own their own units and they can acquire them and dispose of them as they see fit.” Experts are clear that a 200m tonne cut could be achieved only with much tougher safeguard rules. “The draft rules we have seen would not deliver that,” said Bret Harper, head of research at Reputex. “Most new plants, we should assume, would be built using best practice in any event, so they aren’t likely to deliver much abatement. To get that result would require much tighter baselines.” Elisa de Wit, who heads the climate law practice at law firm Norton Rose Fulbright, said, “The only way to get substantial cuts like that would be to change the baselines so they reduce over time. “We assume this will happen after the review in 2017-18.

But Hunt said Xenophon was proposing “only minor changes”. “I am engaged in discussions with Nick and his office and there may be minor technical changes,” Hunt said. “No major changes have been proposed although I am not presuming to know Nick’s final position.” In a wide-ranging interview Hunt also said:"

"While most attention has been given to carbon dioxide, it isn’t the only greenhouse gas that scientists are worried about. Carbon dioxide is the most important human-emitted greenhouse gas, but methane has also increased in the atmosphere and it adds to our concerns.  While methane is not currently as important as carbon dioxide, it has a hidden danger. Molecule for molecule, methane traps more heat than carbon dioxide; approximately 30 times more, depending on the time frame under consideration. However, because methane is present in much smaller concentrations (compared to carbon dioxide), its aggregate effect is less.  But what has scientists focusing on methane is the way it is released into the atmosphere. Unlike carbon dioxide, which is emitted primarily through burning of fossil fuels, methane has a large natural emission component. This natural emission is from warming permafrost in the northern latitudes. Permafrost is permanently frozen ground. Much of the permafrost is undisturbed by bacterial decomposition.  As the Earth warms, and the Arctic warms especially fast, the permafrost melts and soil decomposition accelerates. Consequently, an initial warming leads to more emission, leading to more warming and more emission. It is a vicious cycle and there may be a tipping point where this self-reinforcing cycle takes over. Recently, a policy briefing from the world-leading Woods Hole Research Center has moved our understanding of this risk further through a clearly-written summary. The briefing cites two recent papers (here and here) that study the so-called permafrost carbon feedback.  One of these studies makes use of projections from the most recent IPCC report to estimate that up to 205 gigatons equivalent of carbon dioxide could be released due to melting permafrost. This would cause up to 0.5°C (up to 0.9°F) extra warming. Just as bad, the permafrost melting would continue after 2100 which would lock us into even more warming. Under this scenario, meeting a 2°C limit would be harder than anticipated. The current IPCC targets do not adequately account for this feedback. To put this in perspective, permafrost contains almost twice as much carbon as is present in the atmosphere. In the rapidly warming Arctic (warming twice as fast as the globe as a whole), the upper layers of this frozen soil begin to thaw, allowing deposited organic material to decompose. The plant material, which has accumulated over thousands of years, is concentrated in to upper layers (half of it is in the top 10 feet). There is a network of monitoring stations that are measuring ground temperatures have detected a significant heating trend over the past few decades and so has the active layer thickness. I communicated with Woods Hole expert Robert Max Holmes, who told me,  It’s essential that policymakers begin to seriously consider the possibility of a substantial permafrost carbon feedback to global warming. If they don’t, I suspect that down the road we’ll all be looking at the 2°C threshold in our rear-view mirror.  So, this means that reducing carbon dioxide pollution is even more important. If we are to stop the warming–thawing–more warming cycle, it is critical to reduce emissions now. According to these experts, this is a serious issue, and we should listen to them."

"More than three-quarters of England’s universities are set to miss carbon reduction targets for 2020, according to the latest analysis. Despite the introduction of initiatives to reduce carbon emissions and invest in sustainable energy, higher education institutions claim that an era of expansion has hampered plans to make the sector more environmentally friendly.   Sustainability consultancy Brite Green analysed the emissions of 127 universities in England and found that the majority (76%) are due to miss the target of 43% reduction across the sector by 2020, as set by the Higher Education Funding Council for England (Hefce) in 2010. Brite Green’s analysis shows that the overall reduction is likely to be closer to just 12% by that date. Some 35 universities were found to have increased their carbon emissions since 2005, including King’s College London, the University of Cambridge and Queen Mary University of London. The largest increase, of 66%, was found at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine.  Meanwhile, London Metropolitan University was found to have made the most progress in reducing its carbon output, by 54%, followed by the University of Cumbria (48%) and Soas, University of London (47%). Researchers used public data from Hefce and the Higher Education Statistics Agency, and held consultations with universities, offering them the opportunity to provide more information on emissions if they wished. Yvonne Hawkins, Hefce’s director of universities and colleges, defended the sector, claiming that the targets did not take account of “significant recent growth in university estates and student numbers”. She said that Hefce was working with universities to “review progress and identify barriers and opportunities” and added that the organisation had provided £90 million in grants for carbon reduction projects since 2008.  But student-led campaign group People and Planet, which also produces an annual university league on ethical and environmental performance, took a more critical stance.  Andrew Taylor, the organisation’s climate change campaigns and communications manager, said: “We are dismayed to see further evidence that, after years of student campaigning, some universities continue to de-prioritise sustainability.”  He added that government funding relating to carbon reduction had been “gutted” and noted that Hefce’s annual grant letter to universities no longer made any reference to sustainability. Darren Chadwick, Brite Green’s managing partner, said the problem was exacerbated by a “disconnect” between universities’ carbon management plans and commercial strategies. He explained: “Despite the significant efforts of energy and estates managers, strong growth in the sector has meant that many universities have fallen well behind their targets. It’s clear that carbon strategies need to be updated.” However, he highlighted the progress that many universities had made. Although the majority were not on course to meet emissions targets, most had implemented programmes that had improved energy efficiency, he said. A spokesperson for King’s College London says:We are committed to stretching carbon reduction targets. We have established a £1m revolving green fund where project savings are reinvested in carbon-reduction initiatives. For example, King’s is currently undertaking a fridge replacement project in halls of residence that will save 402 tonnes of carbon dioxide per annum. But planned growth in student recruitment and the increasingly energy-intensive equipment that is required to undertake science, technology, engineering and mathematical research mean that there are compound challenges in achieving these targets. Pearl Costello, environment officer at the Royal Agricultural University says:It is really important for us, as an agricultural university, to be an example to our students. We have the challenges of historic buildings, a limited gas supply and a significant growth, but a few successful projects have created the drive to do more.  We felt that the key to ensuring that carbon reduction remained a strategic priority was to recognise its link with our curriculum. Sustainability is no longer a separate function or budget, but is proactively included in all campus thinking and developments. However, the Hefce carbon reduction targets for universities are very tough, and many universities had not considered the impact of growth when they originally developed their carbon management plans.  A spokesperson for the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine says:The figures held by our sustainability manager show an increase of 15.6% rather than 66% as suggested in the report. As for the discrepancy, there’s an anomaly in the data somewhere which we’re looking into but we don’t know yet. Our figures show the school’s emissions increased from 3,562 tonnes in 2005-06 to 4,118 tonnes in 2013-14 - this represents an increase of 15.6%. Since 2014, the school has developed a new carbon management plan to reduce our emissions.  Jason Clarke, head of sustainability at City University London, says:We’ve been fortunate in that we have been able to align our estates strategy with our carbon management strategy. In 2012 we invested heavily in developing a central combined cooling heat and power plant, which is the foundation of our carbon management strategy. In subsequent years, the university has been able to stop using a number of its poorer performing, remote buildings. Most of the difficulties we have here are around retaining comfortable conditions for students across the seasons. Space is at a premium in central London, so the task for us is to design high-performing spaces using existing mid-20th-century buildings, rather than building new ones. Airtightness and insulation levels aren’t always what one would hope for so addressing these problems forms a major part of the design process.

"A major oil and gas conference in central London was blockaded by a protest against a top industry award given to the head of ExxonMobil, the oil company that is reported to have funded climate change denial. Protesters blocked the entrance on Tuesday evening by glueing themselves to the doors at the Oil and Money conference at the Dorchester on Park Lane, which brings together the most senior executives in the industry. Signs on their backs read “Climate change is nothing to celebrate” and “You can ignore the science but you can’t ignore us”.  The target of the direct action was Rex Tillerson, recipient of the Petroleum Executive of the Year Award at the conference and the chair and CEO of Exxon, the world’s biggest oil company.  Financial records and correspondence emerged in July that show the firm funnelled more than £1.5m to US politicians and lobby groups that deny climate change and block efforts to tackle it – despite having formerly committed not to. Greenpeace estimates that ExxonMobil have spent almost £20m funding researchers and thinktanks that promote misinformation on climate change. Since the revelations, Exxon has said it acknowledges the risks of climate change and has ceased to fund groups that promote denial.  Lorna Buky-Webster, from campaign group Divest London, which organised the protest, said: “We’re here to show the oil industry that there they have nothing to celebrate. “When they should be putting their heads together to tackle the biggest threat to human civilisation that has ever existed, instead they are giving awards to people who have been sitting on knowledge about climate change and aggressively funding denialism.” Tillerson was chosen for the award by industry peers for his “highly successful leadership of ExxonMobil, where he has further enhanced the company’s widely respected reputation for strong operational performance, financial discipline, project execution and technological innovation,” according to Thomas Wallin, vice president of research company Energy Intelligence, which convened the conference in co-operation with the New York Times.

"The high court of justice in Lahore has ordered the creation of a “climate council” to force the Pakistani state to uphold its environmental commitments. A farmer went to the court with the charge that his “fundamental rights” had been breached by the lack of action on the part of Pakistan’s climate change minister. Pakistan has been hit by three consecutive years of deadly floods.   Rising temperatures are increasing the chance of drought and heightening rainfall intensity during a shortened monsoon season. These elements threaten the country’s agricultural production, which half the population relies on for its survival. In a recent ruling, the judge said that the government had not made any concrete steps to enact the national climate change policy, approved in 2012. The judged added, “for Pakistan, climate change is no longer a distant threat – we are already feeling and experiencing its impacts across the country and the region.”  The judge’s proposed “climate council” would bring together representatives from various ministries and civil society, including NGOs, and be headed by a lawyer specialising in environmental law. He or she will have to report back to legal officials and oversee a number of initiatives, for instance optimising irrigation techniques or progressively eliminating motorised water pumps. In a country riddled by terrorism and corruption, Pakistan’s political powers seem to have abandoned the subject of climate change. “Despite having a national climate policy, no one cares about it,” writes Ahmad Rafay Alam, a Pakistani lawyer and specialist in environmental law, on climate change site thethirdpole.net. “It has required a court of law to summon the authorities for us to see their hand-wringing and poor excuses for inaction.” If the decision of the Lahore high court sets a legal precedent, citizens will now be able to hold the state responsible for its inaction in fighting and adapting to climate change. But whether this climate justice will result in concrete action remains to be seen. As Pakistan’s 2012 plan on climate change highlights, the country suffers from “weak technical and financial means” to adapt to global warming. The case marks the second time that a court has forced a state to take action on the climate. In June, a court in The Hague ordered the Dutch state to reduce national greenhouse gas emissions by at least 25% by 2020 compared to 1990 levels, following a case brought to court by Urgenda, an environmental NGO. This judicialisation of climate protection could spread to other countries: in Belgium a court has been considering this possibility. “We are seeing an increasing number of legal challenges because of a disappointment in the ineffectiveness of public and private commitments to reduce greenhouse gas emissions,” said Laurent Neyret, a specialist in environmental law and professor at the University of Versailles. He added that in France “only an NGO recognised to be of public interest could launch such a challenge, and not an ordinary citizen like in Pakistan”. • Translation by Simon Pickstone/ VoxEurop"

"Seattle has found itself at a crossroads of the fight against fossil fuel extraction. Heading right through our waterfront are coal trains from Wyoming, oil trains from North Dakota, and Shell’s Arctic drilling fleet. It is quite the juxtaposition. Progressive Seattle, with its climate hugging politicians, tied to the fossil fuel extraction it claims to oppose.  It’s the same challenge faced worldwide. At the same time as we make extraordinary advances in conservation and alternative energy sources, we lack the political will to stop fossil fuel extraction at the source. Bring on the solar panels, wind turbines, electric transit, bike lanes and LED lights, but if we keep pumping, digging and burning fossil fuel reserves we will still lose the fight. Scientists tell us that approximately 80% of our known reserves must stay in the ground to prevent the worst effects of climate change.   So how do we break the vicious cycle of fossil fuel companies operating with impunity? They want to convince us that fossil fuel use is inevitable, and that we must simply acquiesce, nay, even invest, in expectation of their profits. What a cynical view of the future.  That is where the fossil fuel divestment movement comes in. It asks us to make a simple choice. Do we keep investing in fossil fuel use, or do we start investing in the future we want? While no one individual or institution divesting will tip the scales, collectively it is a movement that tells politicians and the public that it’s possible to imagine a future free of fossil fuels. That vision of the future is essential to unlock the social, cultural, and political changes we desperately need. That’s why we’re asking the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation to divest from fossil fuels. As their Seattle neighbours, we want them to join the fastest growing divestment movement in history – one that has now grown to 400 institutions worth a collective $2.6tn (1.7tn). And we want our campaign to inspire others in Seattle and beyond to join the movement.  When our political institutions fail, as they have with climate change, it falls upon the people to compel the social change we need. To call upon influential institutions and leaders to align their actions with their stated values. Indeed, to hold all of us accountable to the vision of the future we believe in.  It was Bill and Melinda Gates’ humanity that compelled their mission: “Guided by the belief that every life has equal value, the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation works to help all people lead healthy, productive lives.” It is that vision and humanity that makes their voices so powerful and why we ask them to join us.  Every day we see how climate change threatens that vision. The desperate refugees from the Middle East and Africa fleeing political instability fuelled by drought. The Pacific islanders watching their low-lying atolls slowly disappear. Searing heat plaguing locations around the globe.  It comes home to us here in Seattle too. Our poor breathe air far more polluted than the air breathed by the rich. Our East African community mourns those dying in the Mediterranean while struggling to make their place in a new city. Our Asian Pacific islander community watches typhoons hurtling to their hometowns. The largest wildfires ever in Washington state torch homes and blanket rural communities in smoke for months on end.  It is simply not okay anymore to say “we have a duty to profit as much as we can from our investments, regardless of the costs to the rest of society”. Or “it won’t make a difference anyway”.  Nor is it OK to say “the real solution is in a technological breakthrough”. The technology breakthroughs are already here, as conservation and alternative energy rapidly approach or exceed fossil fuels in cost effectiveness. The smart money has already moved away from coal investments. Carbon Tracker has demonstrated that the extraordinary costs of tar sands and Arctic oil drilling will make them unaffordable as well, and that the next big investment bubble to burst is the “carbon bubble”.  On divestment, all that is left is to say is which side you stand on – with the oil, gas and coal companies, or against them? With a future that truly values every human life, or a future that values the next increment of investment profit no matter how risky or damaging?  Here in Seattle we are building a coalition that knows what side it stands on. We will spend our energy urging the Gates Foundation and others to join the divestment movement. When they join it will be a signal for many others to join. If you want to help you can find us at gatesdivest.org.  When the grassroots and the powerful unite, change is inevitable. When the representatives of the world’s governments arrive in Paris to negotiate a climate treaty, let it be with as many voices as possible calling for the change we need."

"Imagine you invested heavily in glam rock silver spandex clothing just as punk music happened. You’d suddenly be left with a lot of shiny stuff you couldn’t shift. It would be a ‘stranded asset’ – the victim of an unanticipated devaluation due to shifting fashion (though you might argue it was always a liability). Increasingly, mainstream acceptance that money poured into fossil fuels risks becoming trapped in similarly stranded assets, raises the intriguing possibility that the logic might leak out and touch other parts of the economy which are heavily dependent on the same fossil fuels. Responding to the emissions rigging crisis embroiling the German car maker Volkswagen, the Financial Times speculated that Europe’s focus on diesel “may have driven its car industry up a technological dead end”. If so, not withstanding VW’s multi-billion legal liability for deceiving regulators, there is another calculation waiting to be done, of the potentially stranded assets in the manufacture of diesel vehicles. In the UK their share of the new engine market rose from under 10% to over 50% in less than a decade, and a sudden reawakening of concern about their health impacts could see them fall from favour even quicker. But why stop there? There’s a strong case that private motor vehicles per se, produced and driven at their current scale, are also a technological dead end whose assets, sooner or later, are set to become stranded. Mark Carney, the governor of the Bank of England recently argued that one way in which climate change will affect financial stability is through the revaluation of assets as we adjust to a low carbon economy. In spite of a rather half-hearted introduction, the new charge on plastic bags in England, for example, could see the assets of a few packaging companies heading for the stranded basket. Places such as New Delhi and Bangladesh have already managed to ban plastic bags outright. Renewed impetus and optimism surrounding the Paris climate talks and the steady build-up of national commitments to reduce emissions could start shifting the confidence line for investors wherever the economy is vulnerable to carbon targets and legislation. The aviation sector, whose big planes, once built, tend to hang around for decades, looks especially vulnerable. Why invest in expensive kit, such as a new London runway, if it will soon ends up sitting largely idle, another carbon stranded asset. Carney called for companies to disclose both their current emissions and what, if any, plans they have to make the transition to a zero carbon business model. With those words ringing in my ears, if I were an actuary – one of those quiet but useful figures in the City whose job it is to see risks on the horizon – I would pull up the full list of energy intensive industries, from steel and aluminium to cement and chemical companies, and start playing hunt the potentially stranded asset. If the Paris meeting is to mean anything, the world will shift inevitably from an economy of linear, material throughput and waste, to a circular economy as frugal and clever at material capture and reuse as an ecosystem. As it does so, those industries which do not reinvent themselves could find themselves as stranded as those silver spandex playsuits. In an article on why the Volkswagen scandal was worse than the one which destroyed the energy company, Enron, David Bach of Yale Management School, pointed out how “clean diesel”, it turns out, is as much a lie as “clean coal”. Politicians and regulators allowed themselves to be swept up in that lie to the point where it destroyed the reputation of Europe’s economic powerhouse for straight-talking, technical efficiency almost overnight, and in a sector, car making, synonymous with ‘brand Germany’.  If one sector could so easily turn unnoticed into a technological dead end, how many others already are doing so, without companies, regulators or officials realising it? The global economy is currently around 80% dependent on power from fossil fuels. Coincidentally, the proportion of recoverable reserves that need to be left in the ground, unburned is estimated to be around the same, 80%. The World Bank put the value of global economic activity in 2014 at about $78tn. Looking ahead, how much of that continued activity is premised on using fossil fuels that can’t be burned, and for which there is no easy energy substitute – such as aviation and types of industrial agriculture? It’s a good, if tricky, research question.  But globally, potentially stranded assets are likely to run into multiple trillions of dollars. Car makers may go electric, but even that’s no get out of jail free card, as the power still needs to come from somewhere. And, as we can see, there’s still far too much carbon in the energy system. So, given that what we already have is unsustainable, no new carbon intensive infrastructure should be being built. To look at things with fresh eyes, and to really see what has become normal when it never should have done, will take more than policy. It will take a shift of culture. A huge range of artists, musicians and writers will be as active as policy people and campaigners on climate change over the coming months. The group Cape Farewell is organising an entire, parallel event to the climate talks called ArtCOP21, spanning 25 countries. Carney coined what he called ‘the tragedy of the horizon’ because the real costs of climate change fall in the future beyond the policy and investment horizons of key financial actors.  By the time it matters to them, he argues, it will be too late. To counter the human self-absorption that creates this state of affairs, a brilliantly inventive new initiative called The Parliament of Things invited people to imagine how non-human entities with a stake in the world might grapple with the problems humanity presents them. In the winning response, by Fien Veldman, the Horizon, personified, nervously addresses the newly gathered parliament of animals, plants and things. It thanks those present for never leaving it empty, but where humans are concerned it complains of being simply overwhelmed. The parliament considers this, and passes the first rule of its new constitution: ‘Dear humans, we would like a little more space.’ Find those stranded assets and we could answer its call. "
"Evidence for flowing water on Mars: this opens up the possibility of life, of wonders we cannot begin to imagine. Its discovery is an astonishing achievement. Meanwhile, Martian scientists continue their search for intelligent life on Earth.  We may be captivated by the thought of organisms on another planet, but we seem to have lost interest in our own. The Oxford Junior Dictionary has been excising the waymarks of the living world. Adders, blackberries, bluebells, conkers, holly, magpies, minnows, otters, primroses, thrushes, weasels and wrens are now surplus to requirements. In the past four decades, the world has lost 50% of its vertebrate wildlife. But across the latter half of this period, there has been a steep decline in media coverage. In 2014, according to a study at Cardiff University, there were as many news stories broadcast by the BBC and ITV about Madeleine McCann (who went missing in 2007) as there were about the entire range of environmental issues. Think of what would change if we valued terrestrial water as much as we value the possibility of water on Mars. Only 3% of the water on this planet is fresh; and of that, two-thirds is frozen. Yet we lay waste to the accessible portion. Sixty per cent of the water used in farming is needlessly piddled away by careless irrigation. Rivers, lakes and aquifers are sucked dry, while what remains is often so contaminated that it threatens the lives of those who drink it. In the UK, domestic demand is such that the upper reaches of many rivers disappear during the summer. Yet still we install clunky old toilets and showers that gush like waterfalls. As for salty water, of the kind that so enthrals us when apparently detected on Mars, on Earth we express our appreciation with a frenzy of destruction. A new report suggests fish numbers have halved since 1970. Pacific bluefin tuna, which once roamed the seas in untold millions, have been reduced to an estimated 40,000, yet still they are pursued. Coral reefs are under such pressure that most could be gone by 2050. And in our own deep space, our desire for exotic fish rips through a world scarcely better known to us than the red planet’s surface. Trawlers are now working at depths of 2,000 metres. We can only guess at what they could be destroying. A few hours before the Martian discovery was announced, Shell terminated its Arctic oil prospecting in the Chukchi Sea. For the company’s shareholders, it’s a minor disaster: the loss of $4bn; for those who love the planet and the life it sustains, it is a stroke of great fortune. It happened only because the company failed to find sufficient reserves. Had Shell succeeded, it would have exposed one of the most vulnerable places on Earth to spills, which are almost inevitable where containment is almost impossible. Are we to leave such matters to chance? At the beginning of September, two weeks after he granted Shell permission to drill in the Chukchi Sea, Barack Obama travelled to Alaska to warn Americans about the devastating effects that climate change caused by the burning of fossil fuels could catalyse in the Arctic. “It’s not enough just to talk the talk”, he told them. “We’ve got to walk the walk.” We should “embrace the human ingenuity that can do something about it”. Human ingenuity is on abundant display at Nasa, which released those astounding images. But not when it comes to policy. Let the market decide: this is the way in which governments seek to resolve planetary destruction. Leave it to the conscience of consumers, while that conscience is muted and confused by advertising and corporate lies. In a near-vacuum of information, we are each left to decide what we should take from other species and other people, what we should allocate to ourselves or leave to succeeding generations. Surely there are some resources and some places – such as the Arctic and the deep sea – whose exploitation should simply stop? All this drilling and digging and trawling and dumping and poisoning – what is it for, anyway? Does it enrich human experience, or stifle it? A couple of weeks ago I launched the hashtag #extremecivilisation, and invited suggestions. They have flooded in. Here are just a few of the products my correspondents have found. All of them, as far as I can tell, are real. An egg tray for your fridge that syncs with your phone to let you know how many eggs are left. A gadget for scrambling them – inside the shell. Wigs for babies, to allow “baby girls with little or no hair at all the opportunity to have a beautifully realistic hair style”.The iPotty, which permits toddlers to keep playing on their iPads while toilet training. A £2,000 spider-proof shed. A snow sauna, on sale in the United Arab Emirates, in which you can create a winter wonderland with the flick of a switch. A refrigerated watermelon case on wheels: indispensable for picnics – or perhaps not, as it weighs more than the melon. Anal bleaching cream, for… to be honest, I don’t want to know. An “automatic watch rotator” that saves you the bother of winding your luxury wrist-candy. A smartphone for dogs, with which they can take pictures of themselves. Pre-peeled bananas, in polystyrene trays covered in clingfilm; Just peel back the packaging. Every year, clever new ways of wasting stuff are devised, and every year we become more inured to the pointless consumption of the world’s precious resources. With each subtle intensification, the baseline of normality shifts. It should not be surprising to discover that the richer a country becomes, the less its people care about their impacts on the living planet. Our alienation from the world of wonders, with which we evolved, has only intensified since David Bowie described a girl stumbling through a “sunken dream”, on her way to be “hooked to the silver screen”, where a long series of distractions diverts her from life’s great questions. The song, of course, was Life on Mars."

"Forests are undervalued assets in meeting the twin global challenges of our time: achieving prosperity and safeguarding climate stability. It’s time we gave them the attention – and finance – that they deserve. Last week, dozens of countries announced a late-breaking wave of commitments to reduce greenhouse gas emissions ahead of the climate change summit in Paris this November. While such pledges are welcome, they are not yet sufficient to avert catastrophic global warming. Tropical forests provide an opportunity to close the gap.   When tropical forests are cut and left to decay or are burned, as happened on an area almost twice the size of Costa Rica last year, the carbon stored in leaves, branches, trunks, roots and soil is released into the atmosphere. For many forest-rich developing countries, deforestation, not fossil fuel use, is the major source of emissions. If tropical deforestation were a country, it would rank somewhere  between China and the European Union as a source of current annual greenhouse gas emissions. So halting deforestation would be a giant step toward taming climate change. That’s not all. Standing forests soak up carbon into vegetation and soil, providing a safe and natural Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) technology. If we were to stop tropical deforestation tomorrow, allow damaged forests to grow back, and protect mature forests, the resulting reduction in emissions and removal of carbon from the atmosphere could equal up to  one-third of current global emissions from all sources.  The good news is that climate negotiators have already agreed on a way to make this happen. It’s called Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and forest Degradation or REDD+, in which rich countries reward developing countries for reducing deforestation on a pay-for-performance basis. Many developing countries have indicated that they would be willing to reduce emissions further in return for international financial support. Rich countries could do more to fight climate change at lower cost by financing tropical forest conservation in addition to their own domestic emission cuts. The few REDD+ agreements already in place have priced avoided CO2 emissions at  only $5 per ton, truly a bargain compared to most other options. In addition to mitigating the emissions that cause climate change, conserving tropical forests contributes to development in myriad ways. New science suggests that forests support agriculture by regulating weather at continental scales, in addition to the shade, forage, and pollination they provide to adjacent farms. This means that deforestation of the Amazon rainforest threatens to deny rainfall to faraway crops in Brazil’s agricultural heartland. Forested watersheds fill reservoirs behind hydroelectric dams and extend their lives by controlling erosion, ensuring that millions of people have access to modern energy. And all these services are in addition to the harvest of timber and non-timber forest products such as charcoal, which provide, on average, one-fifth of household incomes in communities that live in and around forests. Moreover, poor countries and poor people in those countries will be the biggest losers from climate change. A single tropical storm, such as Typhoon Haiyan that slammed into the Philippines two years ago, can knock a country off its economic growth path for decades. And the poorest households, whose health, livelihoods, and housing are already precarious, have the fewest resources to adapt to change or recover from natural disasters. Intact forests are more resistant to the impacts of extreme weather events, such as the landslides that follow heavy rains and the forest fires that follow dry spells in Indonesia. Maintaining the flows of goods and services from forests is critical to buffering the impacts of climate instability on those least able to withstand them. There’s one more reason invest more in tropical forest conservation: preliminary evidence   suggests that REDD+ initiatives can help improve governance and the rule of law. In both Brazil and Indonesia, national efforts to reduce deforestation have been associated with greater transparency, increased law enforcement targeted at forest-related crime and corruption and steps to strengthen the land rights of indigenous peoples. A broad coalition of governments, multinational corporations, non-governmental organizations and indigenous groups recognized these potential benefits in the September 2014 New York Declaration on Forests. Rich countries should think about paying for forest services as a utility. We are willing to pay electric bills in return for keeping the lights on; we should be willing to pay for tropical forest conservation as one way to ensure climate stability, while also promoting development benefits. But so far, rich countries have only pledged about a billion dollars per year for REDD+. Americans spend  20 times that amount on pet food. We can do better than that. And we should. "
"As state and federal governments continue to fail at halting climate change at the global and national levels, smaller communities have a great opportunity to take change-making initiative. Without assistance from national governments, municipal environmental groups have set up their own local peer-to-peer networks, and indigenous communities like the Lubicon Cree First Nation have reclaimed tar sands for solar. Supporting the expansion of such projects from one community to another could be the key for rapid and inclusive action, and this grassroots domino effect could make it less likely that climate action is an elitist and expensive imposition. In my small village of Sleepy Hollow, New York, I’m trying to put us on the map for something other than fictional horror stories, looking at these existing initiatives where other small communities are already taking the lead on climate action in the face of higher-level indifference and even pushback.  Communities that move forward with environmentally friendly initiatives are sometimes penalized for being ahead of higher levels of government. For instance, some communities that have adopted plastic bag bans have been sued, and many oppose such initiatives because they impact some businesses and not others. When higher-level governments take the lead and enact broader legislation, it evens out the playing field, making it easier to put community interests ahead of fear of expensive backlash But that’s taking too long – we need to ask faster. In my research on options for Sleepy Hollow, one takeaway has been that we should draw on existing efforts. For instance, some communities in New York have been part of a pilot program with free tools to assess emissions and decide what actions should be taken for each community, such as streamlining government fleets or making streets safer for bikes and pedestrians. Funding for this program will be ending soon and its future is uncertain, but expanding the reach of such programs would allow for faster action that’s also flexible enough for each community’s needs. While it seems like we have a lot of work to do in a short amount of time, the nation doesn’t need to start from scratch: much of the problem-solving is being done already, though at a recent event on gender and climate justice, speakers said that local solutions were not being given their due in higher-level planning.  Another lesson is to make sustainable behavior the default. According to Morten Kabell, mayor for technical and environmental administration of Copenhagen, shifts to more climate friendly behaviors happen if the “best choice is the easiest choice.” Although European cities are often looked to as models of sustainable living, the prioritization of bike-friendly infrastructure is relatively recent and was initially driven by concerns about safety and health, not climate change. Some American cities are transitioning to being more bike friendly, but to change behavior, we need to make the choices with lower emissions the easier and cheaper ones.  The controversy around climate change is shifting from whether it exists to whether it’s worth acting on, even while Texas produces more wind power than any other state, generating 9% of its power with the potential to make more than 1,800%. President Obama has already connected asthma to air quality and green energy to jobs, and continuing to highlight these concrete benefits could reveal surprising allies for mitigation. We’re already experiencing extreme weather that could become the new normal, and villages like Kivalina, in Alaska, will soon be lost to the sea. The relative “nimbleness” of small communities has allowed them to experiment with climate action; we need to apply what they’ve already learned and do something, fast. "

"The leader of Canada’s biggest oil-producing province has declared she sees no long-term future in fossil fuels, predicting Alberta would wean itself off dirty energy within a century. In an early reveal of her forthcoming new energy policy, Alberta’s Rachel Notley said she would fight climate change by cleaning up the tar sands, shutting down coal-fired power plants, and converting to wind and solar power.  Notley also forecast an eventual future beyond fossil fuels – a dramatic change for Alberta - and a track that has put her on a collision course with Canada’s conservative prime minister, Stephen Harper. The Alberta leader is due to unveil the new policy ahead of the international UN climate conference in Paris this December. The province sits atop the world’s third-biggest known carbon reserves in the tar sands, and has rapidly ramped up production to some 2m barrels of crude a day. By 2020, the province will account for more than a third of Canada’s total carbon pollution, according to government figures.   Notley, whose election last May broke the Conservatives’ 44-year lock on power in the province, said she intends that to change. “I don’t think we are defined by energy. Certainly in the short to medium term that is an asset that we have, so we have to look at how we develop it carefully and responsibly because of the obligation we have to the people employed in the industry,” she told the Guardian. She went on: “Do I see that as our reason for being 100 years from now? Well, I hope we will have learned a lesson of diversification by then.” Notley visited Montreal, New York, and Toronto this week to try to persuade investors that Alberta under her leadership was committed to cleaning up tar sands production and tackling climate change. The Alberta leader will try to make a similar case to the international community when she attends the Paris climate summit. Canada is regularly held up as a climate super villain at the international climate negotiations. Harper pulled Canada out of the Kyoto climate protocol, and launched a quest to become an energy super power, blowing through emissions reductions targets.  Meanwhile, campaigners have targeted tar sands, together with coal, as particularly dirty forms of energy, because of its energy-intensive extraction and its widespread destruction of boreal forests.   Notley admitted Alberta would be squeezed to fight climate change while protecting jobs in the oil patch at a time of low energy prices. “It’s a bit of a conundrum,” she said. “I want to change the direction, bend the curve and do it as effectively as we can while maintaining jobs that are important to Alberta. People deserve to see government both at the federal and provincial levels that are committed to very significantly changing the rate of greenhouse gas emissions coming out of both Alberta and Canada.” Such pronouncements have put Notley at odds with Harper. The free market conservative, who is up for re-election on 19 October, has called Notley a “disaster”. Over the last decade, Harper has championed his vision of Canada as an energy super power and lobbied aggressively in Washington and European capitals for more pipelines to get tar sands crude to market. Harper’s opponents say the hardball tactics backfired. In an election debate this week, Harper was repeatedly accused of alienating Barack Obama and other US officials with hard arm promotion of the controversial Keystone XL pipeline project. Notely has said in the past she is opposed to Keystone XL – but not other pipelines. Her main focus now was getting the oil industry to clean up its act, Notley told the Guardian.  “We need to do much better with greenhouse gas emissions,” she said. “We need to take our environmental responsibilities seriously if we are going to have support for our products in other markets that have greater environmental concerns.” The Alberta leader is expected to unveil new targets for reducing greenhouse gas emissions later this autumn, after hearing from an expert committee. Notley also committed to phasing out Alberta’s coal-fired power plants, which provide more than 40% of the province’s electricity, converting to renewable energy, and putting a meaningful price on carbon. The shift on energy and climate has won praise from environmental organisations – but Notley is facing a tough climb. “She is starting from basically a blank slate,” said Simon Dyer, regional director of the Pembina Institute. A poll released on Wednesday from the environmental think tank found a majority of Albertans favoured strong policies to cut greenhouse gas emissions, even if it meant higher production costs for oil sands companies. He noted that Alberta was one of the few regions in the US and Canada without programmes promoting wind and solar energy. “The premier is saying we are going to be a leader on this but obviously we are coming from very far behind in the pack,” he said.  Mike Hudema, a climate campaigner for Greenpeace, was reserving judgment. “I don’t think we are going to see anything reducing the rampant emissions coming from the tar sands,” he said. “The big reason they want a stronger climate policy is to increase market access. I don’t think the government has come to grips with the scientific reality that three-fourths of all fossil fuels will need to remain in the ground.” The Alberta leader caused some unease this week when she said Alberta would not support the national cap-and-trade scheme put forward by Tom Mulcair, the federal New Democratic Party leader. However, Notley said the reluctance was due to the idea of funds leaving the province, not capping emissions.  “Generally speaking cap and trade as one strategy is a bit problematic for us,” she said. “It would turn into a fairly major cash transfer from Alberta to other places ... We are going to be more focused on a strategy that allows us to take investment that goes into reducing emissions and keeping it in Alberta.”"

"India, the world’s third biggest greenhouse gas emitter, has pledged to source 40% of its electricity from renewable and other low-carbon sources by 2030. It is the last major economy, following 140 other countries including China, the US and the EU, to submit a climate change plan to the UN before international talks to reach a deal on tackling global warming in Paris this December. Campaigners welcomed the commitment to cut the “emissions intensity” of its economy – a ratio of carbon emissions per unit of GDP – by up to 35% by 2030.  India’s population of 1.2 billion, about 363 million of whom live in poverty, is projected to grow to 1.5 billion by 2030. “It is estimated that more than half of India of 2030 is yet to be built,” India’s submission claimed. The country has previously pledged an emissions intensity cut of up to 25% by 2020. Prakash Javadekar, India’s environment minister, said: “Though India is not part of the problem, it wants to be part of the solution. Our historical cumulative emission as of today is below 3%.” In a speech in New York, he referenced the pope’s address to the UN last week and emphasised that while India was a big emitter, it was responsible for less carbon pollution than many developed countries since the industrial revolution.  “The developed world must take moral responsibility for the state of the world today. The pope has also mentioned that the huge consumption of the developed world has repercussions on the developing world,” Javadekar said. India’s submission to the UN, known as its Intended Nationally Determined Contribution (INDC), focuses on clean energy, including solar power, which the prime minister, Narendra Modi, has already strongly backed. It also promised to plant more forests by 2030 to absorb carbon emissions. Modi has repeatedly said India would not accept constraints on its development as part of any climate deal. Unlike China’s submission to the UN in June, India’s does not spell out when its emissions might peak. Most environment groups and thinktanks said the plan, which was submitted to the UN late on Thursday, was good and recognised the impacts global warming would have on India. Rhea Suh, the president of the US-based Natural Resources Defense Council (NRDC), said: “India’s strong climate plan offers a comprehensive approach to curb the worst impacts of climate change.” Germana Canzi, an analyst at UK-based Energy and Climate Intelligence Unit, hailed India’s pledge as significant and said: “The path of that India will now take in its development is extremely important for the future of the climate, particularly as the country is set to surpass China to become the world’s most populous country by 2028, with 1.45 billion people.” Nitin Pandit, CEO of the World Resources Institute in India, said: “As one of the most vulnerable countries to climate change, India recognises the domestic benefits of confronting this issue. Its climate plan does a good job combining opportunities to reduce emissions in the near term, and it includes clear goals to restore landscapes that will bring long-term benefits.” But Durwood Zaelke, a climate change expert and long-time campaigner on the need to phase out climate-changing gases such as HFCs as part of the effort against global warming, said India “could do much better”, and “easily”, if it agreed to phase out HFCs, which are used in air conditioning.  Unlike the largely dry language of submissions by the US and EU, India’s contains colourful passages explaining its attitude towards the environment, citing its long tradition of a harmonious relationship between man and nature. Mahatma Gandhi is invoked several times, including his comment that “Earth has enough resources to meet people’s needs, but will never have enough to satisfy people’s greed.” The Philippines also made an informal indication of its plans to cut its carbon emissions by 70% by 2030 but only if it receives financial assistance, a presidential aide told Reuters news agency on Friday. An analysis of 140 countries’ pledges to the UN so far found this week that they would see temperatures rise to 2.7C above pre-industrial levels by 2100. Governments at previous climate talks have committed to holding rises to 2C. The quest for a deal in Paris is intensifying, according to Laurence Tubiana, the French ambassador for climate change, speaking during a Google hangout on Friday. She said that countries must come up with adequate emissions reductions, and that all countries - including the poorest - must be involved in the deal. An additional pre-meeting will also take place in Paris two weeks before the actual summit which starts on 30 November, she confirmed, in an attempt to iron out any remaining difficult issues in advance. • Additional reporting by Fiona Harvey          "

"Africa will continue to be held back if we do not immediately invest in research and development. African governments who have not met the 1% target pledged at the African Union heads of state summit in 2006 should increase their spending on research. Pledges have been made, but in most cases they haven’t been translated into concrete actions. This is partly because African governments struggle with conflicting priorities such as preventing disease outbreaks and providing education and proper sanitation.   But science could have solutions for these challenges – if we invest in it.  The African economies are some of the world’s fastest growing, averaging 5% annually. For this growth to continue, local solutions and innovations need to be applied to all sectors, especially healthcare and education. Economic progress can only be sustained when the population is fed, educated, healthy and happy.  Countries that have invested in education, science and technology have managed to break the cycle of poverty. The UK spends 1.7% of GDP on scientific research, while America spends 3% (government and private sector investment). African countries are lagging behind in development because their investment in science remains low. The recent Ebola outbreak in west Africa highlighted the disconnect between policy and research. It revealed the absence of strong and credible institutions, the lack of trained doctors and nurses and the outdated and underdeveloped medical and research systems.  The shortage of clinical scientists, epidemiologists and diagnostics laboratories to survey and curtail the disease have had a devastating impact. Perhaps the silver lining to the Ebola cloud has been the promising trial data of a new vaccine that will hopefully reduce the number of lives lost to this dreadful disease. The impacts of climate change also hang like a Damocles sword over a region that has contributed below 3% of the planet’s carbon dioxide emissions from energy and industrial sources. A better understanding of the threats of climate change requires reliable, credible data to strengthen decision-making and ensure that the continent is able to adapt and mitigate the risks. Among the risks facing small island states like Mauritius are flash floods, droughts and unusual temperature spikes. Mauritius has experienced one such flooding in 2013 with fatal losses. Science, technology and innovation can provide answers to these threats and challenges and yet has never been centre stage in our decision-making processes. One of the consequences to this oversight has been brain drain. Many talented Africans have left to greener pastures in the west. The need to provide an enabling environment, and to prevent this drain of talent, is high on government agenda. In Mauritius, the government is enacting policies and providing incentives like a 10-year tax holiday for those who return.  Currently, it is tough for African scientists who have chosen to stay behind. They are forever fighting to secure funding to further their ideas and research activities.  Research priorities are set outside the continent without any alignment to the needs of the continent. As a result, more funding is being spent on HIV and Aids, as well as malaria and tuberculosis, and not enough is spent on neglected tropical diseases.  We need to ensure that funding from international partners complements government funding. Investing local funding will ensure that the research done in Africa helps to meet the continent’s pressing needs. It would also help to ensure the sustainability of programmes after donor funding has dried up. Then trained young scientists can also be assured of a brighter future. In September we launched the Alliance for Accelerating Excellence in Africa (AESA). AESA is a new initiative created by the African Academy of Sciences and the New Partnership for Africa’s Development (NEPAD) Agency, with the support of the UK Department for International Development, the Wellcome Trust and the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation. It aims to support the training of scientists and drive Africa’s research agenda. It also seeks to help scientists grow their careers and access the funding they need to conduct research in order to overcome Africa’s developmental challenges. The launch of AESA on earlier this month is a promising step in the right direction. African governments must join hands with strong and credible international partners to invest in local research. Without funding and the necessary regulatory environment and policies, the benefits of the scientific results emanating from research work won’t be harvested.

"Antarctic ice is melting so fast that the stability of the whole continent could be at risk by 2100, scientists have warned. Widespread collapse of Antarctic ice shelves – floating extensions of land ice projecting into the sea – could pave the way for dramatic rises in sea level.  The new research predicts a doubling of surface melting of the ice shelves by 2050. By the end of the century, the melting rate could surpass the point associated with ice shelf collapse, it is claimed. If that happened a natural barrier to the flow of ice from glaciers and land-covering ice sheets into the oceans would be removed. Lead scientist, Dr Luke Trusel, Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution in Massachusetts, US, said: “Our results illustrate just how rapidly melting in Antarctica can intensify in a warming climate. “This has already occurred in places like the Antarctic Peninsula where we’ve observed warming and abrupt ice shelf collapses in the last few decades. “Our model projections show that similar levels of melt may occur across coastal Antarctica near the end of this century, raising concerns about future ice shelf stability.” The study, published in the journal Nature Geoscience, was based on satellite observations of ice surface melting and climate simulations up to the year 2100. It showed that if greenhouse gas emissions continued at their present rate, the Antarctic ice shelves would be in danger of collapse by the century’s end. Under a reduced-emission scenario, the ice melting was brought under control after 2050. Co-author Dr Karen Frey, from Clark University in Massachusetts, said: “The data presented in this study clearly show that climate policy, and therefore the trajectory of greenhouse gas emissions over the coming century, have an enormous control over the future fate of surface melting of Antarctic ice shelves, which we must consider when assessing their long-term stability and potential indirect contributions to sea level rise.”"
"The plastic bag levy will damage the environment unless the alternatives have impeccable environmental attributes – and most of them don’t (New plastic bag tax does not go far enough, say campaigners, 5 October). The exemptions alone will undermine most of the putative savings. Not only that, but, if we had a better waste-disposal system using efficient combined heat and power incinerators, we could capture the energy from the “borrowed oil” which plastic bags represent. Only 5% of crude oil is used to make all of the plastics we use, and plastic bags are only about 5% of that. A single car trip to the supermarket each week wastes more energy and creates more pollution than a dozen plastic bags.  In any case, all the alternatives to plastic bags come with questions about their environmental impact. Making paper bags uses four times as much energy, creates 50 times more water pollution and 70% more air pollution than plastic bags. And they are rarely used more than once. Making long-lasting bags from cotton/jute and suchlike also comes with environmental penalties. Cotton isn’t the nice innocent “green” product that people think it is. Massive amounts of water and polluting pesticides are used growing cotton, while the energy used in making and shipping woven bags is also vastly higher. A report from the UK’s Environment Agency in 2011 concluded that a cotton bag would have to be reused 171 times to match the carbon dioxide pollution of a typical thin plastic bag used just once. Despite the Guardian’s “Keep it in the ground” campaign, the real problem is the wasteful use of oil in our cars, trucks, homes, offices and factories. That’s where 95% of the oil goes, and most of the resultant waste products are discharged right on the streets where we live.David ReedLondon • I’m all for supermarkets charging 5p per bag – it seems reasonable to me. One thing, though. Will the 5p bags be plain ones without any advertisements or logos on them? I always thought that the free advertising shops got was part of the free bag deal. From now on, I will expect to be offered plain bags at the checkout. Otherwise, I will need to charge for any plastic bag I pay for that has any advertising on it. I was thinking of charging a small amount, say 5p – it seems reasonable to me.Ken WardCrewe, Cheshire • In the north Pacific there is a gigantic whirlpool, twice the size of Texas (Excess baggage, G2, 1 October). It is a floating mass of our discarded plastic – The Great Pacific Garbage Patch. This raw, non-biodegradable image should cause us such pain that we will never ask for another plastic bag, or buy any non-essential product if it uses plastic in any shape or form. Enough is already too much.Jennifer LeachReading, Berkshire • “Excess baggage” reminds me of my visits to Rwanda. President Paul Kagame’s government banned non-degradable plastic bags in 2008. It isn’t just in the beautiful city of Kigali, with its manicured lawns and flower beds, that I found a complete absence of litter, but far out in “The land of a thousand hills” too, where a truly green and pleasant land is completely free of polyethylene grot.Frank PaiceNorwich • There are some, I fear, who will escape the 5p tax on plastic bags yet deserve to be charged. I live on a small council estate in the shires. About twice a month (24 times a year) charities deliver plastic bags within plastic bags asking for them to be filled with unwanted clothes. If unwanted clothes are not available, the charity asks that the bags-within-bags be placed outside the address for later collection, presumably for reuse. In five years of living here, none of those empty bags have ever been collected and are therefore disposed of by way of the council’s general rubbish collection. If a very generous calculation were to be attempted – 10m UK homes x 48 bags per annum – the calculator on my mobile phone suggests that the result is “out of range”. Will charities get away with it?Roger GoughStroud, Gloucestershire"

"In Senegal’s central Kaffrine region, stretches of the national highway cut through vast salt ponds. Yet the salt industry - which could help local people earn more and cope with worsening climate pressures - is little developed, experts say. “At the artisanal level, you have men harvesting with no gloves, no boots,” said Cheikh Tidiane Sall of Innovations Environnement Développement (IED) Afrique, a group working on sustainable development. “Inadequate storage bags are used and the salt contaminates the soil.”  In most of the region’s roadside villages, men shovel salt from mounds into 25 kilo bags, piled up on the ground. Women stand in the road flagging down 18-wheeler trucks and other passing vehicles, selling the bags for $1.70 each. Salt harvesting, storage and transport need to be improved, and production greatly increased, Sall said. Building up the industry would help compensate for financial losses in local agriculture, which relies mainly on peanut and millet production and has been hit hard by erratic rainfall. Livestock herders are suffering too. Last year drought left them desperate to find water and grazing for their animals. “This year everyone’s concern is flooding,” said Pierre Modou Mbengue, director of ARD, a regional development agency partnering with IED Afrique. Salt production could provide an alternative income, as it does not depend on reliable rainfall, Sall said. He coordinates a project that aims to channel more funding into this and other activities identified by local people as key ways to help them adapt to climate extremes and keep the money coming in. It is an example of the “climate-sensitive” development governments signed up to when they adopted a new global action plan to end poverty at the United Nations last month. Climate change receives far more attention in the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) than in the previous development agenda expiring this year. It has a goal of its own, promising urgent action to combat global warming and its impacts, which have begun to bite. “There is a clear signal there that without tackling climate change, sustainable development is - for many countries - unachievable,” said Sven Harmeling, a climate change expert with development charity Care. In the impoverished communities Care works with in Asia, Africa and Latin America, subsistence farmers, coastal villagers and other people at risk from climate threats are planting trees, trying out new crops, setting up flood warning systems, and harvesting water to protect themselves and their incomes. The thorny challenge of working out how to reduce planet-warming emissions enough to limit global temperature rise to 2C or less is being tackled separately at UN climate talks, tasked with agreeing a new deal in December. But the SDGs acknowledge how climate change can harm efforts to reduce poverty and build food security, and must be considered in countries’ development strategies, Harmeling said. Communities decide The SDGs include a target to improve climate change-related planning and management in the poorest countries, with a focus on local communities, women and young people. “If we could start to implement that in a bottom-up way, I think it could be really very impactful,” said climate justice advocate and UN special envoy on climate change Mary Robinson. The best way to ensure climate investments reflect people’s needs is to put the planning “directly into the hands of local authorities and communities”, said the Near East Foundation’s Yacouba Deme. He leads a consortium running the Kaffrine project, alongside IED Afrique and the London-based International Institute for Environment and Development. “Usually the government sets development priorities, and they may not know what the priorities really are at the local level,” said Lancelot Soumelong Ehode, who also works for IED Afrique. Working under the Building Resilience and Adaptation to Climate Extremes and Disasters (BRACED) program financed by Britain, the Kaffrine project aims to change that. In what may be a first for Senegal, it has set up committees in the region, involving local people, that are choosing activities to help them adapt to climate change. They will receive training to build skills and find resources to put their ideas into practice. “It is not that we are obliged by the president or someone to plan for (climate change) - it is a matter of urgency that we do so,” said ARD’s Mbengue. According to Sall, the priorities mapped out so far include salt production, support for livestock herders, and road construction to increase access to markets. The project is also preparing local associations to seek finance from potential sources such as Senegal’s national climate change fund, which is still empty, Britain’s Department for International Development (DfiD) and the fledgling international green climate fund. “We want to show the government, NGOs and the private sector it is possible that, at the local level, people can apply for and manage large funds, implement projects and evaluate them,” Sall said. But reaching that point will be a long journey, said IED Afrique’s Ehode. The three years the Kaffrine project is planned to last is “a very short time to achieve much”, he noted. It has taken months just to gain the confidence and respect of prefects - local government district heads - who are responsible for the transparency and governance of the climate change committees, and how they monitor projects on the ground. Now officials have a stronger incentive to ensure that climate change concerns are a central part of local development plans, as intended in the new global goals. “The prefects are anxious to be doing this work,” said Sall. “The healthy sense of competition makes each prefect want his area to be doing better than the next.” • This article first appeared via Thomson Reuters Foundation"
"China may aim for an earlier greenhouse gas emissions peak before its 2030 deadline, putting a greater onus on Australia to work with its key trading partner on renewable energy rather than fossil fuels, says a leading Chinese analyst. Qi Ye, director of the Brookings-Tsinghua Center for Public Policy in Beijing, said that Chinese policymakers were striving to ensure emissions peaked ahead of a schedule agreed in a joint climate deal with the US earlier this year.  “China hopes to peak as early as possible because it understands it’s in the national interest and to the benefit of the people in terms of health considerations,” Qi told Guardian Australia. Urban smogs contributed to an estimated 670,000 deaths in 2012. “A 2030 peak is very ambitious, it’s very challenging,” said Qi. “I think most people underestimate how challenging that is. Everyone wants China to have an earlier peak but no one wants it more than China itself.” China will introduce a national emissions trading scheme in 2017 and will try to ensure its emissions peak even as 82 million of its people live on less than $1 a day.  Australia’s environment minister, Greg Hunt, has compared Australia’s emissions reduction target favourably with China’s. He said last week that China was “a country with up to a 150% increase in emissions” between 2005 and 2030. But Qi said China was showing “global leadership” on climate change and that Australia would have to forge a new export relationship with China as the economic giant’s coal imports, which have slumped this year, begin to slow. “There will probably still be a high level of coal consumption but we will not see any significant increase in demand for coal in the Chinese economy,” Qi said.  “There’s huge potential in clean energy research, development and deployment between China and Australia. A quarter of all new renewable investment in the world is coming from China, we are talking about a $1.8tn investment. China would be very happy to have the abundant clean energy resources Australia has. “In the past we thought it was a cost to address climate change. Then we realised not addressing it will cost us more. By developing clean energy technologies, we bring more economic opportunities. Every country should look at this with fresh eyes and seize the opportunity rather than just talk about the cost of it.” Meanwhile, the number of large businesses joining a call for a global carbon pricing market has reached 4,000 – most notably oil giant Royal Dutch Shell, the World Bank says.  “Carbon pricing is an efficient, necessary way of reducing emissions,” said Vikram Widge, head of climate and carbon finance at the World Bank’s climate change group.  “The momentum behind it is huge. It’s a critical way to reach our goals but it isn’t sufficient. We have to build upon it.” Widge said Australia, which scrapped its carbon price last year, would need to find an alternative system to meet its goal of a 26% to 28% reduction in emissions by 2030, based on 2005 levels. “Australia has made a commitment and it will need to find a way to meet that target. If it chooses to do it without a carbon pricing it will have to find another way.” The Coalition’s Direct Action climate policy has set aside $2.55bn to fund emissions reduction from businesses that wish to do so, although much of the reduction will depend on how the government treats firms that do not apply for the grants and maintain, or increase, their emissions."

"Given the threat of climate change, what should the world do with its reserves of fossil fuels? Some say keep it in the ground. Others say fossil fuels are needed to in order to provide electricity to the poorest areas of the world. With the announcement Tuesday of its new $20m Carbon XPrize, the non-profit XPrize Foundation is taking a middle ground – launching a competition to find new uses for carbon dioxide (CO2), the greenhouse gas emitted by coal and natural gas plants. It’s intended to allow the continued burning of fossil fuels while reducing or eliminating their climate impact.  “How do we take that CO2 that’s coming from power plant emissions, and incentivize teams to create novel products?” said Paul Bunje, senior scientist for energy and the environment at the XPrize Foundation. “The CO2 could be turned from a waste into a valuable product.” The award, not surprisingly, is sponsored by fossil fuel interests: NRG Energy, a coal-burning utility as well as a strong advocate for solar and wind power, and the Canadian Oil Sands Innovation Alliance (COSIA), a coalition of companies that extract oil from Alberta’s oil sands, which are a mixture of sand, water, clay and heavy oil. Citing estimates from the International Energy Agency, the XPrize Foundation says that 82% of the world’s energy supply is derived from fossil fuels and that overall energy demand is expected to grow 37% by 2040. “As we move toward a low- to zero-emission future, we’ll need to continue using fossil fuels to meet current energy demands,” said Sicily Dickenson, NRG’s chief marketing officer. Some environmentalists challenge that claim. Michael Brune, executive director of the Sierra Club, has long argued that there’s no such thing as “clean coal” because capturing CO2 from smokestacks does nothing about other pollutants, like mercury, and fails to address the environmental fallout from coal mining. Greenpeace has also called for an immediate phase-out of fossil fuels. Andrew Logan, director of the oil program at the Ceres environmental coalition, called the prize “a step forward”, but said, “It really is about the long term. It shouldn’t discourage action [to reduce emissions] in the here and now.” As it happens, the XPrize Foundation is taking multiple approaches to the climate crisis. It is developing prizes for renewable energy generation, advanced energy storage and wireless power transmission. And it previously awarded an XPrize for super-efficient cars. The newest XPrize is actually two awards: $10m for a technology that proves itself at a coal plant and $10m for one that does so at a natural gas plant. As Bunje explained it, anyone can enter (at carbon.xprize.org) but judges will sift through the initial entries and whittle them down into smaller groups of competitors who will be eligible for expert advice and grants of $500,000 each from the foundation to build out their projects. The foundation doesn’t expect to award the two grand prizes until 2020. “The winning team will convert the most CO2 emissions into the highest value products,” he said. Numerous companies are already seeing ways to repurpose CO2. Liquid Light, which was spun off of a Princeton University lab, converts CO2 into a variety of commercially important chemicals. Novomer makes plastics and chemicals from CO2. Skyonic uses CO2 as an ingredient in sodium bicarbonate, commonly called baking soda, hydrochloric acid and bleach. None of these startups, however, have achieved sufficient scale to be a climate solution, and other efforts have fizzled. Calera, a much-hyped Silicon Valley startup that saays it can turn CO2 emissions into cement, has not yet lived up to its promise. Meanwhile scientists have been trying for years to recycle CO2 into liquid fuels. If nothing else, Bunje said the Carbon XPrize should help change people’s view of CO2. “We want a sea-change, a shift in thinking about what’s possible with carbon dioxide,” he said. “We have to change the way our energy system deals with CO2.”"

"Pledges by nations to cut carbon emissions will fall far short of those needed to prevent global temperatures rising by more than the crucial 2C by the end of the century. This is the stark conclusion of climate experts who have analysed submissions in the runup to the Paris climate talks later this year. A rise of 2C is considered the most the Earth could tolerate without risking catastrophic changes to food production, sea levels, fishing, wildlife, deserts and water reserves. Even if rises are pegged at 2C, scientists say this will still destroy most coral reefs and glaciers and melt significant parts of the Greenland ice cap, bringing major rises in sea levels.  “We have had a global temperature rise of almost 1C since the industrial revolution and have already seen widespread impacts that have had real consequences for people,” said climate expert Professor Chris Field of Stanford University. “We should therefore be striving to limit warming to as far below 2C as possible. However, that will require a level of ambition that we have not yet seen.” In advance of the COP21 United Nations climate talks to be held in Paris from 30 November to 11 December, every country was asked to submit proposals on cutting use of fossil fuels in order to reduce their emissions of greenhouses gases and so tackle global warming. The deadline for these pledges was 1 October. A total of 147 nations made submissions, and scientists have since been totting up how these would affect climate change. They have concluded they still fall well short of the amount needed to prevent a 2C warming by 2100, a fact that will be underlined later this week when the Grantham Research Institute releases its analysis of the COP21 submissions. This will show that the world’s carbon emissions, currently around 50bn tonnes a year, will still rise over the next 15 years, even if all the national pledges made to the UN are implemented. The institute’s figures suggest they will reach 55bn to 60bn by 2030. To put that figure in context, the world will have to cut emissions to 36bn billion tonnes of carbon to have a 50-50 chance of keeping temperatures below 2C, scientists have calculated. Current pledges will not bring the planet near that reduced output. Developed nations may pledge to make increasing use of renewable energy sources but as more developing nations become industrialised, carbon outputs continue to rise overall. And there is no prospect of nations now changing their carbon pledges before or during the Paris talks. The world is therefore falling well short of its carbon target – though there are some grounds for relative optimism. A study of COP21 pledges by Climate Action Tracker, (CAT) an independent scientific group of European climate experts, indicates that if all pledges are implemented, then global temperatures will rise by 2.7C. The group revealed that this is a significant improvement on the warming it predicted last year. “Our December update included pledges and informal announcements by China, the US and the EU, and we estimated an average global warming level of 3.1C,” said CAT member Dr Louise Jeffery of the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research. “The biggest contributing factors to the change in our temperature estimate have been China and India.” These nations had been on track to become major carbon emitters but this year issued pledges that have raised hopes they will greatly curtail their outputs, increasing some negotiators’ hopes for Paris. This point was backed by climate economist Lord Stern: “We can already see that the pledges by national governments will mean emissions after 2020 will fall far short of cuts needed to have a reasonable chance of avoiding global warming of more than 2C. It is essential, therefore, that a legal agreement is agreed at the COP21 talks in order to create a process after Paris through which countries will review their efforts and find ways to ramp up their actions on reducing emissions.” A major stumbling block facing negotiators at Paris will be finance. Developed nations – who are responsible for most carbon emissions – have to find ways to pay developing nations so that they can adopt renewable energy technologies and find ways to cope with changes in their environments. Given that this will cost hundreds of billions of dollars, there is considerable room for political fallout. Nevertheless, Field remained optimistic: “The climate change problem is one that can be solved. We have the technologies, the resources – we just need to make the commitment.”"
"Cutting carbon emissions is but one aspect of the changes needed for the infrastructure and mode of operation of the UK (Osborne reveals deal with former Blair ally, 5 October). On the energy side, we need to increase development and installation of a variety of renewable energy sources. These need to be supported with energy storage schemes. Tidal barrages provide an obvious way to combine both opportunities. We also need to develop and use technology to improve energy efficiency. This involves both more efficient operation of energy use and the reduction in use that is not socially useful. We make many things that add little benefit to life – for instance our overpackaging of many small retail items with moulded plastic. All of this needs to be viewed in ways to make our living more sustainable in the long run in terms of the use of world resources.John ChubbCheltenham, Gloucestershire • Whatever one’s political party, the establishment of a National Infrastructure Commission will be welcome if it drives forward the painfully slow process of government commitment to the projects the UK needs if it is to compete, thrive and survive in a global economy. Not least among its priorities must be a renaissance in low-carbon rapid rail links around the UK and not just HS2.  The most recent government policy document on this, the national networks national policy statement (published under the highly successful 2008 regime that has speeded up planning decisions from up to 10 years to no more than six months) is unfortunately completely devoid of any named projects. The National Infrastructure Plan gives a shopping list of projects but stops short of the policy and scientific assessment needed to move them forward. The Infrastructure Planning Commission, established from 2008, was so successful in embedding speedier decisions that by 2012 it could be embedded within the Planning Inspectorate. However, with its demise it is clear that an independent watchdog to ensure the UK is really tackling its infrastructure challenge is sorely missing.Gideon AmosVice-president, Town & Country Planning Association (and former UK infrastructure planning commissioner) • Andrew Adonis worked closely with the Lib Dems at party headquarters during the 1990s before succumbing to Tony Blair’s charms and joining New Labour. He was even, for a time, the Liberal-SDP Alliance’s prospective parliamentary candidate for West Wiltshire. Now we read that Adonis is to resign the Labour whip to work closely with the Conservative government. Where next Andrew?Les FarrisLopen, Somerset • Memo to Lord Adonis in his new role as adviser on infrastructure projects: read Zoe Williams’ article on the use of quantitative easing for green and social investment (It’s fine to print money, so long as it’s not for the people, 5 October). As the dark, deflationary clouds from China and elsewhere gather, and as unemployment and underemployment are still to be found in great swaths of the country, Adonis could propose an infrastructure programme that can help deal with these threats. This would involve using QE to fund increased economic activity that protects the environment through a programme to make all the UK’s 30m homes, offices and factories energy efficient. This decades-long energy infrastructure project would create new jobs in a vast range of skills in every part of the country. The work and business opportunities generated in every constituency will provide huge tax revenues and so calm even the most ardent deficit botherers. In short, it would be QE not just for the people, but also for the planet.Colin HinesConvenor, Green New Deal group • So Adonis resigns from Labour to manage grandiose megaprojects but notably does not resign his position on the HS2 Ltd board. Is this the moment that the Labour party will re-find Labour values and priorities in transport and confront its support for the elitist and hugely expensive HS2 proposal? Contrary to what Frank Field (Tax credits and trains can help Jeremy Corbyn outflank Tories, 4 October) says, HS2 is not a done deal. It has always been said that it requires cross-party support, and Labour opposition at the bill’s third reading would very likely derail it. This would enable Labour to redeploy the huge expenditure to implement the many higher priority improvements to commuter services and regional links, which are what ordinary people use and which offer so much better value for money.Madeleine Wahlberg and Mike GeddesOffchurch, Warwickshire • What a pronounced sense of irony you are developing in the way you report the news. Andrew Adonis is a pre-eminent thinker whose main policy developments for the Blair government were – wait for it – academy schools and HS2. Please clarify the loss to the Labour party for us.Nicola GroveHorningsham, Wiltshire"

"The federal government has said it is making good progress in cutting greenhouse gases after a new report found that Australia will have to double its historic rate of decarbonisation if it is to meet its climate goals. Australia will have to slash its carbon intensity by 4.4% each year if it is to meet its goal of reducing emissions by at least 26% by 2030, based on 2005 levels, according to the PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) analysis.  This rate of required emissions reduction is nearly double the average 2.4% cut managed by Australia annually since 2000.  Australia’s rate of decarbonisation is among the best of the world’s largest economies, PwC said. If Australia maintained its 4.7% reduction in carbon intensity in 2014, it could hit the 2030 target. However, the 2014 figure includes six months during which the former Labor government’s carbon price of $24 a tonne was in place.  A spokeswoman for Greg Hunt, the federal environment minister, said the report is further evidence that Australia’s emissions reduction targets are “strong, credible, responsible and comparable with the rest of the world.” “Australia has an impeccable track record of delivering on our climate commitments,” she said. “The success of the first auction of the emissions reduction fund paves the way to achieve more emissions reductions through the fund’s second auction on 4-5 November. “Other measures previously outlined include vehicle and energy efficiency, phasing out hydrofluorocarbons, and facilitating renewable and low emissions technologies.” However, there is room to do more, with the G20 economies requiring a 6.3% average annual reduction in order to meet an internationally-agreed target of keeping the world’s warming to below 2C compared with pre-industrial times. According to the PwC analysis, the global economy has reduced its carbon intensity, which is emissions related to economic growth, by 1.3% a year since 2000. Last year saw the biggest drop yet, at 2.7%. But these reductions are still not enough to meet the 2C target, which, if exceeded, will result in runaway climate change associated with punishing drought, damaging sea level rises and extreme weather events. If current emissions cuts are maintained, the world will spew out enough heat-trapping gases to exceed the 2C limit by 2036, PwC said. The European Commission has said that national pledges to further cut emissions ahead of climate talks in Paris in December will still result in a 3C rise in average temperatures. The federal government has said Australia’s emission reduction target places it among comparable nations although independent analysis suggests it lags at the back of the pack. Australia still lacks a comprehensive plan to reduce emissions beyond a $2.55bn emissions reduction fund that hands out money to businesses that wish to reduce their greenhouse gas output. Analysts believe this plan will fall well short of the target without major modification, potentially including emissions trading, which the government has previously ruled out. Australia’s energy is still overwhelmingly fossil fuel based, with coal, oil and gas accounting for 94% of the country’s energy demands, PwC said. However, coal consumption has slipped 18% since 2009 and energy from renewables such as wind and solar has increased by 72% over the same period. Greens senator Larissa Waters said: “The Abbott government’s attacks on renewable energy are continuing under Malcolm Turnbull who has made a deal with the Nationals to retain the low 2030 target and not bring back an emissions trading scheme. “We’re missing out on clean energy jobs because the Turnbull government is holding us back from this exciting transition that we need to save our environment and very way of life.” Mark Coughlin, PwC Australia’s energy, utilities and mining leader, said: “The fundamental question remains as to whether Australia’s targets are ambitious enough, or consistent with what other countries are doing to limit global warming to within 2C of pre-industrial levels.  “Based on how Australia has tracked historically, you could argue there’s scope to be more ambitious.”"

"Do you really believe? I’m not asking if you ‘believe’ in climate change – thankfully that question has been delegated to the world of trolls. I mean, do you believe we can build a low-carbon economy in which 9 billion people thrive? That’s a much harder question for many of us. But until we all answer with a resounding ‘yes!’ we won’t move far or fast enough. That low carbon transition requires mass re-engineering of our global infrastructure, economic systems and even our personal behaviours. The scale of revolution is admittedly hard to imagine, until you remember that we’ve already lived through one. And the leaders of that revolution unequivocally believed not only that it should happen, but that it would. The internet is almost exactly the same age as I am. In those 40 years the reach, speed and impact on our lives, economies and even built environment has been monumental. Today nearly half the world’s population can Skype loved ones, order food and access education and cat videos online. We plan our lives and run our businesses all through a system that didn’t exist when I was born.  From daily personal habits to huge infrastructure projects – our political and business leaders have happily turned our established systems upside down for the digital revolution. The British government alone is merrily spending £1bn to upgrade us to ‘superfast broadband’, without the whimpering even minimal green investment generates. Climate activists can only dream of the public and political support the digital economy enjoys. Global transformation can be done, and it has been done. Perhaps we can learn from the people who did it. Reid Hoffman, the founder of LinkedIn, says “Silicon Valley is a mindset, not a location.” So here are the key terms which underpin that proven world-changing mindset: Visionary. This overused word is fundamental to how Silicon Valley changed our lives. From Steve Jobs to Elon Musk the term ‘visionary’ now seems reserved for technology innovators rather than political leaders. While many call for ‘vision’ within the climate movement we seem to lack those iconoclastic leaders who hold an unwavering expectation and belief in their answers. We need to learn that people follow people not policies. Pay it forward. On the opposite end to the individual exceptionalism of ‘visionaries’ is this term for collective benefit. One surprising aspect of the geek world is how highly it values shared learning and a sense of community. There is a philosophy of ‘coopertition’ and support for unusual partnerships in Silicon Valley. We desperately need a similar alignment within climate action, not only within business or activist communities – but between them. The benefit of coopertition is that it allows for cooperation on the need for action, while reserving the right to viciously compete on which action should win out.  Growth-mindset & fail-fast. Two terms encompass learning, innovating and being open-minded. ‘Growth-mindset’ was coined by the Stanford University professor of psychology Carol Dweck, and she compares it to the fixed mindset that doesn’t allow for flexibility, growth or failure. That’s also the root of ‘fail-fast’ - another beloved tech term. Both reflect an acceptance of trying, learning from failures and not expecting perfection from yourself or others. Especially in the business sector, ambitious plans on climate can be killed by an overly ‘fixed’ mentality. Fear of critics dampers the innovative failures we could all learn from. UX. User Experience is the way a technology user (you and I) behaves and feels using a particular product. The holy grail of UX is for a technology to be frictionless – a word for a service so beautifully designed that it’s intuitive with inefficiencies and annoyances smoothed out. Attempts to take personal action on climate are rarely frictionless. Indeed the sheer difficulty of taking action over climate change is often held as a badge of personal honour. We need to improve the UX of low-carbon lifestyles. I’ve plucked these words from the lexicon of an industry arguably more concerned with making money than changing the world (although they would argue differently). But it’s not the worthiness of Silicon Valley’s impact I wish to emulate – it’s the monumental scale. In fact, that’s my favourite tech-term: ‘scalable’. And getting scalable seems to have a lot to do with believing it’s possible.  • This article is part of the Guardian’s Keep it in the Ground campaign.

"When world leaders gather for critical climate negotiations in Paris later this year, they must not overlook the major injustice that means Africa – responsible for only a tiny proportion of global greenhouse gas emissions (pdf) – will suffer disproportionately from rising temperatures.  The most vulnerable populations with the least capacity to cope will shoulder the burden.  Across the continent, the agricultural sector still employs about 65% of the labour force, and most of the rural poor. The majority are dependent on rain-fed agriculture and rangeland, which are subject to the vagaries of the weather. So an increase in the frequency or severity of extreme weather events driven by climate change will result in increased risk of hunger and malnutrition in Africa’s most vulnerable populations.  At the moment, the system for responding to natural disasters is not as timely or equitable as it could be. Funding is secured on a largely ad hoc basis after disaster strikes: only then can relief be mobilised toward the people who need it most. In the meantime, lives are lost, assets are depleted and development gains reversed – forcing more people into chronic hunger, malnutrition and destitution. While developed countries use sophisticated risk-management systems, Africa relies on cost-ineffective charity for each disaster. However, the continent is taking charge and breaking out of this cycle. We now have data about the adverse effects of weather shocks, the cost savings of well-timed responses, early warning technology, and basic social protection systems in many countries.  Together with modern financial tools, we are transferring the burden of climate risk away from governments – and the farmers and pastoralists they protect – to the international financial markets that can handle the risk much better. In 2012, 26 African Union member countries came together to establish the African Risk Capacity (ARC) agency and its financial affiliate, a mutual insurer capitalised at $200m (£131m) by the UK and German governments with interest-free loans. With the $350m in insurance premiums paid by African member countries up to 2020, it provides members with rapid funds in the event of a natural disaster. We are already seeing results. In September last year, as satellites detected a significant rainfall deficit in the Sahel, Senegal, Mauritania and Niger – three of the countries that formed ARC’s inaugural risk pool – were able to use ARC’s Africa RiskView software to determine the areas and communities that would be worst affected. Knowing that their insurance policies, for which the countries paid a combined premium of $8m, would probably pay out, they updated their drought contingency plans and prepared to assist vulnerable populations as soon as possible.  By the end of the west African agricultural season in January this year, ARC Insurance Company Ltd had paid out more than $26m, while a UN aid appeal was still being formulated. The money, used to buy livestock fodder and staples – primarily from local producers – benefited roughly 1.3 million people who might have otherwise been forced to cut down on meals, take children out of school or leave their land. By 2020, the ARC aims to reach 30 countries with nearly $1.5bn of coverage against drought, flood and cyclones. The agency will indirectly insure 160 million Africans – almost half of the G7 global target of 400 million vulnerable people to be insured – and radically transform the way weather risks are managed across the continent by embedding disaster preparedness and financing in our African-owned sovereign risk-management systems.  The ARC also aims to provide the infrastructure to ensure these risk management investments are sustainable and resilient to future climate shifts. This will be achieved using climate adaptation financing, the extreme climate facility (XCF), which intends to issue climate change catastrophe bonds in 2017.  To do this, we are seeking the help of donors, such as the G7, to maximise the benefits of the premium payments from African governments.  The ARC is also using its expertise to extend the protection that global insurers and reinsurers can offer Africa. The industry is increasingly focused on disaster risk, anticipating more frequent and severe losses over the coming decades.  At the end of September, the ARC and its partner Willis unveiled plans to license Africa RiskView software to support agricultural development at scale on the continent. This will not only protect investments in the sector, but also provide an additional revenue stream to ensure the ARC’s long-term financial viability. We have the opportunity to “leapfrog” carbon-intensive phases of development to cleaner, greener, more advanced land-use solutions. Yet climate change threatens both our pace of progress and the assets we have accumulated over the past decades of growth.  The ARC goes a long way towards ensuring the availability of adequate financial resources, which are critical for development progress in Africa. We are ready to face the challenges of climate change adaptation head on, and with our partners are looking forward to moving from managing crises to cost-effective risk management. "

"Volkswagen’s plan to recall cars affected by the diesel emissions scandal is lamentable and the lack of information being provided to customers is staggering, lawyers representing motorists have said.  Matthias Müller, chief executive of VW, told a German newspaper the company would launch a recall of the 11m affected cars in January and complete the fix by the end of next year.  He said a software update could fix many of the cars fitted with a “defeat device” to cheat emissions tests, but some could require new injectors and catalysers. Temporary workshops could be set up to deal with complex cases. In a further blow to the crisis-hit German company, the influential US Senate finance committee said on Wednesday it was investigating whether VW used the defeat devices to benefit from $50m (£33m) of tax credits on diesel cars sold in the US. VW and the buyers of its diesel cars benefited from more than $50m in subsidies in the belief the vehicles caused less pollution then they actually did.  In a letter sent to VW, Orrin Hatch, chairman of the committee, said the use of the defeat devices to manipulate tests means the company may have made false representations to the US government in securing the tax incentives. Meanwhile, VW has confirmed it has appointed Hans Dieter Pötsch, its former finance director, as chairman of the supervisory board – despite calls from stakeholders for an external figure to be appointed chairman. The company was due to submit its plan to fix vehicles involved in the scandal to regulators in Germany on Wednesday. However, VW motorists remain in the dark about what will happen to their cars. Bozena Michalowska-Howells at law firm Leigh Day, which is representing more than 1,200 VW drivers considering legal action against the company, said the carmaker needed to explain exactly how it would repair the vehicles. “The way in which this is being handled by Volkswagen is staggering. Rather than responding to very serious concerns from their customers, they are providing the minimal information,” she said. “The latest lamentable statement, given to a German newspaper, does reveal that some customers will need serious interventions to parts of their vehicle. Which cars and what interventions? “How will anyone be able to buy or sell an affected car without knowing this essential information?” Müller told the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung that scandal was the result of the actions of a few employees and that Martin Winterkorn, the former chief executive, did not know the company was rigging emissions tests. Four members of staff have been suspended, three of whom were senior managers responsible for engine development, Müller added. On the fate of affected vehicles, he said: “If all goes according to plan, we can start the recall in January. All the cars should be fixed by the end of 2016.” VW will face further scrutiny on Thursday when Michael Horn, its US boss, appears in front of the energy and commerce committee in Congress. Horn has written to VW’s customers in the US, where the scandal began, to apologise and warn them that it will take “some time” to resolve the issue. On Monday the UK boss of VW will appear in front of Britain’s transport select committee. Paul Willis will be questioned along with Patrick McLoughlin, the transport secretary, and Mike Hawes, head of the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders, the industry trade body. VW has put aside €6.5bn (£4.8bn) to meet the cost of recalling the cars and fixing them so they meet environmental standards. It also faces a fine of up to $18bn from US regulators as well as legal claims from customers and shareholders. Müller has told staff the fallout from the diesel emissions scandal “won’t be painless” and that the company needs to make massive savings as it faces the prospect of a multibillion-euro bill. “It [the €6.5bn] includes the estimated cost to fix the affected vehicles. But it won’t be enough,” he told them at VW’s headquarters in Wolfsburg, Germany. “We must prepare for significant penalties, and many could take the events as an opportunity to claim damages against Volkswagen. “That is why we have initiated a further critical review of all planned investments. Anything that is not absolutely necessary will be cancelled or postponed, and it is why we will be intensifying the efficiency programme. To be perfectly frank: this will not be a painless process.”"

"Des milliers de militants ont annoncé qu’ils allaient bloquer la conférence internationale de Paris sur le climat en menant des actions directes non-violentes à une échelle sans précédent en Europe. Des ONG allant de 350.org à Attac France pèsent de tout leur poids pour donner de l’importance aux « Jeux Climatiques » face à la conférence intergouvernementale qui se déroulera en décembre. Les manifestations consisteront en dix blocages, chacun lié à un thème et une « ligne rouge » dont ils ont peur que les négociateurs venus de presque 200 pays ne la franchissent. Les gouvernements se réunissent à Paris dans l’espoir de parvenir à un accord sur les actions à mener sur le changement climatique pour l’après-2020. Les militants ont finalement abandonné l’idée d’empêcher les délégués de quitter la table de négociations avant de se mettre d’accord sur un objectif de réduction des émissions à la hauteur de leurs attentes. « Les lignes rouges représentent un juste milieu entre ‘fermez tout’ et ‘faites votre job’, », dit l’écrivaine et activiste Naomi Klein au Guardian. « Je pense que ce serait déjà bien qu’on arrive à influencer le discours, ce qui aura une importance capitale si les gouvernements essaient de présenter un mauvais compromis comme un succès. » Le dernier jour du sommet – le 11 ou le 12 décembre – des milliers de personnes sont attendues autour du Bourget avec des lignes rouges gonflables, explique l’artiste John Jordan, un des leaders du laboratoire de l’imagination insurrectionnelle. « L’idée, ce n’est pas d’enfermer les délégués mais d’avoir des actes de désobéissance civile qui bloquent les rues et les infrastructures, s’ils franchissent les lignes rouges qui représentent le minimum nécessaire pour une planète viable. » Les protestataires peuvent choisir la ligne rouge qui leur tient à cœur, de la finance climatique équitable pour les pays les plus pauvres à la réduction significative des émissions. A ces barrages, des débats auront lieu sur de nouvelles actions à entreprendre en 2016 dans le but d’assurer que les combustibles fossiles resteront enfouis dans le sol. « Ce sera la plus grande action de désobéissance civile sur la justice climatique de l’histoire européenne », s’enthousiasme Prayal Parekh, militante du 350.org. « On est tout excités et on veut en recoudre. Ce sera animé ». Juliette Rousseau, porte-parole de Coalition Climat 21 ajoute : « C’est la première fois qu’on a en France une alliance aussi large – plus de 130 membres – qui soutient des actions et des tactiques aussi diversifiées, des manifestations aux actes de désobéissance. » Une marche, dont les ONG voudraient faire un grand évènement, va donner le coup d’envoi aux démonstrations au moment de l’arrivée des dirigeants au sommet, le 29 novembre. Les organisateurs de la manifestation veulent renouer avec le succès de la People’s Climate March, à New York, qui avait attiré 300 000 personnes l’année dernière. Ce sont les principales organisations pour l’environnement comme Greenpeace et le WWF avec les militants Internet d’Avaaz, des syndicats et des groupes religieux qui sont à l’origine de l’initiative. Ensuite, les « Jeux Climatiques » vont débuter. Les partisans de la lutte contre le changement climatique peuvent s’inscrire dans des équipes de manière anonyme, sur les deux semaines, télécharger des objectifs pour des actions directes non-violentes ou mettre en ligne des cartes pour permettre aux autres de participer. Au cours du sommet, les Jeux devraient progressivement s’intensifier avec un mélange de protestations, de street art, d’actions ayant pour but d’attirer l’attention et de hacking. « Nous sommes bien évidemment en contact avec les Anonymous », précise un militant. « Je sais que [des militants des ‘Jeux Climatiques’] se sont entretenus avec eux mais je ne sais pas si des initiatives concrètes sont déjà prévues. » Pour donner un avant-goût, Attac France a commencé à « faucher » 196 chaises dans les agences des banques les plus implantées dans les paradis fiscaux (une par pays participant aux négociations sur le climat) pour attirer l’attention sur les fonds climatiques que l’on pourrait potentiellement mettre en place si l’évasion fiscale était sanctionnée. Une conférence du monde des affaires — Solutions COP21, dont les partenaires incluent Engie (autrefois GDF Suez), Renault Nissan, Suez Environnement et L’Oréal – devrait également être en ligne de mire. Dans un document interne de “consensus sur les actions à mener” échafaudé par les partisans de la lutte contre le réchauffement de la planète et par les syndicats, que le Guardian a pu se procurer, les parties s’engagent à s’opposer à tout débordement « réactionnaire, nationaliste ou violent ». Parekh explique que l’action non-violente est vitale. « Je suis indienne et c’est à travers la désobéissance civile que mon pays a obtenu son indépendance », dit-elle. « Nous sommes à un tournant qui nous permettra de nous désengager des énergies fossiles et de rendre nos sociétés plus équitables. Je voudrais saisir cette opportunité. Je ne veux plus lire que l’on a battu le nouveau record de l’été le plus chaud jamais enregistré ou qu’une île a encore disparu dans le Pacifique. » • Traduction: Frédéric Schneider/VoxEurop"

"Compared with the unruly Republican pack, the Democratic presidential field can seem tame, with relatively few candidates, a strong frontrunner and zero candidates coming off careers in casinos, computers or neurosurgery. And yet the debut debate among the Democrats scheduled for Tuesday night promises plenty of colorful clashes, whether that means Bernie Sanders implicitly accusing Hillary Clinton of being a fake working-class hero, or Clinton accusing Sanders of turning a blind eye on guns, or all five candidates grappling with questions about Black Lives Matter, climate change or the Trans-Pacific Partnership. It’s worth noting that between them, the Democratic candidates have participated in 21 televised presidential debates in the past – with Clinton accounting for all 21. Her four challengers will be doing this for the first time.  Tuesday night’s host, Anderson Cooper of CNN, has promised a series of pointed questions on bedrock policy issues. Unlike the top-tier Republicans, the Democrats – former secretary of state Hillary Clinton, senator Bernie Sanders, former governor Martin O’Malley, former senator Jim Webb and former governor Lincoln Chafee – may actually have time to answer some of the questions in-depth.  Here’s a preview of some of the points of friction and fun to look out for. While global trade deals may not seem like the stuff of sexy television (and yes, the debates are also about ratings), CNN would do well to get in a question early on about TPP, because the unratified trade agreement is both an important area of policy disagreement, and an intersection for a lot of the undercurrents that make the Democratic race viscerally interesting. Core Democratic voters – workers, unions, some in industry – oppose the deal, saying it will depress wages and lure manufacturing abroad. Clinton buckled to this pressure just last week, saying that she could not support TPP in its final version – in spite of having called it “the gold standard in trade agreements” in 2012. Sanders, meanwhile, has always opposed TPP, as vehemently as he opposed the North American Free Trade Agreement (Nafta). In an October 1993 editorial titled Why I oppose Nafta, he said the deal would exacerbate economic inequality and “only benefit the ruling elites of the United States, Mexico and Canada”.  Clinton supported Nafta before she opposed it.  The TPP debate, then, could be a good opening for Sanders to spotlight his consistency on policy – billed by supporters as a major selling point – and to accuse Clinton of a lack of the same. Host network CNN has already worked to document Clinton’s TPP flip-flop, including in the recent piece 45 times Secretary Clinton pushed the trade bill she now opposes. Because Clinton is still the prohibitive frontrunner in the Democratic race, her rivals may use the debate to challenge her fitness as a standard-bearer for the left. One way to make the point is by listing issues she has switched sides on. The list is longer than Nafta and TPP. Clinton will be the only candidate onstage Tuesday who ever supported the invasion of Iraq. Even Lincoln Chafee, who was a Republican in the Senate when the 2002 war vote came up, voted against it (he was the only Republican senator to do so). While Clinton supported the 1996 Defense of Marriage Act, which defined marriage as between a man and a woman, Sanders, then in the House of Representatives, voted against the bill and called for an end to discrimination based on sexuality. As governors, both O’Malley and Chafee signed same-sex marriage into law the same year, 2013, that Clinton finally came out in favor of it.  Clinton has been a relatively muted critic of income and wealth inequality in the United States, which for Sanders has been a lifelong bugbear. In the Senate, she voted in favor of the 2008 Troubled Asset Relief Program (Tarp), which set aside $700bn in part to bail out big banks. Sanders voted no, with considerable passion.  With multiple mass shootings having already occurred since the last headline mass shooting, and substantive disagreement among the candidates on guns, debate may actually break out on this issue. It’s one of the few issues on which Clinton runs to the left of Sanders, who hails from a rural, gun-friendly state and who voted against the Brady Handgun Violence Prevention Act of 1993 and in favor of allowing guns on Amtrak trains. He has supported assault weapons bans. Clinton, meanwhile, has stepped up her anti-gun rhetoric, saying: “We have to take on the gun lobby.” Last week she unveiled a series of proposals aimed at reducing US gun violence, including universal background checks, rolling back legal immunity for the gun industry, and legislation to keep firearms out of the hands of domestic abusers. Bookend positions on the issue are held down, meanwhile, by O’Malley and Webb. Webb, a decorated Vietnam veteran and former secretary of the navy, argued in the Senate against any restrictions on access to guns. He meant it: in 2007, an aide was charged with trying to carry a loaded pistol and ammunition into a Senate building.  On the other end of the shelf, O’Malley put in place an assault weapons ban as mayor of Baltimore, and as governor of Maryland he signed some of the country’s most restrictive gun laws. Americans are unhappy with the president’s performance on foreign policy, rating Obama at minus-14 approval on the issue in polling averages. One question for Clinton, his former secretary of state, is how much that number will stick to her. Clinton has been distancing herself from the administration’s Syria policy, writing in her 2014 memoir Hard Choices that she had urged Obama to arm the Syrian rebels much earlier, but that she was overruled. More recently, she has supported the establishment of a no-fly zone in Syria, prompting Obama to observe: “There’s a difference between running for president and being president.” Clinton’s Democratic rivals disagree with her in various ways. Both Webb, a vehement critic of the Iraq war, and Sanders oppose a no-fly zone for Syria, and in general are more leery of deepening US entanglements in the region. O’Malley on Friday said that the rise of Isis in Syria and Iraq had been an accidental result of a “mindless rush to war” in Iraq – a rush Clinton abetted. Both O’Malley and Sanders have strong records of supporting action to combat climate change, while Clinton has been playing catch-up, as a greater share of the public identifies the issue as urgent. The League of Conservation Voters gives Sanders a 95% lifetime rating, compared with 82% for Clinton, 81% for Webb and 78% for Chafee. Bill McKibben, the environmentalist, author and founder of 350.org, told the Guardian back in April that Clinton had failed to lead the US to a deal at the 2009 United Nations Climate Change conference, and he contrasted her record unfavorably with that of Sanders, who co-sponsored a 2007 act to curb carbon emissions. “Let’s hope she either steps up her game, or one of the other contenders becomes a reality,” McKibben said. “Bernie Sanders, for one, has been about the climate’s best friend in the Senate.” In a New Yorker profile published earlier this month, Sanders said he had failed as a candidate in his response to the Black Lives Matter movement. “I plead guilty – I should have been more sensitive at the beginning of this campaign to talk about this issue,” Sanders was quoted as saying. The cynic could read the apology as a rare gesture of deference by Sanders to the hard realities of electoral math. While a strong showing among educated white voters makes Sanders look competitive in early states including Iowa and New Hampshire, he remains largely unknown among African American voters in the south. In August, Gallup measured Clinton’s favorability among African Americans nationally at 80%. In the same poll, Sanders posted a 23% favorable rating – and only a 33% familiarity rating. Calls for systemic reform to a criminal justice system that disproportionately punishes African American and minority offenders, meanwhile, have most vociferously been made not by Clinton or by Sanders, but by Webb. For decades, Webb has argued that the US puts too many people in prison, and for the wrong reasons. As a senator in 2009, Webb pushed for an 18-month, top-to-bottom review of the entire criminal justice system. “The goal of this legislation,” he wrote, “is nothing less than a complete restructuring of the criminal justice system in the United States.” US immigration policy is another issue on which Clinton has sought to create distance between herself and the Obama administration, which, she has pointed out, has been aggressive in its enforcement of deportations policy, although it makes headlines for suspending some deportations. “I will not be deporting parents,” Clinton told Telemundo last week. “I will not be breaking up families. I will not be doing what we’ve seen too much of, which is trying to, you know, make immigrants the scapegoat for everything that people are concerned about in the country.” It’s also an issue on which Clinton does not come under much pressure from Sanders, who hails from a state where the immigration debate is not particularly active and who has spoken relatively little on the issue so far on the campaign trail. Last week he echoed Clinton’s call for keeping families together, and said that he would provide a path to citizenship for undocumented immigrants currently living in the US. As with guns, meanwhile, O’Malley has led the field in calling for immigration reform, supporting driver’s licenses for undocumented migrants as governor and presenting a plan in July calling for a drastic reduction in immigrant detentions and for the closure of “inhumane” immigration facilities.  “My end goal is to get 11 million people out of the shadow economy and the shadow society and into the light of full participation,” O’Malley said, “to be more fully included in the economic, political and social life of our country.” "

"Exploring new stretches of the galaxy brought Nasa scientist William Borucki back to Earth. Borucki, 76, retired in July as the principal investigator of Nasa’s Kepler Mission, an unmanned spacecraft that has been surveying a portion of the Milky Way for habitable planets since March 2009. The mission has discovered more than 1,000 confirmed planets and inspired many to think about what, if any, life is out there.  But Borucki said it also made him reconsider life on Earth – and its fate in light of climate change.  “The Earth is a very special place,” Borucki said in an interview with the Huffington Post recently. “Unless we have the wisdom and technology to protect our biosphere, it could become like many other dead worlds.” Borucki, who began his career at Nasa in 1962 working on the Apollo mission, was presented with the prestigious Shaw prize for Astronomy on 24 September in Hong Kong. He is giving a $100,000 portion of his prize money to the science and environmental advocacy group Union of Concerned Scientists to help with climate work. “There must be an enormous number of small planets roughly Earth size, in the habitable zone of the stars – billions or tens of billions of such planets,” said Borucki. If there were life there, one would assume it would evolve into organisms of higher intelligence capable of communication. Yet we haven’t heard from them, and there’s no evidence of other life forms visiting Earth. Borucki said that forces us to ask why not.  “It’s not a silly question anymore,” he said. “You used to be able to dismiss it – say there aren’t any planets, or they aren’t in the habitable zone. That’s not true anymore. We know there are habitable planets. The question that is really important is what happened to them?” One potential scenario Borucki raises: “Could that mean that other civilizations did not recognize the critical importance of maintaining a hospitable climate?” That prospect concerns him. “It really warns us that we need to think very, very carefully about how we protect our biosphere, how to protect our climate,” he said. “It wouldn’t take a lot of change to make the planet uninhabitable for ourselves. “Climate change causes the oceans to change. Climate change causes the temperatures to change. All these things dramatically affect the biosphere,” he said. “So it really worries me to see people – to see ourselves – who really don’t fully understand what we’re doing and the complexities of the system, changing it in such a drastic fashion.” I asked Boruki whether the explorations had led him to believe there’s potential for human life on another planet – an idea raised often in science fiction. “No,” he said. “The possibility of being able to send people, particularly a large number of people, to settle another planet orbiting another star seems extremely small.” Borucki’s earlier research contributed to improved understanding of the ozone layer, and of how human activity could cause its depletion. In the case of ozone, scientific research helped motivate world leaders to take political action to reverse the trend, leading to the signing of the Montreal Protocol in 1987 and subsequent updates. When it comes to climate change, which leaders have been slower to address, Borucki acknowledges that the “required changes are much more extensive in affecting changes in industry and livelihoods”. Yet, he said he remains optimistic: “We must not get discouraged because it takes such a long time for a consensus to occur among world leaders and for the development of practical methods to accomplish the necessary changes. “Once mankind understands the threat, I think they will get together ultimately and conquer that threat,” he continued. “But they have to recognize it and really be dedicated to accomplishing the task, because the tasks are just enormous.”"

"From planning and building roads in the Horn of Africa to helping Filipino coconut farmers get more accurate weather forecasts, eight teams of experts have started tackling some of the world’s most intractable development challenges after winning up to $1m each from the global resilience challenge. The successful projects will look at building resilience – a buzzword gaining ever more traction as world leaders push towards the Paris summit on climate change, the final milestone in a critical year for development. The projects will take place among vulnerable communities in Bangladesh, India, Kenya, Mali, Nepal, Niger, Philippines and Uganda, among others.  The challenge is funded by the Global Resilience Partnership, a public-private initiative involving the Rockefeller Foundation, USAid and the Swedish International Development Cooperation Agency (Sida). The winners were selected from 500 applicants and announced in New York during the UN sustainable development summit. “We must better align humanitarian and development investments and thereby create a resilience dividend,” said Judith Rodin, president of the Rockefeller Foundation, when the winners were announced. “The eight winners … demonstrated how we can create multiple wins for individuals and communities when problems are clearly understood and when solutions respond not only to today’s realities, but build in flexibility to manage tomorrow’s unknowns.” Resilience refers to the ability of communities and households to endure stresses and shocks, and has long been edging its way to the centre of the global aid agenda. This year’s development landmarks – the adoption of the global goals that will set the agenda for the next 15 years, and the forthcoming climate summit in Paris – focus attention on just how closely the development and environmental schedules are linked, further increasing the profile of resilience. Sundaa Bridgett-Jones, the Rockefeller Foundation’s associate director of international development, says the challenge aims to replicate the success of international partnerships like Gavi, the vaccine alliance, to harness learning and develop projects that can become viable investment opportunities. “This is really grounded in the idea of a paradigm shift in how the global community not just responds to but also understands the shocks and stresses that we have today and also the uncertainty of tomorrow,” she said. “Here we have a set of resilience-based innovations, potentially investable projects that are really focused on helping some of the most marginalised people across the Sahel, the Horn of Africa and south and south-east Asia.” The winners include 68 professionals from different specialised fields. Half of the teams are led by women.  A group from Trans-African HydroMeteorological Observatory will work with mobile phone operators and Uganda’s national meteorological authority in the cattle corridor around Lake Victoria to provide low cost, on-demand access to weather alerts. Another project, MetaMeta Research, involves government authorities, water and climate experts and roadside communities working together to plan and build roads, improve guidelines on the harvesting of rainwater, prevent soil erosion and enhance the use of roadside land in the Horn of Africa. The Grameen Foundation was also named as a winner for its project to build resilience among coconut famers in the Philippines by using mobile technology to provide the farmers with real-time climate data as part of an insurance financing pilot to help them cope with losses caused by extreme weather. The other project winners were Mahila Housing SEWA Trust, which works with women in slums in south Asia; Groundswell International, which seeks to help communities in the Sahel’s fragile drylands; MercyCorps, for projects in Mali, Niger and the Horn of Africa; and a team from the University of Sydney that will work to help people with disabilities in disaster-prone regions. “The partnership is about locally driven, high-impact solutions and approaches that really help to bring together a number of things outlined in the global goals: how do we build local community resilience in health and sanitation and nutrition; how do we think about women and girls’ empowerment, how do we consider where we are in terms of planetary boundaries,” said Bridgett-Jones. Charlotte Petri Gornitzka, Sida’s director general, said the Global Resilience Partnership aimed to capitalise on the partners’ different strengths, but also to harness the power of local knowledge and capability. “Sometimes we run the risk, when we partner at headquarter level, of imposing solutions on countries … and we might run the risk of reaching out [only] to the people we know,” she said. “This is the opposite. This is an opportunity to build from the ground and to be directed by those who are closest to the problem.” The partnership has $160m (£104m) in contributions, including a recent $10m commitment from Zurich Insurance Group, and Petri Gornitzka said she expected more insurers to join the initiative.  Such public-private partnerships – sometimes described as blended finance – are being promoted by many development agencies as a way to find the trillions of dollars needed to fund the ambitious global goals agenda.  But some poverty campaigners worry that while these partnerships bring fresh capital to the table, they may also encourage governments to scale back aid finance, relying instead on private entities whose main priority is profit. Bridgett-Jones says the partnership structure allows the foundation to share its focus on innovation, flexibility and resilience while benefiting from the development agencies’ diplomatic alliances, resources and deep knowledge. She expected more private partners to join, noting that other businesses, including telecommunications, recognised the long-term value of building resilience.  “Frankly, there are some good investments that have commercial viability coming out of this work, and that will add not only to increasing the livelihoods of the people they want to serve, but help their own profit margins as well,” she said."

"The United Nations Nobel-winning climate science panel – the ultimate authority tracking the extent of global warming and its consequences for humanity – has a new leader after 13 years. In a vote in Dubrovnik on Tuesday, governments chose Hoesung Lee, the long-serving vice-chair of the climate panel, to replace Rajendra Pachauri, who was forced to step down after being accused of sexual harassment by a female employee at his research institute in India.  Pachauri, an engineer by training, denies the allegations.  He led the UN’s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change for 13 years, from the glory of a Nobel Prize to the embarrassment of having to acknowledge a serious mistake in one of its landmark reports. In a statement after the ballot, Lee said: “The IPCC remains deeply committed to providing policymakers with the highest quality scientific assessment of climate change, but we can do more.” Lee, 69, is a professor dealing with the economics of climate change, energy and sustainable development at Korea University’s Graduate School of Energy and Environment in the Republic of Korea. He is currently one of the IPCC’s three vice-chairs. The election of the new bureau, which will have 34 members including the chair, opens the way for work to start on the IPCC’s Sixth Assessment Report, expected to be completed in five to seven years. The IPCC completed its Fifth Assessment Report (AR5) in November 2014.  The key findings of the AR5 Synthesis Report are:  Lee takes over the UN climate science panel ahead of a critical meeting in Paris in December, which will seek to limit warming to two degrees celsius. Two degrees celsius is the internationally agreed limit for catastrophic climate change – a figure determined in part by the deliberations of the UN’s climate science panel, in a massive volunteer scientific undertaking. The IPCC is charged with producing blockbuster three-volume reports about climate change, its effects on humanity and the natural world, and potential solutions.  The reports, compiled by fleets of international experts all working on a volunteer basis, are seen as the gold standard of climate science. They are meant to provide the evidence to guide governments in finding answers to climate change. Lee, a US-trained economist, beat out five other candidates – all men. His closest rival was Jean-Pascal van Ypersele, a fellow IPCC vice-chair from Belgium who had said he would lobby governments for more funds. Chris Field of Stanford University and Thomas Stocker of the University of Bern, who are both considered leading experts on climate science, also stood for the post. The chairs of the IPCC are chosen by a secret ballot among more than 190 countries, in a process where diplomatic jockeying counts as much as scientific expertise. In a campaign statement, Lee said he would continue the IPCC’s course of collecting and reviewing previously published climate science.  The IPCC has been criticised for falling behind developments in the rapidly expanding fields of climate science, and consistently underestimating the speed and consequences of warming. The UN climate body has also been criticised for lacking transparency. Some scientists have proposed that the UN climate panel move towards more targeted reports that could guide governments in the near term. Lee, in his campaign statements, was non-committal about expanding the IPCC’s role. But he said he wanted to increase the participation of experts from developing countries, and devote more resources to studying the effects of climate change on global poverty. The new IPCC chair also said he wanted to ensure that industrial and financial leaders – and not just governments – were drawing on the UN panel’s reports. “I will pay special attention to climate change issues associated with job creation, health, innovation and technology development, energy access and poverty alleviation,” Lee said in his campaign statement. Lee’s election marks the first change of leadership at the IPCC in 13 years. Pachauri was elected unchallenged for a second term in 2008, after the IPCC picked up a Nobel peace prize. Two years later, the IPCC was badly shaken by his handling of an error in its 2008 report, which made the false claim that Himalayan glaciers could melt away entirely by 2035. Pachauri had been due to step down this year, but was forced to leave early because of harassment allegations."

"The world’s biggest mining company has spent £37m a year on climate change since 2007, and is confident of doubling its profits by 2030 despite the possibility of stringent new controls on greenhouse gas emissions. BHP Billiton said on Tuesday that efforts to forge a new global agreement on climate change, at UN talks scheduled for Paris this December, would not harm its future profits, and anticipated continuing to mine for coal for decades to come.  The company made profits of nearly $14bn in the year to 30 June, 2014, but profits tumbled to nearly $2bn this year on the back of declining demand for key commodities. BHP produces a variety of commodities, including copper, iron ore, coal and gas. At Paris, governments are hoping to sign a deal that would go some way to limiting global warming to no more than 2C above pre-industrial levels, which scientists say is the limit of safety, beyond which the effects of warming are likely to become catastrophic and irreversible. Current pledges from governments on emissions cuts are unlikely to meet this goal, but they will require substantial reductions in future emissions, from both developed and developing countries. BHP said its future planning involved “a range of scenarios”, including a 2C world, but also allowing for much greater levels of warming. The company predicted, in a report entitled Climate Change: Portfolio Analysis, that its assets would be largely unaffected by the changes to emissions levels. “BHP Billiton’s high-quality, low-cost energy coal assets have strong margins and therefore remain attractive despite the reduced demand,” the report found. One of the key technologies identified by the company in allowing the world to continue to burn coal is carbon capture and storage (CCS), a technique by which carbon dioxide is captured at source - chiefly coal-fired power stations - and then piped underground into caverns for long-term storage. Though the technology has been mooted for more than a decade, there has not yet been demonstration of it at a large scale, and several attempted projects have foundered. BHP’s chief commercial officer, Dean Dalla Valle, was unable to say how much funding the company had put into CCS development, out of the £37m devoted to low-carbon efforts. BHP also declined to make commitments on how much of its profits would be diverted into low-carbon technologies in future. The company also intends to use “REDD+” – reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation – to offset its future carbon output, but has yet to purchase any such offsets. Guy Shrubsole, climate campaigner at Friends of the Earth, said: “Whilst any investment in tackling climate change is welcome, BHP Billiton needs to be fundamentally changing its business model to leave fossil fuels in the ground. No amount of spin can hide the fact that the company is one of the world’s largest producers of coal, and that its corporate irresponsibility is cooking the climate.”"

"The Mayor of Krakow has told the Guardian he will introduce a ban on coal use in households, offices, government buildings and restaurants after an amended Environmental Protection Act was signed by the country’s president, Andrzej Duda. Poland’s second largest city is as famed for the filthy smog that cakes its buildings and streets, as for its beautiful historic buildings. The European Environmental Agency has ranked it the third most polluted city in Europe and its particulate matter (PM) pollution can reach six times the safe levels.  Household stoves burning coal are responsible for an estimated 88% of the country’s non-industrial air pollution – and almost half of Krakow’s PM pollution. Under the new EPA signed on Tuesday, which was amended after a long-running battle with the courts, local authorities can now prohibit their use. “We will concentrate our efforts on introducing in Krakow a ban on the use of coal in individual furnaces and boiler rooms,” said Jacek Majchrowski, the city’s mayor. “It will speed up the process of removing the coal stoves and replacing them with eco-friendly heating systems.” Poland emits more greenhouses gases and sulphur dioxide from coal than any other European country, and also has the continent’s highest coal-related health costs, with around 45,000 premature deaths each year attributed to coal burning. The coal industry is a major Polish employer, seen as a guarantor of energy independence. The protection of its future has become a major issue in the 25 October elections, with the leading parties out-bidding each other in its defence.  The country’s prime minister, Ewa Kopacz, last week announced a plan to transfer publicly-owned stakes in coal companies such as PGE for use as collateral in their buy-out of TF Silesia, a highly unprofitable national coal firm.  “In that context the decision in Krakow gives hope,” the Liberal MEP Gerben-Jan Gerbrandy told the Guardian. “All of Poland’s political parties are unanimous about protecting coal consumption so when, at local level, people start questioning its use for health reasons, it might become a game changer in the national debate.” The Krakow council now says it will move ahead with plans for new district heating networks, and revamped public transit networks. Vehicle access to the city centre is being limited too, even though the national parliament rejected the introduction of low emissions zones in urban areas. Majchrowski said he would also urge the Małopolska regional authority to follow Krakow’s lead and adopt the ban on solid fuels in heating. “We are hoping that local authorities elsewhere will start fighting air pollution as vigorously as we do in Krakow,” he said. “This is a chance for a breakthrough in the fight for clean air in Poland,” said Ilona Jędrasik, a spokeswoman for the environmental law firm ClientEarth. “Now it is time for local authorities to make their next move.” Poland depends on coal for nearly 90% of its electricity, and its defence of the fuel has been an ongoing bugbear in European climate negotiations.

"A paper published in the journal Politics and Policy by Sondre Båtstrand at the University of Bergen in Norway compared the climate positions of conservative political parties around the world. Båtstrand examined the platforms or manifestos of the conservative parties from the USA, UK, Norway, Sweden, Spain, Canada, New Zealand, Australia, and Germany. He found that the US Republican Party stands alone in its rejection of the need to tackle climate change and efforts to become the party of climate supervillains. As Jonathan Chait wrote of Republican presidential candidate Jeb Bush’s proposals to eliminate all significant American national climate policies, In any other democracy in the world, a Jeb Bush would be an isolated loon, operating outside the major parties, perhaps carrying on at conferences with fellow cranks, but having no prospects of seeing his vision carried out in government. But the United States is different. Here in America, ideas like Bush’s fit comfortably within one of the two major political parties. Indeed, the greatest barrier to Bush claiming his party’s nomination is the quite possibly justified sense that he is too sober and moderate to suit the GOP. So, what’s different about the United States? One factor is the immensely profitable and politically influential fossil fuel industry. However, Canada and Australia serve as useful analogues. With Australian coal reserves and Canadian tar sands, fossil fuels account for a larger share of both countries’ economies. Nevertheless, Båtstrand noted, The [Republican] party seems to treat climate change as a non-issue ... this appears to be consistent with the U.S. national context as a country with large reserves of coal. Båtstrand also found that the emphasis on free market ideology is relatively strong in the Republican Party platform. However, the appropriate free market approach to climate change involves putting a price on the external costs of climate pollution. In fact, that’s why the President George H. W. Bush administration invented cap and trade as a free market alternative to government regulation of pollutants. So, free market ideology can’t explain the abnormal behavior of the Republican Party on climate change. The answer may lie in a combination of fossil fuel industry influence, and increasing, record levels of political polarization. As shown by the Washington Post’s Christopher Ingraham, the conservative ideology score of House Republicans is the highest it’s been in over 50 years. And as Nate Silver recently noted, The most conservative Republicans in the House 25 or 30 years ago would be among the most liberal members now The Republican Party is no longer the party of Reagan, who listened to scientists and signed an international agreement to curb pollution that was causing the hole in the ozone layer. Silver has also shown that when voting against Democrats, today’s Republican legislators are more united than at any time in the past century. And it’s clear from the language the Republican Party leaders use that they view climate change not as a scientific or critical risk management issue, but rather as a Democrat issue. Thus, Republican leaders simply can’t accept the need to address climate change, because that would put the on the same side of an issue as Democrats. However, it’s also becoming clear that during this rightward shift, Republican Party leaders are growing increasingly out of step with their own voters. President George W. Bush’s Secretary of State Colin Powell recently criticized the party leaders, saying, It should be obvious to party leaders that they cannot keep saying and doing the things that they were doing and hope to be successful in national-level election in the future, not just in 2016. A recent survey found that conservative Republicans support accelerating the growth of clean energy, and 54% accept that humans are contributing to climate change and support putting a price on carbon pollution. These poll results are consistent with previous surveys finding that while Republican voters generally don’t see climate change as a top priority, a majority of Republican voters support regulating carbon as a pollutant, and a plurality even support President Obama’s Clean Power Plan. Eleven House Republicans have recognized this problem, and have submitted a Resolution calling for action on climate change. So there are encouraging signs that some Republican thought leaders and policymakers are recognizing that their party leaders’ ideologically-driven rejection of the need to mitigate climate change risks is unsustainable. Every other conservative political party in the world recognizes it. Canada’s conservative party at least pays lip service to climate change despite an addiction to tar sands oil. Australia just replaced its climate-dubious prime minister Tony Abbott with climate realist Malcolm Turnbull, and even Abbott’s government had a climate ‘Direct Action Plan’, albeit an impotent plan. With the entire rest of the world in agreement about the need to tackle the threats posed by human-caused climate change, and with a rift forming in the Republican Party over the extreme stance of its leaders on this and other issues, it’s only a matter of time before we see an inevitable shift back towards moderation, realism, and real conservatism in the Republican Party position on climate change."
"Mark Carney, the governor of the Bank of England, has warned that climate change will lead to financial crises and falling living standards unless the world’s leading countries do more to ensure that their companies come clean about their current and future carbon emissions. In a speech to the insurance market Lloyd’s of London on Tuesday, Carney said insurers were heavily exposed to climate change risks and that time was running out to deal with global warming.  The governor said that proposals would probably be put to the G20 meeting in Turkey in November urging the world’s leading developed and developing countries to bring in tougher corporate disclosure standards so that investors could better judge climate change risks. “The challenges currently posed by climate change pale in significance compared with what might come,” Carney said. “The far-sighted amongst you are anticipating broader global impacts on property, migration and political stability, as well as food and water security. So why isn’t more being done to address it?” Carney added that there was a growing evidence of humans’ role in climate change, noting that since the 1980s the number of registered weather-related loss events had tripled. Inflation-adjusted losses for the insurance industry had increased five fold to $50bn (£33bn) a year. France will host the latest global attempt to combat climate change at a summit in December, and Carney added to the pressure for action by pointing to the threats to “financial resilience and longer-term prosperity. While there is still time to act, the window of opportunity is finite and shrinking”. The governor, who is chairman of the Financial Stability Board, the international body set up by the G20 in 2009 to monitor risks to the financial system, said losses would be higher than expected if recent weather events proved to be the new normal. “Climate change is the tragedy of the horizon. We don’t need an army of actuaries to tell us that the catastrophic impacts of climate change will be felt beyond the traditional horizons of most actors – imposing a cost on future generations that the current generation has no direct incentive to fix.  “The horizon for monetary policy extends out to two to three years. For financial stability it is a bit longer, but typically only to the outer boundaries of the credit cycle – about a decade. In other words, once climate change becomes a defining issue for financial stability, it may already be too late.” Carney said there were three ways in which climate change could affect financial stability: physical risks, such as claims from floods and storms; liability risks that could arise if those suffering climate change losses sought compensation from those they held responsible; and transition risks caused by the revaluation of assets caused by the adjustment to a lower-carbon economy. The governor said that global action to tackle climate change could have a profound impact on companies if their business models were challenged by the move away from fossil fuels.  “Take, for example, the International Panel on Climate Change’s estimate of a carbon budget that would likely limit global temperature rises to 2 degrees [centigrade] above pre-industrial levels. “That budget amounts to between a fifth and a third of the world’s proven reserves of oil, gas and coal. If that estimate is even approximately correct it would render the vast majority of reserves “stranded” – oil, gas and coal that will be literally unusable without expensive carbon-capture technology, which itself alters fossil fuel economics. “The exposure of UK investors, including insurance companies, to these shifts is potentially huge.” Carney said that, following a meeting in London last week, the FSB was “considering recommending to the G20 summit that more be done to develop consistent, comparable, reliable and clear disclosure around the carbon intensity of different assets”. One proposal, he added, was the creation of an industry-led group, a climate disclosure taskforce, to design and deliver a voluntary standard for disclosure by those companies that produce or emit carbon. “Companies would disclose not only what they are emitting today, but how they plan their transition to the net-zero world of the future. The G20 – whose member states account for around 85% of global emissions – has a unique ability to make this possible.”"
"The food chains of the world’s oceans are at risk of collapse due to the release of greenhouse gases, overfishing and localised pollution, a stark new analysis shows. A study of 632 published experiments of the world’s oceans, from tropical to arctic waters, spanning coral reefs and the open seas, found that climate change is whittling away the diversity and abundance of marine species.  The paper, published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, found there was “limited scope” for animals to deal with warming waters and acidification, with very few species escaping the negative impact of increasing carbon dioxide dissolution in the oceans. The world’s oceans absorb about a third of all the carbon dioxide emitted by the burning of fossil fuels. The ocean has warmed by about 1C since pre-industrial times, and the water increased to be 30% more acidic.  The acidification of the ocean, where the pH of water drops as it absorbs carbon dioxide, will make it hard for creatures such as coral, oysters and mussels to form the shells and structures that sustain them. Meanwhile, warming waters are changing the behaviour and habitat range of fish. The overarching analysis of these changes, led by the University of Adelaide, found that the amount of plankton will increase with warming water but this abundance of food will not translate to improved results higher up the food chain. “There is more food for small herbivores, such as fish, sea snails and shrimps, but because the warming has driven up metabolism rates the growth rate of these animals is decreasing,” said associate professor Ivan Nagelkerken of Adelaide University. “As there is less prey available, that means fewer opportunities for carnivores. There’s a cascading effect up the food chain. “Overall, we found there’s a decrease in species diversity and abundance irrespective of what ecosystem we are looking at. These are broad scale impacts, made worse when you combine the effect of warming with acidification.  “We are seeing an increase in hypoxia, which decreases the oxygen content in water, and also added stressors such as overfishing and direct pollution. These added pressures are taking away the opportunity for species to adapt to climate change.” The research adds to recent warnings over the state of the oceans, with the world experiencing the third global bleaching of coral reefs. Since 2014, a massive underwater heatwave, driven by climate change, has caused corals to lose their brilliance and die in every ocean. By the end of this year 38% of the world’s reefs will have been affected. About 5% will have died. Coral reefs make up just 0.1% of the ocean’s floor but nurture 25% of the world’s marine species. There are concerns that ecosystems such as Australia’s Great Barrier Reef, which has lost half its coral cover over the past 30 years, could be massively diminished by 2050 unless greenhouse gas emissions are slashed and localised pollution is curbed. Meanwhile, warming of the oceans is causing water to thermally expand, fuelling sea level rises caused by melting land ice. Research released in the US on Monday found that Antarctic ice is melting so fast that the whole continent could be at risk by 2100, with severe consequences for coastal communities.  Problems in the ocean’s food chains will be a direct concern for hundreds of millions of people who rely upon seafood for sustenance, medicines and income. The loss of coral reefs could also worsen coastal erosion due to their role in protecting shorelines from storms and cyclones. “These effects are happening now and will only be exacerbated in the next 50 to 100 years,” Nagelkerken said. “We are already seeing strange things such as the invasion of tropical species into temperate waters off south-eastern Australia. But if we reduce additional stressors such as overfishing and pollution, we can give species a better chance to adapt to climate change.”"
" At least 10 million of the world’s poorest people are set to go hungry this year because of failing crops caused by one of the strongest El Niño climatic events on record, Oxfam has warned.  The charity said several countries were already facing a “major emergency”, such as Ethiopia, where 4.5 million are in need of food aid because of a prolonged scarcity of rain this year. Floods, followed by drought, have slashed Malawi’s maize production by more than a quarter, farmers in central America have suffered from two years of drought and El Niño conditions have already reduced the Asian monsoon over India, potentially triggering a wider drought across the east of the continent. Indonesia’s government has declared drought in 34 of the country’s provinces because of El Niño, while 2 million people in Papua New Guinea have been affected by crops shrivelling in heat in some parts of the country and severe frosts in its highlands. El Niño is a periodic climatic phenomenon where waters of the eastern tropical Pacific warm, triggering a range of potential consequences for global weather. While parts of South America are typically doused in heavy rainfall, warmer, drought-like conditions are experienced in Australia, south-east Asia and southern Africa. The UK Met Office has predicted this year’s El Niño could be the strongest on record since 1950, warning that famine could grip west Africa. An Oxfam report, called Entering Uncharted Waters, states the El Niño will rival that of 1998, which caused droughts, floods and forest fires that resulted in 2,000 deaths and caused about $33bn in property damage. The report warns “major humanitarian emergencies” were possible without proper intervention, pointing out that failure to respond to drought has proved disastrous in recent years, such as 2011 when rains failed in the Horn of Africa and more than 260,000 people died. Dr Helen Szoke, the chief executive of Oxfam Australia, said the charity had already started work with communities, including in Papua New Guinea, in an attempt to stave off crop failures. “We are working with farmers in PNG to plant drought-resistant seeds and to help them with the collection of rainwater,” she said. “Vanuatu is another country where we are doing that work although, cruelly, they’ve already had a head start due to the repairing of water systems due to cyclone Pam. “Our staff in Zimbabwe and Malawi, for example, are expressing concern about the preparedness of the seasonal crop. People who rely on subsistence farming aren’t necessarily prepared for frosts or drought, which is when food security becomes an issue. “The poorer countries don’t have the systems in place and are much more vulnerable. Potentially millions of people will be affected by a lack of access to water and if food prices go up, the poor will miss out again.” El Niño-like conditions were expected last year but failed to materialise. The El Niño now brewing in the Pacific Ocean is expected to end in January but may, in the long term, become more frequent. Research published in Nature Climate Change last year predicted El Niño frequency could double because of climate change fuelled by the release of greenhouse gases. Last year was the warmest year globally on record, with 2015 and 2016 potentially set to cause this record to topple again. Szoke said the international community needed to ensure El Niño conditions weren’t replicated every year by changes to rainfall, extreme heat and cyclones caused by climate change. “We can’t keep just patching up communities,” she said. “We need a long-term vision for climate change. We need to reduce emissions, move away from old technologies and address this issue. We have an opportunity to do that in Paris [at UN climate talks] later this year.”"
"The World Bank has pledged to boost by up to $29bn the financial assistance pledged to poorer nations to cope with climate change, bringing closer the possibility of reaching a target of $100bn a year by 2020.  Jim Yong Kim, the president of the World Bank Group, said it could boost funding by a third, from 21% to 28%, in response to client demand. He spoke at a meeting of the World Bank and the IMF in Lima, Peru. “As we move closer to Paris countries have identified trillions of dollars of climate-related needs. The bank, with the support of our members, will respond ambitiously to this great challenge,” Kim said.  In 2014 rich countries and businesses provided close to two-thirds, nearly $62bn, of the “climate finance” which is part of the global climate change negotiations, before the Paris conference this December, according to the OECD.  Rachel Kyte, the World Bank’s special envoy for climate change, said the bank’s pledge coupled with commitments from Germany, France and the UK to double their climate finance and similar pledges from multilateral development banks in Asia, Europe and Africa meant the total pledges were “well on the way to $100bn”. “It’s a global investment plan for moving the world towards [limiting temperature rises to] two degrees which represent trillions of dollars of investment opportunity,” she told the Guardian.  But Oxfam estimates only $2 billion of the total is going to the countries hardest hit by extreme weather caused by climate change, in the form of adaptation grants. The charity’s climate change policy expert Isabel Kreisler said finance ministers should agree at least half of “public funding going towards the $100bn goal should be for adaptation”.  Most of the money is going to green energy investments such as climate-smart transport solutions, renewable energy and enhanced water security.  “We should now see climate finance as investment in the low carbon transition,” said Laurence Tubiana, the French ambassador for the COP21.  Finance ministers from the 20 countries most vulnerable to climate change, the V20, who held their inaugural meeting on Thursday, echoed calls to boost adaptation funding.  The countries range from Tuvalu, a Pacific island of 10,000 people, to Bangladesh and the Philippines."

"Camels pulling wooden carts loaded with coconuts plod down the main road amid speeding motorcycles, buses, rickshaws and cars. Farmers sit atop slow-moving oxcarts loaded with grasses and other cattle feed. In this region of central Gujarat, India, it appears that rural life has not changed for decades. But drive down a dirt road outside the village of Thamna, about an hour north of Anand, and the 21st century comes into view. Solar panels drive a water pump that irrigates the fields of farmer Raman Bhai Parmar, 65, who grows bananas, rice and wheat on seven acres of land. Parmar’s solar energy pump is one of the technologies being promoted by a new project designed to help rural Indians adapt to climate change. The project, run by the international NGO, the Consultative Group for International Agriculture Research programme on climate change, agriculture and food security (CCAFS), aims to create 1,000 so-called climate smart villages across six Indian states including Haryana, Punjab and Gujarat. Haryana and Punjab are known as the grain basket states of India, producing the majority of the country’s staple wheat and basmati rice for export to the Middle East and European markets. The pumping of groundwater for irrigation over the past thirty years has led to a spike in productivity and increased food security.  However, the region faces increases in temperature up to 5C by 2080 and wheat is particularly vulnerable to heat stress. A recent study by the Indian Agricultural Research Institute indicates that climate change may reduce wheat yields in India between 6% and 23% by 2050. Environmental problems such as depleting groundwater and variable rains – delayed monsoons and intense rainfall – limit yields. Indian farmers also typically use almost twice the amount of fertiliser needed, damaging soil, contaminating groundwater and adding to greenhouse gas emissions.  For rural communities in Haryana and Punjab the issue now is how to meet these new challenges, introduce more sustainable practices of farming and still increase yields and profits.  The pilot solar energy pump being used by Parmar is just one of the solutions promoted by the climate-smart villages project. In addition to energy, it provides a financial incentive for farmers to conserve water because they can sell energy back to the grid, thus helping to relieve stress on depleted aquifers. Last quarter Parmar, whose annual income from crops is roughly 65,000 rupees (£652), received a cheque for 7,500 rupees (£75) for producing solar energy.        “When you connect the solar pump to the grid and let the farmer use the energy they need for the pumping, and you give them the chance to sell the surplus solar power to the grid at an attractive price, then they will opt to do it,” says Tushaar Shah, senior fellow at the International Water Management Institute (IWMI) in Anand, which is working with CCAFS on the project. Shah says government subsidises had given farmers’ little incentive to limit their use of diesel-powered irrigation pumps. “The solar energy will give the farmers a crop that is worth up to 90,000 rupees (£900) a year. We think this will reverse the current incentive structure that has led to over-pumping. There are very few crops farmers grow that will give you that income,” he adds.    Crucially, the climate-smart technologies, like the solar pump, are now beginning to gain acceptance among village communities.  When Vikas Chaudhary, 34, of Taraori, Haryana, learned farming from his father, rains came predictably during the monsoon and agriculture was a safe bet. Groundwater was plentiful. Soils were rich. Now that’s all a gamble for Chaudhary, who farms 35 acres and grows rice and a small plot of maize in summer and wheat in winter to support his extended family of seven.  Chaudhary has adopted climate-smart interventions including laser-guided land leveling of his fields, which he says has conserved 20% of water resources in his fields and has increased his yields by 15% through greater precision in seeding, tillage and measuring the moisture of soils.  Chaudhary uses a handheld crop sensor called a Green Seeker to assess crop health, a mobile phone app helps him calculate how much fertiliser to apply throughout the growing season. He also avoids tilling his fields, which helps the soil retain moisture and leads to fewer costs and fewer greenhouse gas emissions. However, the cost of the machinery needed to plant the rotational crop amid stubble from the previous season is a barrier for small farmers, he says. Most prefer to plant on bare soil.  While climate unpredictability has made farming more difficult in the past decade, Chaudhary’s greatest challenge was to change the thinking of his father, who lives on the farm and remains involved in the decisions. “He is now fully impressed by climate-smart practices, and my vision is to change thinking of every farmer, especially young farmers, and how we can make agriculture more profitable,” said Chaudhary.

"Weather records were broken across Australia as the temperature reached 38 degrees in some parts of the country.  Bushfires burned in all states in an early start to the season with total fire bans declared in some areas because of the conditions. Victoria and South Australia both broke records for the hottest ever starts to October while in Sydney the temperature reached 37 degrees in the city and 38 degrees in the western suburbs, the highest temperature recorded in New South Wales on Monday. In South Australia, Adelaide recorded a temperature of 35.6 degrees, matching its record for the hottest day in the first week of October which was set in 1938.  In Victoria, Melbourne recorded a temperature of 32.8 degrees after Saturday broke records for the hottest start to October at 31.3 degrees. In Canberra it was the earliest date in October the city has been hotter than 30 degrees. It recorded 31.7 degrees. Forecaster for the Bureau of Meteorology, Katarina Kovacevic, said although it was “significantly warmer” than usual in Sydney it was not record breaking, but Tuesday was also forecast to reach 33 in the CBD and high 30s in the western suburbs. “[On Tuesday] the warm temperatures continue but on Wednesday we have a southerly change which will mean temperatures dropping drastically to about 23 degrees in city and 24 in the west,” she said. In Tasmania temperatures were forecast to be 30 degrees on Tuesday while up to 20 bushfires burn across the state. There is a total fire ban in place in the state with high winds also predicted in coming days. In Victoria more than 70 fires burned over the weekend and a high fire risk has been declared in central, north-central and south-west of the state. In north Queensland people near Townsville are being told to evacuate with fast moving fires at Hervey Range. People in Thornton Gap road have been told to enact their bushfire plan or leave if they do not have one."
"As Britain’s Conservative party holds its first conference as a majority government, it is worth reflecting that its record on international development has been impressive. One of New Labour’s great legacies was the prioritisation of aid but it was the Tories who claimed the momentous prize of reaching the historic commitment of spending 0.7% of the nation’s GNI on aid.  This achievement deserves plaudits and campaigners need to work now to ensure that it is a permanent feature of Britain’s DNA, as well as to press other countries, especially major economies like France and Germany, to live up to their obligations – as I have written previously, the idea that we will one day be able to reduce our global spending is fallacious.  But there is a flipside to this focus on aid – a serious risk of “aidwash”.  “Greenwash” is the word given to efforts by businesses to give the impression of being environmentally friendly and socially responsible while not fundamentally changing harmful core business practices. It generally expresses itself in charitable spending, basically aid projects, accompanied by lots of back-slapping.  It’s a far cry from what is ultimately needed: a new kind of business model enabling inclusive and sustainable growth. And the real danger of greenwash is that it (often deliberately) diverts attention from the fundamentals. And so it appears to be with UK aid. While the government basks in its 0.7% glory, it is staunchly opposing some of the basic steps that are needed to make a fairer world. Take the long struggle to change the way we help countries emerge from unsustainable and crippling debt. A historic vote at the UN last month finally called for new rules to guide sovereign debt restructuring – but the major creditors, including the UK, voted against. This is just the latest in a systematic attempt by the UK and a handful of other countries to delay necessary change.  Then there is the arms trade, one of the vilest blights on our chances of global progress, on which the present government appears to be over-relaxed. A UK government report released in June showed how hundreds of millions of pounds in loans have gone to the governments of countries like Indonesia and Saudi Arabia to enable them to buy UK arms.  Meanwhile, the government has made it easier to export arms to countries with poor human rights records, reversing legislation brought in by the previous administration. An economy in trouble is no excuse to roll back basic standards – the UK is still vastly rich compared with most other countries. Or take attempts to push forward global cooperation to make tax rules beneficial to the poorest countries. While the government has certainly bowed to pressure to support moves at the OECD to reduce tax avoidance, the impact on the poorest countries will be marginal, which is why almost all the world’s countries have been pushing for a new, truly global body to look at tax issues. But the UK not only opposed this obvious improvement in global governance, it pulled out all the old-fashioned tricks to prevent it happening, making growling phone calls to ambassadors and sending threatening emails to civil society leaders.  It is all very well to have intense policy debates, but when you find yourself adopting bullying tactics, you need to have a hard think about whether you are acting in the global interest.  And on aid itself, the excitement over reaching the target for the quantity of aid has allowed the government to resist pressure for the quality of aid to be improved as well. The push for country ownership enshrined for a decade in the Paris Agenda on Aid Effectiveness appears to have been forgotten in a push to put short-term results above all else. We need results, of course, but not at the expense of the long-term development of health and education systems.  All in all, the leadership being shown by the UK government on aid, in a difficult moment politically and economically, is remarkable, and to the immense credit of those involved, from the prime minister down.  But aid is only one of the many things that rich countries need to do to support international poverty reduction and sustainable development. The acclamation of the sustainable development goals last month only emphasises the range of measures required.  The UK government should be a leader in the next set of development finance challenges. Aidwash, while tempting, should be resisted.  As we approach December’s Paris conference, at which the future of the world’s climate will be in the balance, let us not allow the same approach to hold sway, whereby aidwashing promises of “climate finance” (which I have dubbed climate bribery) distract attention from the over-consumption that is the real issue at hand if we are going to keep our world safe.

"With Shell announcing its withdrawal from the Arctic, the effects of climate change on business performance are everywhere – and it’s time corporate leaders consider the implications for their organisation, or face the consequences. Business and environmental concerns are becoming the same. Those directors who ignore this risk not only damaging their organisations, but could face legal action holding them personally responsible for their negligence.  Accepted wisdom says that business’s short-term mindset and its need to make returns for shareholders make it ill-equipped to take on climate change, the greatest threat facing humanity. Maybe that was true. Now, not only is the environment changing but so is the financial landscape. Strategic-thinking CEOs know they cannot leave climate action to politicians or civil society.  Over a period of just ten days, Shell took a $7bn hit as it admitted it could not make the oil supply pay in the Arctic; Goldman Sachs announced that coal prices are unlikely ever to recover from their current slump; and Mars, Unilever, Kellogg, Nestlé and others wrote to world leaders calling for clear, science-based targets to drive down emissions. They warned that “drought, flooding and hotter growing conditions threaten the world’s food supply”. The biggest names in the business world are seeing climate change affect their bottom line and the rest will follow. Climate change is no longer an ethical issue that can be sidelined as a corporate social responsibility project. It has immediate material impact on the operations of businesses today and their planning for the future. Last week, the Bank of England governor, Mark Carney, delivered a stark warning to the insurance industry, detailing the varied risks global markets face as a result of climate change. He said there are an array of climate challenges faced by the financial community.  These include damage to physical assets from both climate change and the resulting extreme weather events, such as flooding and storms. “Transition risks” will accompany the unavoidable shift to a low-carbon economy, meaning formerly high-value commodities such as fossil fuels become hugely devalued. Finally, liability risks will result when people suffering the effects of climate change seek compensation from polluters. But these are not only threats to business. Ignoring the risks and opportunities presented by climate change could land chief executives and their advisors in court. If directors fail to manage the impact of climate change on their businesses, they could be found personally liable for losses incurred by their shareholders.  The most obvious liabilities for companies and their directors relate to physical loss or damage. The residents of Tuvalu in the Pacific and Kivalina in Alaska, whose homes are disappearing beneath rising waters, have both threatened challenges against polluters. Storm damage, such as that inflicted by hurricane Katrina, has also provided the basis for litigation against fossil fuel companies. The science linking extreme weather and climate change is gathering strength and many more such cases will surely follow.  Litigation will not stem only from physically affected parties but also those with a financial interest. Ocean acidification, shifting rainfall patterns and other effects of a changing climate will have implications for all major companies as their physical operations become affected. These environmental concerns are financial liabilities, and investors will look to litigation to recoup losses if they are mismanaged. Litigation could be brought not only against corporate entities, but also against the individuals steering them.  Company directors’ decisions now will affect the performance of their company in the future, and they could find themselves in court charged with breaching their director’s duties if they do not manage their company’s activities to achieve stability and resilience.  The Companies Act 2006 codifies directors’ duties in law for the first time. They must “promote the success of the company”, first by considering “the likely consequences of any decision in the long term”. Failing to plan for climate change is incompatible with this and other duties and leaves directors open to legal challenge.
