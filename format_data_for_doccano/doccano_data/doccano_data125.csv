"Many effects of global warming appear gradually but can cause sudden and devastating changes. A rise in sea levels is one; it makes estuaries and lagoons slightly more saline, which in the case of the Norfolk Broads, suddenly threatened a big attraction, angling. This is because tiny “golden” algae called Prymnesium parvum, which thrive in slightly saline or mineral rich water, can turn toxic, suffocating the fish by destroying their gills.  What exactly turns harmless algae into a large-scale menace is not fully understood but, in Norfolk and other places where changes in temperature and salinity have occurred, it has caused a series of calamities. In 2015, when a large toxic bloom occurred in Hickling Broad and Somerton, thousands of fish died and 700,000 were rescued by a joint effort between the Environment Agency and angling clubs. The rescue cost £40,000 but saved the fishery. Since about 40% of the income from the Broads derives from angling this represents a serious economic threat to the area as well as an environmental disaster. Before the Prymnesium outbreaks began, this area was one of the most important pike fisheries in Europe. Fortunately a solution to the problem has been found and, surprisingly, it is hydrogen peroxide, often used for bleaching hair. In dilute quantities, it is a way of adding oxygen to large bodies of water when fish are in distress. Scientists at the John Innes Centre in Norwich have discovered that slightly larger concentrations kill the algae but harm nothing else. "
"Overseas tourists have begun to doubt the value of a trip to the ailing Great Barrier Reef and it is getting increasingly difficult to “show people what they expect to see”, a dive operator has told a federal Senate inquiry. A Port Douglas operator, John Edmondson, said “last-chance tourism” was spurring on other visitors but there had been a “weird” lull in bookings this year after back-to-back mass bleaching events made dead coral an unavoidable sight on reef visits.  Edmondson told the environment and communications committee in Cairns on Tuesday that while experienced reef tourists still hailed the Great Barrier Reef as the world’s best coral expanse, it was “harder to get the coral and show people what they expect to see”. He said packages that cost the average family $800 for a day on the reef were becoming a harder sell, with “forward bookings definitely softer this year”. This was despite a favourable exchange rate and security concerns in other countries with reef destinations, he told the committee, which is running an inquiry into the impact of climate change on the marine environment. European reef visitors were routinely raising the issue of Australian government support for the Adani mine as a sign it was “going in the wrong direction” in its policy on climate change – the reef’s greatest threat, Edmondson said. The Queensland Liberal National senator Ian Macdonald asked Edmondson, who studied marine biology, whether he believed “like [former US president Barack] Obama” it was the last chance to see the reef. “It’s nearly the last chance,” Edmondson said. While visitors to the reef were still deeply impressed, “you’re getting a creeping increase of people that had a great day – but you can see there was a lot of dead coral”, he said. Asked by Macdonald if he deliberately took tourists to “dead coral places”, Edmondson said: “You can’t avoid dead coral. “I think what’s happening now is some people think it’s just not worth it because of what they’ve seen and read, and that’s offset by other people that know it’s only going to get worse, and see it now.” Edmondson’s business, Wavelength Reef Cruises, takes 22,000 people a year to see the reef, employs 20 people including marine biology graduates and takes $4.5m in revenue a year. It was “a fantastic business at the moment” but the “very poor trajectory” of the reef was a real concern and he had held back a $3m investment in a fourth boat, Edmondson said. “We’ve postponed our decision because with the current situation you just don’t want to be too exposed,” he said. Macdonald questioned why tourists were linking Adani to the state of the reef, saying: “I struggle to see the connection.” Edmondson said most travellers were “fairly wealthy, they’re mostly educated, they’re aware of what’s in the media” and those with knowledge of coral reefs understood the key threat to the reef was climate change. They saw support for the Adani mine as counter to moves towards a lower carbon economy, he said. “If you come from the UK or France or Holland, windmills are a more common thing, renewable energy, much more electric cars – are we deserving of their money as custodians of the reef?” Edmondson told Macdonald that “politically I’m basically a Liberal voter who gets frustrated that, [on] the right wing of the centre right of politics, basically environmental issues are pushed over to the other side”.  The broader public did not know what to believe about the reef amid “sensationalist” media coverage of the bleaching and responses from an industry that had left “real gap in advocacy for the reef” on climate change, he said. Tropical Tourism North Queensland had sent an email urging its dive operator members by email to provide a “tsunami” of good news stories to counter bad publicity. “The reality is that there’s been a very dramatic change and a shifting in baseline in a lot of areas,” Edmondson said. “You can still go out and have a fantastic day and the reef is still probably the best-managed reef in the world. “But it’s an expensive day. It’s $250 [a person] for most boats to go out to the reef and people have got a very high expectation. “To give them their value for money and give them a good product is getting harder and harder because it’s harder to get the coral and show people what they expect to see.”"
"A campaign to plant enough trees to offset Donald Trump’s climate policies is under way. Organisers hope to plant 10bn trees by 24 December 2017, with the last one being a Christmas tree planted in front of the White House. The organisers of Trump Forest are asking people to donate trees to make up for the 650m tonnes of CO2 that will be released into the atmosphere by 2025 if the president’s plans to backtrack on US climate commitments go ahead.   “Since Trump has taken office, we have seen him make attack after attack on initiatives designed to slow down manmade climate change. Trump has declared a war on a healthy climate for life on Earth so we are fighting back with an army of trees. The more trees that people put in the ground, and the quicker they do it, the faster we will offset Trump’s ignorance,” says glaciologist Daniel Price, a co-founder of the project. The figure of 650m tonnes – equivalent to the annual carbon footprint of 33 million Americans – is calculated from Trump’s decision to rollback the US 2015 Paris agreement pledge to lower emissions by at least 26% below 2005 levels by 2025.  The Obama administration’s clean power plan, which Trump has vowed to review, aimed to cut emissions from existing coal and gas-fired power plants and would have reduced carbon emissions by nearly 650m tonnes by 2025 – just under halfway to meeting the Paris pledge. Jeremy Woods, deputy director of environmental policy at Imperial College London, says the project’s calculations make sense, even if they are at the optimistic end of the scale. He says that trees – especially when they are growing as they use more carbon dioxide from the atmosphere – are a key component of removing CO2 from the air, and an important tool towards a sustainable climate future. “Overall, it’s a positive project. If you plant trees on one hectare of land, roughly the area of a football pitch, with one tree every 10 square metres, that’s 1,000 trees per hectare. With 100 ha per square kilometre, the 100,000 sq kms targeted by Trump Forest would plant 10m hectares with 10bn trees. “I would expect that many trees to take at least 300m tonnes of CO2 out of the air over the eight-year period, so 650m tonnes by 2025 is not outrageous if you take into account the growth of the trees is likely to be higher than my conservative assumptions used here.  “Projects like this demonstrate the importance of doing something now even if they can come across as glib,” says Woods. So far, the tree count stands at 342,000, from 1,242 donors who have invested £39,000 ($50,000). If the campaign is to succeed, they must plant enough trees to fill at least 104,659 sq km, the same size as the US state of Kentucky. (France is 643,801 sq km, England is 130,279 sq km and Ireland 84,421 sq km.) Despite the massive scale of planting needed, the campaigners believe it can be done. “It’s clearly a big challenge, but only recently the world record was broken when India put 66m trees in the ground in a day. If we all chip in, it is a completely realistic goal,” says Price. “In 30 years from now, when people look back on the Trump presidency as an attack on the planet and on rational thought, it would be pretty cool if the history books say his actions were negligible because the global community offset the administration’s additional emissions.” Woods is positive, but cautious. He says that reforestation initiatives are complicated to implement, and that it is difficult to make sure they are sustainably introduced into local communities.  “On balance, it’s a positive thing if it’s done well ... but we also need to remember that tree planting takes time and investment and so not all, in fact, very few, of the 10bn trees are likely to be planted within the next 5 years. The new forest has to be there in perpetuity if the carbon is to be kept out of the atmosphere. And you need to help food production and local communities. “My fear is that people may look at it and say this isn’t that big an area … all we have to do is plant trees on an area the size of Kentucky and the problem is solved, but it’s nothing like that. There’s no silver bullet,” he says. People can contribute in two ways to Trump Forest: either by buying trees from their preferred tree-planting organisation anywhere in the world and sending Trump Forest the receipt so they can count their pledge, or by donating directly to their partner, the Eden Reforestation Projects.  Donating through the Trump Forest website, $1 buys eight mangrove trees in Madagascar (they are hoping to have the credit card fee removed soon so $1 will buy 10 mangrove trees).  The organisers say they have tapped into a global sense of frustration with the president’s climate change policies. The project’s co-founder Adrien Taylor says he felt helpless and had to do something to compensate for Trump’s behaviour.  “Only a small percentage of the world’s population voted in Trump, but everyone, everywhere, pays the cost of his climate ignorance. He should be standing up and taking leadership in addressing what is the biggest collective challenge humanity has ever faced. But he’s not,” says Taylor. “People like Trump are spineless dinosaurs who have no place in politics in this century.”  Go to the Trump Forest website to find out how to donate to the campaign."
"A tropical storm that is on course to break the US record for the heaviest rainfall from a tropical system. Meteorologists say the 120cm-mark set in 1978 could be surpassed on Tuesday or Wednesday.  At least 14 people have died, tens of thousands have been evacuated and more have been stranded as catastrophic flooding has paralysed the home of the US oil industry and the fourth most populous city in the US. Almost certainly, according to a statement issued by the World Meteorological Organization on Tuesday. “Climate change means that when we do have an event like Harvey, the rainfall amounts are likely to be higher than they would have been otherwise,” the UN organisation’s spokeswoman Clare Nullis told a conference. Correct. Nobody is arguing that climate change caused the storm, but it is likely to have made it much worse. Warmer seas evaporate more quickly. Warmer air holds more water vapour. So, as temperatures rise around the world, the skies store more moisture and dump it more intensely. There is a proven link – known as the Clausius-Clapeyron equation – that shows that for every half a degree celsius in warming, there is about a 3% increase in atmospheric moisture content. It was a factor. The surface temperature in the Gulf of Mexico is currently more than half a degree celsius higher than the recent late summer average, which is in turn more than half a degree higher than 30 years ago, according to Michael Mann of Penn State University. As a result there was more potential for a deluge.  The US National Weather Service has had to introduce a new colour on its graphs to deal with the volume of precipitation. Harvey surpassed the previous US record for rainfall from a tropical system, as 49.2 inches was recorded at Mary’s Creek at Winding Road in Southeast Houston, at 9.20am on Tuesday. Yes, the storm surge was greater because sea levels have risen 20cm as a result of more than 100 years of human-related global warming. This has melted glaciers and thermally expanded the volume of seawater. The science here is more tentative, as is the possible link to global warming. Harvey’s wind speed rose by about 45mph in the 24 hours before it reached the coast, according to National Hurricane Center. Computer simulations at Massachusetts Institute of Technology have indicated that similarly rapid increases in storm speeds will be 10 to 20 times more likely to occur by the end of this century than they were during the 1900s as a result of rising greenhouse gas emissions. This is the single most important question posed by Harvey, according to Tim Palmer, Royal Society Research Professor at the University of Oxford. There is not yet a clear link between this and climate change. But scientists have observed a general slowdown of atmospheric summer circulation in the mid-latitudes as a result of strong warming in the Arctic. “This can make weather systems move less and stay longer in a given location – which can significantly enhance the impacts of rainfall extremes, just like we’re sadly witnessing in Houston,” noted Stefan Rahmstorf, a co-chair at the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research. Attribution is a relatively nascent science, but increasingly sophisticated computer models use temperature records, emission figures and recent data to calculate how the rise in greenhouse gases has increased the risk of a hotter world. Last year, researchers with World Weather Attribution and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration estimated that man-made emissions nearly doubled the odds of last year’s heavy rains in Louisiana. This summer, they found the heatwave that struck Portugal and Spain was 10 times more likely to have occurred due to global warming. Once the deluge in Texas abates, they may be able to crunch the numbers for Harvey. Not as yet. Trump previously called manmade climate change a myth invented by China. As president, he has announced the US will withdraw from the Paris agreement. On Twitter, his take on Harvey has been incredulity: “HISTORIC rainfall in Houston, and all over Texas. Floods are unprecedented, and more rain coming” and “Even experts have said they’ve never seen one like this!”"
"A painter who won a prestigious British portrait award sponsored by BP has donated part of his winnings to Greenpeace in protest at his art being used to promote the image of the multinational oil company. Henry Christian-Slane, an artist from New Zealand, won the BP young artist award at the National Portrait Gallery for a painting of his partner Gabi. The high profile prize, which was chosen out of 2,580 entries, came with £7,000 prize money, which was presented by BP’s chief executive Bob Dudley.  Christian-Slane, 26, said he was happy to receive the accolade but was not comfortable “about being part of BP’s PR strategy”. He said as a “symbolic act” of defiance he was donating £1,000 of the prize-money to Greenpeace projects that directly protested against BP’s extraction of fossil fuels from the ground.  “I hope this action will help keep the issue of BP’s role in climate change from being overshadowed by their contribution to the arts,” he said. “I was very uncomfortable with the idea that the portrait award was being used to improve BPs image. Big oil companies like BP have the power to prevent the fossil fuels in the ground from entering the atmosphere as greenhouse gases, and we need to keep pressure on them to accept this responsibility. The individual has a role to play in this.” Greenpeace and the alliance of campaign groups Art Not Oil have long protested against arts institutions accepting sponsorship from the oil giant, and previous protest actions have included climate activists spending 25 hours scrawling messages on the floor of the Tate’s Turbine Hall. Last year it was announced that BP’s sponsorship of the National Portrait Gallery portrait prize would continue for another five years, and the company announced it would invest £7.5m in other major cultural institutions such as the British Museum, Royal Opera House and Royal Shakespeare Company. The deals prompted an open letter of condemnation by figures such as Mark Rylance. Commenting on Christian-Slane’s gesture, Sara Ayech, oil campaigner for Greenpeace UK, thanked the artist for his his principled stand against “art’s co-option by the oil industry.”  She added: “Purchasing a dominant position in London’s cultural scene is starting to become a bit of a double-edged sword for BP. As Henry has demonstrated, not everyone can be bought, and while BP are maintaining their brand’s relationship with the city’s elites, they are also providing a platform for the environmental damage they do around the world to be exposed in front of their home audience.”"
"As the US comes to terms with its second major weather disaster within a month, an important question is whether the devastation caused by hurricanes Harvey and Irma will convince Donald Trump and his administration of the reality of climate change.  The president’s luxurious Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida may escape Irma’s wrath, but with the deaths of so many Americans, and billions of dollars in damage to homes and businesses, the costs of climate change denial are beginning to pile up at the door of the White House. Just days before Harvey formed in the Atlantic last month, Trump signed an executive order to overturn a policy, introduced by his predecessor Barack Obama, to help American communities and businesses become more resilient against the risks of flooding, which are rising because of climate change. But the merciless assault on the US mainland by Harvey and Irma should be forcing the president to recognise the consequences of his arrogance and complacency in dismissing the research and analysis carried out by scientists. The flooded streets of Houston and the wind-ravaged homes of south Florida bear the unmistakable fingerprint of extreme weather made worse by manmade greenhouse gas emissions. A hurricane is a huge, rotating cluster of thunderstorms that forms above a sea surface that has a temperature of at least 26.5C. It is like a giant engine, transferring heat from the sea surface up into the atmosphere and generating strong winds and heavy rain in the process. The Atlantic hurricane season officially runs from 1 June until 30 November, and typically produces 12 tropical storms, of which six reach hurricane strength – with sustained wind speeds of more than 73mph. There have been 11 storms so far this year, including six hurricanes. In early August, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration raised its prediction for the season to “above normal”, suggesting that the final tally could be up to 19 storms, with nine of them hurricanes. But this season has already been remarkable in one respect because two major hurricanes, with sustained winds of more than 110mph, have hit the US mainland, after a period of 12 years when none of the strongest storms made American landfall. Hurricane Irma has also set records for being the strongest hurricane to have occurred in the open Atlantic, and for having sustained wind speeds of at least 185mph over the longest period. Climate change cannot be blamed for the hurricane count in any single season, nor for the occurrence of any single storm, but there are three ways in which it is making the consequences worse. First, although the intensity of a hurricane depends on many factors, warmer seawater tends to promote stronger storms. Average sea surface temperatures have been rising, and some parts of the North Atlantic and Gulf of Mexico are warmer than average at the moment, which is a key reason why both Harvey and Irma became so strong so quickly. Second, a warmer atmosphere can hold more water vapour, which can result in heavier rainfall. That is true not only for hurricanes but also for weaker storms across the world. Even relatively mild tropical storms can cause great damage by dropping huge volumes of rain over one area. Third, apart from strong winds and heavy rainfall, hurricanes cause damage through storm surges as their winds push seawater ahead of them. Storm surges can inundate extensive low-lying coastal areas, sweeping away everything in their path. Sea levels have been gradually rising globally, making storm surges bigger and deadlier. Scientists are still not sure about the other ways in which climate change may be impacting hurricanes. The main reason Harvey created such extreme flooding around Houston was that it stalled over the city and dumped rain for several days without moving on. We do not know if climate change played a role in creating the atmospheric conditions that made that happen. Nor can we yet predict whether climate change will affect the number of hurricanes that occur every year. Some studies have suggested that while numbers will drop, strengths will increase. Also uncertain is how natural climate variability affects hurricanes. Numbers have increased markedly in the North Atlantic since the 1990s, but this seems to be due, at least partly, to large-scale changes in ocean circulation that occur over many years or decades. However, it is clear that the lives and livelihoods of millions of Americans will be at risk if Trump and his administration continue to deny the existence of climate change and its impact on the threat posed by hurricanes.

"We can’t stop looking at human faces. Can’t stop being interested in ourselves, our species. The BP Portrait Award, whose annual exhibition of winners and strong contenders can be seen at the National Portrait Gallery until 24 September, is full of humanity. It is, perhaps, the most humanist art prize in the world, an art award that specifically celebrates the painted human image and looks for modern heirs to the profoundly compassionate tradition of portraiture that includes Rembrandt, Velázquez and Lucian Freud.  Yet it may be time to get over ourselves. Has the moment come to put nature before portraiture, and abolish this oil-tainted oil painting prize?  Protests against BP, probably the world’s most reviled oil company since the Deepwater Horizon disaster in 2010, are regularly staged outside its annual prize giving ceremony. Now the pressure is being ramped up a notch.  For the first time, the Guardian has learned, a winning artist is rejecting part of BP’s prize money. Henry Christian-Slane, 26, from New Zealand, won this year’s BP young artist award, one of five prizes in the open submission contest. He’s donating £1,000 of the £7,000 he received to Greenpeace, to support “projects that aim to protest BPs further extraction of fossil fuels from the Earth”. Christian-Slane is not calling for the end of this art prize – that would be a bit hypocritical, having entered it – yet his gesture undoubtedly turns a harsh spotlight on the BP Portrait Award’s oil funding at a time when BP arts patronage is under attack. Tate’s relationship with the oil and gas extractor has ended (for non-climate related reasons, insists BP) and some say the writing could be on the wall for other arts organisations accepting its sponsorship.  I should probably declare an interest. I accepted an invitation to be on the BP Portrait Award jury a few years ago . I did not get paid anything, but I did have a nice dinner and happily sat on the judging panel of six with a voting BP representative. Since our arguments got quite heated, her vote mattered. It is sometimes argued that BP arts sponsorship is a fake publicity stunt that museums can easily do without – after a long relationship with Tate it turned out BP’s annual spend across its galleries averaged less than £250,000 – but if that is the rule, the BP Portrait Award may well be an exception. It isn’t so much the money – no doubt that is peanuts for BP – as the quirkiness and originality of this particular prize that makes the oil company’s involvement look almost – I hate to say this – idealistic.  Painted portraiture is, after all, not exactly a fashionable art form. None of the people who enter this prize are ever likely to be shortlisted for the more stylish Turner – I’ve judged that too and can attest that the chances of a portraitist winning it are close to zero.  Painting people well is hard, and in the cooler regions of the art world, unrewarding – yet in spite of that, so much of the truly great art of our time, such as Freud’s portraits of Leigh Bowery and Sue Tilley, has come from cussed sods who do it anyway. Freud worked all his life to get that good. I can’t help being grateful to BP for giving a bit of its dosh to Christian-Slane for his sensitive and promising painting Gabi. It is young painters like him who may become the Freuds of the future – and frankly they do not get much encouragement or fame outside this art prize. Then again, how much do portraits matter? How much does art itself matter? I think the debate about BP sponsorship of the arts is dishonest if it does not ask these bigger questions. It’s all very well bullying art galleries – that are struggling, not just to survive in a harsh economic climate but to stay free as the British public expects – to divest themselves of BP support.  The reality is that if we’re making it harder for the arts, we should be prepared to say some things matter more than art. And they do. One of the Greenpeace campaigns that will benefit from Christian-Slane’s cash is its effort to save a newly discovered coral reef at the mouth of the Amazon. This 600 mile reef, which was a kind of scientific legend, an oceanographic rumour, was proven to exist by Greenpeace itself in 2016. The images taken from its submersible are wonderlands of colour and abundance – a beauty no artist created.  This is, however, a beauty that humans can easily destroy. And guess what: BP is one of the oil companies targeting the area. It says it “expects to begin exploratory drilling operations before August 2018”. It claims that its operation about 22 miles from the magical corals and their denizens will be completely safe. Uh-huh. Looking at the wonder of this unique reef – it exists in exactly the kind of murky waters that are not meant to support corals – it is impossible for me to claim a painting matters as much. As the great, campaigning Victorian art critic John Ruskin pointed out, human art can never hope to match the grandeur of nature. The sky is brighter than any painting, the sea – as we can observe in images of this reef – more mysterious than any human fantasy. Without nature there can be no art. It is blind and narrow for arts organisations to pretend they are outside the struggle to save nature.  So make this a turning point. A young artist has bitten the oily hand that feeds the BP Portrait Award and he’s surely started something. If artists don’t want BP’s money how can the National Portrait Gallery keep offering it? Tellingly, the first sponsor of this prize was the John Player and Sons tobacco company.  It seems it’s always the controversial businesses that spend on the arts – the saintly ones don’t crave the publicity. Today it would be unimaginable for museums to take tobacco money. Perhaps museums need to find the next sponsors who need to clean up a dodgy image – soft drinks giants, maybe? It is not true that you can cut off a source of money to museums without harming art. Without BP there might be no portrait award. So let’s tell it truthfully: in the interest of the planet, art will just have to lose face."
"The central highlands of Afghanistan are a world away from the congested chaos of the country’s cities. Hills roll across colossal, uninhabited spaces fringed by snow-flecked mountains, set against blistering blue skies. In this spectacular, harsh landscape, one can pinpoint more or less where human settlement becomes impossible: at an altitude of 3,000 metres (9,840ft).  This is where Aziza’s family lives, in the village of Borghason. In a good year, they just about survive by cultivating wheat and potatoes for food and a small income. However, when the rains fail, as they increasingly do, the family is plunged into debt, unable to reimburse merchants for that year’s seeds. “Last year, we had to borrow money from the bazaar,” Aziza says. Things are about to get tougher. The precariousness of life in Bamiyan, one of Afghanistan’s poorest provinces, leaves villages like Borghason at the mercy of climate change. On a recent visit, the Guardian trekked from freshwater lakes surrounded by jagged massifs at 4,500 metres down to villages at the receiving end of erratic weather, a common result of global warming. Warmer temperatures melt the mountain snow earlier, resulting in an increased flow of water before farmers need it. These are irregularities that farmers living at the margins of economic sustainability cannot afford. “People are surviving,” says Andrew Scanlon, country director for the UN Environment Programme (UNEP). “[But] their ability to bounce back is almost zilch.” Farmers say unanimously that temperatures have risen over the past decades. Rain is scarcer and more unpredictable. “People know about climate change even if they don’t call it that,” says Fatima Akbari, the UNEP’s country assistant. “They know all about change in water and weather.” Despite 15 years as one of the world’s biggest receivers of international aid, much of it to agriculture, Afghanistan remains woefully underdeveloped and largely defenceless against jolts from nature. Western donors primarily poured money into short-sighted programmes such as heavy engineering and cash-for-work schemes, designed for “quick impact”, Scanlon says. “Soldiers and engineers were on six-month contracts and needed to quickly win hearts and minds,” he adds. Governments and engineers got accustomed to short time frames. Meanwhile, little was done to build long-term resilience. Winning hearts and minds was meant to win the war, yet climate change endangers that elusive victory. Although research on the topic in Afghanistan is limited to small-scale anthropological analyses, studies from Iraq and elsewhere link global warming and security. According to the UNEP, about 80% of conflicts in Afghanistan are related to resources like land and water – and to food insecurity, an immediate consequence of global warming. According to a report by the UNEP, the World Food Programme and the National Environmental Protection Agency (NEPA), the biggest climate hazards to Afghan livelihoods are drought and floods, caused by irregular snowmelt or rainfall. Bamiyan is one of the places most at risk, but also the source of environmental problems elsewhere. The mountains in Shah Foladi, one of four recognised national parks, feed both the Kabul basin and the Helmand river, which runs south for 700 miles (1,126km). In Helmand, water has instigated conflict for decades and been central to foreign intervention since the early cold war, when the US got involved in irrigation projects. Despite fighting a worsening war against insurgents, the Afghan government seems, to an extent, aware of the need to address the risks of global warming. “In the region, Afghanistan is the most vulnerable country facing the ravages of climate change,” says Prince Mostapha Zaher, grandson of the former king Mohammad Zahir Shah and director general of the NEPA. Zaher, a trained microbiologist and a forceful presence, has entered Afghanistan into 14 international environmental conventions since 2005. Still, the government’s priorities appear to fall short of his ambitions. Zaher describes the NEPA, which is not an actual ministry, as a “fledgling agency on a shoestring budget”. He has spearheaded efforts to protect Afghanistan’s extraordinary biodiversity by helping to name four areas as national parks. In June, marking World Environment Day, a wetlands site inside the city of Kabul became the latest. Kol-e-Hashmat Khan is a stopover for migratory birds of “world-class importance” and is visited by 150 species each year, according to the UNEP. Threats to the site come not just from the climate but from humans, too. Garbage is piled high on the water’s edge. One-fourth of the site’s nearly 200 hectares have been grabbed by “strongmen”, who burn reeds and erect cream-coloured villas jutting from the banks. “Afghanistan is one of the most biodiverse countries in the world,” says Scanlon, adding that the country boasts about 3,000 endemic plants, almost four times more than Europe. National biodiversity is another victim of international donors, such as USAid, that subsidise fertiliser and pesticides to Afghan farmers, and have used pesticides to eradicate poppies. Scanlon says international agencies generally have a “poor understanding” of Afghanistan’s natural riches. “I still speak to high-ranking officials from the World Bank, EU and other UN agencies who think Afghanistan is a desert, absolutely devoid of ecological value,” he adds. In Bamiyan, the UNEP works to promote sustainable farming. In the village of Khoshgak, farmers used to cultivate the hills to take advantage of rainfall, but that drained them of all nourishment. Now, by collecting water in concrete basins fed by underground pipes, they grow apricots, barley and potatoes in the valley. “Before, there was nothing here. It was scorched,” says Haji Qadir, a village elder, from his neatly manicured garden. Still, he remembers the valley of his childhood being more fertile. “The air used to be cleaner, not full of dust like now.” Women are particularly affected by erratic weather. In Borghason, when the rains fail, farmers switch crops from barley to wheat, which is less ideal as livestock feed, says Chaman, an older woman in the village. As a result, women – who are tasked with fetching water and tending livestock – have longer distances to hike. Villages in Bamiyan exemplify how climate change can hamper the ability of families to sustain themselves. According to Prince Zaher, they show why global warming should be taken as seriously as fighting insurgents. “Terrorism is not going to be lingering here for ever,” he says. “But climate change is an ongoing death sentence.” • This article was amended on 30 August 2017. An earlier version said Bamiyan was the “epicentre” of the region’s environmental problems. Bamiyan is one of the places most at risk, but also the source of environmental problems elsewhere."
"One week after the record deluge in Texas, the biggest hurricane ever measured in the mid-Atlantic is tearing through the Caribbean. Hurricane Irma, a category-five storm, is destroying homes and threatening lives in the Leeward Islands with 185mph winds and 11ft coastal surges, and in the coming days it is forecast to hit Puerto Rico, Haiti, Dominican Republic, Cuba and Florida. The governor of Florida has already declared a state of emergency. For Donald Trump, these twin megastorms are a source of awe. “Hurricane looks like largest ever recorded in the Atlantic!” he tweeted of Irma on Wednesday. “Even experts have said they’ve never seen one like this!” he posted of Harvey last week. But for many scientists they are a worrying sign of a “new normal” in which extreme weather events become more intense as a result of manmade climate change. Rather than expressing astonishment, they say policymakers need to strengthen long-term countermeasures and act more effectively on reducing carbon emissions. Hurricane looks like largest ever recorded in the Atlantic! “Even I as a climate scientist am startled to see another potentially devastating storm in this region so shortly after Harvey,” said Anders Levermann, of the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research. “Unfortunately, the physics are very clear: hurricanes get their destructive energy from ocean heat, and currently water surface temperatures in this region are very high.” Climatologists are careful to point out that rising greenhouse gas emissions are not the sole cause of hurricanes, which buffet the Caribbean and the Gulf of Mexico around this time every year. But there is strong evidence that warming temperatures and rising sea levels are increasing the destructive power of storms. “Higher than average sea-surface temperatures are fuelling Hurricane Irma, giving additional energy and moisture,” said Julian Heming, a hurricane expert at the Met Office. He said the impacts – intense rainfall, flash floods, extreme winds and a potentially lethal storm surge – would be felt far from the centre as Irma moves north-west. On Saint Barthélemy, Irma’s winds were measured at more than 150mph before they destroyed monitoring equipment in the island’s meteorological station. The US National Hurricane Center has said the “potentially catastrophic” storm could bring surges of up to 20ft along coasts in the southern Bahamas and Turks and Caicos Islands, and between five and 12 inches of rain in Puerto Rico, Dominican Republic, Haiti and Cuba. Whether Irma will reach Florida at its current level of intensity is uncertain. Since records began in 1851, only three category five hurricanes have made landfall in the US. Following Harvey, which was a category four hurricane at its peak, a second major storm of this size in one season would be unprecedented, according to Weather Underground. But historically unusual weather is no longer freakish. The floods that hit Houston last week were described as a once-in-500-years event because records suggested there was only a 0.2% chance of such heavy rainfall. However, precedent is an increasingly unreliable guide in a changing climate. In the past three years, Texas has been hit by three 100- to 500-year events, according to local media. More could follow. The National Hurricane Center said on Wednesday it expected Tropical Storm Jose, which has formed east of the Antilles, to become a hurricane during the night. Its latest map also shows a third, smaller storm – Katia – in the Gulf of Mexico. The degree to which climate change affects the intensity of these weather events is being studied. But there is a growing sense of urgency for governments to reduce emissions and strengthen preparations for future disasters.  “These events offer wider lessons on how prepared we are for a warmer future. It is likely that rainfall events, in general, will become more extreme, as will heatwaves and droughts. So events like Irma and Harvey also help us understand if we are prepared for them and who will be most affected,” said Dann Mitchell, a research fellow at the University of Bristol’s Cabot Institute.  As well as better urban and emergency planning, he said, social policies would also play a part. “Increasingly, the evidence is clear that the poorest, being the most exposed to many climate risks and often being the least protected, will be most affected. Addressing this inequality is at the heart of not just the climate change discussion but all discussions about how we become resilient to risk and hazards.”"
"Australian states and territories are powering ahead, developing policies that will meet the federal government’s internationally agreed greenhouse gas emission targets, with South Australia, the ACT and Tasmania leading the race. Despite being chastised by the federal government for unilateral action, South Australia is leading the race, with the ACT and Tasmania not far behind, according to a report by the Climate Council. Compared on a series of measures including penetration of renewable energy, the percentage of households with solar, as well as emissions and renewable energy targets, the Northern Territory, Western Australia and New South Wales are at the back of the pack, with Victoria and Queensland in the middle. Australia’s greenhouse gas emissions have been rising ever since the Coalition government repealed the carbon tax in 2014. The federal government’s own projections show their policies will cause emissions to continue to rise for decades to come. But in the midst of the ongoing federal policy vacuum, every state and territory besides Western Australia has “gone it alone” and developed strong renewable energy and emissions reduction policies. South Australia leads the country with 47% of its electricity sourced from renewable sources, followed by the ACT at 22%. Tasmania sourced 92% of its electricity from renewable sources, but that was dominated by large-scale hydro electricity. The Northern Territory sourced just 2% of its electricity from renewable sources, sitting behind Western Australia and Queensland at 7%. Victoria sourced 12% from renewables while NSW sat at 17%. Queensland led the country when it comes to solar households, with 32% of homes having solar panels. That just pipped South Australia, which had 31%. While both Western Australia and the Northern Territory scored poorly on most measures, there appeared to be grassroots momentum there for solar rooftops, with the biggest increases in solar penetration over the past year happening in those states. Western Australia jumped almost three percentage points to more than 25% penetration, and the Northern Territory jumped 2.7 percentage points to 11.4% – a figure that was still the lowest in the country. The ACT and Tasmania had the strongest renewable energy targets, with the former aiming to implement a 100% target by 2020 and the latter by 2022. The ACT’s aggressive and bipartisan renewable energy policies delivered the lowest energy costs in the country for consumers. Every state except Western Australia and the Northern Territory had targets to reduce net greenhouse gas emissions to zero by 2050. Those policies, combined with a surge in grassroots activity and market-driven closure of coal power plants, look set to easily cut Australia’s emissions by more 28% below 2005 levels, as Australia committed to following the Paris Agreement in 2015. That was the conclusion of a report by Frontier Economics earlier in the year, which concluded: “The commonwealth government will receive credit for state renewable policies that contribute to meeting the 2030 emissions target, while admonishing them for any energy security issues that may result. “Every state and territory, with the exception of Western Australia, is taking energy and climate policy into their own hands, with strong renewable energy targets or net zero emissions targets in place,” said Climate Council councillor and energy expert Andrew Stock. “States and territories previously lagging (NT, NSW and WA), are now stepping up the pace, joining the enormous progress we’re seeing across the nation,” he said. Climate Council member and former president of BP Australasia, Greg Bourne, said Australians are embracing solar energy in droves, with more than 5.6GW generated on the rooftops of 1.7 million homes. “Australia is one of the sunniest countries in the world, so it’s no surprise we’ve already rolled out enough solar to power the lights at the MCG every day for 20,000 years,” he said. States leading the way without federal coordination was described as a “a messy dog’s breakfast” by the Grattan Institute’s Tony Wood, who went on to say the unilateral state action was “understandable with federal ­climate change inaction”."
"Former Australian prime minister Tony Abbott is to give the annual lecture to a London-based climate sceptic group. Abbott will give his speech, entitled Daring to Doubt, to the London-based Global Warming Policy Foundation (GWPF) on 9 October.  The GWPF is led by former UK chancellor Nigel Lawson, who recently incorrectly told the BBC the global temperature had “slightly declined” in the past decade. The BBC was heavily criticised for allowing Lawson to make factually inaccurate assertions unchallenged. Abbott becomes the second former Australian prime minister to be hosted by the GWPF. In 2013, John Howard – Abbott’s old boss and political mentor – delivered the annual address. In his speech, called One Religion is Enough, Howard also incorrectly claimed global warming had stalled and expressed deep scepticism about the possibility of an international agreement on climate change. Two years later, the Paris climate treaty was struck. Under Abbott’s leadership, Australia became something of a pariah on the issue of climate change. His government was known for its pro-coal and anti-climate action policies. Abbott infamously referred to climate science as “bullshit” and said coal was “good for humanity”. The speech Abbott gives in London in October will be notable for its domestic political overtones.  Climate change is a hugely volatile political issue in Australia and Abbott has successfully used the issue in the past to neuter political rivals, including the prime minister, Malcolm Turnbull, who deposed Abbott in 2015."
"Human-caused climate change amplified the damages and suffering associated with Hurricane Harvey in several different ways. First, sea level rise caused by global warming increased the storm surge and therefore the coastal inundation and flooding from the storm. Second, the warmer atmosphere holds more water vapor, which intensifies extreme precipitation events like the record-shattering rainfall associated with Harvey. Third, warmer ocean waters essentially act as hurricane fuel, which may have made Harvey more intense than it would otherwise have been. There are other possible human factors at play about which we have less certainty. For example, it’s possible that Harvey stalled off the coast of Texas because of changes in atmospheric circulation patterns associated with human-caused global warming. As climate scientist Michael Mann notes, his research has shown that these sorts of stationary summer weather patterns tend to happen more often in a hotter world, but we can’t yet say if that happened in Harvey’s case.  Other human activities also worsened Harvey’s impacts. For example, Houston suffers from urban sprawl, covering a larger area (nearly 600 square miles) than the cities of Chicago, San Francisco, Washington DC, Boston, Manhattan, and Santa Barbara combined. With urban sprawl and poor planning came expansive impervious surfaces – absorbent soil covered instead by concrete and asphalt, increasing flood risks. Houston’s lack of zoning laws combined with the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) also encouraged development in flood prone areas.  Private insurance companies don’t want to insure homes that face a significant risk of flooding, but with a lack of regulation and/or government insurance offered by NFIP, development in relatively high-risk flood areas can be profitable. That is, until a flood strikes. 85% of Houston homeowners don’t have flood insurance and will be unable to recover most of their losses from Hurricane Harvey. Others are covered by NFIP, which was already $24 billion in debt before Harvey. That’s because NFIP hasn’t been charging sufficiently high premiums, in large part because it has underestimated flood risks based on maps and projections that are sometimes decades out of date. And climate change is amplifying those flood risks. It’s a challenging problem because for homeowners living in areas where flood risks have significantly increased, flood insurance premiums should hypothetically increase significantly to cover those risks. But factors like rising sea levels and expanding urban sprawl that contribute to that increased risk aren’t the fault of the homeowners, who can then become angry constituents for politicians working on updating NFIP. And so needed changes to the program have yet to be made. As a result, the government is effectively subsidizing the costs associated with living in high-risk flood areas. Between 1978 and 2005, NFIP paid out $5.5 billion (9.6% of paid claims) to just 30,000 properties (0.6% of the total covered by flood insurance) that each flooded an average of five times. Because the NFIP premiums are too low, taxpayers end up footing billions of dollars of those payouts. The situation is analogous to climate change. Without a price on carbon pollution, industries and individuals can dump carbon in the atmosphere for free. But that carbon pollution has costs that we eventually pay, in the form of increased property damage due to amplified storms like Hurricane Harvey, for example. Or from higher food prices when farmers are struck by an intensified drought, or decreased worker productivity in heat waves, or valuable coastal property lost to encroaching sea levels, or homes lost to bigger wildfires and increased costs to fight them – the list of climate costs goes on and on.  Those costs are eventually paid by taxpayers, but we’re picking up the tab for the polluters. It’s effectively a subsidy for the fossil fuel industry to the tune of trillions of dollars every year, and as with artificially cheap flood insurance premiums, we’re subsidizing risky behavior that ultimately causes severe damages. Ten days before Hurricane Harvey hit, the Trump administration rolled back the Federal Flood Risk Mitigation Standard. The policy was implemented by the Obama administration, and required taxpayer-funded public infrastructure projects to plan for future flooding risks. Much infrastructure within and around Houston is now underwater, and accounting for future flooding risks when replacing it would be smart. But the Trump administration considered this policy a burdensome regulation, claiming that the infrastructure permitting process has too many “inefficiencies.” Apparently those “inefficiencies” include saving taxpayer money by reducing future flood losses. When asked about the causes and contributors to Hurricane Harvey and its damages, EPA administrator Scott Pruitt sidestepped the subject by using the Trump administration’s favorite strategy – attack the media: I think for opportunistic media to use events like this to, without basis or support, just to simply engage in a cause and effect type of discussion, and not focus upon the needs of people, I think is misplaced. Worse yet, EPA spokesperson Liz Bowman accused climate scientists of “engaging in attempts to politicize an ongoing tragedy.” It’s similar to the argument that we shouldn’t talk about gun control in the aftermath of a mass shooting. That’s precisely when we should be working on solutions to prevent these types of disasters from happening again and again. Those who oppose climate policies will often argue that we can simply adapt to the consequences of human-caused climate change. Most recently, New York Times columnist Bret Stephens suggested that Harvey will just be a “speed bump” for Houston’s economy, and that the world should follow Houston’s example of “environmental resilience” by following “the path of its extraordinary economic growth.” The people in Texas suffering from having lost their homes and possessions probably aren’t comforted that Stephens considers Harvey a “speed bump” for the local economy (which coincidentally is probably not true). As renowned glaciologist Lonnie Thompson put it: Global warming is here and is already affecting our climate, so prevention is no longer an option. Three options remain for dealing with the crisis: mitigate, adapt, and suffer. There will be some of each, but the more we mitigate the problem by cutting carbon pollution, the less we will have to adapt to and suffer from the consequences of climate change. However, even adaptation takes action. We can take some steps to adapt to rising sea levels, but denying the problem by rolling back regulations aimed at doing just that shifts us further toward the suffering part of the equation. Economic growth has many benefits, but by itself does not move us in the direction of climate mitigation or adaptation. In short, to minimize the suffering caused by climate change, we need to be smarter about addressing the problem and adapting its consequences. Right now we’re instead becoming stupider, and that will only lead to increased suffering. If we want to minimize the suffering caused by future Harveys, we need to talk about how climate change is making them worse, and we need to do something about it."
"On a very wet day we can expect 1-2 inches of rain to fall in the UK, perhaps double that in extreme conditions. But as Hurricane Harvey and other storms have shown, in warmer climes prolonged rainfall can be many times heavier. So in a warming world, just how heavy could rain become?

"For three years now, Somaliland, like much of East Africa, has experienced extreme drought. Drought that has become more and more severe, until earlier this year, with thousands on the brink of starvation, the government of Somaliland declared a national emergency. The crisis should serve as a warning to the rest of the world to prepare – and prepare well – for extreme weather events, which are occurring with greater frequency and ferocity than ever before.   As the drought ravages the communities of Somaliland and its neighbours, hurricane Irma is making its destructive path through the Caribbean islands towards Florida. Countries in South Asia have been battling floods affecting more than 24 million people. Hurricane Harvey has wreaked havoc on the United States’ Gulf of Mexico. Sierra Leone has scrambled to respond to the deadly impacts of a landslide that took nearly 500 lives. Needless to say, the impacts of these events are wide reaching. They extend beyond the obvious food, water and shelter shortages to the inevitable knock-on effects, such as mass migration within and across country borders, and the aggravation of pre-existing inequalities. I’ve recently spent two weeks in the small, self-declared independent state in the northwest of Somalia, meeting women leading the humanitarian response to the disaster in their villages. Just hours outside Hargeisa, Somaliland’s tiny capital, I met women in drought-ravaged communities who have taken up leadership roles for the first time in their lives. These women are desperate to protect the lives of those most at risk in the ongoing crisis.  The impact of the drought on Somaliland’s communities has been extreme. The first two years were increasingly difficult, the women told me, but this last year has been the worst. After years of coping with dwindling water supplies – supplies required for business, for food preparation, for sanitation – it eventually evaporated almost entirely. Money ran out, animals died. With little to eat, whole communities became malnourished. In Somaliland, those who were marginalised before the drought have experienced its greatest effects. In Saylabari, women have formed a collective to ensure that those most in need are the first to receive assistance when aid is distributed in their village.  And who are most affected? Women, they tell me. Women, who have long borne the brunt of a patriarchal system, and its brutish brother, poverty.  Singularly responsible for the care of their children, the stress that mothers have experienced in the drought has been severe. High rates of illiteracy among women who have been denied education means less access to information about what relief is on its way and who will have access to it.  Levels of domestic violence have increased significantly. Women whose husbands have left in search of alternative income are now responsible for providing for their families, as well as caring for them. Forced to forage for water in far off places, women are often raped on their journeys.  For those who migrate, the stories are worse. Over the past six months, people have left their homes in great numbers to search for water and for places their animals can graze on healthy vegetation. Leaving is a gamble –people leave in the hope that there is more sustenance further afield, but without any guarantee of finding it.  Somaliland’s experience of disaster is typical of any emergency insofar as it disproportionately affects women and those marginalised before the crisis. This is a well-recognised truth that should teach us an important lesson. The only way to prepare adequately for disasters of this scale is to address the deeply entrenched gender inequalities in access to resources and decision making.  One hundred kilometres from Saylabari and its women’s collective, a burgeoning women’s coalition have waged their own humanitarian response to the crisis in the village of Gorgeysa.  Their own community is unaffected by the drought, but the women’s coalition introduced a policy that every family in the community must take in two families. Chairwoman Ruun Essa Habane said, “We were receiving so many migrants – so many people who were searching for safety and for food and water. We had to work out how we could care for them.”  The collective pooled its resources, resources that the women had been saving over the three years that they have been working together. They used them to provide for those in their care. They donated clothes.  When I expressed my stunned (Australian) admiration, Essa Habane seemed surprised. “What else could we do?” she said. “We have the money.”  “The community cannot make decisions without us,” said Essa Habane. “We decided we wanted to support those affected by the drought and that was it.”  There is much that Australia could learn from the women of Somaliland and their response to the country’s protracted disaster. While the women in communities in Somaliland give up the little they have to support those who lack their basic needs, Australia struggles to respond humanely to the asylum seeker crisis that we have created.  Rather than responding with kindness to our fellow human beings, our politicians wallow in arguments about space and resources, postulating threats of terrorism and disseminating notions of greedy people jumping queues to grab “our” resources.  It’s worth considering how we might respond if our leadership wouldn’t primarily consist of white advantaged men, who struggle to see beyond the privilege that has always defined their lives, to empathise with those on the margins.  How long can Australia get away with this cruel and selfish response to those in need? Climate change is taking its toll – and it’s a toll that will eventually catch us up.  Extreme weather events are already leading to forced migration, in Somaliland and well beyond it, and in the years to come, millions of people will be on the move, in desperate search of food and water.  If we are to respond effectively to these impending crises – if we are, like the women of Gorgeysa and Saylabari, to ensure that nobody goes without, especially those most vulnerable – we must take action now to ensure that women are equally represented in leadership positions, and that they have the support to maintain them.  Female leaders create space for other women to take up leadership roles and to participate fully in decision making. They consistently make decisions that benefit whole communities, and ensure that everybody is considered and cared for.    At the end of every conversation I had with different women in Somaliland, they would ask me the same question: “What are things like for women in your country? What advice do you have for us as we strive for greater things – for presidency?”  All I could tell them was that in Australia, we’ve taken great steps forward but that the road ahead is long. I said that we could learn from them. That by supporting women’s leadership, perhaps we too, some day, might say, “What else could we do? We have the money.” "
"Approximately one-quarter of Americans identify as evangelical Christians, and that group also tends to be more resistant to the reality of human-caused global warming. As a new paper by Brian Webb and Doug Hayhoe notes: a 2008 study found that just 44% of evangelicals believed global warming to be caused mostly by human activities, compared to 64% of nonevangelicals (Smith and Leiserowitz, 2013) while, a 2011 survey found that only 27% of white evangelicals believed there to be a scientific consensus on climate change, compared to 40% of the American public (Public Religion Research Institute, 2011).  These findings appear to stem from two primary factors. First, evangelicals tend to be socially and politically conservative, and climate change is among the many issues that have become politically polarized in America. Second, there is sometimes a perceived conflict between science and religion, as Christians distrust what they perceive as scientists’ “moral agenda” on issues like evolution, stem cell research, and climate change. As Webb and Hayhoe describe it: theological conservatism, scientific skepticism, political affiliation, and sociocultural influences have reinforced one another to instill climate skepticism into the evangelical tribe mentality, thus creating a formidable barrier to climate education efforts. There are also evangelicals who have tried to convince their peer group about the reality of human-caused climate change and our moral obligation to address it. These include the Evangelical Environmental Network, the Evangelical Climate Initiative, the Young Evangelicals for Climate Action, and evangelical climate scientists like Sir John Houghton and Doug Hayhoe’s daughter Katharine Hayhoe (one of TIME magazine’s 100 most influential people). However, a majority of evangelicals continue to reject the reality of human-caused climate change, and there hasn’t been research quantifying the effectiveness of these evangelical climate leadership efforts. Brian Webb and Doug Hayhoe’s study did just that by testing the effectiveness of a climate lecture delivered by Katharine Hayhoe to undergraduate students at the predominantly evangelical Houghton College in New York. Approximately half of the participants self-identified as conservatives and Republicans, 28% as liberals and Democrats, and the remainder as neither liberal nor conservative. 63% of the participants identified as evangelicals (most of the rest were of other Christian denominations). Katharine Hayhoe’s lecture presented climate science information through the lens of an evangelical tradition. In addition to presenting scientific evidence, it included an introduction about the difference between faith and science (faith is based on things that are spiritually discerned, whereas science is based on observation). About six minutes of the 33- to 53-minute lectures were devoted to theology-based ethics. The participants filled out a survey before and after the lecture, detailing their acceptance that global warming is happening, its cause, whether there’s a scientific consensus, how high of a priority they consider it, how worried they are about it, and how much it will harm various groups. The results showed an increase in pro-climate beliefs for every single question after listening to Katharine Hayhoe’s lecture. Acceptance that global warming is happening increased for 48% of participants, and that humans are causing it for 39%. Awareness of the expert scientific consensus increased among 27% of participants. 52% were more worried about climate change after watching the lecture, and 67% increased their responses about how much harm climate change will do. 55% of participants viewed addressing climate change a higher priority after attending Katharine Hayhoe’s lecture. For most of the remaining participants, there was no change in responses to these questions. By testing three different lecture approaches, Webb and Hayhoe also concluded that the lecture was equally effective when presented in person or as a recorded video, and that adding material about common climate misconceptions didn’t make the lecture any more effective. There’s been some debate among social scientists about how much facts matter in today’s politically polarized society. Some have warned about the “smart idiots” effect, in which people who are more knowledgeable are often less persuadable, essentially because they have more tools with which to reject information they find inconvenient. However, other research has shown that climate-specific knowledge does increase peoples’ acceptance of human-caused global warming. The question then becomes how to arm people with that climate-specific knowledge. One thing most social scientists agree on is that people are more open to information when it comes from “trusted sources” – people with whom they have shared values. For evangelicals, Katharine Hayhoe is a perfect example, and this study confirms that her lectures are effective at informing evangelical college students about climate change. Other climate scientists can follow Hayhoe’s successful example by identifying groups whose membership is predominantly skeptical about human-caused global warming, with whom the individual scientist shares a commonality that will make him or her a trusted source of information. This could consist of religious beliefs, political leanings, or other shared values. This study has shown that the trusted source approach is an effective one at breaking through individuals’ resistance to the realities of human-caused climate change."
"The climate ambitions of the Finkel review appear to be being watered down by the government as it is implemented, according to a draft Coag Energy Council implementation strategy obtained by the Guardian.  The draft implementation plan removes a key recommendation for an agreed emissions trajectory for the electricity system, alignment with the Paris agreement and subsidised solar and batteries for low-income houses.  Sources tell the Guardian the document was prepared by the federal government and distributed to state and territory representatives on the morning of the meeting, leaving little time for state representatives to analyse it. A final version of the document is expected to be delivered to Coag today. The federal environment and energy minister, Josh Frydenberg, declined to comment on the document, saying: “It is not appropriate for any government to comment on draft documents of the Council of Australian Governments.” Described by the prime minister, Malcolm Turnbull, as a “blueprint for the once-in-a-century transformation currently taking placing in Australia’s energy system”, the Finkel review presented 50 recommendations to the Council of Australian Governments (Coag). Those recommendations were intended to solve the energy “trilemma” – delivering affordable and reliable electricity, while lowering emissions. The review itself was widely criticised for lacking in ambition when it came to action on climate change, and failing to align with Australia’s commitments made in the Paris climate agreement. The key recommendation of the review was a clean energy target, which Frydenberg has so far failed to get approved by the joint Coalition party room, which includes a number of climate change deniers. But the party room agreed to the other 49 recommendations, which the Coag Energy Council is now advising heads of government on how to implement. At a teleconference on Friday last week, state and territory energy ministers were presented with a draft implementation plan for discussion. That document, obtained by the Guardian, appears to water down those recommendations in relation to climate change, and removes some altogether. One key recommendation in the Finkel review that has been severely weakened in the draft implementation document is a change that would force the electricity market to align efforts to meet government emissions reduction commitments made as part of the Paris agreement. Finkel’s recommendation said Coag leaders should agree to a new Australian Energy Market Agreement, which commits all parties to “a nationally consistent approach to energy policy that recognises Australia’s commitment in Paris to reduce emissions and governments’ commitment to align efforts to meet this target with energy market frameworks.” But the draft implementation document removes the reference to international emissions reduction commitments, instead saying merely that the agreement will “reaffirm Australian governments’ commitment to the [national electricity market] and a national, integrated approach to energy and emissions reduction policy”. Among Finkel’s key recommendation for an “orderly transition”, he called for three things: the clean energy target; a three-year notice of closure for existing large generators; and “an agreed emissions reduction trajectory”. All three moves were part of one recommendation, numbered 3.2. The Coalition has not agreed to adopt the clean energy target but it has agreed to the three-year notice-of-closure rule, which appears in the implementation plan. However, the plan does not contain any mention of an agreed emissions reduction trajectory. Frydenberg told the Guardian his view is that the Coag Energy Council did not agree to the emissions reduction trajectory because it is part of the clean energy target. “The Coag Energy Council has agreed to implement the recommendations of the Finkel review except for the clean energy target, which includes the national electricity market emissions trajectory which the federal government is currently considering.” It is unclear why the emissions trajectory is considered part of the clean energy target, since the Finkel review makes clear that there are a number of mechanisms that could achieve such a trajectory. Finkel modelled several such mechanisms, including an emissions intensity scheme. Another Finkel recommendation calls for low-income households to be given subsidised access to “energy efficient appliances, rooftop solar photovoltaic and battery storage systems”. Explicit references to renewable energy has been removed in the draft implementation plan and replaced with “energy efficiency and demand management technologies”. Sources say representatives of the ACT raised the question of the trajectory being removed, and asked for it to be included. Representatives of Queensland and Victoria also apparently raised concerns about some of the other changes. Sources said the document, which was prepared by the federal government, was circulated to state energy ministers only hours before the meeting was held, leaving little time for proper scrutiny. The document is expected to be finalised and sent to heads of government today."

"Hurricane Katrina in 2005 was “the first taste of a bitter cup that will be proffered to us over and over again,” according to former US vice president Al Gore at the time.  Since then, Hurricane Sandy in 2012 and now Hurricane Harvey have borne out this prediction. The latest storm may turn out to be less fatal than Katrina, which killed more than 1,800 people but in economic terms it may be as bad. Hurricane Katrina cost about $160bn (£124bn) in economic losses in today’s terms, accounting for the last decade’s inflation, while Sandy wrought about $70bn in damage. Preliminary estimates for the damage caused by Harvey are wide apart, spanning $90bn to $190bn, reflecting the difficulty of judging an unfolding disaster.  Bob Ward, policy and communications director at the Grantham Research Institute on Climate Change and the Environment, at the London School of Economics, says: “Hurricane Harvey may turn out to be the most damaging weather disaster to have hit the US. It will take some time before we know what the full cost is [and] in addition to the physical damage there will be the economic losses from businesses that cannot operate. If Houston is slow to recover from the impacts, the losses will mount.” In the UK, motorists have been warned that petrol prices are likely to rise sharply as the effect of Hurricane Harvey on oil production is felt. If past disasters are anything to go by, about half of the direct, local cost of Hurricane Harvey is likely to be picked up eventually by insurers, with the rest borne by the public purse and by individuals and businesses. Insurers have taken an increasingly active role in the last decade in warning of the potential for more intense storms, floods, droughts and other natural disasters as a result of climate change, and of our failure to protect a rising population and increasingly complex infrastructure against these effects. “We have been working on climate change since the 1970s,” says Ernst Rauch, head of climate and public sector business development at Munich Re. “We are one of the largest risk takers and it is essential we understand these potential risks. This is crucial to us.” For insurers, the key issue is the resilience of populations and infrastructure – the ability to deal with disasters when they happen. In most situations, this requires government planning, working with the private sector to help proof homes and buildings against severe weather. But while insurers have grown acutely aware of these risks, governments and other parts of the private sector have lagged behind. “We see the need at a global scale for societies and public risk managers like government and local authorities to pay more attention to the reduction of risk and resilience building,” says Rauch. “Otherwise we will see an ongoing increase in losses, driven and intensified by climate change.” Weather catastrophes are now six times more frequent than in 1950 Caspar Honegger, who heads global flood peril assessment at Swiss Re, reports that after Superstorm Sandy hit New York, the city asked his team to analyse the climate risks for the next 40 years. They found that rising sea levels and the increasing frequency of storms would raise average annual losses by 170% to $4.4bn.  ClimateWise – a coalition of 29 insurers including Allianz, Lloyd’s, Zurich, Prudential and Swiss Re – warned of a growing “protection gap” between the cost of natural disasters and the amount insured for. The group said weather catastrophes – which are now six times more frequent than in 1950 – are making some assets uninsurable and advised more investment in building resilience against floods and heat waves. The online property company Zillow estimates that 1.9 million homes in the US, valued at a combined $882bn, could be submerged by the end of the century as sea levels rise and storm surges erode coastlines and riverbanks. Florida would be worst affected, losing one in eight properties, followed by Hawaii with one in 10. Insurers now treat this as a board level issue, with chief executives reporting to their shareholders on the increasing risk from climate-related disasters, and working with the UN, World Bank and national governments. As their business relies on understanding risk, they have taken a lead not just in pricing in new risks but in encouraging efforts to reduce them. Insurers are among the top global investors in renewable energy, and some are considering divesting from fossil fuels. They have funded studies of vulnerability and ways to adapt to climate change, and urged governments to protect their populations from the potential ravages of warming. Yet not enough is being done, warns Rauch. “Not enough account is taken of climate change at the public decision-making level. Climate change is not something that is going to have an impact in a hundred years, its impact is already felt today. That’s why we need to adapt to the consequences, such as by investing in infrastructure, fortifying homes, building levees and dykes, maybe removing homes from highly exposed zones.” In part this lack of preparedness is down to the cost of equipping communities with better protection and better recovery mechanisms. But for more than a decade, since the pivotal Stern review of the economics of climate change in 2006, an increasing body of work has demonstrated that dealing with emissions and the probable effects of climate change now will save money in the medium and longer term. “The longer we fail to act the more expensive it will be; the sooner we act, the cheaper. Doing nothing will be much more expensive,” says Rauch. But insurance does offer one big advantage in assessing the likely impacts of climate disasters, says Rauch. “We are very transparent. Insurance premiums reflect risk based on two factors: first is the underlying hazard, that is the probability of an event occurring, and the second is the vulnerability if an event occurs. If the hazard is driven up by climate change, you can still reduce vulnerability, by investing in protection and fortifying homes, such as by building them to higher standards. Then the premiums could remain constant. But if you keep everything as it is today and the risk goes up, they would have to rise.” In Florida, for instance, lax building regulations mean buildings are more vulnerable, as well as more at risk, and premiums are higher accordingly – more than $2,000 for insurance coverage that would cost less than €200 in Germany, according to Rauch. “At the end of the day, insurance is a simple system and one of the biggest benefits is that we put a price tag on risk – so in a functioning market everyone can understand where the risk is higher.”"
"Ain’t no mountain dry enough? Ben Nevis may well have grown by a metre last year but now it is also nude from basecamp up for the first time in 11 years. You would expect snow under foot atop the summit’s stone cairn at the lofty height of 1,345m, not a blunt, barren crown. So what on earth happened to the formerly covered peak?  Well, Scotland has had its third warmest winter since 1910 but, even so, white mountain tops can be as hit-and-miss as white Christmases. Indeed, avid snow-watchers are keen to stress that it is a popular misconception to presume peaks are always snowy, or that the lower the altitude, the less the chance of a powdery summit. Many mountains in South America’s Andes are as dry as the arid Atacama desert upon which some of them reside – even when you get to the uppermost point. Monte Pissis, in Argentina, is the third highest in the western hemisphere and, at almost 7,000m, the tallest snowless peak in the world. Rising air temperature, driven by increasing concentrations of greenhouse gases – AKA global warming – has accelerated deglaciation in recent decades. As a consequence, researchers believe we are in a transition phase, from a world with glacierised mountains to a situation where permanent snow and ice cover is likely to be strongly reduced or even eliminated. This has potentially dire consequences for the half of the world’s population who depend on mountain water and who could soon be driven to stockpiling. But it’s not all doom and gloom – Ben Nevis expert Iain Cameron is confident the snow will return. “It can snow at any time on Ben Nevis, but snowfall at this time of the year is generally ephemeral,” says Cameron. “The first substantial falls you can expect are in October.” For how many more years that will periodically be the case remains to be seen. At this rate, snow-topped mountains could be primed to join proper Toblerones in the litany of things of which we may have seen the last."
"Universities have faced an onslaught of criticism this summer, from outrage over the “greed” of vice-chancellors to claims that tuition fees are “blighting young people’s futures”. The fallout saw Labour MP Darren Jones resign from an advisory board at the University of Bath over revelations about its vice-chancellor’s 11% pay rise. Last week, it culminated in a speech from Alistair Jarvis, the new chief executive of Universities UK, the representative body for vice-chancellors, in which he denounced critics of universities as people pushing “misinformation, muddled argument and even a little malicious intent”. With a fresh academic year looming, we sought expert advice for university leaders preparing to tackle whatever the new term throws at them. From facing media scrutiny to ensuring your institution isn’t funding climate change, here’s what the professionals recommend.  Media expert Sarah Dickinson, author and founder of media training consultancy Electric Airwaves Vice-chancellors are really in the hot seat at the moment, mainly because there’s been controversy about what they earn, so all vice-chancellors need to be as ready as they can for what I believe to be legitimate media scrutiny. When you come face-to-face with a journalist your brain forgets all the positive things you’ve been doing and the negative things come to the forefront. Always carry a mental suitcase of the positive things you have initiated at your university. For instance, it might be that through your work and that of your colleagues you have been able to establish a fund to build a new technology wing. Have the confidence to use the personal pronoun. It has much more resonance if anyone in a position of authority can say: “If you want to know personally what I think…”. That way, your arguments will come across much more passionately. Make sure you constantly update your views on current controversial issues, from why the finances of the Universities Superannuation Scheme have deteriorated, to historic statues such as Cecil Rhodes, to LGBT rights. As long as you follow these very basic rules, you should always be able to treat interviews as an opportunity, not a threat. Eco-fashion expert, journalist and TV presenter Lucy Siegle When people become conscious of being singled out as over-paid, the danger is they virtue signal by wearing low-cost fast fashion. I see this a lot with celebrities trying to say “I’m one of you”. It succeeds only in bolstering the false idea that fast fashion is in someway democratic. It’s not. It’s a destroyer of the environment and creates obscene wealth in terms of fast fashion moguls. The best thing well-remunerated people can do is spend outside of this system and make it count. I’m a big fan of bespoke garments, especially suiting in good fabrics – you can find out a lot about mills and production these days.  We have a really healthy sustainable fashion ecosystem in the UK right now. For occasion wear, I think Kitty Ferreira is unbeatable. We also have a mainstream ethical hit on our hand through longstanding eco-shoe brand Po-Zu. I think the People Tree ethical collection with the V&A is a winner for female vice-chancellors. Not everyone will feel comfortable increasing their fashion budget, but there are brands that address part of the puzzle. Ex-teacher Sarah Jerath established her own brand, Two For Joy, where you can find out exactly where the cost of the clothes is being distributed. Increasingly we are seeing a lot of UK students doing practical fashion courses and learning to cut and sew. Wouldn’t it be great if vice-chancellors could wear students’ creations? Divestment expert Chris Saltmarsh, fossil free campaigns coordinator at People & Planet Higher education institutions have committed to remove more than £80bn of investments out of oil, coal and gas companies globally. The UK higher education sector is leading the way, with institutions accounting for nearly half of over 100 universities worldwide that have made pledges. To date, a third of universities have made a fossil fuel divestment pledge of some kind. As the academic year resumes and vice-chancellors mull over how they can use their significant power to contribute to the challenge of avoiding catastrophic climate change, they can draw inspiration from this ever-growing divestment movement. For divestment to be effective, vice-chancellors must ensure three things. Firstly, their commitments must be made public to help build the movement against fossil fuel companies. Secondly, their commitments must be full – the divestment must encompass all fossil fuels and fossil fuel companies. Finally, their commitments must be time-bound so students and staff know when they plan to move their money by – usually within one to three years – and can hold them accountable.  If a university has already made a divestment commitment, there is still a lot to be done. People & Planet’s Divest Barclays campaign, for example, encourages universities to boycott Barclays until the bank stops financing fossil fuel projects, this could be by removing a Barclays branch from campus, switching the university’s bank account provider or excluding them from careers and recruitment fairs. Tech and education expert Anne-Marie Imafidon MBE, CEO of Stemettes, a social enterprise working to inspire young women into Stem roles Universities are typically set up along faculty or department lines. Students in those groups are kept within those groups. It’s important to create environments where people are able to talk across departments and disciplines in a way that leaves them rewarded for contributing to a higher-level discussion. When I was at university there were physical spaces for people to come together to work, enabling that cross-pollination of ideas. Even if they’re not permanent spaces, the action of bringing people together to share thoughts and ideas can be invaluable. Innovation comes from environments where groupthink is not allowed to flourish. Industry is a great driver for innovative thinking on campus. There’s talk among some of the university departments I’m involved with around tech hubs opening in or near universities, where you’re able to connect people – whether it’s PhD students or researchers – with industry, allowing those working at universities to experiment with their ideas.  It’s important to involve everybody. Innovative ideas and new perspectives can come from anywhere. Universities must not fall into old habits of following traditional academic hierarchies. Whether it’s new academic staff or new students coming in, getting them involved can be invaluable because there will be things they are able to look at with fresh eyes.

"As communities in coastal Texas and Louisiana confront the damage wrought by Hurricane Harvey, another hurricane, Irma, fueled by abnormally warm waters, is barreling into the Caribbean and threatening Puerto Rico and Florida. We know that the costs of both hurricanes will be enormous and that climate change will have made them far larger than they would have been otherwise. How much larger? Careful studies will take time but the evidence that climate change is warming ocean waters, increasing both sea level and the risk of extreme precipitation in these regions is well established.  On 29 October 2012, when Hurricane Sandy slammed into America’s east coast, a storm surge of more than nine feet caused extensive flooding damage throughout the affected region. Researchers have since determined that the damage from that storm surge was greatly worsened by climate change. Sea level along the East Coast has risen by about eight inches since 1900, as oceans have warmed and expanded in response to rising concentrations of carbon dioxide and other heat-trapping gases in the atmosphere, with subsiding land adding insult to injury. According to one study, sea level rise increased Sandy’s flood damages to property in New York City alone by $2bn – more than $230 per New Yorker. Such costs from storm damage attributable to climate change are just one piece of the story. New York City estimates that it will spend an estimated $19.5bn to prepare for climate change impacts through 2030. And researchers say developing countries most vulnerable to rising seas and increasing extreme weather will need between $140bn and $300bn annually by 2030 to help them cope. Who should pay these costs? In the United States, the default assumption is that costs of climate damages and adaptation should be borne by taxpayers, through flood insurance programs, federal disaster relief funds and the like, as well as by affected individuals, families and private businesses. This assumption is now being challenged in the courts. Lawsuits filed in July by three coastal California communities against ExxonMobil, Chevron, BP and other large fossil fuel companies argue that the companies, not taxpayers and residents, should bear the cost of damages from rising seas. They draw on extensive evidence that fossil fuel companies, knowing that their products contributed substantially to climate change, engaged for decades in a coordinated campaign to publicly disparage climate science to avoid limits on emissions. These lawsuits build on a vigorous and growing debate in the court of public opinion and among company shareholders about the responsibilities of fossil fuel giants for their contributions to climate change. This is a debate fueled by high-profile evidence of some companies’ deception, the growing and devastating human and economic costs of climate change, and the recognition that even today fossil fuel companies maintain business models that assume the continued global reliance on their products that would drive heat-trapping emissions and temperatures well above the Paris agreement limits that some of the same companies profess to support. Today, we and several colleagues are publishing a peer-reviewed paper in the journal Climatic Change that shows it is possible for scientific evidence to help apportion responsibility for climate damages among fossil fuel producers. Using a simple, well-established climate model, our study for the first time quantifies the amount of sea level rise and increase in global surface temperatures that can be traced to the emissions from specific fossil fuel companies. Strikingly, nearly 30% of the rise in global sea level between 1880 and 2010 resulted from emissions traced to the 90 largest carbon producers. Emissions traced to the 20 companies named in California communities’ lawsuits contributed 10% of global sea level rise over the same period. More than 6% of the rise in global sea level resulted from emissions traced to ExxonMobil, Chevron and BP, the three largest contributors. We have the data needed to link the emissions traced to products sold by a fossil fuel company to a specific share of changes in temperature and sea level rise. Determining who should pay what for climate damages is a social and political question. But this kind of scientific work can help inform public and policy debate over the issue and potentially offers an approach that can help juries and judges to monetize damages in cases like the California communities’ lawsuits. Plainly, companies should not be at liberty to persist for decades in selling products as safe to use when they know they are harmful and have alternatives available to them. Upon learning of the risks of their products, companies could have used their considerable technical and financial resources to greatly accelerate carbon storage and clean energy technologies. Many, even within the fossil fuel industry itself, are arguing they can still change course, but it is hard to justify the immediate cost to shareholders when just using the atmosphere as a waste dump and leaving impacted communities, taxpayers and future generations to deal with the consequences appears to be a risk-free alternative. But, as we found in the 2008 financial crisis, allowing companies to make private profits while society at large underwrites the risk ends badly for everyone. It may take tens to hundreds of billions of dollars to support disaster relief and recovery among Gulf coast communities affected by Hurricane Harvey. ExxonMobil, Chevron and BP have collectively pledged only $2.75m. As scientists further identify the role that climate change has made to exacerbating this tragedy, courts of law and public opinion should judge whether they are paying their fair share."
"When Rick Kirn planted his 1,000 acres of spring wheat in May, there were no signs of a weather calamity on the horizon. Three months later, when he should have been harvesting and getting ready to sell his wheat, Kirn was staring out across vast cracked, gray, empty fields dotted with weeds and little patches of stunted wheat. “It’s a total loss for me,” said Kirn, who operates a small family wheat farm on the Fort Peck Reservation, an area of north-eastern Montana that lies right in the heart of the extreme climatic episode. “There’s nothing to harvest.”  Kirn’s story is typical across the high plains in Montana and the Dakotas this summer, where one of the country’s most important wheat growing regions is in the grips of a crippling drought that came on with hardly any warning and, experts say, is without precedent. While much of the country’s attention in recent weeks has been on the hurricanes striking southern Texas and the Caribbean, a so-called “flash drought”, an unpredictable, sudden event brought on by sustained high temperatures and little rain, has seized a swathe of the country and left farmers with little remedy. Across Montana’s northern border and east into North Dakota, farms are turning out less wheat than last year, much of it poorer quality than normal.  Most farmers in and around the Fort Peck Reservation agree that climate change is to blame for the sudden drought and ruined crops, but that doesn’t change the fact that farmers and others who make their living off of agriculture are now subject to shifting political winds and strained debate around the issue. “This is unprecedented,” says Tanja Fransen of the National Weather Service in Glasgow, a larger city just up the road from Fort Peck. “This is as dry as it’s been in recorded history and some of our recording stations have 100 years of data. A lot of people try to compare this to previous years, but really, you just can’t.” Adnan Akyuz, the state climatologist for North Dakota, describes the unusual drought in terms that are reminiscent of descriptions of deluge brought on by Hurricane Harvey. “It is safe to say, we got into it very fast, which caught us off guard and we didn’t know it was going to continue,” he says. Akyuz said that March through July was the third-driest five months on record in North Dakota since 1895, a dire situation impossible to predict given traditional methods of weighing snowpack with average seasonal temperatures to monitor for potential drought. But in the future, unpredictable may be the best prediction. “We should expect these swings and incorporate these swings into our management plans,” said Akyuz. As of late August, the US Drought Monitor classified all of Montana in some stage of drought, with 65% of the state’s vast lands in “extreme” or “exceptional” drought.  “The new normal is that now we have a warmer world, in times when you’re not getting your normal load of rain, things can go bad very quickly,” said Brenda Ekwurzel, senior climate scientist with the Union of Concerned Scientists. Partly as a result of the drought, Montana is also dealing with one of its worst wildfire seasons on record. As of early September, wildfires have burned more than 1m acres – among the state’s top five most devastating fire seasons in terms of acres burned – and forecasts suggest the destruction will continue for weeks. In south-eastern Montana, cattle rancher Lillian Ostendorf explains taking turns on fire lookout duty, which entails sitting on top of a hill scanning the horizon, watching for smoke to flare up on the wide-open prairie. Fires come up quickly and move fast. Just last week, a fire that sparked on her family’s ranch spread several miles before it was put out. The situation requires constant, exhausting vigilance. “There’s lots of different stories about things starting fires right now. Everything from a horseshoe hitting a rock to lightning to vehicles going down the highway,” she says. John Youngberg, director of the Montana Farm Bureau Federation, says the extreme summer is forcing farmers and ranchers to make tough decisions every day about what they can salvage. Thus far, there’s no comprehensive estimate on agricultural losses this year in the region but the drought is taking a certain toll. “It’s a lot of pressure on people and it’s affecting people psychologically,” said Youngberg. Further to the north-west, in Jordan, near the heart of a now-contained Lodgepole Complex fire that burned 270,000 acres this summer, farmers and ranchers say the actual toll of the fire on livestock and future crops could take years to see. “We won’t know for months how the cattle were affected. We don’t know if they’ve burned their feet, or if they inhaled smoke and it affected their lungs. We have no idea,” says Teddy Roberston, a Garfield County commissioner who for 30 years made her living as a cattle rancher. “We’re tough and we have a lot of fight left in us, but it’s just going to take some time because we’ve never experienced such a catastrophic loss,” she added.  Outside of agriculture, wildfires have burned with devastating impacts. In late August, one of only two still-standing historic backpacker chalets in Glacier National Park was lost to a fire and the park has moved art and valuables from another historic lodge at Lake McDonald as fire approaches. Much of the state is blanketed by thick smoke, in some cases with air quality deteriorating to Beijing levels. Montana’s Democratic governor Steve Bullock has declared the entire state a fire disaster and warned that the battle will continue. “The reality is Montana is in a severe drought and the conditions are ripe for continued severe fires throughout September,” Bullock wrote in a Facebook post on Monday. Republican members of the state’s congressional delegation have instead blamed environmentalists for the summer of fire ruin. In an interview two weeks ago with Montana public radio, senator Steve Daines argued that lawsuits from environmental groups that prevent timber sales and logging are at fault for the massive fires.  On the ground, in places like Fort Peck, farmers are sharing the pain and resources. In North Dakota and eastern Montana, local hay-distribution programs are helping to ease the burden for those whose crops didn’t materialize. Akyuz says that while the political debate might continue, farmers and others directly affected by the disaster are figuring out how to make it through. Kirn, only one of the thousands of farmers and ranchers hit by the disaster, thinks this might be the end of his farming days. Irrigation is too expensive for small farming operations, leaving crops at the mercy of climate. “This is absolutely the worst year I’ve ever seen,” he says, gesturing across the barren fields."
"Mar-a-Lago. Trump National Doral Miami. Trump Palace. Trump Royale. Trump International Beach Resort Miami. Trump Hollywood.  These Trump-owned or Trump-branded properties are in south Florida, in the path of Hurricane Irma. All are exalted by the Trump Organization and by the president himself. All could be underwater by the end of the century. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (Noaa) predicts that the sea level will rise in south Florida by as much as 34in by 2050. The Southeast Florida Regional Climate Change Compact says the increase could be up to 81in by 2100. By 2045, according to a risk analysis prepared by Coastal Risk Consulting for the Guardian, the grounds of Mar-a-Lago could be under at least a foot of water for 210 days a year because of increased tidal flooding. The Palm Beach complex, which Trump has begun to call the “winter White House”, is a source of pride for the president. Having described the private resort as the “best club in the world”, he hosted the Japanese prime minister there in February. He also believes Mar-a-Lago has the best meatloaf in America. The main building at Mar-a-Lago will be safe – at least for 30 years – but the flooding will restrict access to the building and impact infrastructure, Coastal Risk Consulting said. The president, who is 71, is unlikely to be around to see that happen. But he could bear witness to repeated flooding of other Trump properties. In just 30 years’ time, the Trump Grande complex in Sunny Isles, Miami – consisting of the Trump Palace and Trump Royale condo buildings and the Trump International Beach Resort hotel – will be experiencing the effects of climate change. The resort could face tidal flooding and storm surges for 97 days a year, while its beaches could be badly affected by erosion. The Trump Hollywood condos, about 12 miles north of Miami, “could be turned into islands” for 140 days a year. Trump’s National Doral golf course is also at risk. In June the Orlando Sentinel reported that sea-level rise and associated flooding could cause severe damage. Even if the course remains intact, flooding would mean fewer days where the National Doral is actually playable. In his book Crippled America – “The rhetoric of this book is both tired and tiring in equal measure,” according to Kings Review – Trump said, without explaining his reasoning, that he does not believe in climate change.  When the Guardian asked him about it in 2015, he would not respond. Trump has previously described the concept of climate change as a “hoax” invented by “the Chinese”. Despite those beliefs, in 2016 Trump applied for planning permission to build a two-mile long wall on the beach next to his golf course in Doonbeg in Ireland. The application said the wall was necessary because of global warming and rising sea levels."

"Emissions from the electricity sector in the three months to June dropped by the biggest amount on record, as the effect of the Hazelwood coal-fired power station closure is seen for the first time in quarterly projections produced exclusively for the Guardian. But even that drop wasn’t enough to stop Australia’s overall greenhouse gas emissions from continuing to rise. Emissions from almost every other sector – industrial energy, transport, industrial heat and agriculture – all rose. They are the highest levels seen since before the carbon tax was repealed, according to projections by consultants at Ndevr Environmental.  The results mean Australia has now consumed 24% of its carbon budget set by the government’s Climate Change Authority – the total amount of carbon it can release from 2013 while doing its fair share to keep global warming under 2C. Once a certain amount of carbon goes into the atmosphere, warming over 2C will be inevitable. The report replicates the government’s methodology for its National Greenhouse Gas Inventory quarterly reports, which the government traditionally delays releasing for up to nine months, and has in the past saved up and released quietly in a batch just before Christmas. Australia’s overall greenhouse gas emissions over the year to June 2017 were the highest since 2011, with emissions rising steadily since the carbon tax was repealed in 2014. The most recent quarter – the three months to June 2017 – also had the highest emissions for any June quarter since 2011, rising to 3m tonnes more than the same quarter last year.  However, emissions from electricity dropped significantly, by about 4.3m tonnes compared with the previous quarter, or about 2m tonnes compared with the June quarter last year. The drop was mostly due to the closure on 1 April of the Hazelwood power station, which was Australia’s most polluting generator. Increased generation from Snowy Hydro in the quarter also contributed to the lower emissions from the electricity sector, said Stephen Christos from Ndevr Environmental. But that reduction was overwhelmed by other sectors, which all increased or stayed stable.  The most notable increase was in the “stationary energy” sector, which includes fuel burned for heat and energy in industry other than electricity. Emissions for stationary energy were the second-highest on record in the most recent quarter’s projections, having risen steeply over the past year. Among the significant factors pushing up the emissions in stationary energy are the three huge LNG production and export facilities in Queensland, which are also responsible for Australia’s tight and expensive domestic gas market. The liquefying and exporting of huge volumes of Australia’s gas has left the domestic market with relatively little gas, pushing up costs for consumers. The drop in emissions from electricity over the past 12 months was cancelled out by the increase in emissions from stationary energy, with electricity dropping by 5.3m tonnes and stationary energy growing by 5.8m tonnes. Transport emissions also rose significantly – by more than 2.2m tonnes above the same quarter last year.  The results are drawing Australia further from its carbon reduction targets made after the Paris climate agreement, which was adopted in December 2015. Compared with a hypothetical situation where Australia cut its emissions linearly from when they were made according to its commitment, Australia’s most recent quarterly emissions are now exceeding its Paris commitments by 5.53m tonnes, and exceeding the science-based cuts recommended by the Climate Change Authority by 14.74m tonnes."
"What can we say about the role of climate change in the unprecedented disaster that is unfolding in Houston with Hurricane Harvey? There are certain climate change-related factors that we can, with great confidence, say worsened the flooding.  Sea level rise attributable to climate change – some of which is due to coastal subsidence caused by human disturbance such as oil drilling – is more than half a foot (15cm) over the past few decades (see here for a decent discussion). That means the storm surge was half a foot higher than it would have been just decades ago, meaning far more flooding and destruction. In addition to that, sea surface temperatures in the region have risen about 0.5C (close to 1F) over the past few decades from roughly 30C (86F) to 30.5C (87F), which contributed to the very warm sea surface temperatures (30.5-31C, or 87-88F).  There is a simple thermodynamic relationship known as the Clausius-Clapeyron equation that tells us there is a roughly 3% increase in average atmospheric moisture content for each 0.5C of warming. Sea surface temperatures in the area where Harvey intensified were 0.5-1C warmer than current-day average temperatures, which translates to 1-1.5C warmer than “average” temperatures a few decades ago. That means 3-5% more moisture in the atmosphere.  That large amount of moisture creates the potential for much greater rainfalls and greater flooding. The combination of coastal flooding and heavy rainfall is responsible for the devastating flooding that Houston is experiencing.  Not only are the surface waters of the Gulf of Mexico unusually warm right now, but there is a deep layer of warm water that Harvey was able to feed upon when it intensified at near record pace as it neared the coast. Human-caused warming is penetrating down into the ocean. It’s creating deeper layers of warm water in the Gulf and elsewhere. Harvey was almost certainly more intense than it would have been in the absence of human-caused warming, which means stronger winds, more wind damage and a larger storm surge. (As an example of how this works, we have shown that climate change has led to a dramatic increase in storm surge risk in New York City, making devastating events like Hurricane Sandy more likely.)  Finally, the more tenuous but potentially relevant climate factors: part of what has made Harvey such a devastating storm is the way it has stalled near the coast. It continues to pummel Houston and surrounding regions with a seemingly endless deluge, which will likely top out at nearly 4ft (1.22m) of rainfall over a days-long period before it is done.  The stalling is due to very weak prevailing winds, which are failing to steer the storm off to sea, allowing it to spin around and wobble back and forth. This pattern, in turn, is associated with a greatly expanded subtropical high pressure system over much of the US at the moment, with the jet stream pushed well to the north. This pattern of subtropical expansion is predicted in model simulations of human-caused climate change.  More tenuous, but possibly relevant still, is the fact that very persistent, nearly “stationary” summer weather patterns of this sort, where weather anomalies (both high-pressure dry hot regions and low-pressure stormy/rainy regions) stay locked in place for many days at a time, appears to be favoured by human-caused climate change. We recently published a paper in the academic journal Scientific Reports on this phenomenon.  In conclusion, while we cannot say climate change “caused” Hurricane Harvey (that is an ill-posed question), we can say is that it exacerbated several characteristics of the storm in a way that greatly increased the risk of damage and loss of life. Climate change worsened the impact of Hurricane Harvey."
"A gargantuan truck fills the driveway of Tori Amos’s Cornwall home. The surrounding countryside is tranquil – verdant hills, stone farm buildings, golden crops swaying in the late August sun – but a throng of activity greets us at the home/recording studio Amos shares with her producer husband, Mark Hawley. The van and attending crew, she says, curled up on the sofa in her library, are here to collect one of her beloved Bösendorfer pianos for an impending European tour. “She’s being put in her case,” explains Amos. “Hopefully with a nice blanket.” Amos was raised in Maryland, a Led Zeppelin-loving daughter of a minister, and self-taught pianist who would jilt both church and conservatoire to forge her own sound in the 90s: wildly original, taboo-busting piano pop. She cut through grunge’s squall, playing two, sometimes three, piano keyboards simultaneously, while wearing 7in stilettos. Her music is celebrated enough to warrant the occasional benevolent ribbing – the animated series Bob’s Burgers recently had an Amos-esque woman using lyrics about an oil spill as a metaphor for her vagina – and has been an indelible influence on today’s musicians, acknowledged by Taylor Swift, Perfume Genius and Annie “St Vincent” Clark.  Native Invader, released this week, is Amos’s 15th studio album, some 25 years on from her solo debut Little Earthquakes. She is feeling “fortunate, blessed” about this benchmark. “But writing is still nerve-racking, mostly because I’m waiting for the muses to turn up.” She has jump-started the process in previous years; a penchant for hallucinogens, for example, is well documented. “Oh, I haven’t done those in a while,” says the 54-year-old. “I’m leaving that to the youth now.” Those 18-hour-long ayahuasca trips could be heavy going, says Amos, but nothing tested her creativity quite like the menopause. “That’s the harshest teacher I’ve met; harsher than fame. I was in the thick of it during [her 2014 album] Unrepentant Geraldines. But I’m on the other side of it now,” she smiles. “I can see possibilities again.” The “muses” saved her, but they took an age to show up. “And when they weren’t there, I was a stranger to myself.” It was a trip through the Great Smoky Mountains, her late Cherokee grandfather’s ancestral lands, last autumn that grounded her. Trekking through the Appalachian sub-range (a stretch that bridges North Carolina and Tennessee), she imagined her “Poppa” as a boy, treading those same routes. “In that moment, we shared something; seeds were planted. I didn’t recognise them at the time, though. It was very humbling.” Poppa’s influence runs deep on Native Invader, peaking in the urgent thrum of the album’s standout single, Up the Creek. When she was a girl, Poppa taught her about songlines – the sacred navigational paths of the indigenous folk. “We’d take walks. He’d smoke his pipe, tell me his people’s stories. There was no fanfare to it. I just drank it all in, like a weed.” Lineage and land, then, are dovetailing influences on this album. Resilience, too, the environmental kind – climate change hangs heavy – and the psychological, both in the face of Trump-era chaos. In the US last year, while working on a song for the Netflix teen drama Audrie & Daisy, Amos experienced the poison he has spread first-hand. “I remember flying into Florida and sitting next to a woman who chanted, ‘Lock her up!’ the whole way there. Oh! Such hate,” she says. “After that, I began to see the polarities; people unfriending family members on Facebook …” The schisms bore an unsettling similarity to Poppa’s accounts of post-civil war life, gleaned from his mother, Little Margaret, a formidable, tomahawk-wielding matriarch who had evaded the forced relocation of Native Americans by means of taking refuge in the Smokies. “I remember Poppa telling me how cousins would fight cousins, how some families still hadn’t healed, a hundred or so years later. The similarities terrified me. I cocooned myself there for a minute, and the muses weren’t coming.” In January, Amos’s 88-year-old mother, Mary Ellen, had a stroke, “and everything changed”. Before the attack, which has left Mary unable to speak and requiring round-the-clock care, mother and daughter had spoken often. About the election? “About everything.” Doctors say it’s difficult to assess the damage, “but I believe she’s still with us,” says Amos gently. “She remembers songs, certain hymns, the Beatles’ Penny Lane. She was, is, such a believer that all things can be healed by taking a walk; that all the answers are there, in nature. To see Mary under attack from this stroke, and to see America herself, Lady Liberty, under attack – it’s a terrible parallel.” Matriarchal power – in deities, myths, archetypes – has been a perpetual touchstone in Amos’s work, and is still present; I notice a pack of tarot-like Goddess Oracle cards on her library desk. Post-menopause, she is discovering a “different kind of fertility” in her work. She is honouring Gaia, and pulling no punches when it comes to naming the would-be architects of her destruction: “Those pimps in Washington, raping the land,” she sings on Benjamin, a track on the new album. “I think mother earth is being incredibly resilient against a government that seems hell-bent on exploiting her resources,” she says. “So she is under attack, and yet, when I walk in her bounty, I don’t get the sense that she’s giving up, or defeated. I do sense that [feeling] in people though.” She says that paranoia and fear permeated the tours for her post-9/11 album, Scarlet’s Walk, but she’d encountered the “smell, the taste” of political influence, years before, playing to piano bar lobbyist crowds in Georgetown, Washington, throughout her teens. “I was at a very impressionable age, performing for people making huge backroom decisions about the country. That was back when [Trump’s Supreme Court appointee] Neil Gorsuch’s mother was head of the Environmental Protection Agency. Iran-Contra; Weinberger – I played through all of that.” Remaining creative in the face of the machine, she says, is vital. “You can’t beat a bully at his own games. And I’m not talking about one particular bully here; it’s energy. You have to out-create the destruction – it’s the only way.” But first, says Amos, the US must face its shame: its crimes against the First Nations, from Andrew Jackson’s 1830 Indian Removal Act to the bulldozers that crushed the Standing Rock protests this February. “I’m not in a position to speak for First Nation people – that’s a sacred task. But, as an observer, it seems to me that, unlike Germany, we’ve never had to really face our holocaust. Until we do that, the healing can’t begin.” In the Smokies, she encountered locals who were oblivious to the land’s fraught history and had no idea they were inhabiting sacred songline territory. The ignorance she encountered stunned her and left her meditating on her own complicated lineage: a family tree that includes both Native Americans and Confederate soldiers. It was Amos’s physician sister, Marie Amos Dobyns, a member of the Association of American Indian Physicians, who prompted the pilgrimage. “Marie’s a big believer in championing the voiceless; I didn’t truly understand that until Mary lost hers.” Dobyns has forged deep friendships in the Native-American medicine communities over the years, says Amos, kinships she has been generous enough to share with Amos. “I call them the ‘Seattle sweat lodge sisters’. There’s nothing I’ve experienced like [sitting in a sweat lodge with them]; you feel so nurtured, so given to. But there’s a nakedness, a vulnerability, you have to bring to it in order to receive that.” Vulnerability – men’s, in particular – is tackled compassionately on the Native Invader song Wings: “Sometimes, big boys, they need to cry.” Is she referencing anyone in particular here? “Oh, I see it all around me: in my marriage, in my crew.” Men can spend hours gabbing in the pub, Amos says, without ever articulating their feelings. When, I wonder, did Trump last cry? Would we all be safer from the epidemic of toxic white masculinity – Charlottesville, Dylann Roof, “fire and fury” – if men could own their fragility? “Listen, we have all heard men being called a certain female body part when they cry. And we all know the real power of that body part; talk about a multitasker! Emotional vulnerability takes bravery. Great male leaders through the ages have understood this.” Trump’s most bilious voters – the ones who invoke God’s name with white hoods and burning crosses – are anything but brave, says Amos, and definitely not true, compassionate Christians. As a former Jesus groupie, or “recovering Christian” as her Boys for Pele-era tour T-shirts touted, Amos is uniquely qualified to know. “Some of Mary’s carers, they really walk the walk. They practise their faith on a daily basis and they glow with it. Mary had – has – that glow, that containment, too. But she’s got a fight on her hands now, to stay on the planet.” On her impending tour, how will Amos endure the miles between mother and daughter? Will she cut things short should the worst happen? “It’s day-to-day right now,” she says, after a long, heavy pause. “I’ve been doing music since I was two and a half; it’s the thing that makes sense to me.” And yet, at her peak, Amos didn’t always make sense to her critics. In the 90s, her genius was frequently couched in misogynistic backhanders by the music press: she was a “weird chick” in Q; a “Grade-A, class-one, turbo-driven fruitcake” in the NME. “And they weren’t all men, those critics,” Amos points out wryly. But she persisted, and here she is now, 15 albums in – still touring, still creating, still defiant."
"It is not only Donald Trump’s government that censors the discussion of climate change; it is the entire body of polite opinion. This is why, though the links are clear and obvious, most reports on Hurricane Harvey have made no mention of the human contribution to it. In 2016 the US elected a president who believes that human-driven global warming is a hoax. It was the hottest year on record, in which the US was hammered by a series of climate-related disasters. Yet the total combined coverage for the entire year on the evening and Sunday news programmes on ABC, CBS, NBC and Fox News amounted to 50 minutes. Our greatest predicament, the issue that will define our lives, has been blotted from the public’s mind. Almost certainly, according to a statement issued by the World Meteorological Organization on Tuesday. “Climate change means that when we do have an event like Harvey, the rainfall amounts are likely to be higher than they would have been otherwise,” the UN organisation’s spokeswoman Clare Nullis told a conference. Nobody is arguing that climate change caused the storm, but it is likely to have made it much worse. Warmer seas evaporate more quickly. Warmer air holds more water vapour. So, as temperatures rise around the world, the skies store more moisture and dump it more intensely. The US National Weather Service has had to introduce a new colour on its graphs to deal with the volume of precipitation. Harvey surpassed the previous US record for rainfall from a tropical system, as 49.2 inches was recorded at Mary’s Creek at Winding Road in Southeast Houston, at 9.20am on Tuesday. There is a proven link – known as the Clausius-Clapeyron equation – that shows that for every half a degree celsius in warming, there is about a 3% increase in atmospheric moisture content. This was a factor in Texas. The surface temperature in the Gulf of Mexico is currently more than half a degree celsius higher than the recent late summer average, which is in turn more than half a degree higher than 30 years ago, according to Michael Mannof Penn State University. As a result there was more potential for a deluge. Yes, the storm surge was greater because sea levels have risen 20cm as a result of more than 100 years of human-related global warming. This has melted glaciers and thermally expanded the volume of seawater. This is not an accident. But nor (with the exception of Fox News) is it likely to be a matter of policy. It reflects a deeply ingrained and scarcely conscious self-censorship. Reporters and editors ignore the subject because they have an instinct for avoiding trouble. To talk about climate breakdown (which in my view is a better term than the curiously bland labels we attach to this crisis) is to question not only Trump, not only current environmental policy, not only current economic policy – but the entire political and economic system. It is to expose a programme that relies on robbing the future to fuel the present, that demands perpetual growth on a finite planet. It is to challenge the very basis of capitalism; to inform us that our lives are dominated by a system that cannot be sustained – a system that is destined, if it is not replaced, to destroy everything. To claim there is no link between climate breakdown and the severity of Hurricane Harvey is like claiming there is no link between the warm summer we have experienced and the end of the last ice age. Every aspect of our weather is affected by the fact that global temperatures rose by about 4C between the ice age and the 19th century. And every aspect of our weather is affected by the 1C of global warming caused by human activities. While no weather event can be blamed solely on human-driven warming, none is unaffected by it. We know that the severity and impact of hurricanes on coastal cities is exacerbated by at least two factors: higher sea levels, caused primarily by the thermal expansion of seawater; and greater storm intensity, caused by higher sea temperatures and the ability of warm air to hold more water than cold air. Before it reached the Gulf of Mexico, Harvey had been demoted from a tropical storm to a tropical wave. But as it reached the Gulf, where temperatures this month have been far above average, it was upgraded first to a tropical depression, then to a category one hurricane. It might have been expected to weaken as it approached the coast, as hurricanes churn the sea, bringing cooler waters to the surface. But the water it brought up from 100 metres and more was also unusually warm. By the time it reached land, Harvey had intensified to a category four hurricane. We were warned about this. In June, for instance, Robert Kopp, a professor of Earth sciences, predicted: “In the absence of major efforts to reduce emissions and strengthen resilience, the Gulf Coast will take a massive hit. Its exposure to sea-level rise – made worse by potentially stronger hurricanes – poses a major risk to its communities.” To raise this issue, I’ve been told on social media, is to politicise Hurricane Harvey. It is an insult to the victims and a distraction from their urgent need. The proper time to discuss it is when people have rebuilt their homes, and scientists have been able to conduct an analysis of just how great the contribution from climate breakdown might have been. In other words, talk about it only when it’s out of the news. When researchers determined, nine years on, that human activity had made a significant contribution to Hurricane Katrina, the information scarcely registered. I believe it is the silence that’s political. To report the storm as if it were an entirely natural phenomenon, like last week’s eclipse of the sun, is to take a position. By failing to make the obvious link and talk about climate breakdown, media organisations ensure our greatest challenge goes unanswered. They help push the world towards catastrophe. Hurricane Harvey offers a glimpse of a likely global future; a future whose average temperatures are as different from ours as ours are from those of the last ice age. It is a future in which emergency becomes the norm, and no state has the capacity to respond. It is a future in which, as a paper in the journal Environmental Research Letters notes, disasters like Houston’s occur in some cities several times a year. It is a future that, for people in countries such as Bangladesh, has already arrived, almost unremarked on by the rich world’s media. It is the act of not talking that makes this nightmare likely to materialise. In Texas, the connection could scarcely be more apparent. The storm ripped through the oil fields, forcing rigs and refineries to shut down, including those owned by some of the 25 companies that have produced more than half the greenhouse gas emissions humans have released since the start of the Industrial Revolution. Hurricane Harvey has devastated a place in which climate breakdown is generated, and in which the policies that prevent it from being addressed are formulated. Like Trump, who denies human-driven global warming but who wants to build a wall around his golf resort in Ireland to protect it from the rising seas, these companies, some of which have spent millions sponsoring climate deniers, have progressively raised the height of their platforms in the Gulf of Mexico, in response to warnings about higher seas and stronger storms. They have grown from 40ft above sea level in 1940, to 70ft in the 1990s, to 91ft today. This is not, however, a story of mortal justice. In Houston, as everywhere else, it is generally the poorer communities, least responsible for the problem, who are hit first and hit worst. But the connection between cause and effect should appeal to even the slowest minds. The problem is not confined to the US. Across the world, the issue that hangs over every aspect of our lives is marginalised, except on the rare occasions where world leaders gather to discuss it in sombre tones (then sombrely agree to do almost nothing), whereupon the instinct to follow the machinations of power overrides the instinct to avoid a troubling subject. When they do cover the issue, they tend to mangle it. In the UK, the BBC this month again invited the climate-change denier Nigel Lawson on to the Today programme, in the mistaken belief that impartiality requires a balance between correct facts and false ones. The broadcaster seldom makes such a mess of other topics, because it takes them more seriously. When Trump’s enforcers instruct officials and scientists to purge any mention of climate change from their publications, we are scandalised. But when the media does it, without the need for a memo, we let it pass. This censorship is invisible even to the perpetrators, woven into the fabric of organisations that are constitutionally destined to leave the major questions of our times unasked. To acknowledge this issue is to challenge everything. To challenge everything is to become an outcast. • George Monbiot is a Guardian columnist"
"As recovery begins on the islands of the Caribbean and Florida braces itself for an onslaught, Irma has stormed into the record books as the most powerful hurricane ever recorded in the Atlantic Ocean.  But such weather systems are far from a rarity. Hurricanes are a type of storm known as a tropical cyclone, which build from warm, moist air over the oceans.  Water evaporates, leaving behind a region of low pressure, which is then filled by surrounding air, explains Adrian Champion, an expert in climate systems from the University of Exeter. This causes more “new” warm air to rise into the cyclone, he explains. As this warm, moist air cools, it forms clouds, releasing energy back into the cyclone, helping it to develop.  Such systems form in the tropics as the water is warmer than elsewhere, therefore more easily evaporated. The “spin” of the hurricane is down to the rotation of the Earth affecting the movement of the air: since Irma formed north of the equator, it spins anticlockwise. Many different factors can cause the system to build. “What causes it to intensify [beyond a standard cyclone] is either that the ocean is unusually warm or there is further instability [such as strong winds] in the atmosphere,” said Champion. Depending on where these systems strike, they are given different names. “If they hit the Americas then they are called hurricanes, if they hit Asia they are called typhoons and if they hit Africa and Australia they are called cyclones,” said Champion.  But it is when these severe storms head towards land that interest generally gathers pace – a factor that has led to hurricanes and other tropical cyclones being given specific monikers to avoid confusion and help the public and the media to share information. The names themselves are allocated based on a system devised by the World Meteorological Organization – if a tropical cyclone is particularly deadly, as in the case of Hurricane Katrina, its handle will not be used again. The strength of a hurricane is marked by its category on what is known as the Saffir-Simpson scale, which reflects the wind speeds – and hence the level of damage expected once the cyclone strikes land.  While category 1 hurricanes are serious, expected to damage rooftops and bring down trees with wind speeds between 74 and 95mph, Hurricane Irma was initially at the top end of the scale, meeting criteria for a category 5 hurricane: winds of 157mph or more, catastrophic damage, power outages that could last for many weeks, and areas of land rendered uninhabitable for months.  But drastic though Irma is, one thing is for sure: the storm will pass. “The big thing is [hurricanes] only have this energy supply when they are over the oceans,” said Champion. “When they hit landfall they weaken and die away.”"

"Many of us share some dim apprehension that the world is flying out of control, that the centre cannot hold. Raging wildfires, once-in-1,000-years storms and lethal heatwaves have become fixtures of the evening news – and all this after the planet has warmed by less than 1C above preindustrial temperatures. But here’s where it gets really scary. If humanity burns through all its fossil fuel reserves, there is the potential to warm the planet by as much as 18C and raise sea levels by hundreds of feet. This is a warming spike of an even greater magnitude than that so far measured for the end-Permian mass extinction. If the worst-case scenarios come to pass, today’s modestly menacing ocean-climate system will seem quaint. Even warming to one-fourth of that amount would create a planet that would have nothing to do with the one on which humans evolved or on which civilisation has been built. The last time it was 4C warmer there was no ice at either pole and sea level was 80 metres higher than it is today.  I met University of New Hampshire paleoclimatologist Matthew Huber at a diner near his campus in Durham, New Hampshire. Huber has spent a sizable portion of his research career studying the hothouse of the early mammals and he thinks that in the coming centuries we might be heading back to the Eocene climate of 50 million years ago, when there were Alaskan palm trees and alligators splashed in the Arctic Circle. “The modern world will be much more of a killing field,” he said. “Habitat fragmentation today will make it much more difficult to migrate. But if we limit it below 10C of warming, at least you don’t have widespread heat death.” In 2010, Huber and his co-author, Steven Sherwood, published one of the most ominous science papers in recent memory, An Adaptability Limit to Climate Change Due to Heat Stress. “Lizards will be fine, birds will be fine,” Huber said, noting that life has thrived in hotter climates than even the most catastrophic projections for anthropogenic global warming. This is one reason to suspect that the collapse of civilisation might come long before we reach a proper biological mass extinction. Life has endured conditions that would be unthinkable for a highly networked global society partitioned by political borders. Of course we’re understandably concerned about the fate of civilisation and Huber says that, mass extinction or not, it’s our tenuous reliance on an ageing and inadequate infrastructure, perhaps, most ominously, on power grids, coupled with the limits of human physiology that may well bring down our world. In 1977, when power went out for only one summer day in New York, swaths of the city devolved into something like Hobbes’s man in a state of nature. Riots swept across the city, thousands of businesses were destroyed by looters and arsonists lit more than 1,000 fires. In 2012, when the monsoon failed in India (as it’s expected to do in a warmer world), 670 million people – that is, 10% of the global population – lost access to power when the grid was crippled by unusually high demand from farmers struggling to irrigate their fields, while the high temperatures sent many Indians seeking kilowatt-chugging air-conditioning. “The problem is that humans can’t even handle a hot week today without the power grid failing on a regular basis,” he said, noting that the ageing patchwork power grid in the United States is built with components that are allowed to languish for more than a century before being replaced. “What makes people think it’s going to be any better when the average summer temperature will be what, today, is the hottest week of the year in a five-year period and the hottest temperatures will be in the range that no one has ever experienced before in the United States? That’s 2050.” By 2050, according to a 2014 MIT study, there will also be five billion people living in water-stressed areas. “Thirty to 50 years from now, more or less, the water wars are going to start,” Huber said. In their book Dire Predictions, Penn State’s Lee Kump and Michael Mann describe just one local example of how drought, sea level rise and overpopulation may combine to pop the rivets of civilisation: “Increasingly severe drought in West Africa will generate a mass migration from the highly populous interior of Nigeria to its coastal mega-city, Lagos. Already threatened by rising sea levels, Lagos will be unable to accommodate this massive influx of people. Squabbling over the dwindling oil reserves in the Niger river delta, combined with potential for state corruption, will add to the factors contributing to massive social unrest.” “Massive social unrest” here being a rather bloodless phrase masking the utter chaos coming to a country already riven by corruption and religious violence. “It’s sort of the nightmare scenario,” said Huber. “None of the economists is modelling what happens to a country’s GDP if 10% of the population is refugees sitting in refugee camps. But look at the real world. What happens if one person who was doing labour in China has to move to Kazakhstan, where they aren’t working? In an economic model, they’d be immediately put to work. But in the real world, they’d just sit there and get pissed. If people don’t have economic hope and they’re displaced, they tend to get mad and blow things up. It’s the kind of world in which the major institutions, including nations as a whole, have their existence threatened by mass migration. That’s where I see things heading by mid-century.” And it doesn’t get any better after 2050. But forecasts about the disintegration of society are social and political speculations and have nothing to do with mass extinctions. Huber is more interested in the hard limits of biology. He wants to know when humans themselves will actually start to disintegrate. His 2010 paper on the subject was inspired by a chance meeting with a colleague. “I presented a paper at a conference about how hot tropical temperatures were in the geological past and [University of New South Wales climate scientist] Steve Sherwood was in the audience. He heard my talk and he started asking himself the very basic question: ‘How hot and humid can it get before things start dying?’ It was literally just an order of magnitude kind of question. I guess he thought about it and realised that he didn’t know the answer and wasn’t sure anyone else did either… Our paper really wasn’t motivated by the future climate per se, because when we started we didn’t know if there was any kind of realistic future climate state that would fall within this habitability limit. When we started, it was just like, ‘We don’t know. Maybe you have to go to, like, 50C global mean temperature.’ Then we ran a whole set of model results and it was rather alarming to us.” Sherwood and Huber calculated their temperature thresholds using the so-called wet-bulb temperature, which basically measures how much you can cool off at a given temperature. If humidity is high, for instance, things like sweat and wind are less effective at cooling you down and the wet-bulb temperature accounts for this. “If you take a meteorology class, the wet-bulb temperature is calculated by basically taking a glass thermometer, putting it in a tight wet sock and swinging it around your head,” he said. “So when you assume that this temperature limit applies to a human, you’re really kind of imagining a gale force wind, blowing on a naked human being, who’s doused in water, and there’s no sunlight, and they’re immobile and actually not doing anything other than basal metabolism.” Today, the most common maximums for wet-bulb temperatures around the world are 26C to 27C. Wet-bulb temperatures of 35C or higher are lethal to humanity. Above this limit, it is impossible for humans to dissipate the heat they generate indefinitely and they die of overheating in a matter of hours, no matter how hard they try to cool off. “So we were trying to get across the point that physiology and adaptation and these other things will have nothing to do with this limit. It’s the easy-bake oven limit,” he said. “You cook yourself, very slowly.” What that means is that this limit is likely far too generous for human survivability. “When you do real modelling, you hit a limit much sooner, because human beings aren’t wet socks,” he said. According to Huber and Sherwood’s modelling, 7C of warming would begin to render large parts of the globe lethally hot to mammals. Continue warming past that and truly huge swaths of the planet currently inhabited by humans would exceed 35C wet-bulb temperatures and would have to be abandoned. Otherwise, the people who live there would be literally cooked to death. “People are always like, ‘Oh, well, can’t we adapt?’ and you can, up to a point,” he said. “It’s just after that point that I’m talking about.” Already in today’s world, heated less than 1C above preindustrial times, heatwaves have assumed a new deadly demeanour. In 2003, two hot weeks killed 30,000 people in Europe. It was called a once-in-500-year event. It happened again three years later (497 years ahead of schedule). In 2010, a heatwave killed 15,000 people in Russia. In 2015, nearly 700 people died in Karachi alone from a heatwave that struck Pakistan while many were fasting for Ramadan. But these tragic episodes are barely a shade of what’s projected. “In the near term – 2050 or 2070 – the US Midwest is going to be one of the hardest hit,” said Huber. “There’s a plume of warm, moist air that heads up through the central interior of the US during just the right season and, man, is it hot and sticky. You just add a couple of degrees and it gets really hot and sticky. These are thresholds, right? These aren’t just like smooth functions. It gets above a certain number and you hurt yourself very badly.” China, Brazil, and Africa face similarly infernal forecasts, while the already sweltering Middle East has what Huber calls “existential problems”. The first flickers of this slow-motion catastrophe might be familiar to Europeans struggling to accommodate the tens of thousands of refugees at their borders: the collapse and mass migration of Syrian society came after a punishing four-year drought. Still others have noted that the Hajj, which brings two million religious pilgrims to Mecca each year, will be a physically impossible religious obligation to fulfil due to the limits of heat stress in the region in just a few decades. But for the very worst-case emissions scenarios, heatwaves would not merely be a public health crisis or a “threat multiplier”, as the Pentagon calls global warming. Humanity would have to abandon most of the Earth it now inhabits. In their paper, Huber and Sherwood write: “If warmings of 10C were really to occur in the next three centuries, the area of land likely rendered uninhabitable by heat stress would dwarf that affected by rising sea level.” Huber said: “If you ask any schoolchild, ‘What were mammals doing in the age of the dinosaurs?’ they’d say they were living underground and coming out at night. Why? Well, heat stress is a very simple explanation. Interestingly, birds have a higher set-point temperature – ours is 37C, birds’ is more like 41C. So I actually think that’s a very deep evolutionary relic right there. Because that wet-bulb temperature was probably maxing out around 41C in the Cretaceous, not 37C.” Back at the diner in New Hampshire, Huber told me about his “favourite story”: the US Army’s real-life parable of the so-called Motivated Point Man. In 1996, a platoon of light infantry spent days in the Puerto Rican jungle acclimatising to stifling heat and humidity, cautiously monitoring their water intake before simulating a night-time raid. The platoon included “some of the most fit and motivated soldiers in the battalion”. When the evening of the raid came, the platoon leader began leading his troops through the jungle, machete-ing a path through the brush. Before long, he was felled by fatigue and delegated his leadership to an underling. When the second private failed to advance the platoon quickly enough, the platoon leader demanded to lead again. But soon he found himself hyperthermic and unable to walk. His soldiers had to douse him in cold water and supply him with intravenous infusions. Eventually, four soldiers had to carry him. Before long, the extra demands vitiated the entire platoon, all of whom began to fall prey to heat stress. The exercise had to be called off before it became a massacre. “So I look at that as, if it’s night-time and acclimatised, fit people can just disintegrate into a pool of useless people on stretchers. That’s what I see happening to society, to cultures,” Huber said. “If you want to know how mass extinctions happen, that’s how. So when people talk about the Pleistocene megafauna extinctions and Clovis people, sometimes they act like it’s a mystery how these things happen. But it happens in exactly the same way. You have something tearing apart the strongest members, the weaker ones try to fill in the gaps, they’re really not strong enough to take it and the whole thing collapses. “You want to know how societies collapse?” Huber said. “That’s how.” Extracted from Ends of the World by Peter Brannen is published by Oneworld Publications (£18.99).

"In 50 years, the region near where I grew up, Cameron Parish in south-west Louisiana, will likely be no more. Or rather, it will exist, but it may be underwater, according to the newly published calculations of the Louisiana government. Coastal land loss is on the upswing, and with each hurricane that sweeps over the region, the timeline is picking up speed. As a result, Cameron, the principal town in this 6,800-person parish (as counties are called in Louisiana), could be the first town in the US to be fully submerged by rising sea levels and flooding. So it’s here one would expect to feel the greatest sense of alarm over climate change and its consequences.   Instead, Cameron has earned a different kind of fame: it’s the county that, percentage-wise, voted more in favor of Trump than all but two other counties in the US in last year’s election. (Nearly 90% of registered voters did.) Why would some of the people most vulnerable to climate change vote for a politician skeptical of climate change’s existence? Why would people in Cameron Parish support policies that could ruin them? To get to the root of this question, I slipped my tennis shoes into knee-high marsh waders, navigated the ropes on a rusty shrimp boat, and ate mountains of fried seafood. I spoke to people living different and yet parallel lives in Cameron Parish, where timelines are defined as pre-storm or post-storm, and where people kindly addressed me as Miss Shannon. In rocking chairs and over lunch specials, I asked them about their seemingly contradictory views. I asked them why they voted for Donald Trump. And I asked them how they felt about being the proud residents of what may be America’s first drowning town. Tressie Smith is a 44-year-old mother of two and a business owner – her seafood restaurant is the most popular lunch spot in town. That popularity is aided by the fact that her would-be competition was all destroyed in hurricanes Rita (2005) and Ike (2008). The population of Cameron dropped a stunning 79% between 2000 and 2010. When the hurricanes hit, Smith was working for a cafe down the road. When it closed after the storms, Smith saw an opening. She bought a barber shop, tacked up naval-themed decorations and named her new business Anchors Up Grill, a wry nod to the local conditions. Her special is the “dynamite shrimp poboy”, a sandwich with jumbo shrimp grilled in a spicy sauce and covered in melted cheese and bacon, for $11. “Oh yeah, I’m concerned,” Smith says when asked about the future. “And the bad thing is they won’t give me any hurricane insurance. They said my building don’t qualify.” Her structure, with its glass and metal garage and creaky wooden trailer steps, stands out among the remaining buildings on the street, which are mostly bunker-like big cement city offices. If another storm hit, Anchors Up looks like it’d be the first to go. “They did insure me the first year we were open, but then, for no reason, they wouldn’t renew it,” she recalls. “But this is all I can do, because I had to mortgage my house and my land to get this. Because of the rules and regulations, it costs so much to live here.” Many locals in Cameron repeat this phrase – “rules and regulations”. They’re referring to the strict construction rules placed on residents who wanted to return to Cameron and rebuild after Rita and Ike hit the town. As a result, all structures needed to be raised in order to qualify for hurricane insurance. The result is a humble town whose homes appear strangely grandiose: single-story modest brick houses now rest on top of large, grassy man-made hills, a kind of south Louisiana castle. For 10 years, Smith was a truck driver, which gave her a particular vantage point from which to observe the coast. “I think the coast is disappearing, I really do. Because I traveled this road so much, driving for the oil fields. By the way it looks, it looks like the water is getting closer and closer.” But Smith stops short of offering an explanation. “I really don’t know what is causing it, I don’t know what you’d call it – erosion? I guess it’s probably caused by climate change, but I don’t really believe in the concept.” She pauses to sip her Coke, and reconsiders. She looks east down the road, where an $11bn- liquefied natural gas plant is slated to be constructed, once federal approval comes through. “But why would they be spending millions of dollars on those liquefied natural gas plants if the coast’s going to disappear? And they probably know a lot more than me.” As for her politics, Smith thinks Cameron’s residents voted for Trump because “we think he could help the oil field out, and hopefully stop the imported seafood from coming into our country so our people can make a living,” she says. Smith, like most of the residents of Cameron, has been highly dependent on state and federal assistance programs to recover after the storms. But what if, in Trump’s push to shrink the size of the government, recovery programs are cut? “We’d be screwed,” she says frankly. “But that doesn’t change my opinion about Trump,” she quickly adds. “Outsiders think that everybody is just looking for a handout down here, but there is hard-working people that live here. There are just not many jobs right now, especially if all you know is commercial fishing. Even if Trump cuts those programs that helped us, we gonna make it one way or another here, with or without help. Down here we survive.” Standing in green wading boots in shin-high water about 40 miles north of the Anchors Up Grill, Brandon Vail wipes the nitrogen pellets off of the inside of his glasses. A fertilizer plane has just passed over his rice field. Vail is a young, highly educated self-employed rice farmer who makes about $35,000 a year from farming. He works on 4,500 acres of land – corn, crawfish, cattle, hay, soy beans and rice – which he leases from 22 different landowners. But the arable land around where Vail farms is disappearing, as development sprawls and coastal loss creeps northward. “With the ground losses we have here, it doesn’t really pay to be really big for us. I do better to be diversified. I been losing ground to residential and commercial development, and also to mitigation land to make room for that. So over the last four years, I’ve lost about 1,000 acres. Some people have lost more.” He’s not optimistic about the future of farming. “This year is my 19th crop. I probably picked a poor career choice because I can see the writing on the wall. If I had kids I wouldn’t want them doing what I’m doing in this area. I don’t think farming will be a viable industry in this area 50 years from now. I may be wrong. I hope I’m wrong.” Vail is a registered Republican, and he gets heated when he thinks about how his fellow Trump voters are perceived from the outside. “Everyone thinks just because you’re from the south you’re a Confederate flag-waving drunk idiot. We’re not all like that. Some of us are educated. We just see things different from you.” He added: “My parents busted their ass and cut corners for me to go to private school. My sister is a complete Democrat. We’re Catholic. But I’m looked at like some kind of racist slaveholder. I’m lumped into that category. But we don’t fit.” Vail says he’s pleased with the drawdown on environmental restrictions that Trump has instituted since taking office. “When he took office he stopped the EPA’s Waters of the US rule, where anything that would flow into a navigable tributary would have had jurisdiction under the EPA. Well, navigable tributaries go through half the land I farm. So you’re saying a ditch I put in my field to drain the water off, then that the land comes under your jurisdiction? You can tell me when I can go into it, and what I can use as fertilizer?”  He shakes his head in disgust. “Residents can go buy RoundUp, can send out their detergents and soaps and all this kind of runoff into downstream water, but then they want to blame the farmers?” Vail adds: “There’s not a farmer on earth that is going to ruin soil or water. We learn best management practices, and most of us will use those practices because it increases the bottom line. You can’t wait around for some bureaucrat to tell you what you can and can’t do.” “I’m gonna let you in on a little secret,” Mr Benny says, as he leans close enough that his worn white baseball cap shades the afternoon sun on my face. “I’m the luckiest man in the world.” Seventysomething Benny Welch lives across from the oceanfront marsh in Cameron Parish, just behind a big oak tree, whose limbs he clung to through the night in 1957 when Hurricane Audrey hit, sweeping his family out of their home and him – fortuitously – into a wishbone-shaped crevice of branches, the only thing left standing when it was all over.  Mr Benny – as everyone refers to him here – spends his days strolling through a garage packed with boxes overflowing with severed alligator parts. He and his family make their money hunting alligators, and then selling the otherwise discardable pieces of the alligator bodies – the styrofoam-like handles of perforated jawbone, the scaly claws with ladylike fingernails, the phallic-shaped teeth stained brown with age. The Welch family have done well for themselves thanks to a number of contracts with gas stations around the south, whose clients impulse purchase the alligator-tooth necklaces as they pay for their Big Gulps. He shows me one of the most popular pieces: an alligator tooth surrounded by rectangular beads stamped with the Confederate flag. But business wasn’t always so good. The double-hit of hurricanes in 2005 and 2008 “turned the marshes upside down”, he recalls. “We didn’t know what what to do, there was no alligator eggs for three years.” Mr Benny’s son lets me know that their alligator hunting business has brought in a high-end clientele. He brings out a photo of a grinning Donald Trump Jr taken during an alligator hunting trip. That personal connection has helped inform Mr Benny’s politics. “I’m Donald Trump all the way,” he says with a smile. Even though Mr Benny’s family has been directly impacted by hurricanes, and even though the state mapping agency indicates that his home will be submerged within 50 years due to coastal land loss, Mr Benny isn’t buying it. “I don’t believe it,” he says, shaking his head. “I don’t believe that the tide is gonna rise 10 feet and that the Ice Age is coming and stuff like that.” Like many of the residents here in Cameron, Mr Benny sees time on a longer horizon than others might. “I been here 75 years, you understand?,” he reminds me with gentle force. “And I’ve lived on the water and guess what? The tides still come up almost the same way, and there is no flooding. And today our front marshes aren’t underwater.” “If you go by what the real scientists say, there’s no proof. In the last 10 years the average temperature of the world hasn’t even risen a half degree. And if you listen to everyone talking it, it’s up five or 10 degrees. And it’s not true! It’s a political thing. How much money has Al Gore made off global warming?,” he laughs, shaking his head with a cackle. “It ain’t happened yet!” Bronwen Theriot is the 36-year-old science teacher at South Cameron High School. She’s also a member of a group colloquially called the “die-hards”: residents who had their homes destroyed by Hurricane Rita in 2005, managed to rebuild, and then had their new homes destroyed again in 2008 by Hurricane Ike. And still, she made it home. “I came back every time. To the same place,” says Theriot, proudly. Theriot’s boyfriend works for the state, and so state policies on coastal subsidence are regular dinner conversation for the couple and their kids. “I’ve looked at those maps a million times,” she says, referring to the maps recently published by the state of Louisiana that show Cameron 50 years from today in the “red zone” – underwater. “I’ve looked at the aerial photos. I see how if we don’t do something to protect our coast we will have no coast to protect,” she says, matter-of-factly. “And it is evident if you take a ride around here.”  To the right of her home are a line of weed-bedraggled cement slabs, where her neighbors once lived; empty plots left by those driven away by the uninhabitability of this coast.  “From a scientific perspective,” she says, putting on her high school science teacher hat, “the map is showing you – look, this is going to happen. Compared to other places where they have stopped the erosion versus here where they haven’t, it’s clear that not enough is getting done. “But I don’t know what is causing the coastal depletion,” she says. “When it comes to depletion and subsidence, I feel like there are so many items it could be attributed to, and perhaps it is not one individual thing, but a lot of things adding up. “Do I think it is climate change? That’s hard,” she says, smiling. Theriot seems caught between her job as a science educator and her life as a longtime Cameron resident, tasked with teaching about the environment in a fiercely red town. “From a scientific perspective ... data is manipulated all the time. So whoever is interpreting the data, as much as you try to not have a bias, you could still have a bias. Of course, I am going to be more proactive about coastal restoration and protections because it is directly affecting me, so for me, looking at the data, I am very very worried.” She relents: “But I think the data is incomplete. And I am still not sure about climate change. I am still researching it. I feel like I don’t have enough good sources to say yes or no on if climate change is a real thing.” Now, from her elevated balcony overlooking the old slabs, she takes a clearer position. “I’m a big proponent of the oil industry, because that’s how my family and my community made a lot of its money. So that is my livelihood. So it is hard for me to point that finger.” The Louisiana shrimping season just opened this week, and as a lifelong shrimper and the owner of a couple boats and a dock, today should be a busy day for Leo Dyson, not a slow one. But the wind’s been blowing too hard to take out the boats, and so here he sits, perched on a pile of barnacle-crusted wood pallets. Dyson cares most about shrimp. “In these countries like China and everything, they work under communism where the government owns everything – the boats, the factories. In China, they raise their shrimp in sewage ponds they load with antibiotics, and that can cause cancer. We are one of the few countries that will even accept shrimp from China, and it doesn’t make sense that the FDA even allows that. But we gotta produce shrimp for the same price as them under free enterprise.” “So I think Trump will help this. I think he will make changes to the FDA and import tariffs and all that. I think he will make a more even playing field where everybody will still be able to make a living. So I voted for him because I thought he was the best man for the job.” Dyson is not particularly concerned about the forecasts that show the coast disappearing over the coming decades. He thinks global warming is a gossipy scam. “Too bad you’re not writing for the National Enquirer,” he teases, “because then you could say ‘fisherman sleeps with alien and causes global warming!’ “The fact is I’m 68. I’ve seen cold weather and I’ve seen hot weather. And you know the earth’s been through some ice ages. And when the ice ages was over, did they think it was global warming? A planet that doesn’t change becomes a barren waste, so that’s why it’s changing.” Instead, Dyson says that what worries him most are the environmental regulations ostensibly intended to save the coast. “The laws are already there to protect the coast. And I understand Trump is not 100% environmentalist. But I think it’s a good thing to get the government out of our lives. I don’t want any more environmental regulations. I don’t want any more fishing laws. And I don’t want a lot of restrictions where people can’t make a living.” Dyson says hurricanes aren’t all bad news in his line of work. “The wetland restoration is doing more to harm the ecosystem than if they left it alone. After [hurricanes] Rita and Ike we caught a lot of shrimp, because the levees were washed away and nature worked the way it was intended to, where man didn’t mess with it. These structures – the levees and all – are making it get worse every year. So for me having a hurricane would be good for business – for a little while. “If I thought global warming was real, I’d be the first to admit it,” he says, looking out across the rough water. “Because I’d be the first to see it. I’m here on the water after all. I could see how in 3,000 years we could be underwater, because I mean who knows, but in 50? I don’t think so. I was told that 50 years ago. Things don’t change much here.”"
"Have you ever seen a headless toad? If the answer is no, now is a good time to go out looking for one. You see, it is almost exactly at this time of year that they are becoming headless thanks to the actions of tiny parasites that are emerging from out of their bodies. It is with these creatures that I would like to begin this piece about the worthiness or worthlessness of parasites.  The toadfly Lucilia bufonivora is a small, nondescript fly not unlike a bluebottle. In spring it anoints a chosen toad with some eggs, which it lays on the toad’s nose. The maggots that come forth from these eggs climb into the toad’s nostrils, where they begin to eat its nasal passages along with its eyes and brain before bursting forth from the toad’s head, all at once, later in the year. The result is a headless toad torso. Look out for them. How do the maggots know when to emerge en masse from the toad’s head? The answer is that, as the maggots grow, they become primed like a bomb. They become temperature-sensitive. They use the toad’s cold-bloodedness against it, activating a mass migration from the toad’s head when temperatures regularly drop below 14C … or about now. At the exact moment you read this, thousands of toads are walking around in the countryside with a ticking time bomb in their head. Primed like this, each toad becomes the bomb-laden bus that must not drive slower than 50mph in the film Speed – except the passengers are the bad guys. And the passengers are obsessed with the weather. And there are thousands of buses. As weird as it sounds, I’ve become a big fan of toadflies. The same goes for mites, protozoa, worms, fleas and ticks. Parasites are de rigueur for life on Earth. It was only a matter of time before a group of scientists would have the gall to call for their conservation. This happened on Wednesday, opening up an interesting area of ethical debate about whether such animals as worms and ticks are worth saving. The research paper used parasite specimens from the Smithsonian Institution’s Museum of National History to map out the survival fortunes of 457 parasites from across the world. By applying a range of climate models to these species it was discovered that, as an average, we may lose 10% of our global parasite diversity by 2070. If you include host creatures, many of which are facing extinction, the number of threatened parasite species skyrockets to one in three. The hangers-on are only just hanging on, it seems, and so our parasite friends may come to need us more than ever, to ensure their survival. Can we learn to love them, I wonder, particularly when they so often appear to cause such pain and suffering to other creatures? Sure, we could do without the parasites that cause intense distress to humans and their livestock and pets, but what about the rest? Would this be a poorer world without the humble toadfly? Or the emerald wasp, which makes zombies out of cockroaches? Or the flatworm larvae, which cause frogs to grow extra legs so that they can be eaten by birds, the only host in which the adult flatworm can mate? Or the slug mite? Would we even notice if creatures like these disappeared overnight? The answer, as scientists are increasingly coming to understand, is yes, very probably. In many habitats on Earth, parasitism probably exceeds predation (preying on other species) as a means of acquiring energy for new life. In estuarine habitats, for instance, the number of parasitic trematode worms is higher than the biomass of estuarine birds. They have become the biomass upon which other things feed. In a curious sort of way, these creatures are now the life-givers. There are other examples. On some oceanic islands, the lice and ticks and fleas that seabirds bring with them provide life-giving sustenance to scorpions, lizards and spiders, bolstering biological diversity. In a series of tests involving experimental grass plots in the US, the bulk of the biomass feeding on the grass didn’t come from the herbivores above ground, but rather from the parasitic fungus below. The more we study parasites, they more we understand their value to ecosystems. They are not passengers within buses, in other words, but buses within bigger buses. And so I am happy to welcome parasites to the conservation debate. Though we may feel uncomfortable with having to include them, in time I suspect we will come to realise that they have a part to play, one that has gone overlooked and unrecognised. With more research, perhaps we will come to see the best of ourselves in them. Energy harvesters. Ecological dynamos. Bringers of life. Or perhaps they have new things to teach us, like how better we might use the planet’s resources without anyone ever really noticing we were there.

"Climate change could wipe out a third of all parasite species on Earth, according to the most comprehensive analysis to date. Tapeworms, roundworms, ticks, lice and fleas are feared for the diseases they cause or carry, but scientists warn that they also play a vital role in ecosystems. Major extinctions among parasites could lead to unpredictable invasions of surviving parasites into new areas, affecting wildlife and humans and making a “significant contribution” to the sixth mass extinction already under way on Earth.  The new research, published in Science Advances, used the collection of 20m parasites held at the Smithsonian Institution’s Museum of National History in the US to map the global distribution of 457 parasites. The scientists then applied a range of climate models and future scenarios and found that the average level of extinctions as habitats become unsuitable for parasites was 10% by 2070, but extinctions rose to a third if the loss of host species was also included. “It is a staggering number,” said Colin Carlson at the University of California, Berkeley, who led the new work. “Parasites seem like one of the most threatened groups on Earth.” The severity of the impact varied with the different climate scenarios. For example, a 20% loss of parasite native ranges in scenarios where carbon emissions are rapidly cut in the future rises to 37% if emissions continue unchecked.  “Parasites are obviously a hard sell,” said Carlson. “Even if you are grossed out by them – and there are obviously downsides for individual hosts and for humans – parasites play a huge role in ecosystems.” They provide up to 80% of the food web links in ecosystems, he said. Having a wide range of parasites in an ecosystem also means they compete with one another, which can help slow down the spread of diseases.  “If parasites go extinct, we are looking at a potential massive destabilisation of ecosystems [which] could have huge unexpected consequences,” Carlson said, with other parasites moving in to take advantage. “That doesn’t necessarily work out well for anyone, wildlife or humans.”  One example of the complex role parasites can play is a hairworm that lives in grasshoppers in Japan and tends to lead its host to jump into water, where the grasshoppers become a major food source for rare fish. “In some subtle ways, parasites are puppeteers,” Carlson said. The research analysed more than 50,000 records of the 457 parasite species, which the researchers believe provides a representative picture. But, with more than 300,000 species of parasitic worms alone known to exist, working out the specific impact of parasite extinctions on diseases is complex and remains to be done. “It is difficult to summarise the net consequence, as we know so little about most parasites,” Carlson said. “Climate change will make some parasites extinct and make some do better. But we would argue the overall phenomenon is dangerous, because extinctions and invasions go hand in hand.” Anna Phillips, the curator of the Smithsonian’s parasite collection, said: “As long as there are free-living organisms, there will be parasites. But the picture of parasite biodiversity in 2070 or beyond has the potential to look very different than it does today based on these results.”"
"Marine life on the Antarctic seabed is likely to be far more affected by global warming than previously thought, say scientists who have conducted the most sophisticated study to date of heating impacts in the species-rich environment. Growth rates of some fauna doubled – including colonising moss animals and undersea worms – following a 1C increase in temperature, making them more dominant, pushing out other species and reducing overall levels of biodiversity, according to the study published on Thursday in Current Biology.  The researchers who conducted the nine-month experiment in the Bellingshuan Sea say this could have alarming implications for marine life across the globe as temperatures rise over the coming decades as a result of manmade greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. Gail Ashton of the British Antarctic Survey and Smithsonian Environmental Research Center said she was not expecting such a significant difference. “The loss of biodiversity is very concerning. This is an indication of what may happen elsewhere with greater warning.” Sub-zero conditions near the south pole mean there are comparatively few species on the usually frozen land, but below the ice, the relative lack of pollution, traffic and fishing has left an abundance of marine life that divers and biologists compare to coral reefs. Previous studies of warming impacts have focused on single species, but the latest research examines an assemblage of creatures. Twelve identical 15cm sq heat plates were set in concrete on the seabed. Four were warmed by 1C, four by 2C and four left at ambient temperature as a control.  At 1C, a species of bryozoan moss (Fenestrulina rugula) became utterly dominant on the four plates. Within two months it reduced the evenness and diversity of the species spread. The researchers also found the marine worm Romanchella perrieri grew an average 70% larger than those under ambient conditions. At 2C, the results from different plates varied with different growth rates of different species. The researchers speculate that this may be because the higher increase in temperature had a greater shock impact. Ashton said further longer-term studies should be conducted but the overall trend was already clear. “The indication of change being more than anticipated is fairly reliable. This is the best data we have to date.” Until recently, most of the coverage of temperature rises has focused on the north pole, where the shrinking of arctic ice has been most visibly dramatic. But concerns are growing about the impact of global warming on the far bigger southern ice cap. Earlier this year, the United Nations weather agency announced that temperatures in the Antarctic recently hit a record high.  An Argentine research base near the northern tip of the continent recorded a balmy 17.5C in March 2015, the World Meteorological Organisation revealed.  The vast continent contains 90% of the world’s fresh water, most of it locked in ice that is several kilometres thick. The effects of climate change are not uniform, but concerns grew in July when a trillion tonne block of the Larsen C ice shelf collapsedinto the sea. The region is also steadily turning greener due to the increased growth of surface moss. UK-based scientists published a paper in May showing that growth rates of moss have accelerated more than fourfold since 1950. The latest study suggests the trend could become more evident on the sea bed as well as the land surface."
"The corporate backlash is growing against Donald Trump’s withdrawal from the Paris climate accord, with Mars launching a $1bn sustainability plan and an M&M’s campaign centred on renewable energy.  It is the latest climate move by the family owned firm, which emerged as a vocal critic of the US president’s decision to pull out of the 2015 climate pact, saying it was “disappointed” with the withdrawal and stressing that corporations could not go it alone when it came to tackling climate change.   Mars is now rolling out a $1bn (£771m) investment to help cut greenhouse gas emissions across its value chain by 67% by 2050, run a poverty reduction and sustainability programme for farmers and suppliers, and ramp up food safety and security efforts.  Chief executive Grant F Reid said: “This plan is about not just doing better, but doing what’s necessary. We’re doing this because it’s the right thing to do but also because it’s good business.  “We expect to have a competitive advantage from a more resource-efficient supply chain, and from ensuring that everyone in our supply chain is doing well.”  The Snickers, Twix, Milky Way and Skittles maker has also revealed plans to champion renewable energy through its M&M’s brand, featuring images of things such as wind turbines alongside its red and yellow candy characters.  Its sustainability investments and M&M’s campaign were announced ahead of the UN general assembly and climate week which will run from 18 to 24 September in New York.  Reid said: “If we are to help deliver on the targets agreed in Paris and the UN sustainable development goals, there has to be a huge step change.  “While many companies have been working on being more sustainable, the current level of progress is nowhere near enough.”  The Paris agreement aims to prevent the Earth from heating up by 2C since the start of the industrial age.  Since the world has already warmed about 1.1C since the Industrial Revolution, the accord aimed at making sure the threshold was not breached with each nation curbing heat-trapping emissions.  All but a very small number of scientists say warming is a result of human activity.  The chief executive added: “Mars has been in business for four generations and intends to be for the next four generations.  “The only way that will happen is if we do things differently to ensure that the planet is healthy and all people in our extended supply chains have the opportunity to thrive.” "
"Most of the east coast and parts of South Australia are at high risk of bushfire after one of the warmest, driest winters on record, a national conference has warned. Populated areas of Queensland, New South Wales, Victoria and South Australia have been marked “red” in the 2017 Southern Australia Seasonal Bushfire Outlook.  Weather experts and commissioners from each state’s rural fire services gathered in Sydney on Tuesday, warning residents in all states to be prepared for what is set to be a bad bushfire season. The outlook said most of Australia had above-average temperatures and below-average rainfall over winter and this had contributed to an elevated fire risk for the bulk of eastern and south Australian coasts. Australia has had its ninth driest winter on record, said Bureau of Meteorology climatologist David Jones, which has left greater fuel loads across southern Australia. The outlook said the warmer and drier than average weather over recent months, combined with the forecasts for spring, suggest that the southern fire season was likely to commence earlier than usual and be more active than normal. “[The] dry conditions now mean that vegetation is already dry with very low greenness evident in satellite data,” the report said. “The dry state of vegetation means that warm, windy conditions are likely to see more elevated fire risk than is normal for the time of year.” While the bureau expects more average rainfall levels in spring, it may not happen until well into the season.  The bureau has previously said Australia is set for a warm and dry spring with above-average temperatures expected for most parts of the country. After a string of balmy winter weeks, the chance of higher spring daytime temperatures is greater in the north and south-east of the country, it said. Australian Associated Press contributed to this report"
"Climate contrarians, like Trump’s EPA administrator Scott Pruitt and Energy Secretary Rick Perry, don’t understand how scientific research works. They are basically asking for a government handout to scientists to do what scientists are should already be doing. They are also requesting handouts for scientists who have been less successful in research and publications – a move antithetical to the survival of the fitness approach that has formed the scientific community for decades.  The helping handout would be through a proposed exercise called a “red team/blue team” effort. It is a proposal that would reportedly find groups of scientists on both “sides” of the climate issue (whatever that means), and have them try to poke holes in each others’ positions. I will explain why this is a handout but first let’s talk about the plan and how it interferes with the scientific process. I say that Pruitt and Perry don’t understand how science works because we are already doing “red team/blue team” exercises everyday in our normal line of business. Science works by challenging each other and our ideas. If we think that a colleague has made an error, we tend to be merciless and tenacious to correct the errors. This is part of the premise of the concept of peer review – where we send studies and manuscripts to journals to have other experts objectively review them for errors. So back to the basic premise of a red team/blue team exercise – basically the “red team” would critique some conclusion of a “blue team.” The blue team would be able to respond, and there would be this back and forth exchange. On its face it sounds pretty straightforward even though scientists are already doing that in the scientific literature. But how would this work in practice?  First, how would the red team and blue team members be selected? Would they be picked by Pruitt and Perry who have already demonstrated a commitment to unbridled fossil fuel usage? The red team would almost certainly be selected from the very small but vocal group of contrarian scientists and non-scientists who have failed in the scientific arena. The fact is, there are no credible scientists who doubt that human emissions of greenhouse gases cause global warming. They just don’t exist.  There are some “lukewarmist” scientists who think the problem won’t be that bad, but these “lukewarmers” have failed to provide compelling evidence in the scientific literature. In many instances, their work has been shown to be wrong, the mainstream scientists have evaluated their claims and found them lacking or faulty. And this is why 97% of the world’s top climate scientists agree with each other on climate change.  So forming a red team would basically amount to a governmental helping hand to scientists who have not succeeded in the scientific arena. Since they cannot compete in the cut-throat area of scientific research, they would be given a free pass by the government to circumvent the normal peer review process. Let’s be clear, the red team cannot make the case in the scientific arena so they would be given a free pass to make their claims in the political arena. What would the exercise look like? Well that isn’t clear. Some ideas have been floated such as a live debate. Perhaps a red team response to a summary article such as the National Climate Report made public recently by the New York Times? Would it be special earmarked funding for contrarians to perform research? Would it be an “official” U.S. government report that is written by the contrarians? We just don’t know. But regardless of its manifestation, the result would be that contrarian scientists – who have already failed to make their case – would have their voices elevated to an inappropriate position of equality with those scientists whose work has survived scrutiny. The public would simply see two groups of “scientists” opposing each other, making it difficult for non-experts to discern who is correct. Finally, it would promote political ideology over scientific quality. Science works by being competitive; the best ideas and the best scientists are rewarded. The failed scientists and scientific ideas are discarded. By giving a free handout to failure, it would create an environment where you don’t have to be good at your job; you just have to have the right politics. Conservatives generally view handouts and bailouts as an anathema. When they realize that what underlies the red team effort is really just a bailout to failed ideas, they will not be supportive.  What I would suggest the so-called red team do is start competing in the trade of our profession. Complete studies and publish papers which support your hypothesis. Subject your ideas to criticisms, see if your ideas survive scrutiny.  If your ideas are failures, don’t go looking to Uncle Sam for a handout. Try again, think deeper, work harder. That is what real scientists do."
"It is possible to be killed by floods in Mumbai, but not really to be surprised by them. On 29 August, the city was battered by a monsoon storm which left homes, highways and hospital floors submerged, and shut down the commuter railway which has to carry more people every day than live in Denmark. More than 20 people are dead: swept away or crushed as multi-storey buildings collapsed. Bodies are still washing ashore. Instead of feeling surprise, though, Mumbai treated the deluge like an unwelcome guest who keeps coming by and trashing the place. The most unnerving collective flashback was to 26 July 2005. Ferocious rainfall that day turned the city into a lethal aquatic obstacle course, which 700 people did not survive. That year’s flood, like this one, was followed by a flood of assurances from elected leaders, and civic pledges to protect waterways and mangroves, and renewed attention to how a metropolis built largely on tidal estuary and marine “reclamations” could so easily return to the water.  As Mumbai wades through deja vu, provinces further east are struggling to keep their heads above water, as they have been for weeks. Hundreds of villages have been abandoned in Bihar, West Bengal and Assam. The direct death toll may exceed 800 (no one is likely to count the lives lost or stunted in the longer term – the result of crops, homes and public works swept away in some of India’s poorest states). Like Mumbai, though, these are places accustomed to flooding. Some of the world’s largest rivers flow through them, and spill their banks each monsoon. The mutability of land and water is an essential trait of parts of Bengal and Assam, and a theme in their literature. Amitav Ghosh, the bard of this theme in the English language, wrote of Bengal’s mangrove forests: “Here, in the tide country, transformation is the rule of life: rivers stray from week to week, and islands are made and unmade in days.” So are the plains, on occasion. Floods in eastern India are often woven into tradition, as part of the cycle that rejuvenates fields, fish stocks and wetland forest. This inclines Indians to acceptance. “Don’t try to fight nature,” the actor Amitabh Bachchan tweeted on the night of 29 August, as the storm abated in Mumbai. “Don’t put blame.” Well, we do put blame, and object to state incompetence, reckless urbanisation and failures of disaster response. Afterwards, though, especially when watching from indoors, we cherish the monsoon’s show of strength and surplus, and feel the familiarity of the flood. This is a deadly mistake. In Mumbai and Assam, recent floods have occurred where flooding is traditional, but no longer for traditional reasons. The storm in Mumbai deposited 15% of the city’s annual rainfall in a single day. The same occurred on 21 August in Chandigarh, northern India. Bengaluru, in the south, received 30% of its annual average on 15 August – the heaviest rainfall recorded in the past century. Mumbai’s storm is classed as an “extreme rain event”. Climate change models predict that they will become more frequent and proliferate into parts of India never thought of as monsoon hotspots, where the pumps are even less likely to be primed. This is the new, turbulent nature of our monsoon: that we are receiving more and more of our rainfall in extreme doses (which causes floods), and less in between the major deluges, which is when fields are fed and water tables recharged. For India, more flooding and more drought are not two possible futures. Both are here together, already. The submergence of so much of India by this monsoon is not an expression of timeless natural rhythms or even classic state failures. Extreme rain events mean that, as environmental scientist Sunita Narain put it, “floods in the time of drought are India’s new normal”. Recognising this is integral to creating homes, farms and infrastructure which can survive the changing monsoon. The government of Narendra Modi was elected, in part, on a promise of economic development, which it has struggled to deliver. One way to defend our gains, in real terms, is by moving fast to help cities and districts adapt: both to control flooding and save lives, and to harvest heavy rainfall and save water. • Raghu Karnad is journalist and editor-at-large at The Wire"
"A dramatic period of global warming 56 million years ago that saw temperatures climb by up to five degrees and triggered extinctions of marine organisms was down to volcanic eruptions, researchers have revealed, in a study they say offers insights into the scale and possible impact of global warming today. One of the most rapid periods of warming in Earth’s history, the Palaeocene/Eocene Thermal Maximum (PETM), occurred as Greenland pulled away from Europe.   However, details of the quantities of carbon dioxide behind the warming and where it came from had remained unclear.  Now scientists say they have solved the puzzle, revealing that the main driver of the event was a gradual release of carbon dioxide through volcanic eruptions – findings, they say, that overturn a long-held view that the PETM mirrors the rapid rise in carbon emissions seen today. “[The PETM] was always regarded as the best natural analogue for current anthropogenic carbon emissions – but we have found that not even that event is a actually good analogue,” said Marcus Gutjahr, first author of the study from the Geomar-Helmholtz Centre for Ocean Research in Germany. “We are actually currently marching in unknown territory.” Writing in the journal Nature, Gutjahr and colleagues from the UK and US reveal how they unpicked the conundrum by combining computer simulations with an analysis of fossil shells from microscopic single-cell organisms found within a sediment core from the north-east Atlantic Ocean.  The team focused on the ratios of different forms – or isotopes – of oxygen, carbon and boron within the shells, the latter of which offers tell-tale clues about the ocean’s acidity, a measure affected by levels of carbon dioxide that dissolved from the atmosphere into the ocean. “These shells recorded the chemistry of the ocean in which [they] grew,” said Gutjahr. The carbon dioxide, he notes, could either have been pumped directly into the atmosphere through volcanic events or have formed from other carbon sources, such as underwater methane deposits or organic-rich sediments.  However, carbon dioxide from the different sources would have a very different impact on carbon isotope ratios. What’s more, while volcanic eruptions gradually release carbon dioxide over time, gases from methane deposits or sediments are released rapidly. Drawing these factors together with the level and duration of the increased ocean acidity, the team found that the carbon dioxide was probably released through volcanic eruptions, with such events accounting for up to 90% of the emissions. But, says Gutjahr, the study does not rule out the possibility of some very short, sudden releases of methane and other carbon sources. “The key things is the acidification took 20,000 years and if we had introduced enough methane over 20,000 years to keep the pH so low, then the carbon signature would be [very different to what we see],” he said.  The team were also able to calculate that overall between 10,200-12,200 petagrams of carbon were released into the atmosphere during the PETM – more carbon than is in the world’s total fossil fuel reserves – with rates of up to 0.58 petagrams of carbon released each year over 50,000 years. About 10 petagrams of carbon are currently released every year from fossil fuel emissions.  Daniela Schmidt, a professor of palaeobiology at the University of Bristol who was not involved in the study, said the study held a warning for the planet today.  “We know something which was smaller than what we are currently doing had profound biological implications,” she said. “We always assume that if something happens quicker and we have less time to adapt, the impact will be larger.” Mark Maslin, professor of geography at University College London, said the case for volcanic eruptions being behind the PETM was compelling, adding that the research suggests underwater sources of carbon, like methane deposits, might be more stable than previously thought and play a smaller role in climate change. But, he added, there are plenty of causes for concern, not least the rapid rate of carbon emissions today, and Earth’s current sensitivity to such changes, means the planet will not be able to adjust in the same way it did in the past. What’s more, he said, the potential loss of other carbon-rich deposits remains a serious issue. “We should still be worried about methane stored in the permafrost in the high Arctic,” he said."

" The Australian government’s science agency, the CSIRO, has paid tens of thousands of dollars to peak mining lobby group the Minerals Council of Australia, which fights against government action on climate change. The CSIRO has been listed as an “associate member” of the Minerals Council of Australia (MCA) since at least 2004 and new documents obtained by the Australian Institute, under freedom of information laws, show that in 2017 the “annual subscription” for membership was just under $10,000.  The mining lobby plays a vocal role in Australian climate change policy debates and the positions it takes are on the extreme end of the spectrum and include pushing for more coal power stations to be built. The CSIRO continues to be a member of the MCA despite even Australia’s biggest climate polluter, AGL, publicly parting ways with the Minerals Council of Australia in 2016, saying it did so because of the positions the MCA took on climate change. “AGL’s positions on climate change and renewable energy differed from those held by the Minerals Council of Australia ... and AGL has elected not to renew its membership,” the company said in its 2016 sustainability report. CSIRO declined to answer specific questions about how long it had been a member, what the cost had been and what the CSIRO got in return for membership. A CSIRO spokesman instead gave a statement, published in full below. The executive director of the Australia Institute, Ben Oquist, said: “The Minerals Council has been on the fringe of the climate and energy debate in Australia, opposing policies that would tackle emissions effectively. “It defies commonsense that the CSIRO, an organisation that researches climate change and develops renewable technology, gives money to a lobby group that campaigns against effective climate policy and against policies that would increase renewable energy.” CSIRO has come under fire in recent years for a perception it has not been giving fearless advice to the public and to government on climate-related issues. At the same time, the organisation has cracked down on employees who themselves seek to speak publicly on policy issues. Internal CSIRO emails leaked earlier this year show significant internal unrest over CSIRO’s failure to make a submission to the government’s consultation on greenhouse gas emissions targets in 2009. In one email, a CSIRO executive said it didn’t provide a submission because the “questions posed in the discussion paper are very policy-focused”. She said CSIRO would engage government agencies behind closed doors. But Oquist said one of MCA’s main functions is to lobby to change government policy. “In its 2013 annual report the MCA boasts it ‘was at the forefront of the debates over the carbon and mining taxes; and their abolition (expected after July 2014) will be in no small part due to the council’s determined advocacy on both issues’,” Oquist said. “While the commonwealth’s key scientific research organisation effectively funds political advocacy for the coal industry, it works to prohibit its own staff from commenting on national science policy.” John Church, a world-leading climate scientist who was made redundant in the organisation’s 2016 job cuts and who was one of the disgruntled employees in the leaked emails, told the Guardian CSIRO’s membership of the MCA was in contradiction to its refusal to engage in policy debates. “I would definitely say there was a conflict,” Church said. “CSIRO is putting itself in a position where it is implicitly supporting particular policy positions by being a member of the Minerals Council. “They should not only be independent but be seen to be independent.” A senior climate scientist still at the CSIRO told the Guardian that currently it is almost impossible for climate scientists there to speak publicly about policy. David Karoly, a climate scientist from the University of Melbourne and a former member of the government’s Climate Change Authority, said: “It’s a small amount of money but it is odd in my view that they are spending this level of funding on an organisation that is arguing against the conclusions the CSIRO has made about the science of climate change.” When asked about AGL’s move to quit the MCA, Tim Nelson, AGL’s head of economics, policy and sustainability, told the Guardian: “We think there’s a strong opportunity for all corporates and industry associations to document a very scientific approach to how they see the consistency of their industry and their business with the 2C goal that Australia has signed up to.” The Minerals Council of Australia website says “full membership” is given to companies “directly involved in mining, prospecting or contracting activities relating to the obtaining, concentrating, smelting ore refining of minerals.” They say “associate membership”, such as that held by the CSIRO, “is open to companies which carry on as their principal business the supply of equipment, materials, services or capital to a company eligible for full membership.” Other public organisations with associate membership of MCA include ANSTO Minerals and the University of Western Australia. A CSIRO spokesman gave the following statement: CSIRO has a long history collaborating with professional societies and bodies including industry associations. Memberships are an important part of our dialogue with a wide range of stakeholders by allowing us to build networks, share research results, collaborate on research projects, and generally help ensure the relevance and uptake of our research. No organisation we are a member of has authority to speak or act on behalf of CSIRO. Further, as standard practice CSIRO officers must work within relevant policies to ensure our independence and impartially. For example, they cannot comment on policies of the government, opposition or any other political parties; or outside of their areas of expertise in their interactions with any industry body. An MCA spokesman said: “The MCA represents Australia’s mining industry as part of its contribution to sustainable development, economic growth and social and community affairs. “As outlined on our website, full membership of the MCA is available to businesses involved in mining, prospecting or contracting activities while associate membership is open to groups providing equipment, materials, services or capital to mining companies.” ANSTO Minerals, part of the government-owned Australian Nuclear Science and Technology Organisation is also an associate member of the Minerals Council and a spokesman said ANSTO was a member of the Uranium Forum of the MCA and also sits on the radiation protection working group. “These are forums through which we provide advice on all aspects of the nuclear fuel cycle including safety, compliance, radiation management, efficiency, and international best practice,” the spokesman said."
"How did fear of nuclear holocaust fade so fast? I was brought up at a time when we thought the world would probably end before we got old. But here we still are, the people who were young in the 60s, and so are the H bombs that terrified us. If anything, we are less safe now than back in the heyday of our CND demonstrations. My father was one of the early founders of CND: a former communist who had left the party at the time of the Hitler/Stalin pact; he launched a peace march across Europe to Hungary in the 1950s. He was by nature a millenarian, living in fear of the end of the world in one way or another – and his fears were well-grounded. I went on my first Aldermaston march at 13, after hearing him speak in Trafalgar Square. Unfortunately, as was his wont, he stopped at The Bunch of Grapes pub before the march left Belgravia, and never got any further. But I went for the whole four-day trip, and every year after that, Aldermaston was the great social event for me and my friends.  My father’s fears of nuclear annihilation were so serious that halfway to a holiday in Wales, the family car had to be turned around because he had forgotten the large jar of death pills he had accumulated to mercy-kill everyone in the event of nuclear war. We had read Nevil Shute’s On the Beach. We knew what was coming. We knew exactly what Strontium-90 fallout did to you. We knew that RAF Fylingdales’ early-warning system would give us just four minutes to say goodbye. I carried banners on CND marches listing what you can do in four minutes: boil an egg, run a mile … The songs of those marches have stayed with all who were there: “Don’t you hear the H bombs thunder / Echo like the crack of doom? While they rend the skies asunder / Fallout makes the earth a tomb.” There were many verses. “Time is short; we must be speedy / We can see the hungry filled / House the homeless, help the needy / Shall we blast or shall we build?” The refrain ends “Ban the bomb, for evermore!” But it never happened and the bombs are still here, bequeathed now to our grandchildren. In fact, the world’s armoury has become even more unstable, in the hands of countries not officially sanctioned by the UN to possess them: Pakistan, Israel and now North Korea. Nothing about the replacement of Soviet communism by nationalist dictatorial Putinism makes the rusting Russian nuclear arsenal feel any safer than it was back then. Trump’s tiny finger on the button is terrifying. The risk of terrorists getting their hands on enough nuclear material to make lethal dirty bombs is growing, not shrinking. Already not just nuclear material, but ready-made bombs, have gone missing, or are unaccounted for. No one knows how or when or where. The fear was rekindled with the arrival of cruise missiles at Greenham Common in 1983, launching a second wave of CND activism. But that too faded. Why? The ecological collapse of the planet took over, because it’s actually happening, right now, in the global floods, droughts and forest fires, the hottest years accelerating on the graphs. My father’s end-of-the-world anxiety turned to sustainability - he became an early climate-change campaigner, setting up a commune to grow its own produce, though it was never self-sufficient. He was only half joking when he wagged a finger at me and warned that I would arrive at his door from London, begging for a cabbage, as civilisation collapsed around us. What should we fear most? Which will get us first – nuclear obliteration or the planet boiling? There are many kinds of complacency: the right, by nature, tends to trust that some notional global establishment will somehow sort things out before catastrophe strikes. Or science will fix it just in time. Maybe, as the risks rise, there is a limit to the amount of fear you can feel at any one time, and you are left to shrug helplessly at whatever insanity Kim and Trump may commit. Astronomers know without doubt the world will end, many millennia hence. The question is whether we end it all now, out of sheer human idiocy."

"One of the world’s largest marine protection areas has been created off the coast of Easter Island. The 740,000 sq km Rapa Nui marine park is roughly the size of the Chilean mainland and will protect at least 142 endemic marine species, including 27 threatened with extinction.  An astonishing 77% of the Pacific Ocean’s fish abundance occurs here and recent expeditions discovered several new species previously unknown to science. Apex predators found in the conservation zone include scalloped hammerhead sharks, minke, humpback and blue whales, and four species of sea turtle. Matt Rand, the director of the Pew Bertarelli ocean legacy project, which campaigned for the park, said: “This marine reserve will have a huge global significance for the conservation of oceans and of indigenous people’s ways of life. “The Rapa Nui have long suffered from the loss of timber, declining ecosystems and declining populations. Now they are experiencing a resurgence based on ensuring the health of the oceans.” Plans for the marine park were first announced at a conference in 2015, at which the former US president Barack Obama declared his “special love for the ocean” in a video message.  The plans were confirmed in a speech by Chilean president Michelle Bachelet on Saturday. The marine park’s creation was enabled by a 73% vote in favour of the conservation zone from Easter Island’s 3,000 Rapa Nui population in a referendum on 3 September, after five years of consultations. Extractive industries and industrial fishing will be banned inside the reserve, but the Rapa Nui will be allowed to continue their traditional artisanal fishing on small boats, using hand lines with rocks for weights. Ludovic Burns Tuki, the director of the Mesa del mar coalition of more than 20 Rapa Nui groups, said: “This is a historic moment – a great and beautiful moment for the Rapa Nui, for the world and for our oceans. “We think this process can be an example for the creation of other marine reserves that we need to protect our oceans – with a respect for the human dimension.” After the creation of a comparable marine protection area around the nearby Pitcairn Islands last year, proposals for a reserve in the Austral Islands’ waters could soon create a protected area of more than 2m sq km. This would have a unifying potential for the Polynesian people, according to Burns Tuki. “The ocean is very important to us as a source of food, but the Polynesians were great navigators and the ocean also represents our mother,” he said. “It enables us to move with a double canoe between the different islands. It gives us everything.” As global warming takes hold, some scientific papers suggest that marine reserves may also help mitigate climate change and provide a vital carbon sink. The deep, clear and cool waters around Easter Island are also a resilient area for coral reefs.  Marcelo Mena, Chile’s environment minister, said: “This marine protected area adds to the legacy of President Bachelet and the 1.5m sq km of protected areas created by this government.” The International Union for Conservation of Nature has called for 30% of the world’s oceans to be protected, but only about 1.6% has so far been covered by marine protection areas.

"It is well known that humans are causing the Earth to warm. We also know that a warmer atmosphere has more water vapor. Just like the air is more humid when it is warm, and less humid when cold. The more humid air leads to more intense precipitation and potentially more flooding. But how much change we will see is an open scientific question. This question is made complex by the fact that flooding isn’t just about rain. It reflects a dependence on evaporation, rain, the ability of land and water management to handle water surges, and other factors. Fortunately, a very recent study out of Science Advances has helped advance our understanding of the confluence of global warming, intense rain and flooding.   The authors, Conrad Wasko and Ashish Sharma, from the University of New South Wales investigated various non-urban catchments. These are regions where precipitation drains to a common site. We know that in many places the rainfall is increasing. What these authors wanted to know was whether there was a coincident increase in floods found in these various catchments. This study isn’t as simple as it might sound. The authors had to make choices about which rainfall event and which temperature peak corresponded to each other and to a potential water flow peak. According to the paper, “precipitation events were identified where the precipitation was separated by five days of zero rainfall.” That is, it had to be dry ahead of time. Streamflow and flooding events were selected as peaks separated by more than seven days. The authors then picked the largest peak from the precipitation and the streamflow observations and matched them to a coincident temperature measurement.  The tough part is that there can be a delay in temperatures and precipitation. Furthermore, there can be a physical distance between the source of the storm and the location of precipitation. Finally, many times we see flooding without the required five-day dry period. So admittedly this study has real limitations. On the other hand, the authors had to make some choices of selection and these are as good as any others. And, they compensated for these limitations by using extensive rainfall, temperature and streamflow data, data that represented the entire world and allows confident conclusions to be drawn. What they found was that in most cases there is no direct link. That is, higher temperatures does not generally cause an increase in water flow or flood risk.  So this begs the question, why not? Why isn’t there a clear direct relationship between the temperature peaks and flooding? Well the authors explain that there is an important role of hydrologic loss (water loss due to evaporation for instance). When the authors separated the results by size of catchment, they found that the importance of these water losses was reduced for smaller catchment areas. They write: if the catchment or region capturing the precipitation is smaller, but the precipitation event intensity remains the same, the potential for losses is less. In large catchments, the peak streamflow is more likely to be influenced by the catchment wetness conditions preceding the storm event.  When they broke the analysis into different catchment sizes, the authors found that for extreme rainfalls, the flooding and temperature move together. The authors also broke analysis into different geographical zones and found that their conclusions held true, regardless of the zone location. As I stated earlier, there are limitations to this study; the authors did a great job discussing those limitations. For instance, they point out it’s possible that human changes to the catchment itself can affect flooding. Urbanization in recent years may have “increased streamflow due to a larger proportion of impermeable surfaces while the development of dams for storage may have had the opposite effect.” They also report that the temperature at which the high water flows are recorded do not necessarily correspond to the temperature of the storm. Evaporation can happen for instance over an ocean, the moisture can be carried hundreds of miles inland, where it falls as rain. But, the fact that their results exclude urban catchments and use data from over 5,000 streamflow and 50,000 rainfall gauges lends credibility to their assertions. So is this good news or bad news? Well, on the one hand it confirms that global warming leads to competing effects of more heavy rains and more drying of land – forces in opposition to each other. Higher temperatures dry out soils faster and they increase precipitation. If the soils are dryer when the rains fall, it means that the floods may be less severe. That is a good thing.  On the other hand, this study helps confirm that the Earth can move from dry to wet conditions more rapidly in a warmer environment. That is not a good thing. It also has implications for refilling groundwater supplies. Much of the recovery from drought and refilling of groundwater is through smaller flooding/high-flow events. Since those are not necessarily increasing, it means droughts are likely to linger. As author Ashish Sharma told me: What this study does is to show, using just data and no model projections, that flood risk is indeed increasing but at the rare to very-rare flood end. The milder floods that are more of a nuisance than a threat to property and lives, are actually decreasing. This is worse news than before though, as it is these milder floods that make up the bulk of the refill to our water supply reservoirs."
