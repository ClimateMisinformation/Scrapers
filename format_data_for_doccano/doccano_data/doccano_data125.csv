"China's air pollution could be intensifying storms over the Pacific Ocean and altering weather patterns in North America, according to scientists in the US. A team from Texas, California and Washington state has found that pollution from Asia, much of it arising in China, is leading to more intense cyclones, increased precipitation and more warm air in the mid-Pacific moving towards the north pole. According to the team's findings, which were released on Monday in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, these changes could ultimately contribute to erratic weather in the US. The authors used advanced computer models to study interactions between clouds and fine airborne particles known as aerosols, particularly manmade ones such as those emitted from vehicles and coal-fired power plants. ""Our work provides, for the first time to the authors' knowledge, a global multi-scale perspective of the climatic effects of pollution outflows from Asia,"" says the study's abstract. One effect, the study says, is an ""intensification of the Pacific storm track"", a narrow zone over the ocean where some storms that pass over the US begin to gather. ""Mid-latitude storms develop off Asia and they track across the Pacific, coming in to the west coast of the US,"" said Ellie Highwood, a climate physicist at the University of Reading. ""The particles in this model are affecting how strong those storms are, how dense the clouds are, and how much rainfall comes out of those storms."" China is fighting to contain the environmental fallout from 30 years of unchecked growth. Of 74 Chinese cities monitored by the central government 71 failed to meet air quality standards, the environmental ministry said last month. China's top leaders are aware of the extent of the problem. Beijing will soon revise an important piece of legislation and give environmental protection authorities the power to shut polluting factories, punish officials and restrict industrial development in some areas, Reuters reported on Tuesday. The changes to the China's environmental protection law, the first since 1989, will legally enshrine oft-repeated government promises to prioritise environmental protection over economic growth. Cao Mingde, a law professor at the China University of Political Science and Law, told the newswire that upholding environmental protection as a fundamental principle was a huge change. ""It emphasises that the environment is a priority."" Although the legislation's fourth draft is nearing completion, it is still short on details, according to the report. China's legal system is often hostile to pollution-related litigation. On Monday, a Chinese court rejected a lawsuit by five residents of Lanzhou, a city in the country's north-west, over an incident last week when dangerous levels of the carcinogenic chemical benzene were detected in the water supply. The residents demanded damages, a public apology and water quality data from the city-owned water company. According to a local newspaper, the court claimed that under civil procedure law, the litigants were unqualified to sue; in pollution-related cases only ""agencies and organisations"" could press charges, and they needed official authorisation to take action."
"Let me add one more to Larry Elliott's five warning signs (A corner turned – or just more groupthink?, 7 April). Why have international investors been so keen to acquire UK assets, notably prime property in London? It is because they are confident that UK governments will do whatever it takes to preserve asset values: a collapse in values is the nightmare of any government hoping for re-election. They know too that in quantitative easing our government has a fine instrument for preserving (and boosting) asset values, never mind that it had done precious little for job creation. But a second-division economy will get away with printing money only for so long as first-division economies are at it too. After that we either carry on printing and watch sterling decline, or stop printing and put our faith in a (miraculous) revival in the balance of payments. At which point investors more interested in dollar value than in the sterling value of their London mansions will head for the exit – a step made all the easier by past removal of all those pesky restrictions on capital movement.  So the sixth warning sign flashes when our slowdown in quantitative easing happens later than in first-division economies. David ChambersLondon • Larry Elliott's scepticism about the longevity of the economic recovery might itself have been influenced by the received wisdom it purported to doubt. It puts global warming as a reason for concern, rather than economic growth per se, which is causing ""climate change"" (a more complex concept than global warming) and other serious environmental degradation. There is still insufficient attention paid to the fact that we live on a finite planet and that as a result economic growth has to be finite. To get away from this model, one has to look at different paradigms for economics, as well as different measures for assessing how well people are living. The present system allows the richest nations to fool themselves into thinking that unbridled economic growth can continue, because they can print money, repress interest rates and import resources if theirs become scarce, thus depriving the poorest of basic necessities and social justice. What happens when we can no longer do this? Perhaps the colonisation and exploitation of Mars will keep us topped up? More ""real"" realism, please, so that we can explore sustainable long-term alternatives in mainstream economic commentary, rather than confining the environmental discussions to doom and gloom pieces in other parts of the paper.Dr David DixonLondon • Articles on economics, as with your leader (A discipline ripe for disruption, 3 April), seldom mention the role of money itself, yet 97% of money in circulation – about £2,200bn – has been created by banks sinking their customers, including the government, into debt (Q1 Bulletin 2014). Banks are reluctant to reveal the interest they receive, but a conservative estimate is 5% on average, indicating that society pays these for-profit companies £110bn a year. Compare this with VAT revenue of £103bn. No wonder personal debt is higher than ever, social services are being cut, and our society inhabits two separate and opposing economic planets.James BrugesBristol"
"In full disclosure, I am jealous that I did not get a chance to work on this – perhaps the most important climate change multimedia communication endeavor in history. Climate change really is a made-for-TV story. It has all the drama of Hollywood, with real-life villains and heroes thrown in. We scientists struggle everyday to communicate the importance of climate change to the world. It is great to see communication experts come in and accomplish what scientists alone cannot. That's why I'm excited about the biggest climate science communication endeavor in history. Airing this spring in the US (Showtime), a cast of the world's best climate scientists team up with the world's best politicians and actors to tell the stories of real people from across the planet affected by climate change in Years of Living Dangerously. The first episode is available here.  The brainchild of veterans from 60 Minutes (Joel Bach and David Gelber), the series has very high standards of accuracy. Along with the blockbuster style of James Cameron, Jerry Weintraub, and Arnold Schwarzenegger, this endeavor is committed to combining great science with compelling story telling. Behind the scenes is best science team you could imagine, including Drs. Heidi Cullen, Joe Romm, Jim Hansen, Katherine Hayhoe, Michael Mann, Michael Oppenheimer… the list goes on and on. The project consists of a series of separate stories on climate change, which unfold over nine episodes – often focusing on how a changing climate is affecting peoples' lives. One segment is entitled ""Christie and the Storm"" with correspondent Mark Bittman. This segment focuses on the impact of Superstorm Sandy, the rebuilding effort in New Jersey, and the intersection of politics and weather.  Don Cheadle takes the lead in the segment ""Pray for Rain"". He and Texan scientist Dr. Katherine Hayhoe look at the impacts of drought and heat in the United States in an episode that touches on everything from economics to climate to religion. Arnold Schwarzenegger, one of my personal heroes on climate change for showing that the subject should not be a liberal or conservative issue, leads the ""Fire Line"" segment. He joins an elite team of wild-land firefighters as they battle infernos. He discovers a hidden secret that may be a bigger danger to national forests than fires. There are many more segments covering extreme heat waves and human health, methane and future energy supplies, ice in the arctic, coming political instability with climate change, future energy choices and others. Correspondents include Matt Damon, Harrison Ford, Thomas Friedman, Lesley Stahl, and a very long list of other concerned public figures. In total, 16 segments were produced with locations in the United States, Europe, Southeast Asia, South America, and the Middle East. How was this effort pulled together? The producers wanted to ensure this series had a long reach. They decided to find well-known figures who were passionate about environmental issues, but were not necessarily experts. Rather, they wanted the correspondents to ask questions on behalf of the audience, questions that the viewers themselves might ask.  The production team was very selective about the composition of the team. The many famous correspondents did not just give cameos; they are truly committed to the project. The production team gave the space for the Hollywood stars to do something most of them had never done before – go into the field as correspondents and work directly with experts. This plan worked; the correspondents were enthusiastic about the chance to work on this series – many of them were already involved in their own efforts to deal with climate change and other environmental issues.  For instance, Matt Damon is Co-Founder of water.org, Harrison Ford is a Conservation International Board Member, Don Cheadle is a UN Environmental Program Global Ambassador, and Ian Somerhalder is the Founder of his namesake organization to educate and engage youth on environmental issues. With commitment and talent like this, how can you go wrong? David Gelber perhaps sums it up best,  ""The goal of this YEARS OF LIVING DANGEROUSLY is to galvanize a national conversation on the realities of climate change and inspire people to share their own stories and empower them to get involved in solutions. We're also implementing an engagement campaign that will extend this effort beyond the broadcast to encourage our global leaders in politics, business and religion, as well as concerned citizens, to state where they stand on key climate issues and take action."" The show premiers Sunday April 13th at 10pm on SHOWTIME, I think I'm going to get cable TV just for this."
"Australia can remove 63m tonnes of carbon dioxide a year from the atmosphere by 2050 if it embraces technology that captures CO2 and buries it, new modelling has shown. The Jacobs SKM study, commissioned by the Climate Institute, says biomass carbon capture and storage (bio-CCS) can play a significant role in helping Australia play its part in keeping the global temperature increase to less than 2C compared with pre-industrial levels.  The latest report from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), released on Sunday, says although the availability and widespread deployment of carbon dioxide removal technologies are “uncertain”, they have to play a role if emissions are to be curbed. The Climate Institute report finds that, without bio-CCS, Australia will have to pay more for emissions reductions or buy abatement from overseas. A failure to remove carbon in this way will increase the cost of climate action by up to $60bn by 2050, the report says. The study, the first in-depth look at biomass storage in Australia, stresses there is “no silver bullet that will stop climate change” but that carbon capture needs to be part of the mix to give the world a 75% chance of avoiding a 2C increase. Bio-CCS involves using wood and crop material as fuel to generate electricity or other forms of energy. Plants suck up CO2, which is normally released into the atmosphere when they die or are cut down. Bio-CSS prevents the second stage of this life cycle by burning the material for power then storing the released carbon underground. This outcome, called “negative emissions”, will ensure that more carbon is locked up in the ground than is released into the air. The removal of 63m tonnes of CO2 a year by 2050 is equivalent to 1.5 times the current emissions from all cars in Australia. The government has identified the storage of carbon in soils and plants as a key plank in its climate policy, outlining plans to plant millions of trees and fund projects that advance soil sequestering. Critics argue carbon capture is unproven and a distraction from preventing emissions at the source. However, the CSIRO has conducted extensive work in the area of carbon capture and recently released a map of Australian soils suitable for this purpose. “If we are serious about 2C, we’ve got to get this stuff out of the atmosphere and have a serious conversation about how the hell we do that,” the chief executive of the Climate Institute, John Connor, told Guardian Australia. “We’ve got to have a full press on energy efficiency and renewable energy, but we need to start looking at carbon capture. We need to turn off the tap but also pull out the plug. We’re not pretending it’ll be easy, but we need to start that conversation.” Bio-CCS involves the transition from coal burning to burning vegetative matter, in order to be emissions negative. Connor concedes this prospect will be opposed by the fossil fuel industry. “The fossil fuel industry is its own worst enemy,"" he said. ""It should be championing things that limit emissions for it to have a future. “The lunacy in the public debate at the moment will have to subside if we’re going to have these conversations and get serious about keeping to the 2C guard rail.”"
"Vladimir Putin's land grab in Crimea has shocked the west into rethinking security strategy on the continent.   Michael McFaul, former US ambassador to Moscow, has rightly argued in the New York Times that Putin has made a strategic pivot, and has abandoned reform and partnership with the west for a campaign to consolidate autocratic power at home and erect an alternative to western liberal democracy for the nations in its ""near abroad"".   In the efforts to gauge how far Russia will go and what it means for transatlantic institutions, however, a larger theme is being overlooked. That is the role of climate and energy policy in the “long game” that will now play out between Russia and the west. Rather than being a choice between democracy and autocracy, the choice is actually one between patronage-based oil-and-gas oligarchies on the one hand, and adaptive and innovative low-carbon economies on the other. Russia is a country that has fallen victim to the now quite well-understood “resource curse” – the seeming contradiction that countries with great natural wealth, especially in fossil fuels, tend towards autocratic government, systemic corruption and developmental stagnation affecting the general population, combined with extravagant wealth on the part of controlling elites. The leaders of resource-cursed countries rely on networks of patronage among the rent-seeking class that has gained control over natural resources and derivative industries, and such political systems do not change as long as the petro-dollars keep rolling in. At the same time that attention is riveted upon Russian expansionism and efforts to negotiate its limits, the international community is busy working towards a global climate agreement in 2015 that aims to hold warming to 2C in this century. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change has just issued its first report in seven years on the impact of global warming, showing that the impacts are real and that the world needs to redouble its efforts on climate mitigation and adaptation for at least the generation to come. It is this viewpoint that Putin’s Russia is implicitly rejecting, for the reason that the world’s movement away from the carbon-based energy paradigm would deprive Russia of its immense wealth. Author Bill McKibben has estimated that to achieve this goal up to $20tn worth of fossil fuel reserves would need to remain in the ground, essentially worthless.  One can quibble with the numbers, but the conclusion in regards to the current geo-political situation is clear: in the long term the alternative to military containment of an oil-drunk Russian autocracy is authentic, internal reform of the Russian state and economy, which will only occur when the windfall profits that sustain Putinism cease to flow. Now, the world has not devalued these assets yet, but Russia is behaving as if its natural wealth has to be leveraged through its military-industrial complex to convert devaluing assets into territorial gains. Putin’s behaviour is like that of individuals in an inflationary spiral. More and more oil and gas will translate into fewer goods and services. So the strategy is to convert the inflating assets into “real” ones as quickly as possible, before three-quarters of Russia’s natural capital becomes worthless. It will be a diminishing window of opportunity if the world gets serious about climate change.  There is enough progressive thinking in Russia today that Putin can be frightened by the threat of a Maidan-type uprising in Moscow. Currently the Russian leader and his cronies have sufficient resources to see off the threat, and the incorporation of new Russian citizens who owe their chance at prosperity to Putin’s decisive leadership provide him with an additional loyal column of support. But the resource curse can come back to haunt him, particularly if oligarchs start fighting among themselves. The west can help move things along by developing an energy security strategy that starves the regime of money. The European Union, while taking a back seat to Nato on security strategy, must lead on a transatlantic alignment on energy and climate security that includes US as well as European shale gas as a bridge leading to a renewables-based economy. Until now the United States has been a laggard in international climate talks, and its domestic energy policies have propped up corrupt and authoritarian regimes around the world. This must change.  European countries have been loathe to incur the risks of exploiting their own shale gas resources, but member states should now reconsider their policies, keeping in mind that Europe has the capacity to apply the toughest environmental standards of any energy producing region in the world. Even if Russian territorial ambitions are curbed, Putin has effectively declared a new ideological divide in Europe. If it would be an ideological divide, let it be one between rent-seeking oil and gas oligarchs and sustainability innovators; between closed societies with press controls and open societies with press freedom; between respect for partners and the aspirations of their populations and cynical leveraging of power.  In the meantime, let the United States join Europe in seriously engaging the climate negotiations and forging an energy strategy that is both more sustainable and more likely to empower the younger generation of Russians to create opportunities for reform that are currently closed by Putin's fossil fuel fed autocracy. • Stephen Stec is visiting professor at the Department of Environmental Sciences and Policy, Central European University.

"Religious groups have urged Pope Francis to back a campaign to encourage millions of people, organisations and investors to pull their money out of the fossil fuel industry. Multi-faith groups in Australia and North America have sent a letter to the pope saying it is ""immoral"" to profit from fossil fuels.  The letter, shown exclusively to the Guardian, says 80% of global fossil fuel reserves must ""stay in the ground"" if dangerous climate change is to be avoided. ""We urge you, as a person held in high esteem by many millions around the world, to speak clearly about the place of divestment from fossil fuels as one significant means to avert the worst of climate disruption,"" the letter says. ""You could have a desperately needed influence on the direction humanity takes from here. We urge you to use this influence."" The plea to the Vatican follows a call from archbishop Desmond Tutu for an anti-apartheid style boycott of the fossil fuel industry. Writing in the Guardian last week he said, ""People of conscience need to break their ties with corporations financing the injustice of climate change."" The letter sent to the pope's offices in February is co-signed by the Australian Religious Response to Climate Change (ARRCC) and US-based GreenFaith. Thea Ormerod, chair of ARRCC and a practising Catholic, said: ""If the extracting and burning continues, the world's children and grandchildren may have little or no chance of any kind of decent life on this planet, particularly those who live in the global south. ""For corporate bodies to continue seeking to profit from extracting coal, oil and gas in spite of this fact, is institutionalised greed, selfishness and arrogance. I believe as a Catholic that it is sinful."" Both ARRCC and GreenFaith are umbrella organisations working mainly with Christian, Hindu, Muslim, Buddhist and Jewish groups. The letter was also signed by a New Zealand campaign that has seen five Anglican dioceses pledging to divest from fossil fuels. GreenFaith executive director, the Rev Fletcher Harper, said: ""Pope Francis's support would provide a powerful validation of the moral rightness of divestment and reinvestment in response to the climate crisis, and would immediately signal the need for dramatic action. It would be of vital significance."" Bill McKibben, the US environmentalist and one of the leaders of the divestment campaign, said: ""For people of faith, it's become clear that we can't fulfill the commandment to love our neighbors without breaking the fossil fuel addiction. ""That's why so many churches have been divesting from the richest companies on earth. After all, where your treasure is, there is your heart as well."" Scores of religious groups, educational institutions, philanthropic foundations and cities have pledged to go ""fossil free"", while others, such as Harvard University, have pushed back against requests. Last September the White House announced it had joined Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Norway, and Sweden ""in ending public financing for new coal-fired power plants overseas, except in rare circumstances."" That followed the US Export-Import Bank tightening its rules on lending to foreign coal-power projects in an attempt to cut greenhouse gas emissions. The World Bank has introduced similar restrictions on its lending. The Norwegian government is reviewing its US$838bn sovereign wealth fund, ranked the largest in the world, to consider stopping fossil fuel investments. In response to moves in Norway, the World Coal Association has said major coal companies who were the potential targets for divestment were also spending money on so-called ""clean coal"" technologies. The association said divesting coal assets would not cut demand for the fuel, ignored its contribution to economic development and would ""do nothing"" to address climate change. The letter to the pope was sent a week before Australia's Cardinal George Pell was appointed to an influential senior position within the Catholic church and the Vatican as the head of a new secretariat for the economy. Cardinal Pell has expressed extreme scepticism of the science linking greenhouse gas emissions to climate change. In 2011 he delivered the annual lecture of the UK's sceptic group the Global Warming Policy Foundation, founded by Lord Nigel Lawson, and claimed carbon dioxide was ""not a pollutant"" and animals would not notice a doubling of atmospheric CO2. He said climate change campaigners were following a ""mythology"" which he said was attractive to the ""religionless and spiritually rootless"". The Vatican declined to comment on the letter."
"A paper published in the International Journal of Modern Physics B by the University of Waterloo's Qing-Bin Lu last year claimed that solar activity and human chlorofluorocarbon (CFC) emissions, not carbon dioxide emissions, could explain the observed global warming over the past century. The journal has now published a rebuttal of that paper by myself and my colleagues Kevin Cowtan, Peter Jacobs, Mark Richardson, Robert Way, Anne-Marie Blackburn, Martin Stolpe, and John Cook. As I recently discussed, contrarian climate research blaming global warming on Anything But Carbon (ABC) tends to receive disproportionate media attention. Lu's paper was a prime example, being trumpeted by a University of Waterloo press release and Science Daily and Phys.org articles, all of which used exaggerated language like ""Lu's theory has been confirmed."" ABC News did a better job covering the paper, talking to climate scientist David Karoly, who expressed appropriate skepticism about a paper which purports to overturn decades and even centuries of well-established physics and climate science in one fell swoop. Characteristically, Rupert Murdoch's The Australian then criticized ABC News for failing to be ""fair and balanced"" because they interviewed an actual climate expert about the paper.  However, Lu's paper contained numerous clear fundamental flaws. For one, the underlying argument was based on ""curve fitting"" or ""overfitting,"" which is when the variables in a model are arbitrarily stretched to match the observational data. In this case, Lu took the global energy imbalance caused by CFCs (which are greenhouse gases) and scaled them up dramatically to match measurements of global surface temperatures. Lu then also had to explain why CFCs would be increasing the greenhouse effect, but carbon dioxide wouldn't. To accomplish this, he invoked what's known as ""the saturated gassy argument"" – claiming that rising carbon dioxide can't cause more warming because there is already so much in the atmosphere that its greenhouse effect has become saturated. This argument was first made by Knut Ångström in 1900, but was conclusively disproved by E. O. Hulburt in 1931 and military research in the 1940s. Lu misinterpreted several recent papers to revive the argument, but as we showed in our paper, it still remains incorrect. Ultimately Lu's argument was that global surface warming has slowed in recent years, and his model using CFCs and solar activity could accurately match those observations. However, Lu used outdated and superseded surface temperature measurements with a cool bias that exaggerated that surface warming slowdown. He also used an extremely outdated reconstruction of solar activity. We showed that even ignoring the unphysical ""curve fitting"" in his model, models using current known human climate influences produced a more accurate fit to up-to-date surface temperature measurements than Lu's model. The extreme curve fitting employed in Lu's paper is apparent in the above figure, with the solid green line indicating the actual global surface temperature response from the CFC influence, and the green dashed line indicating the response after the arbitrary scaling by Lu. It's also clear that the temperature response to all human influences (black dashed line) correlates well with the observed temperature changes, with natural influences and internal variability also accounting for some short-term changes, like the surface warming slowdown over the past 10 to 15 years. Another key flaw that we discussed in our paper was Lu's failure to account for the entire climate system. Changes in the greenhouse effect don't only impact surface temperatures; they impact the entire global climate. Thus if CFCs really were the current dominant influence on the global climate, given that they have flattened in recent years (due to the Montreal Protocol), the warming of the entire global climate should also have flattened out. That's simply not the case, as the oceans have continued to warm at a rate equivalent to about 4 Hiroshima atomic bomb detonations per second during that time. As our paper showed, the fundamental flaws in Lu's argument are numerous. *It ignores the continued rapid heat accumulation in the oceans*It relies on unphysical curve fitting*It tries to revive the long-debunked saturated gassy argument*It uses outdated data*Using known human climate influences dominated by carbon dioxide fits the data better than Lu's flawed model anyway Our paper concludes, ""We therefore conclude that the hypothesis of [Lu] is not only inferior to the mainstream explanation of the present climate change, but that it is based on unphysical and fundamentally flawed premises."" Lu's paper fits into Category 2 of the ways flawed contrarian papers get published in scientific journals – by submitting to an off-topic journal. It's not uncommon for contrarian research to be published in physics rather than climate journals. The editors of off-topic journals may be unable to identify referees with adequate climate expertise to review these climate papers, making it more likely that the sorts of fundamental flaws that were the basis of Lu's paper won't be identified during the peer-review process, and hence more likely that this flawed research will be published in off-topic journals. It's important to note that contrarian research is often useful in challenging and advancing our scientific understanding. However, as Carl Sagan said, ""They laughed at Columbus, they laughed at Fulton, they laughed at the Wright brothers. But they also laughed at Bozo the Clown."" As our Cosmopolis paper recently showed, unlike the human-caused global warming theory, contrarian hypotheses have not withstood scientific scrutiny or the test of time. The media tends to give papers like Lu's disproportionate attention because controversy sells and because many people don't want to believe humans are engaging in dangerous disruption of the global climate system. It's unlikely that our rebuttal will receive nearly as much media attention.  However, when these papers are published in off-topic journals, that's a red flag that they may not have been subjected to rigorous expert peer-review, and that their claims should be strongly scrutinized before being uncritically passed along for public consumption. In this respect, The Australian, Science Daily, and Phys.org failed, but ABC News deserves praise for soliciting expert opinion in their coverage of this paper. Ultimately we can chalk CFCs up to another failed Anything But Carbon (ABC) hypothesis. The list of contradictory ABCs is extensive, for example blaming global warming on the sun, ocean cycles, CFCs, galactic cosmic rays, and volcanoes, all of which contradict the claims that the planet isn't warming or that it's cooling. Other contrarians contradict all of these arguments by accepting the reality of human-caused global warming, instead claiming that the climate just isn't sensitive to the increased greenhouse effect, or that global warming is a good thing.  While the expert consensus on human-caused global warming is consistent and cohesive, it seems like no two contrarians can agree on an alternative hypothesis, quite simply because none except human-caused global warming is supported by the full body of scientific evidence."
"Battles over water and food will erupt within the next five to 10 years as a result of climate change, the president of the World Bank said as he urged those campaigning against global warming to learn the lessons of how protesters and scientists joined forces in the battle against HIV. Jim Yong Kim said it was possible to cap the rise in global temperatures at 2C but that so far there had been a failure to replicate the ""unbelievable"" success of the 15-year-long coalition of activists and scientists to develop a treatment for HIV.  The bank's president – a doctor active in the campaign to develop drugs to treat HIV – said he had asked the climate change community: ""Do we have a plan that's as good as the plan we had for HIV?"" The answer, unfortunately, was no. ""Is there enough basic science research going into renewable energy? Not even close. Are there ways of taking discoveries made in universities and quickly moving them into industry? No. Are there ways of testing those innovations? Are there people thinking about scaling [up] those innovations?"" Interviewed ahead of next week's biannual World Bank meeting, Kim added: ""They [the climate change community] kept saying, 'What do you mean a plan?' I said a plan that's equal to the challenge. A plan that will convince anyone who asks us that we're really serious about climate change, and that we have a plan that can actually keep us at less than 2C warming. We still don't have one. ""We're trying to help and we find ourselves being more involved then I think anyone at the bank had predicted even a couple of years ago. We've got to put the plan together."" Kim said there were four areas where the bank could help specifically in the fight against global warming: finding a stable price for carbon; removing fuel subsidies; investing in cleaner cities; and developing climate-smart agriculture. Improved access to clean water and sanitation was vital, he added, as he predicted that tension over resources would result from inaction over global warming. ""The water issue is critically related to climate change. People say that carbon is the currency of climate change. Water is the teeth. Fights over water and food are going to be the most significant direct impacts of climate change in the next five to 10 years. There's just no question about it. ""So getting serious about access to clean water, access to sanitation is a very important project. Water and sanitation has not had the same kind of champion that global health, and even education, have had."" The World Bank president admitted that his organisation had made mistakes in the past, including a belief that people in poor countries should pay for healthcare. He warned that a failure to tackle inequality risked social unrest. ""There's now just overwhelming evidence that those user fees actually worsened health outcomes. There's no question about it. So did the bank get it wrong before? Yeah. I think the bank was ideological."" The bank has almost doubled its lending capacity to $28bn (£17bn) a year with the aim of eradicating extreme poverty by 2030 and spreading the benefits of prosperity to the poorest 40% in developing countries. ""What we have found is that because of smartphones and access to media, and because everybody knows how everyone else lives, you have no idea where the next huge social movement is going to erupt. ""It's going to erupt to a great extent because of these inequalities. So what I hear from heads of state is a much, much deeper understanding of the political dangers of very high levels of inequality,"" he said. ""Now that we have good evidence that suggests that working on more inclusive growth strategies actually improves overall growth, that's our job."" Kim said he was shaking up the bank's structure so that it could lend more effectively and to end a culture in which the organisation's staff did not talk to each other. Instead of being organised solely on a geographic basis, the bank will now pool its expertise across sectors such as health, education and transport so that ideas could be shared across national borders. The bank's private-sector arm, the International Finance Corporation, will be encouraged to work with the public-sector arm. Kim said the changes had come about because knowledge was not flowing through the organisation. ""We were working at six regional banks. The six regional banks were working pretty well, but there was not the sense that there was any innovation in tackling a problem – that if you went to the World Bank you'd have access to that innovation."""
"A new paper has been published in the journal Cosmopolis entitled Review of the consensus and asymmetric quality of research on human-induced climate change. The paper was authored by John Abraham, myself, and our colleagues John Cook, John Fasullo, Peter Jacobs, and Scott Mandia. Each of the authors has experience in publishing peer-reviewed responses to flawed contrarian papers. Despite the 97% expert consensus on human-caused global warming supported by peer-reviewed research, expert opinion, the IPCC reports, and National Academies of Science and other scientific organizations from around the world, a large segment of the population remains unconvinced on the issue. A new commentary by Edward Maibach, Teresa Myers and Anthony Leiserowitz in Earth's Future notes that most people don't know there is a scientific consensus about human-caused climate change, which undermines public engagement on the subject.  This 'consensus gap' is in large part due the media giving disproportionate coverage to climate contrarians. In our paper, we sought to evaluate whether that disproportionate media coverage was justified by examining how well contrarian hypotheses have withstood scientific scrutiny and the test of time. The short answer is, not well. The first contrarian argument examined in our paper was the claim that the Earth is not warming. This argument was particularly popular in the late 1990s and early 2000s, when John Christy and Roy Spencer from the University of Alabama at Huntsville published an analysis of satellite data that seemed to indicate the lower atmosphere was cooling. This appeared to contradict surface temperature measurements from thousands of thermometers around the world, which when combined together, indicated substantial global warming. Contrarians were certain that the thermometers were wrong, the satellites were right, and we didn't have to worry about global warming. However, it turns out that satellite measurements of atmospheric temperatures are very tricky. The satellites are positioned above the atmosphere that they're trying to measure, and have to peer through many different atmospheric layers. Their orbits also drift, and satellites have limited lifespans, forcing scientists to splice together measurements from different instruments. Gradually, various problems with the satellite temperature measurements were identified, some by the Huntsville group, and several by other groups. Corrections were made to the record, and before long the satellite record showed the warming of the lower atmosphere happening at a similar rate to that estimated from the thermometers around the globe. Two decades later, additional possible biases are still being identified in the satellite temperature record. Nevertheless, contrarians continue that the lower atmosphere isn't warming as fast as it should be, or that the surface thermometer measurements are biased hot (recent research has shown they actually have a cool bias). However, Christy and Spencer's claim that the planet isn't warming did not withstand scientific scrutiny or the test of time. The second contrarian argument we investigated involved the claim that the global climate is not very sensitive to the increased greenhouse effect because the planet has some sort of natural climate response that will offset global warming. One of the first such arguments in the peer-reviewed literature was the 'infrared iris' hypothesis from contrarian darling Richard Lindzen.  The premise of Lindzen's hypothesis was that as the climate warms, the area in the atmosphere covered by high cirrus clouds will contract to allow more heat to escape into outer space, similar to the iris in a human eye contracting to allow less light to pass through the pupil in a brightly lit environment. However, within a year of Lindzen's iris hypothesis paper being published, four scientific groups had published their own studies finding significant flaws in his methods and assumptions, shown in dark blue in the first graphic above. Several more critiques were published in the ensuing years failing to find evidence supporting the iris concept (red in the first graphic), showing that while the scientific community took this new hypothesis seriously, it simply failed to withstand scientific scrutiny. Although this is the case for most of Lindzen's arguments, he continues to be among the most highly sought contrarians by journalists and policymakers who try to create the perception of significant disagreement amongst climate science experts. Roy Spencer and his colleague Danny Braswell have similarly published papers arguing that the climate is not as sensitive to the increased greenhouse effect as most climate scientists believe and most of the available evidence indicates. A paper they published in 2008 used a very simple climate model to make this argument, but subsequent research showed that their model was actually too simple, and failed to accurately represent how the global climate operates (green in the first graphic). Spencer and Lindzen published several other papers making similar arguments in subsequent years, but these again failed to withstand scientific scrutiny (orange, black, and light blue in the first graphic). Various other scientific groups pointed out several flaws in the methods and assumptions in each of their publications, and in fact one editor resigned because he felt his journal had failed its task of conducting rigorous peer-review in publishing a fundamentally flawed 2011 Spencer and Braswell paper (black in the first graphic). To contrast, human-caused global warming is based on solid fundamental physics that we've understood for over a century. In contrast to the relatively few studies mentioned here, thousands of studies have scrutinized and reaffirmed the basic physics that underlies the theory. It has withstood the test of time.  While there are still some areas of climate science undergoing serious research, like how much we're influencing changes in various types of extreme weather, the central tenets of human-caused global warming are solidly established. While some challenges have been advanced in the scientific literature, these challenges have been found to be incorrect. In addition to the failure of their alternative hypotheses to withstand scientific scrutiny, research has shown that contrarian scientists have less expertise and fewer publications than mainstream climate scientists, and that as climate expertise increases, so does acceptance of human-caused global warming. This then raises the question as to why contrarians are given disproportionate attention by the media and policymakers. They represent a small minority of experts with fringe views that have failed to convince the rest scientific community, simply because their ideas haven't withstood scientific scrutiny. On the other side we have human-caused global warming, supported by 97% of peer-reviewed research, expert opinion, fundamental physics, and having withstood the test of time. The fact that these two groups are treated as being on equal scientific footing and the issue continues to be 'debated' in the media has resulted in a misinformed public, and that's a problem."
"A clear national strategy is ""urgently needed"" to help future-proof coastal areas from rising sea levels and extreme weather, according to a report published by the National Trust on Friday.  The trust, one of the UK's biggest coastal owners, says many of its sites have been ""battered"" by storms and ""hit hard"" by high tides this winter.  Birling Gap, part of the Seven Sisters chalk cliffs in East Sussex, experienced seven years of erosion this winter – leaving its cafe and shop teetering metres from the edge.  Part of the footpath down to the golden sands of Rhossili on Gower, South Wales – recently voted the UK's best beach – has been washed away by storms.  The charity says it has been forced to ""fast-track"" decisions over how to adapt coastal areas in the months ahead, rather than years or decades. Simon Pryor, natural environment director at the National Trust, called for the government to ensure strategies to future-proof the coastline are implemented.  ""There is a natural inclination to want to defend the coastline with concrete, but our coastline is dynamic and the forces of nature that have formed it are part of its beauty,"" Pryor said.  ""Hard defences will always have their place, but the winter storms that hit many coastal places hard have provided a valuable reminder that they have a limited life.  ""Where we can we need to give natural processes that have formed our coast the space to work, and create areas where the coastline can realign as the sea levels rise. Natural habitats such as sand-dunes and salt marshes can act as buffer zones that absorb the impact of storms and very high tides.""  Pryor said a report published by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change last month reinforced the urgency of having a ""workable plan"" for long-term coastline management.  He said there was a ""clear need"" to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to avoid further accelerating climate change and the risk of more dramatic storm damage.  ""Communities living on the coast, landowners, government agencies and local and central government all need to work together now to find solutions based around an adaptation approach to help future-proof the coastline,"" Dr Pryor added.  ""Much of the framework to make this happen is in place but government needs to act now to make sure that it's implemented and the support is there for coastal communities to begin planning to adapt.""  The report, 'Shifting Shores - adapting to change', highlights case studies of places affected by the storms.  Stretches of the wildlife-rich Norfolk coast at Brancaster and Blakeney Freshes saw significant changes as a result of a tidal surge in December. Sand dunes at Murlough in Northern Ireland also suffered their worst erosion in living memory.  The trust, which cares for 742 miles of coast in England, Wales and Northern Ireland, will have adaptation strategies in place for its 70 coastal places most at risk of erosion or flooding by 2020. Around 60% of the trust's coastal land is at risk of erosion in the 21st century, with 15% of those sites potentially losing more than 100 metres of land to the sea.  Adaptation strategies for such areas will involve looking at future-proofing buildings on the coast, where car parks should be located, creating movable access to beaches and new habitats for wildlife.  Professor Andrew Cooper, professor of coastal studies at the University of Ulster, said: ""The approach to coastal change management being adopted by the National Trust is exactly the type of adaptive approach that we will need to embrace as we face extremes of weather set against the backdrop of a changing climate and rising sea level.  ""We cannot afford to, nor is it desirable, to try and engineer our way out of this.""  A new project in Studland in Dorset, in partnership with Arts University Bournemouth, aims to create 'future-proof' beach huts that can withstand extreme weather and a changing coastline.  Some of the 270 beach huts at Studland have already had to be moved twice, with a number left ""perilously"" close to the beach after winter storms washed the footpath away.  Elli MacDonald, project manager at Studland, said: ""Beach huts have been popular with families since Victorian times and are an important part of the special character of the British coastline. That's why we're trying to find a practical solution so that these symbols of the seaside can be enjoyed by generations to come.""  The National Trust was founded in 1895, with its first acquisition a small area of coastal cliff about Barmouth in north Wales. Last year, public support enabled the charity to acquire a one-mile stretch of the White Cliffs of Dover."
"""If climate change is a total downer … it's going to be really hard to take action,"" said one of the scientists behind the UN climate panel's recent report on climate-driven threats to food, health and infrastructure. One reaction is to talk up the business opportunities of doing things. Without doubt, there are many, and there is enormous scope for climate entrepreneurs. But there is a trap in hyping markets as the answer. Many governments would like nothing more than to believe they can leave global warming to the unchallenged market. That means they wouldn't have to do anything themselves except murmur something green occasionally. But if the market was going to solve the problem it would already be doing so, because the problem is decades old. Its price signal would already have reallocated resources to keep us living within planetary boundaries. Information would have flowed and risks been calculated in such a way that money retreated from activities damaging to a stable climate, and went into better alternatives. Some bizarre anomalies suggest a deep-rooted inability to question the economic structures that are pushing us over the edge. Arnold Schwarzenegger, the former ""green governor"" of California, is soon to star in a ground-breaking environmental series on US TV called Years of Living Dangerously. Importantly for the American market, it tackles climate change head-on. It is made by the director James Cameron who made not only Schwarzenegger's defining film, Terminator, but also the epic Avatar, which told the story of humanity's assault on an alien race that lives at one with nature in a tropical, forest-like world. In this new series, Schwarzenegger fronts an episode on the problem of forest fires. Other Hollywood luminaries include Harrison Ford, Jessica Alba and Matt Damon. But, at least where Schwarzenegger is concerned, a laudable project is in danger of sending the message that we can have our planet and eat it, all due to a blind spot about financial markets. Research by Global Witness last week revealed record sums of money being invested in tropical deforestation with the largest investments coming from a US-based multibillion dollar investment company called Dimensional Fund Advisors (DFA). It turns out, thanks to declarations made during his time as governor of California, that Schwarzenegger has a major stake in DFA which, in turn, has shares in several of the world's most notorious logging companies, including a number of companies that have been implicated in illegal activities. Overall, since 2000 the world has lost the equivalent of 50 football pitches worth of forest every minute. DFA's sales pitch to clients is that it is a ""pioneer in financial engineering"", and uses the ""science of capital markets"". One of its directors is the Nobel prize-winning economist Eugene Fama, who was dubbed the father of the ""efficient market hypothesis"". Famously, he played down the risks posed by the housing market before the sub-prime mortgage crisis triggered the broader financial crash of 2007-08. Complex algorithms have long been a part of financial trading, but they've become ever more dominant as the speed of financial transactions makes individual human scrutiny impossible. But narrowly efficient markets have proved highly inefficient at spotting and avoiding systemic risks, whether to do with the housing market or, in this case, the preservation of a biosphere fit for human civilisation. Without in-built checks and balances, seemingly clever financial engineering can do terrible damage. Here, the immediate, obvious irony of the environmentalist profiting from deforestation deepens. Arguably Schwarzenegger is most famous for his role as the Terminator, a robo-killer who travels back from the future to assassinate humanity's last hope in a future war against machines. Now, the real-life actor is tied-up in robo-funds that really do pose a threat to our survival chances. Trusting that some vague notion of the market will come to save us is deeply misguided. That is partly why, perversely, the very industries that pose the greatest threat in terms of climate change would never rely on it. If the UN's estimate of $30bn a year sounds a lot to help protect tropical forests, it's worth remembering that an amount 63 times greater goes in subsidy alone to the fossil fuel sector globally. Already this year thick clouds of smoke from forest fires in Indonesia are filling the air of major cities. These add to a huge human death toll from pollution-linked respiratory problems just as they also signal how we are compromising tropical forests that are the lungs of the world. It's a problem pushed by market mechanisms. If Arnold Schwarzenegger is set to give advice on tackling fires at home, he could set an even better example by making sure his investments don't metaphorically pour petrol on them abroad. • One Hundred Months"
"An Inconvenient Truth, the documentary featuring Al Gore's attempts to alert people to the dangers of climate change, triggered a global conversation when it was released in 2006, and earned $50m at the box office. Now the film's producers are talking up a potential sequel. ""We have had conversations,"" Lawrence Bender told the Hollywood Reporter. ""We've met; we've discussed. If we are going to make a movie, we want it to have an impact."" Fellow producer Scott Z. Burns added that he ""would only support doing a follow-up if we have a really, really amazing way of attacking the issue and reinvigorating it.""  Bender, who has also frequently produced Quentin Tarantino's movies, argues that a sequel is necessary because the headway made by the first film has been eaten into by lobbying from the fossil fuel industry. ""They did a really good job of pushing back and confusing people,"" he says. ""Some people actually believe global warming doesn't exist."" An Inconvenient Truth was made after fellow producer Laurie David saw former presidential candidate Al Gore deliver a slideshow presentation about the impact of fossil fuel consumption on global warming; the film is based around that slideshow, with Gore expanding on his thesis as well as showing what inspired his environmentalism. It won an Academy Award for best documentary, as well as one for best original song. David also called for a sequel to be made. ""God, do we need one,"" she said. ""Everything in that movie has come to pass. At the time we did the movie, there was Hurricane Katrina; now we have extreme weather events every other week. The update has to be incredible and shocking."""
"The last year has seen a rapid proliferation of groups calling on universities across the UK to disinvest from fossil fuels. From Fossil Free Aberdeen to Fossil Free Sussex, groups of students, staff and alumni have put pressure on universities reduce their investments in fossil fuels. Some also call for greater transparency in investments, and several call for broader ethical investment policies (e.g. divesting from the arms trade too). Last week saw the launch of Fossil Free Health. It’s focus is not so much on universities, but other bodies which surround training and research on health; the Royal Colleges, the British Medical Association and the Wellcome Trust.   Fossil Free Health is interesting for several reasons. It is a coalition of student groups and professionals. It also targets a sector at large, not a specific campus. They draw on medical advice to make their case, reflecting the growing number of voices which argue that climate change is, amongst other things, a health issue. Following a strong editorial calling for divestment in the BMJ last month, the campaign leads with a medical frame, dubbing the fossil fuel industry one “whose very business model threatens to completely undermine human and planetary health.”  In particular, it is interesting to see Fossil Free Health put the Wellcome Trust firmly under the spotlight. Wellcome is a biggie when it comes to moneybags in and around UK science, and I’m sure the campaigners know this. Last year’s Knowledge and Power report estimated that UK universities have a combined investment wealth of around £62.2 billion. In comparison, Wellcome calculates that by the end of September 2013, its endowment was approximately £16.4 billion. It's equivalent to over a quarter of the other activity, in one, big lump.  There is some history of complaints over where Wellcome put the the power of their money. In 2011, the Trust came under criticism from Labour MP Stella Creasy for investing in the payday loans company, Wonga. The then director, Sir Mark Walport, defended this investment, but last summer, Wellcome announced they would be selling their stake. It was only the direct stake, which was reasonably small as these things go, and it was probably done for a range of reasons. Still, like many similar endowments, Wellcome have a policy to avoid investment in tobacco. They have drawn a line before. Maybe they will again. It’ll be interesting to see how this new medical push on fossil fuel divestment plays out. Whereas the university divestment campaigns have worked by mobilising student activists, groups like Wellcome, the BMA and the Royal Colleges don’t have the same core campus. They have headquarters and other sites - even public ones like museums - but groups interact with and through them in different ways. It also has a different set of relationships with its various stakeholders who, again, have different relationships with each other. Arguably UK medics have other political fights on their hands right now, but other divestment campaigns have managed to connect with broader issues so maybe this will too. We'll see how this develops, and if the medical establishment listens.  Alice Bell is a freelance writer and researcher specialising in science, health, technology and environment policy. "
"There are choices that need to be made if dangerous climate change is to be avoided in the 21st century. Previous reports from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) have confirmed that the influence of human activities on the climate is unambiguous, and that climate change will have a major impact on human activities and ecosystems. Its third report, published yesterday, sets out the huge challenge that needs to be addressed by policymakers. The evidence is clear: sticking to business as usual will lead to temperature rises of three to five degrees above pre-industrial levels. This will potentially lead to catastrophic effects on water resources and agricultural productivity, and accelerate sea level rise. If momentum is maintained, the pledges made by UN members at the Cancun Climate Convention in 2010 would probably take us to the bottom end of that range, close to a three-degree rise. But they would not meet the two-degree goal set by the UN and accepted as the target needed to avoid dangerous climate change.  Hitting the two-degree target has not been ruled out, but the IPCC has concluded in its report that major changes would be needed to energy systems, requiring technological and institutional change on a massive scale. Global emissions of greenhouse gases would need to fall by 40-70% to meet the target. This could imply a tripling or quadrupling, by 2050, of cleaner electricity sources such as renewables, nuclear or fossil fuels, along with carbon capture and storage, and the aggressive pursuit of energy efficiency opportunities. There will be no single solution across the world but rather a patchwork of responses as countries make their own choices. However, the expansion of renewable energy is likely to be ubiquitous. The implications of delay are clearly stated in the report. If we postpone action until 2030, the two-degree target will be beyond our grasp unless technologies to remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere are used. Afforestation and reduced deforestation will help but the alternative of burning biomass and capturing and storing the CO2 would need to be adopted. This is controversial and raises wider sustainability concerns. Prompt action will cut costs and leave open a wider range of options. Cost is a critical question that needs to be addressed in any proposals for action, or inaction. In the report, the IPCC has suggested that action to cut greenhouse gas emissions could reduce global growth by 0.06% per year over the 21st century, leading to a 1.7% reduction in global consumption by 2030 and 3.4% by 2050 relative to a business as usual strategy. Is this affordable? It does not sound much when set against the impact of climate change. And other benefits from improved air quality and reduced dependence on imported fossil fuels are not costed in. However, expenditure would fall heavily on energy bills rather than being spread imperceptibly across the economy. The political leadership challenge is clear. What does it mean for the UK? The Climate Change Act contains a legally binding target for an 80% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions by 2050. This is broadly compatible with the IPCC conclusion that global emissions need to fall by 40-70%. The UK also has a system of five-year carbon budgets that act as stepping stones towards the 2050 target. UK policy therefore has a built-in mechanism which, if used, can ensure that emissions reductions are not delayed. The government is considering a recommendation from the committee on climate change that the fourth carbon budget, covering 2023-27, should not be loosened. The IPCC report provides substantial support for this argument. If the UK is going to play a leading role in international negotiations, cut emissions in line with the IPCC analysis and keep its options open, the prompt action signalled by the existing fourth carbon budget is essential. This, along with the evidence presented by the IPCC in its previous reports, should provide governments around the world with the information they need to accelerate action against the dangerous impact of climate change."

"Catastrophic climate change can be averted without sacrificing living standards according to a UN report, which concludes that the transformation required to a world of clean energy is eminently affordable.“It doesn’t cost the world to save the planet,” said economist Professor Ottmar Edenhofer, who led the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) team. The cheapest and least risky route to dealing with global warming is to abandon all dirty fossil fuels in coming decades, the report found. Gas – including that from the global fracking boom – could be important during the transition, Edenhofer said, but only if it replaced coal burning.  The authoritative report, produced by 1,250 international experts and approved by 194 governments, dismisses fears that slashing carbon emissions would wreck the world economy. It is the final part of a trilogy that has already shown that climate change is “unequivocally” caused by humans and that, unchecked, it poses a grave threat to people and could lead to wars and mass migration. Diverting hundred of billions of dollars from fossil fuels into renewable energy and cutting energy waste would shave just 0.06% off expected annual economic growth rates of 1.6%-3%, the IPCC report concluded.“The report is clear: the more you wait, the more it will cost [and] the more difficult it will become,” said EU commissioner Connie Hedegaard. The US secretary of state, John Kerry, said: “This report is a wake-up call about global economic opportunity we can seize today as we lead on climate change.” The UK’s energy and climate secretary, Ed Davey, said: “The [report shows] the tools we need to tackle climate change are available, but international efforts need to significantly increase.” The IPCC economic analysis did not include the benefits of cutting greenhouse gas emissions, which could outweigh the costs. The benefits include reducing air pollution, which plagues China and recently hit the UK, and improved energy security, which is currently at risk in eastern Europe due to the actions of Russia – a large producer of gas – in Ukraine. The new IPCC report warns that carbon emissions have soared in the last decade and are now growing at almost double the previous rate. But its comprehensive ­analysis found rapid action can still limit global warming to 2C, the internationally agreed safe limit, if low-carbon energy triples or quadruples by 2050. “It is actually affordable to do it and people are not going to have to sacrifice their aspirations about improved standards of living,” said Professor Jim Skea, an energy expert at Imperial College London and co-chair of the IPCC report team. “It is not a hair shirt change of lifestyle at all that is being envisaged and there is space for poorer countries to develop too,” Skea told the Guardian. Nonetheless, to avoid the worst impacts of climate change at the lowest cost, the report envisages an energy revolution ending centuries of dominance by fossil fuels – which will require significant political and commercial change. On Thursday, Archbishop Desmond Tutu called for an anti-apartheid style campaign against ­fossil fuel companies, which he blames for the “injustice” of climate change. Friends of the Earth’s executive director, Andy Atkins, said: “Rich nations must take the lead by rapidly weaning themselves off coal, gas and oil and funding low-carbon growth in poorer countries.” Along with measures that cut energy waste, renewable energy – such as wind, hydropower and solar – is viewed most favourably by the report as a result of its falling costs and large-scale deployment in recent years.  The report includes nuclear power as a mature low-carbon option, but cautions that it has declined globally since 1993 and faces safety, financial and waste-management concerns. Carbon capture and storage (CCS) – trapping the CO2 from coal or gas burning and then burying it – is also included, but the report notes it is an untested technology on a large scale and may be expensive. Biofuels, used in cars or power stations, could play a “critical role” in cutting emissions, the IPCC found, but it said the negative effects of some biofuels on food prices and wildlife remained unresolved. The report found that current emission-cutting pledges by the world’s nations make it more likely than not that the 2C limit will be broken and it warns that delaying action any further will increase the costs. Delay could also force extreme measures to be taken including sucking CO2 out of the air. This might be done by generating energy by burning plants and trees, which had absorbed carbon from the atmosphere, and then using CCS to bury the emissions. But the IPCC warned such warned such carbon removal technologies may never be developed and could bring new risks. “This is a very responsible report,” said Professor Andrew Watson, an atmospheric scientist at the University of Exeter who was not part of the IPCC team. He said there were economic and social risks in transforming the energy system to cut carbon. “However, there are even bigger risks if we do nothing and rely exclusively on being able to ride out climate change and adapt to it.” Environmental campaign groups, which have previously criticised the IPCC for being too conservative, welcomed the new report. WWF’s Samantha Smith said: “The IPCC report makes clear that acting on emissions now is affordable, but delaying further increases the costs. It is a super strong signal to [fossil fuel] investors: they can no longer say they did not know the risks.” Kaisa Kosonen, at Greenpeace International, said: “Renewable energy is unstoppable. It’s becoming bigger, better and cheaper every day. Dirty energy industries are sure to put up a fight but it’s only a question of time before public pressure and economics dictate that they either change or go out of business.” • This article was amended on 27 May 2015 to correct a figure from the IPCC report."
"It's big and bumpy with a gooey interior and a powerful smell of decay – but it could help keep millions of people from hunger. Researchers say jackfruit – a large ungainly fruit grown across south and south-east Asia – could be a replacement for wheat, corn and other staple crops under threat from climate change. The World Bank and United Nations warned recently that rising temperatures and unpredictable rainfall had already reduced yields of wheat and corn, and could lead to food wars within the decade. Now researchers say jackfruit could help provide the solution. Jackfruit is the largest known treeborne fruit. Even a small jackfruit weighs in at 10-15lbs (5-7kg), and farmers have recorded specimens of more than 100lbs (45kg). ""It's a miracle. It can provide so many nutrients and calories – everything,"" said Shyamala Reddy, a biotechnology researcher at the University of Agriculture Sciences in Bangalore, India. ""If you just eat 10 or 12 bulbs of this fruit, you don't need food for another half a day."" But jackfruit, despite its huge potential, remains underexploited as a food crop in India, where it originated. That is beginning to change, however, with a growing number of researchers looking for alternatives. Reddy's university will host an international conference on jackfruit in May. She said the Indian government had launched a number of new initiatives to promote the crop by expanding its use as a canned vegetable and as a processed food. The effort coincides with a global push to expand food production, especially in developing countries which are expected to face growing challenges to feed their people in the coming decades. Jackfruit can fill the gap on a number of counts, said Danielle Nierenberg, president of Food Tank, which works on sustainable agriculture. ""It is easy to grow. It survives pests and diseases and high temperatures. It is drought-resistant,"" she said. ""It achieves what farmers need in food production when facing a lot of challenges under climate change."" The fruit is rich in potassium, calcium, and iron, said Reddy, making it more nutritious than current starchy staples. Sri Lanka and Vietnam have established jackfruit industries, where the fruit is processed into products as diverse as flour, noodles, papad and ice cream. Jackfruit is also canned and sold as a vegetable for export. But jackfruit remains a hard sell in much of India. Although the fruit was seen as an important staple 40 or 50 years ago, it is now derided as a poor man's fruit, said Shree Padre, a jackfruit farmer from Karnataka. Only one or two commercial-scale jackfruit plantations are in current operation. ""In the country of origin, it is just not understood,"" he said. ""There is an inferiority attached to jackfruit. Any farmer would happily carry an imported apple in his hand rather than jackfruit."" The down-market reputation is unwarranted, said Nyree Zerega, a researcher on plant biology at the Chicago Botanic Garden, who has studied jackfruit in Bangladesh. In addition to its high nutritional value, the fruit is very versatile, she said. The seeds, young fruit, and mature varieties are all edible. The timber from jackfruit trees is also valuable. ""It is just not being utilised,"" she said. ""I think it could play a much more important role in diets than it currently does and be a staple,"" she continued. ""In addition to consuming cooked young jackfruit, ripe jackfruit, and jackfruit seeds, there are also many food products with longer shelf life that can be made from jackfruit."" Processing the fruit can be offputting, she conceded. The larger fruit give off a strong odour, and ooze a thick white sap. ""It is not the easiest fruit,"" Zerega said. But jackfruit, breadfruit, and other non-traditional crops are being reexamined because of fears about future food supply. A report from the International Panel on Climate Change last month warned that heatwaves, drought, and unpredictable rainfall patterns were already cutting into yields of wheat and maize. The World Bank's Dr Jim Yong Kim earlier this month predicted food shortages could lead to wars within the next five to 10 years. ""There is just more interest in crops that aren't the major staples,"" she said. ""We just don't have a choice. We are going to have to explore some of these alternative to make sure we are going to be able to nourish people,"" Nierenberg said. • This article was amended on 25 April to correct the spelling of Nyree Zerega's name."
"The Worldometers website is compulsive viewing. If you watch this ""real time world statistics"" site ticking, you will see the world's soil disappearing before your eyes. The statistic for land lost to soil erosion ticks over slower than some (the one measuring world population, say, or the number of cigarettes smoked), but it's growing a few hectares a minute. And it's not only in impoverished regions of the world; the UK's soil is in peril too. Erosion, compaction, pollution, development and loss of organic matter are damaging something that's as vital to life as water and air. It can take up to 500 years to form 1cm of soil, and Defra says soil degradation costs England and Wales between £0.9bn and £1.4bn every year.  Soils vary wildly, from chalk to clay, acid to alkaline; there are more than 1,800 different types in the UK alone. After the deluge this winter, many rivers ran brown as soil washed out to sea. Exposed, damaged soil is vulnerable to being washed away by high rainfall, while reduced organic matter and compaction caused by over-cultivation or over-grazing make it less absorbent. Where water once soaked in, it now runs off, exacerbating flooding and causing further erosion. Patrick Holden, a British farmer who once ran the Soil Association and now heads up the Sustainable Food Trust, warns that the floods have seen a ""catastrophic leaching of goodness from the soil"". He says soil is at the fulcrum of the debate about sustainability: ""It is the irreplaceable resource on which the future of civilisation depends. We should be seriously worried. Soils are haemorrhaging across the world."" Why should we care? Because, as Professor Jane Rickson from the National Soil Resources Institute says, ""Soil is amazing, providing us with food, fuel and fodder, storing water and carbon, and supporting habitats and infrastructure. It's like an engine made up of physical, chemical and biological components. It is their interaction that makes it work."" Soil may seem simple, benign stuff, but it teems with life. A teaspoon of rich garden soil contains up to a billion bacteria, within a complex and shifting mixture of grains, pores, channels and chambers. The microbes store, transform and release nutrients that plants need: nitrogen for growing leaves, phosphorus for roots and potassium for flowers and fruit. Soil is also connected to climate. Healthy soil stores and slowly releases water in periods of drought or flood. It's also a carbon sink – there's more carbon stored in the soil than in vegetation or the atmosphere. When soil is blown away by wind and rain, it releases carbon into the atmosphere. The threats soil faces may be great, but there is still hope. Holden says gardeners need to act as ""soil stewards"" alongside farmers, and encourages us to see soil as a sort of stomach, digesting the food that plants need. That stomach, packed with friendly bacteria, should be fed well and treated with care. • Keep off saturated ground – it needs time to drain and dry. • Start mulching – it's the simplest and easiest way to protect and improve soil. • Compost all you can, so you can feed soil with rich organic matter. • Say no to polluting chemical fertilisers and pesticides. • Keep growing – plants prevent erosion and help the soil sequester carbon. • Download a soil and earthworm survey. Who's who in the soil food web: Tiny strands of mycorrhizal fungi live in symbiosis with plant roots, helping them to extract nutrients from soil. Nematodes are a group of microscopic, wormlike organisms that eat bacteria, fungi, algae and other organisms. Bacteria are microorganisms that help to break down organic matter. Some help to fix nitrogen, too. Protozoa are single-celled organisms that eat bacteria. Mites, centipedes, spiders, beetles, springtails and woodlice are all arthropods: invertebrates that eat fungi, bacteria, plant particles and each other, producing nutrients for plants and aerating the soil. Worms draw organic material into the soil, improve soil structure and aid the growth of plant roots."
"The Union of Concerned Scientists (UCS) has just published an analysis of 2013 climate coverage by the three major American cable news networks. The report and data are available online, and the results are summarized in the figure below.  UCS reviewed nearly 600 segments mentioning ""global warming"" or ""climate change"" across the networks' most prominent evening and weekend programs during the 2013 calendar year. Segments that contained any inaccurate or misleading representations of climate science were categorized as misleading; otherwise they were characterized as being accurate.  UCS also put the misleading statements in sub-categories that reveal the problematic tendencies of each network's climate coverage. Aaron Huertas, a science communications officer at UCS who led the analysis said of the difference between network climate coverage, ""Sometimes, it's like the networks are covering different planets. Unfortunately, too many politicians, interest groups, and pundits continue to dispute established climate science and cable shows sometimes give them a platform to do so."" The UCS analysis found that Fox News Channel hosts and guests were the most likely to accuse scientists of manipulating or hiding climate data. Fox hosts and guests often conveyed misinformation about scientific findings, including many false claims that global warming is not occurring.  However, Fox did have some accurate climate coverage, including interviews with policymakers and fact-checking segments. Special Report with Bret Baier and The O'Reilly Factor were responsible for almost all of the network's accurate coverage, though both shows also had segments that featured inaccurate representations of science. The Five was the main culprit behind Fox's climate inaccuracies, and was responsible for 53% of the network's misleading coverage. If not for this program, Fox would have had a climate reporting accuracy rating of 45%. Despite just 28% of Fox's coverage being accurate in 2013, this was a significant improvement for the network. A 2012 UCS report found that Fox News' representation of climate science was accurate just 7% of the time over a six-month study period. On CNN, most of the segments that included inaccurate climate statements were from debates featuring guests who reject aspects of established science. Many networks like CNN and BBC that try to be 'balanced' in their climate reporting fall victim to false balance, giving the minority view disproportionate coverage, often in debate-style segments. However, two prominent CNN hosts condemned false balance this February, and since then CNN has not held a misleading debate on climate change. MSNBC's climate coverage was far and away the most accurate. On a few occasions, hosts and guests overstated the speed and severity of sea-level rise as well as the link between climate change and some forms of extreme weather, such as tornadoes. However, they also accurately conveyed science on those topics in other instances. 57% of MSNBC's accurate coverage featured some criticism of politicians or other public figures that dispute established climate science. MSNBC also had the most frequent climate coverage of the three major cable networks. Chris Hayes' coverage particularly stood out for the frequency and depth with which he approached climate coverage. These findings help explain why Americans tend to be relatively poorly informed about climate change. 38% of American adults watch cable news, with Fox News having the largest viewership. Only two-thirds of Americans accept that climate change is occurring, and less than half of Americans recognize that it is largely due to human activities. This is a stark contrast to the 97% expert consensus on human-caused global warming. Inaccurate climate coverage on cable news networks, especially Fox News, can account for some of the American public's lack of awareness of human-caused climate change. While Fox News' climate coverage has improved over the past year, the network has a long way to go if its goal is to accurately inform its viewers. CNN's coverage is better, but the network needs to stop approaching climate science like a political debate. MSNBC provides a good example for the other networks to emulate in terms of factual accuracy and volume of climate coverage, though the network needs to be careful not to gloss over important nuances when discussing the links between climate change extreme weather."
"On Sunday night Australian time, the intergovernmental panel on climate change (IPCC) will release its final working group report on reducing carbon pollution. These “mitigation” reports have been historically the bridesmaids to the earlier reports on climate science which get more of the media attention. Because the report's conclusions will shape the global discussion about what all major emitters should be doing next on climate change policy, it may be more important for Australian and global climate policy than the other two reports combined.  Based on leaked drafts of the work of the world’s leading climate economists, the IPCC are likely to make three important overall conclusions. The first is that avoiding dangerous global warming of 2oC is possible, but urgent action is required across all major countries and emitting sectors. Turning our coal, oil and gas based energy system to one based on clean energy sources like wind and solar, improving the energy efficiency of our buildings, industries and transport sector, stopping deforestation and deploying technologies that remove carbon pollution from the air are all essential ingredients to effective action. This is possible with political will and sensible, consistent policy. Secondly, the IPCC is likely to also illustrate that well executed climate policy decisions can provide broader benefits to communities, such as reductions in air pollution and improvements in energy security. Delaying effective action will also substantially increase the cost of achieving long-term climate goals. Those factors are a key driver behind growing global action on renewable energy and energy efficiency. Thirdly, effective national climate policy should include a suite of policies: carbon pricing, regulations to overcome barriers to action, and long-term investment signals (such as Australia’s renewable energy target scheme) are all essential. But beyond all this common sense, the real sting in the tail for the government will be what the IPCC says around the scale of emission reductions needed to contribute our fair bit to global action. In its last report, the IPCC indicated that countries like Australia would need to reduce emissions by 25-40% on 1990 levels by 2020, and 80-95% by 2050, to give a 50/50 chance of avoiding a 2oC increase in global temperature. This target range became a benchmark by which national targets were discussed. Many – including Australia, the USA, the EU, Norway and Japan – indicated their willingness to reduce emissions across this scale in advance of the Copenhagen climate summit.  The new IPCC report will have a similar impact, likely pointing out that countries like Australia need to reduce emissions by 50% on 2010 levels by 2030 to be consistent with the agreed global goal of avoiding 2oC, while major emerging economies like China would need to see emissions peak and begin to fall. These conclusions are not emerging in a void. Last December, countries agreed to advance new post 2020 emission targets by April 2015. European Union member countries are likely to be the first to come forward with a 2030 emission target. The US is working with China on sharing information on their targets, and the US government has established an interagency working group to develop their new target by April 2015. These targets will be examined internationally before the new global climate agreement is finalised in Paris in December 2015. Of course, countries want to see the commitments others are making before they sign on the dotted line in Paris. They want to look under the bonnet at what others are putting forward, so they don’t buy a clunker. A key criterion in this evaluation will be whether each country’s target is consistent with a fair contribution to avoiding warming of 2oC. The IPCC’s conclusions will shape this global conversation. The government is yet to outline what preparations Australia is making for its post-2020 target, or whether we will join other major emitters in advancing our initial target offer by April 2015 (as we have agreed to do in Warsaw last year). The ALP has been no less committal, and continues a slip and slide on emission targets that started in 2009. Its policy to reduce emissions through an internationally linked carbon limit and price can achieve emission targets at low cost. However, the ALP keeps deferring a decision on its exact targets, despite initiating a number of independent expert reviews on what they should be. Those experts have recommended at least a 15% reduction in emissions by 2020. It’s clear that neither the government nor the ALP want us to discuss what contribution Australia is going to make to the Paris agreement and what emission goals we should set post 2020. Other governments are asking politely now, but as the 2015 climate summit gets closer, these questions will get more pointed. This weekend’s report from the IPCC will just be the start. "

"The UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change's (IPCC) Fifth Assessment Report on the impacts of global warming this century has been widely recognised as clarifying beyond all doubt that we do, indeed, face an unprecedented planetary emergency. Moreover, not one that will arrive far into the future, but that's happening right now.   The report states unequivocally that: ""… recent climate-related extremes, such as heat waves, droughts, floods, cyclones, and wildfires, reveal significant vulnerability and exposure of some ecosystems and many human systems to current climate variability."" Over the last few years, ""several periods of rapid food and cereal price increases following climate extremes in key producing regions indicate a sensitivity of current markets to climate extremes among other factors.""  Just look at the unrest in Egypt, Syria and Ukraine – not to mention Venezuela, Bosnia, Thailand, Argentina, Brazil, Bangladesh, China, Kyrgyzstan, Turkey, among many more - all of which are related to the fact that food prices have hovered around ""the boiling point"" over the last 18 months.  And according to a new report by the Environmental Justice Foundation (EJF), in 2012 alone 31.7 million people were forced from their homes due to extreme weather events such as flooding and storms. As I've argued before, this is a taste of things to come, rooted as it is in a 'perfect storm' convergence of climate, energy and economic crises.  The EJF points out that every 1 degree Celsius (C) rise in global average temperatures is estimated to cause a 14% increase of intergroup conflict and a 4% increase of interpersonal violence. While climate change does not by itself necessitate conflict, refracted through the current structures of an increasingly unequal global political economy, it dramatically increases the risk. In the IPCC's words, continued climate change will bring with it an escalating ""breakdown of food systems linked to warming, drought, flooding, and precipitation variability and extremes."" This collapse of interdependent human and natural systems, in turn, will likely ""prolong existing, and create new, poverty traps, the latter particularly in urban areas and emerging hotspots of hunger,"" as well as increasing ""risks of violent conflicts in the form of civil war and inter-group violence.""  But violent conflict, in turn, ""increases vulnerability to climate change"" by harming ""assets that facilitate adaptation, including infrastructure, institutions, natural resources, social capital, and livelihood opportunities"" – creating a vicious cycle. What's most disturbing about the new report, though, is its business as usual scenarios. The IPCC projects that our current carbon emissions trajectory is heading for carbon dioxide (CO2) concentrations of 936 ppm by 2100, which would lead to a rise in global temperatures of between 4 and 5C. For anyone who doubts how alarming this trajectory really is, the following IPCC statement is notable: ""By 2100 for the high-emission scenario RCP8.5, the combination of high temperature and humidity in some areas for parts of the year is projected to compromise normal human activities, including growing food or working outdoors."" As Joe Romm astutely observed about this telling, but little-noted, paragraph:  ""Bottom line: We are at risk of making large parts of the planet's currently arable and populated land virtually uninhabitable for much of the year - and irreversibly so for hundreds of years."" The problem is that the IPCC's worst-case business as usual projections are very conservative. IPCC models largely don't account for complex amplifying feedbacks, and appear to underestimate the sensitivity of the earth system to CO2 – to such an extent that a 2011 paper in Science pointed to paleoclimate data 30-100 million years ago showing that the earth was 16C warmer at CO2 levels we're pitched to reach by end of century. Yet the rate of current change is far faster than ever happened in earth's history. As IPCC lead author Dr Daniela Schmidt said:  ""What our findings very clearly spell out is that since the time of the dinosaurs we have not had climate change at rates as rapid as it's currently happening. So, it's the rates and the magnitudes of those changes which are really important."" What's worse is that the IPCC's forthcoming report on climate mitigation, due out mid-April, will reportedly underscore that we are well on our way to breaching the atmospheric concentrations required to maintain a safe climate at 2C. Rich countries led by the United States need to halve their emissions from 2010 levels by 2030, while fast developing countries like China and India must limit emissions to 2010 levels in the same time-frame.  But in reality most governments are nowhere near planning such deep curbs – which themselves overlook the fact that a growing body of scientific literature suggests the 2C limit is too high, implying that even deeper emissions cuts are necessary to avoid hitting the tipping point into dangerous warming. The elephant (or rather, zombie) in the room, of course, is Big Oil – not to mention Big Gas and Big Coal. Despite occasional rosy statements vaguely indicating recognition of the reality of climate change, major agents of what Jeremy Leggett calls ""the incumbency"" have inadvertently made very clear where they really stand in the battle to save planet earth.  In a series of carefully-timed reports released on the same day as the IPCC's climate impact assessment, Exxon-Mobil said that it will continue to sell fossil fuels without restriction despite climate change, and that it was confident governments would do the same: ""… the scenario where governments restrict hydrocarbon production in a way to reduce GHG [greenhouse gas] emissions 80 percent during the Outlook period is highly unlikely. The Outlook demonstrates that the world will require all the carbon-based energy that ExxonMobil plans to produce during the Outlook period… We see population, GDP and energy needs increasing for the world over the Outlook period, and that all economically viable energy sources will be required to meet these growing needs."" Exxon-Mobil goes to almost absurd lengths to dismiss the capacity of renewable energy sources to challenge the hegemony of the fossil fuel incumbency: ""…. renewables will continue to comprise about 5 percent of the total energy mix by 2040. Factors limiting further penetration of renewables include scalability, geographic dispersion, intermittency (in the case of solar and wind), and cost relative to other sources. The cost limitations of renewables are likely to persist even when higher costs of carbon are considered."" So instead, we are assured that:  ""Traditional energy sources have had many decades to scale up to meet the enormous energy needs of the world. As discussed above, renewable sources, such as solar and wind, despite very rapid growth rates, cannot scale up quickly enough to meet global demand growth while at the same time displacing more traditional sources of energy."" Therefore, the report concludes, ""it is difficult to envision governments choosing this path [a ""low carbon scenario""] in light of the negative implications for economic growth and prosperity that such a course poses, especially when other avenues may be available."" Exxon-Mobil's sentiments appear to be shared by others, such as Royal Dutch Shell, which in 2008 identified potential scenarios for the next 40 years based on ""three hard truths"": the surge in energy demand, the struggle of supplies to meet demand, and intensifying environmental stresses.  One scenario, called ""Blueprints,"" forecasts a transition to more environmentally-friendly practices. Another, ""Scramble"", forecasts the opposite: a lack of decisive action on climate change, coal and biofuels driving growth in developing countries with unconventional oil and gas propelling US and western growth, and intensifying climate impacts such as rising food prices and extreme weather. Publicly, Shell has declared that the ""Blueprints"" scenario represents its chosen path. Privately, reports journalist McKenzie Funk - author of Windfall: The Booming Business of Global Warming (2014) - the head of Shell's scenario team told him in 2012: ""We've gone to Scramble. This is a Scramble kind of world. This is what we're doing.""  Funk's book is eye-opening. Far from denying climate change, he documents a consistent pattern of mining and agricultural companies, energy conglomerates, hedge funds, and Wall Street traders, among others, who are eagerly profiting from climate impacts in the form of rocketing resource prices. They are investing in farmland, water, raw materials, minerals and energy, at the expense of everyone else. But Big Oil is dead wrong. The incumbency as a whole has consistently underestimated the rise of renewables, and failed to anticipate its meteoric growth. The truth is that the incumbency knows its both dead, and wrong, but is desperate to ensure investors know neither.  A new Citigroup report out last week hails the dawn of the ""age of renewables"" in the US – the world's largest electricity market – where it finds that solar and wind power are becoming cost competitive with fossil fuels, including coal and gas, and even with nuclear. Rising and volatile gas prices, and the structurally disadvantageous nature of coal and nuclear due to ageing nuclear fleets and high production costs led Citigroup to conclude: ""We predict that solar, wind, and biomass continue to gain market share from coal and nuclear into the future… As solar, wind, biomass, and other power sources gain market share from coal, nukes, and gas, the LCOE [levelised cost of energy] metric increasingly becomes important to the new build power generation decision-making."" The numbers speak for themselves and clearly ""set the bar for alternative energy"": ""Given the large expected increase in demand for gas, offset by production gains, gas prices are expected to rise over the long term. As a result, the bar for renewables and other fuel sources to cross continues to rise, thus making it easier for alternatives to gain market share… Solar is still early in the growth cycle, and in many countries - Germany, Spain, Portugal, Australia, and the Southwest US - residential-scale solar has already competed with average residential electricity prices. In 2013, solar was the second-largest source of new generation capacity behind natural gas - its prospects look bright in 2014 and beyond as costs continue to decline and improve the LCOE picture."" It's now increasingly recognised that the transition into the post-carbon era must involve not simply ""adaptation"" and ""mitigation"" – the stale buzzwords of bureaucracy - but entail radical transformation of our societies at multiple levels. Even the IPCC's forthcoming mitigation plan concedes: ""Stabilising greenhouse gas concentrations will require large-scale transformations in human societies."" But perhaps no clearer manifesto for this transformation came from an unexpected editorial in the British Medical Journal, stating that: ""The IPCC report shows the need for 'radical and transformative change.'… This is an emergency. Immediate and transformative action is needed at every level: individual, local, and national; personal, political, and financial."" The editorial endorses the World Bank president's call for ""divestment from fossil fuels and investment in green energy,"" and highlights the health benefits of change:  ""More active forms of transport and the consumption of less red meat will cut death and illness from cardiovascular disease, obesity, diabetes, and cancer. Less air pollution will cut the global burden of asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, cancer, and heart disease… If we are to avoid catastrophic climate change and bequeath a sustainable planet worth living on, we must push, as individuals and as a profession, for a transformed, sustainable, and fair world."" The post-carbon era is upon us. Unfortunately, the Zombie Incumbency is in denial – but one wouldn't expect much more from the walking dead.  The only question, therefore, is what can each of us as individuals do – however small within our own context - to start becoming the change we want to see in the world? Because before every giant leap was a baby step.

"It could be a village fete. There are rugs spread out, bunting, and several green gazebos. People are sitting on folding camp stools, and knowledgeable locals are keeping an eye on the Sussex skies for the first sign of rain. Only the placards and banners strike the wrong note. Because the villagers and visitors gathered together are here not to raise money for the church roof, but to try to stop a plan to drill for fossil fuels under their homes and fields. That was my first experience of the protest at Balcombe, last summer. It's been a long journey since then, via five hours in the cells of Crawley police station, months of preparing our case, and finally six days at the magistrates court in Brighton.  Balcombe, as one of the first places in the UK to be earmarked as a potential fracking site, has been the frontline in a major struggle over the search and exploitation of yet more fossil fuels – and the stakes could hardly be higher. Fracking not only has a range of serious local environmental impacts, including risks of air and water contamination, but it also radically undermines efforts to tackle the climate crisis – which in turn means our children will inherit a much more hazardous world. Many of my constituents have written to raise their concerns about this with me. Our peaceful protest in August 2013 was designed to raise greater awareness about the dangers of fracking, and to put pressure on the government to change course. The window for action is closing fast. Two UN climate reports that came out during the trial have made it clear that greenhouse gas emissions from burning fossil fuels are rising faster than ever, and that the only way to avoid the worst impacts of climate change is to switch urgently to renewable energy, reduce energy demand, and wean ourselves off fossil fuels for good. As an MP, I'm in the privileged position of being able to make the case in parliament. I've tabled motions, put questions to ministers, spoken out in the media – and will continue to do so. But the government is ignoring the evidence, rejecting the climate science, and dismissing the enormous benefits of a secure and affordable energy system based on renewables and energy efficiency. Instead they are set on a reckless and irresponsible new dash for gas, offering the fossil fuel companies generous tax breaks as well as influence within government itself. Experts are clear that we need to leave around 80% of known fossil fuel reserves in the ground if we're to have any chance of avoiding dangerous climate change. With this in mind, it makes no sense to start a new industry extracting shale oil and gas. That's why I decided to join the peaceful protest in Balcombe. There is a proud tradition of nonviolent direct action in this country, and I believe that using peaceful means to try to stop a process that will cause enormous damage is not only reasonable, but also morally necessary. My acquittal and that of my four other co-defendants yesterday is a huge relief, but it's by no means a cause for celebration. That will only happen when David Cameron announces an end to fracking, and invest instead in cleaner, greener energy sources. Fittingly, people in Balcombe are showing the way again. Last month saw the launch of REPOWERBalcombe, a new community energy company set up by local residents with the aim of generating the equivalent of 100% of the village's electricity from clean, renewable energy. This initiative and many like them are the way forward, creating genuine energy security, lower emissions, lower fuel bills and more jobs – not ever more government support for a dirty, polluting dinosaur of an industry that should be well down its evolutionary path to extinction."
"Unless we undertake additional measures to reduce emissions, we are heading for a temperature increase of around 4C by 2100 as compared to pre-industrial levels, according to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) report this month. To have a likely chance of limiting the temperature increase to the globally agreed target of 2C, emissions must reduce at least 40-70% by 2050 compared to 2010 emissions (and it is even optimistic to assume that these reductions will be sufficient). This latest report gives behavioural change a much more central role than in 2007. Although it's acknowledged that ""only major institutional and technological change will give a better than even chance"" of not exceeding emissions, the report asserts that behavioural change can play a key role in achieving emission reductions. The report states for example that ""behaviours informed by awareness of energy and climate issues"" can reduce energy demand in buildings by up to 20% in the short run, and by 50% by 2050. One illustration being (pdf) that a typical office building in Zurich could reduce annual energy use for air-conditioning by a factor of more than three by adjusting their thermostat from 24C to 28C during the summer months. Behavioural change can be facilitated through a wide range of policies and measures, monetary and non-monetary incentives. Taxing emissions has long been the preferred choice in the economist's toolbox. However, they're usually unpopular, they raise fairness concerns, and they are not always very effective. Taxes and other conventional policy tools have been around for decades, and it would be difficult to claim that governments around the world have had great success in reducing emissions in this time. More recently a new policy tool has attracted attention: nudges. Nudges are defined as changes to the decision context that alter behaviour without forbidding any options, and without substantially changing prices. They can and have been applied across fitness and nutrition, from smoking to education, and several studies show that they can be very cost-effective climate policy tools: • Food waste: Food consumption is responsible for around a fifth of global greenhouse gas emissions, yet receives comparatively little focus compared to transport or deforestation. One study showed that by reducing the plate size by around an inch, restaurants can cut food waste by 20% – by nudging guests to leave less food. At GreenNudge we estimated the net benefit of introducing this to be around £2,600 per ton of CO2 saved. • Home energy: If we are informed that we use more energy than our neighbours, it seems we start thinking about how we are wasting energy, and start looking for ways to save energy. An MIT and Harvard University study found that adding smileys on utility bills, indicating performance compared to the average household in the same neighbourhood, and adding energy tips, improved energy-saving behaviour. They estimate this could, if scaled nationally, cut US emissions by 3m tons of CO2 per year at a net benefit of around $165 (£98) per ton. As the study concluded: ""This compares very favourably with other, more traditional strategies to reduce carbon emissions; wind power, carbon capture, and storage added to new coal power plants, and plug-in hybrid vehicles are estimated to cost $20, $44, and $15 per metric ton of CO2 abated."" While nudges have proven to be of interest to many, and effective in places, critics have argued that many of these measures, especially measures targeting energy efficiency, are unlikely to be very effective because of so-called rebound effects. A classic example being that if you get people to buy more fuel-efficient cars, it will be cheaper to drive, and hence people will drive more. Careful studies of rebound effects (pdf) find, however, that while they can reduce the impact of a measure, rebounds do not offset the effect fully, typically reducing effectiveness by 10-30%. There is still much more to explore and learn about the potential contribution of nudges to climate policy, but a few things already seem clear: • Nudges can in some instances be very effective policy tools. They can be cost effective, and target behaviours that other tools are not well suited for. What tax scheme would you use to get restaurant guests to leave less food waste behind? • Nudges can be a useful supplement to other tools. If energy taxes are in place, nudges can be used to make the operating costs of appliances more salient (and thanks to the taxes they will be higher), and help consumers choose more energy-efficient products. • Not all behaviours can be nudged successfully. It takes more than a nudge to get a utility company to invest in wind and solar power instead of coal or gas-fired power. Nudges should be seen as an addition to the climate policy toolbox, not as a replacement for the old tools. With this new IPCC emphasis, and as governments struggle to meet ambitious (yet still insufficient) climate targets, it is useful to take a serious look at nudges and other behavioural interventions as potentially useful supplements to the climate policy toolbox.

"Stop investing in dirty fossil fuels and rapidly shift to renewable energy to prevent dangerous climate change – this was the message from Sunday's long-awaited UN report from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. Why, then, is the government still kowtowing to big energy companies determined to keep us hooked on dirty energy? Last week I travelled to the south-west of England to meet people taking matters into their own hands.  Wadebridge Renewable Energy Network (Wren) in Cornwall and Plymouth Energy Community  in Devon are two exciting co-operatives rolling out clean energy in their local areas. For Stephen Frankel, chair of Wren and professor of epidemiology, the big energy shakeup isn't happening fast enough. Energy policy is fundamentally confused, he says. Politicians talk of decarbonising and decentralising our energy system, but the six large utility firms still have a stranglehold over energy policy – and all the money. Three years ago he was sitting at a pub table saying something had to be done, to take people back to the future, and give them control over their energy again. So off he went and did it. At their energy shop on the high street, Jerry Clark, technical director, explained to me how Wren works. We're a one-stop shop for energy, he said. You may not be motivated by climate change, but if you want to know how to save money on your energy bills, come on in and we'll tell you your options. Wren then acts as a broker – finding installers to fit free insulation, solar panels and so on – and the customer pays a small finder's fee. And what a success it has been. Already Wren has over 1,000 members in Wadebridge and the surrounding area, and has procured more than 200 installations. There are solar panels on the laundrette and the wine shop now, and also on a local school that we visited – they're saving it at least £5,000 annually. What's fascinating is that Wren even has its own currency, a beautifully decorated note given out like reward vouchers for a supermarket. It's accepted by independent shops in Wadebridge, keeping money in the town. The installers are local, and Wren also donates to the food bank and other nearby community projects. They say there's about £1m in the local economy that wouldn't be there otherwise – now that's something.  It is a little strange to think, though, that Wren's success relies on its customers finding their energy options so difficult to decipher – from the green deal to the renewable heat incentive. It's great that they trust Wren to make sense of it all, but does the government really need to make things so complicated? Wren is also working to provide local and cooperatively-owned energy at community scale, with the energy generated being used to power nearby homes at a reduced price. And it is pioneering aspects of a smart grid that can cope with fluctuations in generation from renewables.  They just need to overcome grid connection issues, Clark explained. The National Grid can be very slow to connect individual renewable energy installations and can charge a high amount for it, making the real cost to investors and communities far greater than that of the actual installation. It would have cost Wren over £1m to install solar on one particular Wadebridge school – crazy, isn't it? Wadebridge is working hard to become energy self-sufficient. By the end of this year around 89% of the energy used locally will be produced locally. But only about 3% of the energy being produced right now is through installations owned by local people. Wren hopes to bring more of the current and new generation into local ownership, with a goal of 30% by 2016. I looked down at it from the hillside: a fairly typical market town of fewer than 10,000 people, not renowned for its green credentials like neighbouring Totnes. If Wadebridge could go renewable, so could other towns like it – Wren estimates that a third of the country has the right size population, roof space, and sufficient surrounding land. With everything I'd seen and heard, we headed to Devon. In Plymouth, I met Dave Garland, a director of Plymouth Energy Community, and Alistair Macpherson, low-carbon city team leader at Plymouth city council. Their aim is to get solar panels onto at least 20 schools and community buildings in Plymouth over the next six months.  Plymouth city council has provided half the funding needed via a £500,000 low-cost loan – and the rest is being crowd-funded through a community share offer. In just over five weeks they have raised £484,000 – with around 58% of investors living in Plymouth. This is an amazing success. Partly it's down to its marketing budget; partly the council's endorsement. But what I really like is how accessible it is to ordinary people. The minimum share is just £50 – and with a rate of return of 6% per year, far higher than an ISA, why wouldn't you?  Schools can make huge annual savings through solar panels, with half-price clean electricity that could well cover library costs; as a former teacher, Garland holds the issue close to his heart. I couldn't agree more: it's why Friends of the Earth is launching its own new campaign to help schools nationwide go solar. But there are technical and legal challenges to getting many energy projects off the ground. As Macpherson said, success comes with having three or four key individuals with lots of expertise and spare time. But many groups aren't this lucky, and that's when you need a council to step in, as has been the case in Plymouth.  Certainly I think Macpherson is correct to say that local authorities should encourage community energy projects by providing funding, or at least permission and expertise. They are good long-term investments on behalf of local people, and a practical way for councils to demonstrate their commitment and leadership towards reducing carbon emissions. But we need help from central government too, starting first and foremost with greater ambition for community energy.  There's huge potential for community energy in the UK and it could play a major role in shifting us on to renewables. According to a report by the thinktank Respublica in September last year , community energy accounts for 46% of all energy produced from renewables in Germany, while in the UK this figure stands at just 0.3%. It's hard to see why the government is keeping it on the sidelines  – unless it's worried about the threat to it poses to the big six energy companies and the fossil-fuel status quo. The government must help people to start community energy projects, by making it easier to afford upfront costs. The funding announced in the community energy strategy - will only go so far. In Germany people can get low-interest community energy loans from their bank. I want to see these available on every UK high street. And community-owned installations should be given priority for grid connection, at a low, affordable cost. The winners of the global race to decarbonise will be the countries that invest now in solar power. Solar is already cheaper than gas in many parts of the world; it should be a no-brainer for any government serious about reducing energy bills and increasing energy security in a way that doesn't add to carbon emissions – unlike fracking. Community energy projects could go a long way towards providing solar in the UK, keeping down our energy bills, slashing carbon emissions, and boosting local economies. The government needs to act now to remove the barriers and empower ordinary people to launch a massive generation of new, clean energy projects.

"Much has been made about the Earth's energy imbalance (extra energy absorbed by the Earth). It is clear the Earth is out of balance, in laypersons' terms, it has a ""fever"". What isn't clear is how bad the fever is. A new study by Dr. Matt Palmer and Dr. Doug McNeall moves us closer to answering this ""fever"" question.   These scientists used data from the latest group of climate computer models (CMIP5) to look at the relationships between the energy flows at the top of the atmosphere, the surface temperature of the Earth, and changes in ocean energy. They made (in my mind), three important conclusions. First, there is a lot of variability in the Earth surface temperature. In fact, these natural fluctuations of the Earth surface temperature (0.3 degrees C per decade) can mask much of the underlying global warming. Consequently, you cannot use Earth surface temperatures over 10 years or so as an indicator of the Earth ""fever"". As we look over longer periods of time, the ""masking"" of global warming by internal fluctuations gets smaller; however, even for 15 years or so, natural fluctuations and human-caused global warming can be about the same size. Second, the authors found that an increase in the ocean energy explains almost all (95%) of the variation in the Earth energy balance. This means that more complete measurements of the global oceans would enable us to better measure the ""fever."" Finally, for time periods longer than a year, the ocean becomes the dominant storage reservoir for heat.  There were some other conclusions that are noteworthy. For instance, we have heard a lot about how things like volcanoes, human particulate emissions, and solar variability can also impact our understanding of the Earth's ""fever."" The current paper argues that these ""external"" influences may be smaller than the natural variability of the Earth system itself – the ""sloshing"" of energy in/out, and within the Earth system. Another phenomenon that has been reported on quite a bit recently, including by me and my colleague in these pages, is the role of energy storage deep in the ocean. The authors confirm that such storage likely plays a contributing factor to the internal variability. According to one of the authors, Dr. Palmer, who spoke about the importance of ocean and satellite measurements of the Earth's ""fever,"" ""My view is the net radiation at top-of-atmosphere (TOA) energy flow is the most fundamental measure of global warming since it directly represents the accumulation of excess solar energy in the Earth system. The lack of correlation between global surface temperature and TOA over ten years or so tells us that temperature trends are not a good indicator of how much energy is accumulating in the Earth system over the same period. This means that the recently observed ""pause"" in surface warming may tell us nothing about longer-term global climate change. Doug McNeall added, ""If you want to measure global warming on timescales of about a decade, measure the temperature of the oceans. The deeper you measure, the more accurately you'll measure the warming."" As I've said before, there is no ""pause"" in global warming. The Earth continues to absorb enormous amounts of energy. My own research and my colleague's have shown this, so too does updated and available data from NOAA. This paper is just the umpteenth nail in the coffin of that myth. It is also a note of caution from this paper: don't confuse the ""slosh"" with the ""fever"", or you might end up with egg on your face."
"The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change released its report on Monday, stating it is now beyond a shadow of a doubt that climate change will not leave anyone untouched and that ""the worst is yet to come."" Yet, without any apparent sense of irony, ExxonMobil launched its own report on the same day as the IPCC release, reassuring its investors that ""carbon-based fuels will continue to meet about three-quarters of global energy needs through 2040."" If we listen to ExxonMobil, it would be no exaggeration to say we can kiss the world as we know it goodbye.  Fortunately, we don't need to. The IPCC makes clear that taking decisive action now will save lives and money. In fact, reducing carbon pollution rapidly and immediately can cut the overall economic damages of climate change in half. We will hear more on this topic when part three of the report – on mitigation options – is released in Berlin next week. Given that the IPCC first sounded the alarm nearly 25 years ago, it's fair to ask why governments are more likely to take heed this time around. First, governments have already promised to do what's necessary to hold temperature rise below 2C. Second, combating climate change makes good economic sense. Investing in energy efficiency creates jobs, and in the US alone would save hundreds of billions of dollars on energy bills. Governments could generate additional benefits by phasing out the wasteful subsidiing of fossil fuels. Producer subsidies and tax credits which create corporate incentives for new exploration and development should be the first to go. For the same money, we should increase the development of clean, renewable energy. Don't believe anyone who tells you that a 100% renewable energy-powered future is unrealistic. There are no technical barriers to addressing the climate crisis. The only thing missing is political will and leadership. The race to put a man on the moon is evidence enough of what can be accomplished when there is the political will to do so. So how do we generate that necessary political will? Business and financial leaders, pension fund managers, religious and labour leaders, and people from all walks of life are joining the fight to prevent catastrophic climate change. It is becoming increasingly obvious that climate change is not only about protecting polar bears or the environment, but is fundamentally about people – about jobs, food, water, children, and quality of life. Global change will only happen when people perceive it as relevant to their daily struggles and priorities – and at this critical moment in history, people are connecting the dots. As leaders of the two largest international climate networks, we are optimistic that a political tipping point is approaching. Heads of state and government will gather at the United Nations this September for a summit which will focus exclusively on climate change. This represents a historic opportunity for our leaders to address the crisis head on, and for civil society to demand it of them. They must announce bold actions at the national and local levels which go far beyond the status quo. To remain within relatively safe limits of temperature rise, we can't bow to the will of the likes of ExxonMobil. The science tells us that we need to phase out greenhouse gas emissions by around the middle of the century. Admittedly, this is a challenging goal but unless we want to consign our children and grandchildren to a world reminiscent of a post-apocalyptic B-movie, it's a challenge worth accepting. So is it too late, or is it not too late? That is not a question, but a choice.

"Questions are rising about how companies should lobby on environmental issues, and the ways in which their lobbying is reported. In the US, for example, companies must disclose the subject of their lobbying, but do not have to disclose the position that they are lobbying for. This incomplete reporting opens them to concerns from consumers and investors.  In an age of increasing transparency, business leaders can expect more scrutiny, especially as concerns about the climate grow. While the politics and policies of climate change may be complicated, the message to a CEO is simple: there should be no question about where your company stands on climate policy.   Ikea Group has gotten the message, and is moving toward a transparent climate change policy. The company recently articulated its positions in this infographic. Thanks to internal leadership and partnerships with NGOs like WWF and the Climate Group, IKEA can now explain why climate change is relevant to its business interests and which policy actions it supports. Most importantly, it is taking these messages directly to policymakers throughout Europe, lobbying for ambitious, legally-binding 2030 targets for carbon dioxide emissions, renewable power and energy efficiency. A silent majority While some companies are stepping forward on climate change policy, many others have remained quiet. There are a variety of reasons for this silence. Some are wary of staking out a position on a politically-charged topic that might alienate customers. Others offer tepid public support, while privately lobbying against climate change policy. Many are simply struggling internally to understand business risks and opportunities, ensure consistent messaging, and find the capacity to engage in climate policy debates. However, regardless of the reason for their silence, some critics have argued that it prevents essential political breakthroughs on climate change. So why (and how) are companies like Ikea stepping up to inform and advance climate policy? More importantly, what can other companies do to articulate their positions and demonstrate their leadership? My colleagues and I at the World Resources Institute worked with the United Nations and several esteemed partners on a Caring for Climate report to answer these questions and create a common standard for engaging responsibly in climate policy debates. This guide, which is informed by business leaders, policymakers, investors, and NGOs from nearly two dozen countries, represents a baseline for action and transparent reporting. Continued silence or perceived inconsistencies put companies at risk. As Ford's recent link to Keystone XL shows, a lack of clarity fuels suspicion, speculation and distrust.  Shareholders and other stakeholders want to understand if and how companies support strong policy action to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and adapt to a changing climate. And, as Anne Kelly of Ceres has noted, silence does not equal neutrality: industry associations and other powerful interest groups can claim to be speaking for those companies who do not speak for themselves.  Increasing attention and interest  Investors are asking more questions. CDP, which is backed by more than 750 institutional investors representing more than $90tn in assets, is gathering information about corporate lobbying for the second year in a row. In 2014, it plans to extend its scope, scoring the quality of the disclosures that it receives. The group is currently exploring how to factor these responses into overall performance scores over time. Meanwhile, outside groups are looking closer at what companies are saying and doing on climate policy. the Union of Concerned Scientists has been reviewing companies' and industry groups' actions and influences, and calling out inconsistencies between their public positions and those of their lobbyists.  Other organizations are exploring the possibility of updating past studies, like SustainAbility's Influencing Power. Another option that some are exploring is benchmarking companies to establish leaders and laggards.  Actions speak loudest The bottom line for companies is that it pays to be proactive. Businesses that clarify their positions and are transparent about their influences can avoid any questions from investors, customers and NGOs. Further, supporting policies to reduce global greenhouse gas emissions now, instead of delaying for a few more years, would avoid some $5tn in additional costs, according to the International Energy Agency. Being proactive means identifying where climate change creates long-term risks and opportunities. It means ensuring that a company's lobbyists, and its industry groups' lobbyists, are pulling in the same direction as the company's long-term interests. These actions help ensure consistent, transparent engagement. A company can: 1. Clarify its position: Companies like Microsoft have issued public statements to clarify that their membership in climate-change denying industry groups like Alec ""is not an endorsement"" of their views on climate or energy policies. At the very least, these statements ensure that obstructive industry groups cannot claim to speak for all members on climate change. 2. Join with others to make climate policy asks: Groups like Business for Innovative Climate and Energy Policy (Bicep) in the US or the Prince of Wales's Corporate Leaders Group in Europe help members develop positions, sign letters and meet directly with legislators. Broader partnership groups, like the UN's Caring for Climate initiative, also help companies connect with high-level officials and ministers to discuss climate policy priorities. These are opportunities to influence climate policy debates with a strong, collective, constructive corporate voice.  3. Recruit others in its industry to shape policies that accelerate markets for low-carbon goods and services: WRI's policy engagement guide, published with the UN and others, highlights how the lighting industry and the information and communications technology industry are advocating strong policies that promote energy efficiency and climate change adaptation.  4. Level the playing field: Companies can push for rules that ensure that all businesses are held to a standard of transparency when it comes to policy engagement.     In the months ahead, climate change will be on the agenda at all political levels – local, national and international. Scientists have outlined current impacts and future implications of climate change, as well as the ambition required to minimize the risk of the worst disruptions to communities around the world.  Individual companies can choose to let others delay actions and decisions for a global response. Alternately, they can take a leadership role, identifying and aligning their political influences, and helping to explain to customers, shareholders and stakeholders why and how they are helping advance ambitious, specific policies to address climate change."

"95% of the entire fresh produce range sold by Asda is already at risk from climate change, according to a groundbreaking study by the supermarket giant. The report, which will be published in June, is the first attempt by a food retailer to put hard figures against the impacts global warming will have on the food it buys from across the world. Asda, which is owned by Walmart, brought in consultants PwC to map its entire global fresh produce supply chain against the models being used by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. Chris Brown, Asda's senior director for sustainable business, said the study shows the impacts are already being felt and will get progressively worse as time goes on. The results have already gone to the highest levels of management and Brown said some of the results were surprising. ""It did highlight things which we did not expect to see as well as quantifying the impacts."" ""Quite a lot of the debate is illuminated by opinions, this provides some much-needed data."" The only produce that would remain unaffected by a rise in temperatures would be those with easily moved production, like fresh herbs. Brown said the results show that it is imperative that supermarkets start to think strategically about how to cope with the impacts of rising emissions. Tackling views that the UK food supply might benefit from a warmer climate, Brown said: ""If we do nothing, we will leave a rubbish legacy for our children and the future would go one of two ways. One is that rich western economies can try to buy their way out of trouble although that is morally not acceptable, and emerging economies such as China will equally be able to use their economic power to secure access to food.  ""Secondly, there is the risk that we will act tactically rather than strategically as we won't have thought the implications through."" However, it's unlikely there will be a shortage of products on the shelves as the supermarkets have become experts in managing supply risks and seasonal volatility. ""I am not sure the shopper will recognise much difference as there will be strategic investments to manage weather implications, for example, growing salad crops under cover. ""The ingenuity and capacity of the supply chain to cope will insulate consumers but we cannot be certain which is why we need to makes these studies and review the implications."" Friends of the Earth senior food campaigner, Vicki Hird, welcomed the study and said Asda now needs to act.  ""Major retailers must wake up to the enormous climate change threat to food supplies – Asda must now put the problem at the core of its business,"" Hird said. ""If they really want to be a greener grocer they must take steps in its marketing strategy, reviewing products which use too much water and steering customers off meat, and in its supply chain, paying producers to cover the cost of sustainable production."" The supermarket chain says one pre-requisite for change is to win the ongoing support of customers. A survey of 9,500 shoppers in February showed nearly three quarters had actively investigated their fresh produce's origins. Paul Kelly, head of external affairs and corporate responsibility at Asda, said the survey shows the reputation of supermarkets is at risk unless they act. Focusing on the key issue of water scarcity in yesterday's Nature Climate Change, he wrote: ""Adequate water management in our business is not just important to enhance the resilience of supply chains but fundamental to maintain our reputation as a sustainable business. In order to cope with greater demands on water, Asda says there needs to be a fundamental reform of systems governing land and water use but points to the difficulty of individual companies to influence complex global supply chains. ""Monoculture production systems - for example, palm oil and sugar cane - may benefit local communities with employment and funding but they're often reliant on over-exploited water resources. Such systems need to be reconsidered and restructured."" The company is already reviewing its choice of what produce it wishes to see grown in what regions and assessing how better water management can alleviate climate change pressures. Saying that, it is in food retailers' best interests to invest in adequate water stewardship. Kelly points to examples at Asda such as launching a water-trickle scheme for celery growers in Spain, and working with a citrus supplier in Morocco to convert existing sprinkler practices to drip irrigation, which resulted in an initial 60% drop in water usage. But while Kelly said it is vital to engage with the various stakeholders on the ground, such as agribusiness, small scale farmers and local governments, the big unanswered question hampering collaboration is how to share out the cost of new investments. ""Although we have a menu of solutions to choose from, we lack the co-ordinated response and innovative financial mechanisms that would scale up implementation of those solutions,"" said Kelly. One way around this problem that Asda is exploring is to tie in farmers to longer term contracts in exchange for capital investments. ""Retailers like Asda would consider financial investments if the benefits are clearly identified and achievable,"" he said. ""A water-related investment could potentially shield retailers from water-induced market fluctuations and protect against price hikes or from having to source too often from more expensive options, for example overseas. ""It will also reduce the need to over-contract, which is currently required to ensure that the quantity of produce demanded by our customers is delivered even when there is poor weather; this adds to the transaction cost of the produce. By supporting growers in better water management, as we did in Spain for example, retailers could also potentially enhance retailer–farmer relationships.""

"A butterfly species whose population collapsed because of climate change and habitat loss has defied predictions of extinction to rapidly move to cooler climes and change its food plant. The quino checkerspot (Euphydryas editha quino), found in Mexico and California, has shifted to higher altitudes and surprisingly chosen a completely different species of plant on which to lay its eggs, according to research presented at the Butterfly Conservation's seventh international symposium in Southampton.  Its rapid adaption offers hope that other insects and species may be able to adapt unexpectedly quickly to climate change. ""Every butterfly biologist who knew anything about the quino in the mid-1990s thought it would be extinct by now, including me,"" said Prof Camille Parmesan of the Marine Sciences Institute at Plymouth University. The Quino was once abundant in southern California but the expansion of Los Angeles and San Diego saw it reduced to just two small colonies. Other populations in Mexico began declining sharply as global warming made conditions too hot and dry for its caterpillars' food plant, a species of plantain. Six years ago, Parmesan suggested that the endangered quino could be a prime candidate for ""assisted colonisation"" – to be moved by humans to cooler, unspoilt habitat north of Los Angeles. Instead, to the amazement of scientists, the butterfly did not need human help and reappeared on higher ground to the east, where its caterpillars are feeding on a flowering plant it has never eaten before. Several other butterfly species have been changing habitat or diet to cope with a changing climate but the quino checkerspot is the first butterfly known to science to change both so rapidly. Many environmentalists fear that climate change is happening too quickly for species to adapt but, according to Parmesan, this surprising example shows that some apparently doomed species may be more resilient than we imagine. However, she warned that this case showed that nature reserves, and linking together unspoilt habitat, was more important than ever to enable species to survive a changing climate. Without undeveloped land to the east of Los Angeles and San Diego, the quino checkerspot would have had nowhere to go and would have become extinct. ""We have to give these species the space to adapt,"" said Parmesan. ""In the early days of climate change people worried that nature reserves would be no longer useful because the species they protected would move out. Now we know that new species move in, and so they are more important than ever."" More than a quarter of Britain's 59 species are moving north, with butterflies such as the comma moving around 10km each year. With climate change, another UK species, the brown argus, has started to feed on wild geranium plants as a caterpillar, enabling it to spread rapidly through the Midlands and into northern England. But the international symposium also heard strong scientific evidence that climate change will create more losers than winners because unspoilt habitat is so fragmented, preventing many butterflies, moths and other insects from moving to more suitable places. Tom Oliver of the Centre for Hydrology and Ecology told the symposium that scientific modelling predicted a number of UK butterfly extinctions by the middle of this century."
"Monday saw the release of the latest climate report from the planet’s scientists. Predictions of famine, flood, and so on – mostly what we already knew, in even more striking language.  But Monday also saw the release of another document somewhat less expected, and probably at least as important in the ongoing battle over the future of the atmosphere and hence all of us who live in its narrow envelope.   Here’s the backstory. For 18 months now some of us have been campaigning for colleges, churches, cities and the like to sell their shares in fossil fuel companies, on the grounds that their business plans call for burning far more carbon than scientists believe the planet can safely handle. It’s become the fastest growing divestment movement in history — but some have tried to reach out to the industry and reach a middle ground instead, hoping to reform them instead of simply trying to break their power.  Profound thanks are due, then, to those shareholder activists who urged “constructive engagement” with the oil, gas and coal barons.  Because those organisations, groups like As You Sow, CERES, and the Interfaith Center on Corporate Responsibility, managed in very short order to get Exxon Mobil, the leader of the fossil fuel industry, to show its cards. In fact, in a truly historic moment, Exxon Mobil turned over the whole deck — and to its credit it showed it has nothing up its sleeve, no tricky rhetoric or sleight of hand. Just endless amounts of oil and gas.  On Monday the company issued two reports, in formal response to a shareholder resolution that demanded they disclose their carbon risk and talk about how they planned to deal with the fact that they and other oil giants have many times more carbon in their collective reserves than scientists say we can safely burn.   The company said that government restrictions that would force it to keep its reserves in the ground were “highly unlikely,” and that they would not only dig them all up and burn them, but would continue to search for more gas and oil — a search that currently consumes about $100 million of its investors’ money every single day. “Based on this analysis, we are confident that none of our hydrocarbon reserves are now or will become ‘stranded,’” they said.  This is an honest reply. It is as honest as the report that emerged the same day from the world’s climate scientists, which demonstrated that if Exxon Mobil and its ilk keep their promise to dig up their reserves and burn them, then the planet will no longer function effectively.   Some of us, cynically, thought all along that this would be Exxon’s posture. The company, after all, poured millions into denying climate science when that was still possible. That’s why we’ve been calling for divestment.  We’ve never thought that there was a small flaw in their business plan that could be altered by negotiation; we’ve always thought their business plan was to keep pouring carbon into the atmosphere. And indeed Exxon’s statements are easy to translate: “We plan on overheating the planet, we think we have the political muscle to keep doing it, and we dare you to stop it.” And they’re right — unless we build a big and powerful movement, they’ll continue to dominate our political life and keep change from ever taking place.  So now, with that information clearly on the table, it’s time for college boards and foundation heads, church denominations and city mayors to act and act firmly. By divesting — by announcing that they are breaking ties with these companies — they will begin the process of politically bankrupting them. Of taking away the social license that allows them to act with such consummate arrogance, on the very day that the planet’s scientists laid bare the impact of climate change on everything from crop yields to civil wars.   It’s never fun to see one’s cynicism confirmed. But Monday was a day for reality, on the scientific front but also the political, economic, and corporate.  The only open question left is what we’re going to do about it. "

"If you're poor, the only way you're likely to injure someone is the old traditional way: artisanal violence, we could call it – by hands, by knife, by club, or maybe modern hands-on violence, by gun or by car.  But if you're tremendously wealthy, you can practice industrial-scale violence without any manual labor on your own part. You can, say, build a sweatshop factory that will collapse in Bangladesh and kill more people than any hands-on mass murderer ever did, or you can calculate risk and benefit about putting poisons or unsafe machines into the world, as manufacturers do every day. If you're the leader of a country, you can declare war and kill by the hundreds of thousands or millions. And the nuclear superpowers – the US and Russia – still hold the option of destroying quite a lot of life on Earth.  So do the carbon barons. But when we talk about violence, we almost always talk about violence from below, not above.  Or so I thought when I received a press release last week from a climate group announcing that ""scientists say there is a direct link between changing climate and an increase in violence"". What the scientists actually said, in a not-so-newsworthy article in Nature two and a half years ago, is that there is higher conflict in the tropics in El Nino years, and that perhaps this will scale up to make our age of climate change also an era of civil and international conflict.  The message is that ordinary people will behave badly in an era of intensified climate change.  All this makes sense, unless you go back to the premise and note that climate change is itself violence. Extreme, horrific, longterm, widespread violence.  Climate change is anthropogenic – caused by human beings, some much more than others. We know the consequences of that change: the acidification of oceans and decline of many species in them, the slow disappearance of island nations such as the Maldives, increased flooding, drought, crop failure leading to food-price increases and famine, increasingly turbulent weather. (Think Hurricane Sandy and the recent typhoon in the Philippines, and heat waves that kill elderly people by the tens of thousands.)  Climate change is violence.  So if we want to talk about violence and climate change – and we are talking about it, after last week's horrifying report from the world's top climate scientists – then let's talk about climate change as violence. Rather than worrying about whether ordinary human beings will react turbulently to the destruction of the very means of their survival, let's worry about that destruction – and their survival. Of course water failure, crop failure, flooding and more will lead to mass migration and climate refugees – they already have – and this will lead to conflict. Those conflicts are being set in motion now. You can regard the Arab Spring, in part, as a climate conflict: the increase in wheat prices was one of the triggers for that series of revolts that changed the face of northernmost Africa and the Middle East. On the one hand, you can say, how nice if those people had not been hungry in the first place. On the other, how can you not say, how great is it that those people stood up against being deprived of sustenance and hope? And then you have to look at the systems that created that hunger - the enormous economic inequalities in places such as Egypt and the brutality used to keep down the people at the lower levels of the social system, as well as the weather. People revolt when their lives are unbearable. Sometimes material reality creates that unbearableness: droughts, plagues, storms, floods. But food and medical care, health and well-being, access to housing and education – these things are also governed by economic means and government policy. That's what the revolt called Occupy Wall Street was against. Climate change will increase hunger as food prices rise and food production falters, but we already have widespread hunger on Earth, and much of it is due not to the failures of nature and farmers, but to systems of distribution. Almost 16m children in the United States now live with hunger, according to the US Department of Agriculture, and that is not because the vast, agriculturally rich United States cannot produce enough to feed all of us. We are a country whose distribution system is itself a kind of violence.  Climate change is not suddenly bringing about an era of equitable distribution. I suspect people will be revolting in the coming future against what they revolted against in the past: the injustices of the system. They should revolt, and we should be glad they do, if not so glad that they need to. (Though one can hope they'll recognize that violence is not necessarily where their power lies.) One of the events prompting the French Revolution was the failure of the 1788 wheat crop, which made bread prices skyrocket and the poor go hungry. The insurance against such events is often thought to be more authoritarianism and more threats against the poor, but that's only an attempt to keep a lid on what's boiling over; the other way to go is to turn down the heat.  The same week during which I received that ill-thought-out press release about climate and violence, Exxon Mobil Corporation issued a policy report. It makes for boring reading, unless you can make the dry language of business into pictures of the consequences of those acts undertaken for profit. Exxon says: We are confident that none of our hydrocarbon reserves are now or will become 'stranded'. We believe producing these assets is essential to meeting growing energy demand worldwide. Stranded assets that mean carbon assets – coal, oil, gas still underground – would become worthless if we decided they could not be extracted and burned in the near future. Because scientists say that we need to leave most of the world's known carbon reserves in the ground if we are to go for the milder rather than the more extreme versions of climate change. Under the milder version, countless more people – species, places – will survive. In the best-case scenario, we damage the Earth less. We are currently wrangling about how much to devastate the Earth.  In every arena, we need to look at industrial-scale and systemic violence, not just the hands-on violence of the less powerful. When it comes to climate change, this is particularly true. Exxon has decided to bet that we can't make the corporation keep its reserves in the ground, and the company is reassuring its investors that it will continue to profit off the rapid, violent and intentional destruction of the Earth.  That's a tired phrase, the destruction of the Earth, but translate it into the face of a starving child and a barren field – and then multiply that a few million times. Or just picture the tiny bivalves: scallops, oysters, Arctic sea snails that can't form shells in acidifying oceans right now. Or another superstorm tearing apart another city. Climate change is global-scale violence, against places and species as well as against human beings. Once we call it by name, we can start having a real conversation about our priorities and values. Because the revolt against brutality begins with a revolt against the language that hides that brutality."
"Me: [knock, knock] Hello. Senator George Brandis, Australian Attorney-General: Who is it [from behind the door]. This had better be important. I'm on the last chapter of ""Still Not Sorry"" by Voltaire.  Me: It's important. I wouldn't have come all this way to your alternative universe for nothing. GB: [opens door]. Well come in, come in. Take the weight off your… arghhh! What's that in your hand? Me: A mobile phone. But never mind that. I can't join you in there, but I do need to talk to you. I've come about that interview you gave the other day. The one where you said climate change deniers were being... what was it… ""excluded from the debate""? GB: Yes. Rather good I thought, especially that bit where I called some of those climate believers ""medieval"". What about it? Me: Well, I think that you might have got your two universes a bit transposed. That restaurant where you gave that interview… it's actually in the real world. GB: It's WHAT? I'm always so careful with my universes. What makes you think I mucked up? Me: There were a few clues. There was that bit when you were banging on about how climate change was something people ""mock at your peril"" and how deniers were excluded from the argument. Well, you know about News Corporation, right? They've got something like 70 per cent of the newspaper readership. I mean, practically all their main writers are.... GB: Never heard of them. Me: That's because you're standing in there in your alternative universe and I'm out here. There are contrarians everywhere at News Corp. Andrew Bolt, Miranda Devine, Terry McCrann, Tim Blair. And the deniers are all over commercial radio too. And let's not get started on the blogs. GB: Well I have heard that radio show with Alan Jones. He's in and out of here all the time. Reckons all that climate change stuff is witchcraft. Me: Right. OK. And then there was that bit where you said that ""one side"" wouldn't engage with climate deniers intelligently and how science is about being sceptical. GB: Yes... all perfectly correct. Me: No, no, no. Correct where you're standing right now maybe, but not out here. I mean yes, science is about being sceptical… that's obvious. But there are almost no proper scientists left who reckon we don't cause climate change. The scientists have been sceptical about climate change. They've studied all that stuff about there being a new ice age coming or that it's just all natural. They've looked at it all, they've been researching all that for decades. GB: Hang on, hang on. What do you mean proper scientists? I know a proper scientist when I meet one, thank you. They're always writing columns in The Australian about how climate change is all overblown rubbish. That's what proper scientists do, write op-eds and work for think tanks. They devote their lives to trying to understand the complexities of getting stuff in The Australian and avoiding peer review. I'm not saying they're right, of course. Me: Really, this idea that climate change deniers are some sort of poor repressed group just doesn't stand up out here. They're not so much repressed as bloody everywhere. Oh, except in science journals. They're not really there. GB: Ah.. that's because they're repressed. Me: Then there's your boss. You have met Tony Abbott's top business advisor, right? Maurice Newman? You know, the guy who reckons climate change is a ""scientific delusion""… hang on, who is that behind your modest-sized bookcase? GB: Maurice, come out from there. Me: Is Tony's renewables policy adviser there too? [movement behind bookcase] Dick, I can see you there you know. GB: Hey, you know you really shouldn't keep using that word denier. You're just doing that so that people associate me with homeopathy denial. Me: Listen, Senator. I just… I just can't talk to you while you're still in there. But before I go, you were right about one thing in that interview. GB: Oh yeh, what was that? Me: When you said that sometimes people who question the science are in danger of being mocked. That does happen. I mean, it's happening right now. Here, where I'm standing. I'm mocking you, but I promise to stop if you come out. GB: Bigot."
"Clive Palmer is threatening to block both the carbon and mining tax repeals if the Abbott government “plays games” by including its Direct Action climate change fund in budget appropriation bills to avoid its defeat in the Senate. And the mining magnate-politician challenged Tony Abbott to hold a double dissolution election if he didn’t like the stance the Palmer United party was taking on key issues, claiming such a poll would only enhance his party’s position.  On Monday Palmer hardened his already unenthusiastic position on the government’s $1.5bn “emissions reduction fund” – the centrepiece of Direct Action – saying it was “dead”, “finished” and “over” because Palmer United party senators believed the money would be better spent on pensions. The environment minister, Greg Hunt, responded by repeating a tactic the government foreshadowed last year – that the money for the emissions reduction fund could be included in the budget appropriations bills which cannot be amended in the Senate. ""The funds will be part of the budget papers and I doubt the budget will be blocked, unless we're going to be forced into a constitutional issue,"" Hunt told the ABC. Palmer responded by saying that “if the government wants to try to play smart … then two can play at that game”. “You tell them that if they do that [include the emissions reduction fund in the budget] we will immediately reconsider our position on the carbon and mining tax repeals,” Palmer told Guardian Australia. “If they play games like that they need to be politically punished … and reconsidering our support for the carbon and mining tax repeal would be one thing we would definitely consider.” Palmer said if Abbott “didn’t like that answer he could always have a double dissolution election … but of course then he would be going to the people on the basis of what he really wants to do to them, which will be revealed in the budget, and in a double dissolution election we would only need a quota of 7% rather than 14% so I think we would double our number of senators. “But if Tony Abbott wants a double dissolution election he can have one, we’re fine with that.” Speaking to reporters in Brisbane later in the day, Palmer claimed Direct Action was “a slush fund designed to give money to Liberal party consultants and lobbyists who want to do their bidding”. “Direct Action has been made up so the Liberal party can confuse people in the green sector and make out they are doing something when they are doing nothing,” he said. He repeated his threat to “reconsider” support for the mining and carbon taxes unless Direct Action was presented as a separate bill that could be voted down by the Senate, rather than as part of budget appropriation bills. He said he was seeking to “protect” older Australians who Tony Abbott had promised would suffer no change to their pension rights. “If he wants to do that to elderly citizens I will do whatever I can to protect our elderly citizens ... he knows he is lying to the Australian people,” Palmer said. When it became clear last year that the Senate crossbench could vote against Direct Action, Hunt insisted there were “other options” open to the government, including linking the emissions reduction fund to a budget appropriations bill. But climate policy advocates say implementing only the emissions reduction fund and not the broader compliance proposal under Direct Action, which would impose “baselines” on greenhouse emissions, would leave the policy even less effective than they now assess it to be. “There is a real threat to any target if there is no compliance mechanism controlling the significant blowout in emissions … it would leave this as a policy destined for ruin,” said John Connor, the chief executive of the Climate Institute.  The emissions reduction fund has also been rejected by the Family First senator-elect, Bob Day, as “a waste of money”. And the spending has been questioned by the Liberal Democratic party senator-elect, David Leyonhjelm, who says ""even if [the science of global warming] is eventually confirmed government spending in Australia will not make the slightest bit of difference"" and the DLP senator, John Madigan, who has said he wonders “whether [the government] is just trying to look like they are trying to do something about global warming which they don’t really believe in”. But the independent senator Nick Xenophon wants changes to toughen Direct Action to ensure it is effective, with measures such as stringent emissions baselines for big emitters, which some industry groups are resisting. Tony Abbott has threatened a double dissolution election if the new Senate blocks key elements of his election agenda. “If Labor doesn’t see the light in the next few months there is a new Senate coming in July and I am confident they will accept the government’s mandate and if not there are constitutional options open to us,” the prime minister said in an interview with the ABC last year to mark the government’s first 100 days in office. Earlier on Tuesday Palmer said he would also be willing to vote against appropriation bills containing funding for the emissions reduction fund.“We’ll be voting against Direct Action, whatever form it’s in,’’ he told the ABC. Labor confirmed it was disinclined to support Direct Action, even if the carbon pricing scheme is repealed. ""Australia can’t afford to do nothing on pollution – but that’s exactly what Tony Abbott is doing,"" said the party's environment spokesman, Mark Butler. ""Tony Abbott is a prime minister who doesn’t believe climate change is real. Labor remains opposed to Direct Action, which doesn’t have a cap on pollution, and pays taxpayer dollars to the big polluters with no likelihood of any substantial reductions in carbon pollution."""
"Recently, the US State Department released yet another report on the environmental impacts of building the Keystone pipeline. The report is shocking in its ironic juxtaposition of real greenhouse gas emissions and the potential impact on the Earth's climate. It is also shocking because the State Department tells us the pipeline will be made to withstand climate change, but won't be responsible for those changes. The report reflects an incompetence of the authors of the report and a divorce of the report from common sense. It isn't just me who feels this way, other groups concur the State Department report is faulty. First, the report does identify the equivalent greenhouse gas emissions which would travel through the pipeline. With an estimated 830,000 barrels per day, my calculations (reinforced by multiple published and white-paper studies) are that the associated emissions would be approximately 480 million kg CO2 per day. If you include the byproduct petcoke, which is being burned as a coal replacement (but is dirtier than coal), the numbers are even worse (520 million kg CO2 per day). There is some uncertainty because we are not certain what the actual transported product will be, how many barrels of bitumen, what the diluent is made from, what the mix of extraction methods are, etc. All of this is equivalent to approximately 35-40 million passenger vehicles or 50-57 coal-powered plants. During a time we need to reduce emissions, exploitation of the tar sands and construction of the Keystone pipeline would do the reverse. We would be locked in for years of enormous greenhouse emissions. People who think Keystone is a minor issue don't understand science and they sure don't understand economics. The tar sands contain reserves equivalent to seven times Saudi Arabia. Full exploitation of that tar will raise world temperatures by 0.75°F.  So, how does the report overlook these numbers (which they essentially agree with)? They say, ""Stop! We don't want you to focus on the greenhouse gas emissions from oil through Keystone"" (or from the tar sands for that matter). They want you to imagine a world where the oil would be burned anyways. If not piped through Keystone, it would come from some other source. If not from Canadian tar sands, someone else would supply the petroleum. This argument makes no sense. It is a little like a crystal meth dealer saying to the police, ""I shouldn't be charged for the damage my drug caused because the users would have found meth, or cocaine, or heroin somewhere else."" Such an argument is illogical. We need to measure the emissions from Keystone and the tar sands directly. We should compare the impacts of pumping the world's dirtiest oil to making wiser use of the energy we already extract. For instance, if we increased passenger vehicle efficiency in the US by about 12%, we would save all the oil to be pumped through the Keystone pipeline, our planet would be cleaner, and the average US driver would be $250 richer each year. Who is against a thicker wallet and a cleaner planet? The exploitation of the tar sands requires approval of Keystone. The Canadian government continues to tell us the oil will get to market anyway. If that is true then why do they need the pipeline? Why can't they build their own pipeline? Are there no competent engineers in Canada? If Keystone is denied, it will significantly change the economics of tar sand exploitation; it will send a strong message to the marketplace that tar sands are not the future fuel we need. The principle reason for Keystone is to open tar sands to world markets that will pay higher prices for the tar. The main impact of pipelines like Keystone is to make petroleum companies in Canada richer. An interesting side impact will be that it will actually raise gas prices in the US. So, if you want to pay more for oil, if you want to build a pipeline that benefits foreign companies and provides little value to the US, go ahead approve the pipeline.  It has to be mentioned that two Secretaries of State and one President will have Keystone as their environmental legacy. You cannot be concerned about climate change and at the same time approve Keystone. An approval will mean that Hillary Clinton, John Kerry, and President Obama are more about words than action. Right now, history is set to judge the conservative parties in the US very harshly for climate change. Time and time again, they have stood in the way of stewardship. They have denied science, attacked scientists, wasted precious resources, and enacted policies which hinder the advancement of clean and renewable energy. Right now, they own climate change. They own Superstorm Sandy, they own the droughts of 2011, 2012, and 2014, and they own the increase in insured extreme weather costs.  Approval of Keystone by Clinton, Kerry and Obama will make the ownership dual. No one will look back and remember regulations on coal plants or agreements on HCFCs. They will remember the cowardice on Keystone. They will remember a decision which should have been an easy one made by people who knew the problem. Those memories will haunt the Democrats not only in the future but immediately, in the next election cycle. On the other hand, if the Clinton/Kerry/Obama decision is the right one, they will find a groundswell of support from the populace including voters and donors who fight continuously for environmentally conscious legislators. Let's hope that the current decision makers have the courage to do what is right. Let's hope they listen to the scientists who have been pleading for decades to take action. This is the time, this is the issue, and this is their legacy."
"The renewable energy industry has labelled a controversial Abbott government review an “unprecedented scam” and a “stitch-up” after learning that it was conducting electricity industry modelling on the assumption there would be no risk or cost to investments in coal-fired power stations in the next few decades. The review of the renewable energy target – headed by veteran businessman and self-professed climate sceptic Dick Warburton – and its modellers from ACIL Allen consulting held a workshop with industry participants on Wednesday at which they revealed the modelling would assume investors in fossil fuel generation would not need to factor in any risk due to climate policies for decades – neither a carbon price, nor a requirement to invest in emission-reducing technologies, nor any cost from any other government policy or regulation.  Many of the 50 participants said this assumption was entirely unrealistic.  John Grimes, chief executive of the Australian Solar Council, said it made the whole review a farce. “This is an absolute stitch-up. They are predetermining the outcome of this modelling by the assumptions they are making … it is an unprecedented scam in policy-making and it needs to be called for what it is,” Grimes told Guardian Australia. “It is clear that the RET review report will protect the vested interests in the current electricity market.”  Grimes said that any model that ignored international action on climate change and failed to consider a carbon price up to 2030 “lacks any credibility”. Ric Brazzale, managing director of Green Energy Trading, said it was “ridiculous to assume you can increase greenhouse emissions for decades with no kind of cost or risk at all”. “They are not going to come up with a fair outcome if they assume there is no carbon price and no kind of carbon constraint at all,” Brazzale said. It is understood the workshop was also told the review had not considered the government’s election promise to provide subsidies to put solar panels on another one million roofs because there was as yet no policy detail behind it. Dick Warburton, a veteran industrialist and current chairman of the Westfield Retail Trust, described his views on climate science in a 2011 interview on ABC. “Well I am a sceptic. I’ve never moved away from that. I’ve always believed sceptical,’’ he said. “But a sceptic is a different person than a denier. I say the science is not settled. I’m not saying it’s wrong. I’ve never said it’s wrong, but I don’t believe it’s settled.” He is joined on the review panel by the former executive director of the Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics, Brian Fisher, director of Asciano Limited and the CSIRO, Shirley In't Veld and the managing director of the Australian Energy Market Operator, Matt Zema. The review is charged with looking at “the economic, environmental and social impacts of the RET scheme, in particular the impacts on electricity prices, energy markets, the renewable energy sector, the manufacturing sector and Australian households” and with assessing how it fits with the government’s aim of “reducing business costs”. It has asked for submissions on whether the RET should be “abolished, reduced or increased”. The target – introduced by the Howard government and expanded by the Rudd government – now requires that 41,000 gigawatt hours of energy be sourced from renewables by 2020. At the time it was enacted that represented 20% of the market, but due to falling electricity demand, it will now be well over 20% – which has prompted calls for the target date to be pushed out or the target reduced, including a plan privately floated by the environment minister, Greg Hunt, for it to become a 25% by 2025 target. But others, including the government’s top business adviser, Maurice Newman, want the RET scrapped altogether. Newman, the former chairman of the ABC and the ASX, has said persisting with government subsidies for renewable energy represented a “crime against the people” because higher energy costs hit poorer households the hardest and there was no longer any logical reason to have them. In setting up its own RET review, the government bypassed the Climate Change Authority – which it wants to abolish – but which is required by legislation to undertake regular reviews of the RET. "
"Environmental groups are preparing to launch a series of court cases to frustrate the Abbott government’s agenda, targeting its plans to ditch the carbon tax and devolve approvals for new coal mines to the states. In a significant hardening of its approach to a government it views as instinctively anti-environment, the conservation movement has signalled it will move away from lobbying in favour of legal confrontation.  The Environment Defenders Office, a legal network which had its public funding removed by the Coalition in December, has reported a surge in private donations, which it will use to take on the government over climate change, environmental regulation and community health issues. The Victorian office of the network is to rebrand as Environmental Justice Australia, using a crowdfunding model in place of government support. Meanwhile, Earth Justice, a long-established litigation group from the US, visited Australia last week to advise the Wilderness Society on legal tactics. It is understood partnerships with environmental groups in the US and UK will be forged to help facilitate challenges to the Coalition’s agenda. “Talking niceties has got us nowhere with this government,” said Brendan Sydes, chief executive of the new Environmental Justice Australia office. “Business as usual isn’t satisfactory, so we’ve got to look outside the box, including legal action and divestment campaigns against fossil fuels. “We will be looking at legal avenues to challenging the dismantling of the clean energy package without having any credible alternative. We’ll also be looking carefully at the one-stop environmental shops. The government is going completely in the wrong direction.” Environmental groups have voiced dismay at the government’s approach, including the attempted repeal of the carbon price in favour of its “direct action” policy, the bid to delist parts of Tasmania’s forest from World Heritage protection and the handover of development approvals to state governments. The shark cull in Western Australia, approved without an assessment by Greg Hunt, the environment minister, and Tony Abbott’s comments last month that there are too many trees “locked up” in national parks have also caused widespread green chagrin. Lyndon Schneiders, national director of the Wilderness Society, said the group was looking to challenge a raft of coal and gas projects it sees as being “disastrous for the global climate” if they go ahead. “For the government to wash its hands of these responsibilities and hand over power to blatantly pro-development state governments is set to have significant legal implications,” he said. “We’re getting advice on that now. “We need to use the courts to pull the political leaders into line when they overstep the boundaries. The government seems to think they have a mandate to strip away 30 years of hard-fought environmental protections. We still want to engage with them, but I think Abbott’s [forestry] speech made their philosophy crystal clear.” Kelly O'Shanassy, the new chief executive of the Australian Conservation Foundation, said the group would be targeting voters in marginal electorates to encourage MPs to take climate change seriously. “We will be doing more work out in the communities, in electorates in places such as western Sydney, to say ‘here is how climate change impacts you’,” she said. “We need to focus on areas where politicians work the hardest for votes. “We won’t ever tell people which party to vote for, but at the moment it’s a race to the bottom for environmental policy and we want to create a race to the top. We want parties to have to take climate change seriously in order to get elected.” O’Shanassy said she wanted to double the ACF’s current membership base to 400,000 people by recruiting activists to hold community meetings and door knocking rounds in key marginals. “We’ll be asking more people to do more things to make climate change a critical issue,” she said. “Commentary by the prime minister saying that we have too many trees really disturbs me. Nature provides products and services we need, but once we get into an exploitative relationship with nature she will kick our butt.”"
"Here’s the latest in Australia’s sorry climate policy saga – the government is considering shrinking its Band-Aid climate change policy down to half a Band-Aid and Clive Palmer is threatening to rip even that away. Direct Action was conceived by the environment minister, Greg Hunt, over the summer of 2009 to give the Coalition some kind of policy to reduce greenhouse emissions after the internal Coalition conflagration that cost Malcolm Turnbull his leadership and installed Tony Abbott, who vowed to get rid of the “great big tax on everything”.  His policy hasn’t changed since 2010 – proposing to use competitive government grants to meet a 5% emissions reduction target by 2020. It is silent about what happens after that and many have questioned whether it will even get that far. Hunt has – since the election – fleshed out some of its detail and will imminently provide more detail with a white paper to inform legislation he will soon present to the parliament. But, as has been clear since very shortly after last year’s election, the crossbench in the Senate is disinclined to support any emissions reductions at all, as many crossbenchers are unsure about the whole anthropogenic global warming thing and others – such as the DLP senator John Madigan – being unsure whether the government is honestly concerned about the anthropogenic global warming thing or just wanting to look like it’s doing something. (Independent Nick Xenophon wants to talk to the government about how to make Direct Action more effective.) Faced with the uncomfortable possibility of succeeding in repealing the carbon tax and then failing to legislate Direct Action and therefore being left with no climate change policy at all, Hunt signalled last year he could include at least the emissions reduction fund in budget bills and may not need separate legislation to get it going. On Tuesday he repeated this in the face of the Palmer United party’s hardened stance against Direct Action. Even if the Hunt tactic succeeds, it would mean that a policy many doubt will be effective may no longer contain the elements essential for its success. These include baselines and compliance mechanisms – in essence the already-weak safeguards that try to make sure that other parts of the economy don’t increase emissions faster than the emissions reduction fund can provide grants to pay for emission reductions. The latest greenhouse inventory data, released without fanfare last Tuesday, shows Australian emissions fell 0.8% in the year to December 2013 – with emissions from electricity generation falling by 5% and “fugitive” emissions from coal mining increasing by 6.7%. Hunt likes to nominate coal mine emissions as a potential source of abatement that could be funded by Direct Action, but during the long, long debate about the carbon tax we were repeatedly told that for “gassy” coal mines the cost of dealing with those emissions – if they could be reduced at all – was $25 per tonne of CO2 or more, much more than the emissions reduction fund is likely to be able to pay. If the emissions reduction fund is set up – somehow – but the other elements of Direct Action are not, including the baselines and penalties for industries dramatically increasing their emissions, then the likelihood of Direct Action reaching even a 5% target, or providing further reductions after 2020, falls from unlikely to “forget about it”. But now Palmer is saying he intends to make sure the emissions reduction fund is not set up at all because he has suddenly decided the money should be spent on pensioners. At first he said he would the block budget bills containing the Direct Action money, but then he appeared to realise Labor and the Greens wouldn’t, so he threatened to block the carbon tax and mining tax repeals.I have no idea whether the PUP would make good these threats. It seems unlikely given Palmer has campaigned on his support for the repeals, but then the idea that the mining magnate would actually hold such a large portion of the Senate balance of power once seemed pretty unlikely, too. In any event, the options on the table appear to be no climate policy at all, or a climate policy that constitutes only the emissions reduction fund but not the other elements of Direct Action which could give it a chance of being in any way effective. Half a Band-Aid, or no Band-Aid at all."

"In February the UK was hit by some of the worst storms in recent memory. Flood maps showed that huge areas of the Somerset Levels and the Thames valley were underwater, and whole communities were cut off for days at a time. But it wasn't just our flood defences that were lacking – one of the toughest challenges during the floods was providing people in affected areas with up-to-date information. ""I've been studying the graphs on the Environment Agency website trying to work out what they mean,"" Jeremy Langford told the Guardian in February as he tried to make up his mind whether to evacuate his home in the village of Moorland in favour of higher ground. ""I'm sure somebody knows what the water is doing but if they do they aren't getting the message over to us."" The Environment Agency finally caved in to mounting pressure to release some of its flood data for free, and the UK's tech community cobbled together flood relief apps over a long weekend in mid February at Flood Hack, an impromptu hackathon hosted by Google's collaborative workspace in East London. ""The Flood Hack release of data has given us some hints of what can be done with open flood data,"" said data consultant Owen Boswarva, who sits on Defra's transparency board. ""However what I see in them is how much they could be improved by the release of more relevant flood data sets."" The Environment Agency is facing a rising tide of pressure to open more of its flood data. The data sets it released in February included real-time river level data that updates every fifteen minutes. But the open licence on these data sets expires on 15 May, just three months after they were first issued, and they are just a fraction of the flood data that the Environment Agency holds. ""Complex problems demand massive amounts of data to solve,"" said Conor Riffle, director of data product innovation at the Carbon Disclosure project, which has released climate change data on the world's 100 biggest cities. ""We need to improve the free flow of climate change data so we can start to get a handle on protecting people and property from the coming impacts of a changing climate."" These impacts include more extreme weather like the storms that caused the UK floods. Open data campaigners are hoping for an announcement from the Environment Agency in the coming weeks about opening its core flood data. But waiting for governments to open their data troves is not the only way to get your hands on it. In Philadelphia, in the US state of Pennsylvania, a group of 'civic hackers' going under the name Code for Philly have decided to take the collection of climate data into their own hands. Code for Philly plan to collect local air pollution and temperature data using sensors attached to city buses so that they can quantify the effect of planting new trees in the city, as part of their Open Climate Tracker project. Trees have a cooling effect in cities due to water evaporating from their leaves, as well as providing shade to streets and roofs which absorb heat, but this can be hard to measure accurately. Crucially, Code for Philly plan to release all the Open Climate Tracker data online so that people can develop useful applications with it. By connecting GPS location data with temperature and particle sensors they plan to build an interactive climate map of the city that can provide real-time updates. ""You could have an app that tells you when to bring your kids inside if there's a high level of particulates in the air,"" said Joshua Meyer, lead developer on the project. ""Or if you go for a run in the city, avoid this area because there's high pollution right now."" In a few weeks they will launch a Kickstarter campaign to fund prototypes that will be strapped to bicycles to test the sensors. They plan to use the information they collect in combination with Open Tree Maps, a project that maps the location of trees in the city, to work out what effect a tree has on its surroundings. ""We can actually show how the micro-climate changes over time,"" said Meyer. ""If you say to someone your street gets warmer by this much every year, you can't refute that, it becomes personal."" Meyer says that by showing people that planting trees can save them money on their air conditioning bill, Open Climate Tracker can help people make better decisions, as well as sway people who doubt that climate change is even happening. This is more difficult than it should be, given the data already available: in the UK, David Cameron had to backtrack after he said he suspected there was a link between the floods and climate change, despite the Met Office's lead scientist, Julia Slingo stating that ""all the evidence suggests there is a link to climate change."" And in the US, 41% of Tea Party Republicans think global warming is 'just not happening'. ""Often government departments have difficulty recognising the untapped potential in reuse of the data they produce,"" said Boswarva. But maybe the tides are changing. In March the White House launched its Climate Data Initiative, which aims to make climate data more accessible through a government website, climate.data.gov. Meyer believes open climate data is the key to making climate change clear, and showing people how it affects them: with the right information, people can make better decisions in respect to the environment, as well as form strategies to protect themselves against changing weather conditions in a warming world.

"Not many people go to Kong Karls Land, and even fewer return from these Arctic islands way north of Norway because it is a world of polar bears and is strictly off limits to all but the most intrepid or foolhardy. So when photographer Doug Allan got permission to film sequences there for David Attenborough's Planet Earth series, he did not expect an easy assignment – it is usually -32C in April, the wind is vicious and hauling cameras in the deep snow is a nightmare. After walking five or more hours a day and watching polar bear dens in the snow slopes for 23 days, however, Allan had seen just one mother bear and her cub. By day 24, he says, he was living ""in bear world, at bear speed, with bear senses"".  ""We find a new hole and wait. We shuffle, hop, bend, stretch and run to stay warm. Five hours of watching and then with no warning at all I catch a glimpse so brief that I almost miss it. But the camera's locked on the hole on full zoom and my eye's very quickly on the viewfinder. ""Nothing for a couple of seconds and then an unmistakable black nose. Nose become muzzle, grows bigger to become full head and in less than a minute she has her front legs out and is resting on the snow in front of the hole. She's looking at me but she's not bothered. I've just pulled out of a close-up thinking this can't get much better … when she sets off on a long slide down the slope. I'd swear it's partly in sheer pleasure,"" he recounts, adding that two cubs then appeared at the den entrance. ""Clearly it's their first view of the world … It's showtime on the slopes and we have front-row seats."" Capturing extraordinary shots of baby polar bears blinking in the first light of their first day, filming humpback whales catching krill by blowing bubbles, or descending deep below icebergs are all Allan's speciality. If you want penguins in winter in a blizzard, snow leopards in Ladakh, India, someone to venture into ice caves with or just hang out on an iceflow at 85N for several months, TV wildlife producers turn to Allan. If you've ever been amazed by footage of polar bears, it's probably been filmed by him. His perfect temperature, he says, is -18C. ""I just became the cold man. You had coral people, elephant people, chimp people. I was the cold man. Discomfort is part of the business,"" he said last week in London on return from a harrowing four-day crossing of the Ross Sea. Allan, from Dunfermline in Scotland, trained as a marine biologist and commercial diver, and has been to both poles and spent five winters and eight summers in Antarctica with the British Antarctic Survey as a diving officer and base commander. Diving was his first passion, where he learned about survival in cold places. His big break came when a BBC crew with Attenborough turned up at in Antarctica in 1981. ""He stepped off the chopper and they all wanted a picture of themselves with him. I ended taking the crew to different places, and went out with a cameraman. After 48 hours I realised [being a wildlife cameraman] ticked all the boxes: travel, adventure, underwater."" Since then he has been a top cameraman on many of the Attenborough series including Blue planet, Life in the Freezer and Planet Earth, as well as the BBC series Human Planet. ""I came along at a good time. When I started, hardly anyone had been to the Antarctic. It was like all these plum sequences were just waiting to be plucked. I just like to get on an animal's wavelength."" The camera and communications technology was rudimentary when he started 35 years ago. ""It is certainly easier to film today. I made two whole films without seeing a single frame. It was unusual to get any feedback on your content. Very rarely did you have chance to see [film]. The old guys, who learned on film, are different. If you shot something then, you had to remember it. Today you can shoot a lot and look at it immediately. You used to have to think what shots you needed next, and what you had missed. You shot less. Film was very expensive. It cost around £150 a minute. Today you can have too much material."" Satellite phones did not exist and Allan would be allowed just a few messages home each month on a telex machine. ""Today nowhere is that difficult to get to or impossible to call from. Nowhere now is more than three flights away."" ""My value is field experience in cold conditions. I have a feel for it. I have spent so much time on sea ice it now feels like crossing the street. I do get cold toes but the poles are healthy places. There are no leeches, no diseases or mosquitoes. My place is out in wild with big animals or underwater. You have to get cold and you can't hide there,"" he says. Wildlife filming has evolved but Allan has not followed all the trends. He does not ""do"" wildlife filming on specially constructed sets – the only way that most small wild animals can be filmed. ""Wee things are not my scene. It's much easier to focus on an elephant rather than a pygmy shrew. There's massive skill in set filming. Below the size of a rabbit you have to think about controlling your subject. In a series such as Hidden Kingdom, just about every shot was in a set. It requires a high level of skill, but it's not one that I have."" Working with Attenborough so often, he says, has been a privilege and a pleasure. Allan cannot hide his admiration for his lifetime's work. The respect is clearly mutual. In the foreword to Allan's book, Attenborough writes: ""He is not as other men. He cheerfully endures conditions more uncomfortable and for longer periods than anyone I know. He has an uncanny understanding of animals. That tells him what the animal is about to do before he does it. He is a wonderful companion."" Wildlife filming, he says, is full of great successes, but also failures and embarrassments. When he was starting out, he was in the Orkneys to film kittiwakes. Unfortunately he could not identify which birds they were. ""In Blue Planet, I would think 20% of the shots failed."" He is quick to praise his colleagues. ""I was trying to film snow leopards in Ladakh. I looked for weeks. I had one in front of me for an hour. But he was asleep for 50 minutes. Cameraman Mark Smith was in Pakistan at the same time. He got all the good stuff. "" Once, he says, he was attacked by a massive walrus. ""It was totally scary. I was snorkelling and something grabbed my waist. I hit it on the head with my camera. They crush people with their flippers and squeeze the hell out of you or they put their lips on seals' heads and suck out their brains."" Now he would like to make his own film about climate change in the Arctic, talking to the Inuit people who live there and experience it first hand. Because he is trusted by them, he says he would be able to make an extraordinary documentary. To work with people in the Arctic, he says, needs a different kind of patience. ""Patience is sitting waiting and watching for days in the blowing snow. Wildlife filming, on the other hand, is sitting, waiting and watching for days in the blowing snow but at least you are being paid for it."" • Doug Allan is on a lecture tour in April and May around Britain; he is the author of Freeze Frame, a Wildlife Cameraman's Adventures on Ice"
"David Cameron's commitment to the green agenda will come under the fiercest scrutiny yet this week when top climate-change experts will warn that only greater use of renewable energy – including windfarms – can prevent a global catastrophe. A report by the world's leading authorities will expose a growing gulf between a Tory party intent on halting construction of more onshore windfarms and the world's leading scientists, who see them as one of the cheapest ways to provide energy while at the same time saving the environment.  Mitigation of Climate Change, by the UN's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), a panel of 200 scientists, will make it clear that by far the most realistic option for the future is to triple or even quadruple the use of renewable power plants. Only through such decisive action will carbon dioxide levels in the atmosphere be kept below the critical level of 480 parts per million (ppm), before the middle of the century. If levels go beyond this figure, the chances of curtailing global mayhem are poor, they will say. The report – the third in a series by the IPCC designed to highlight the climate crisis now facing the planet – is intended as an urgent wake-up call to nations to commit around 1-2% of GDP in order to replace power plants that burn fossil fuels, the major cause of global warming, with renewable sources. Its conclusions represent a huge challenge for Cameron and the Conservative party – which is now laying plans to block the construction of new onshore windfarms in Britain, the country's only realistic, reasonably priced renewable energy option other than solar power, which has limited potential in the UK. Having promised to lead ""the greenest government ever"", Cameron now stands accused by the green lobby of watering down his commitments in response to the threat of Ukip, which campaigns heavily against windfarms. The prime minister's green credentials have also been called into question by the appointment in 2012 of Owen Paterson, a climate-change sceptic, as environment secretary. Paterson said in September 2013: ""People get very emotional about this subject and I think we should just accept that the climate has been changing for centuries."" An Opinium/Observer poll – which today puts Ukip on 18% support – also finds that just 15% of voters think Cameron has lived up to his promises on the environment, against 46% who think he has not. In addition, only 20% disagreed with the suggestion that the government was giving priority to short-term economic growth over the sustainable use of the environment. Last week local government secretary Eric Pickles announced he had taken personal control over all future decisions about new onshore windfarms, while Grant Shapps, the Conservative party chairman, said wind turbines were no longer ""environmentally friendly"". Shapps also suggested that the Tories would pledge to curb them in their 2015 election manifesto and instead approve only offshore windfarms. However, the move would cripple the ability of the government to play a full part in curtailing carbon dioxide emissions, and experts warn it could lead to higher energy prices. Onshore wind power costs around £90 per megawatt hour to generate, but for offshore windfarms this rises to £150. Other renewable energy sources are either of limited use in Britain or are not yet fully developed, such as tidal power. Nuclear energy is one alternative, but is controversial, and a major construction programme would take decades to approve and construct. ""Renewable energy is backed by the public; wind power has the support of two thirds (66%) of Britons and the CBI has called on action to tackle climate change,"" said Christian Aid's senior climate change advisor, Mohamed Adow. ""The government should be doing all it can to put the UK at the forefront of this energy revolution not blowing hot and cold on the issue. Joss Garman, Greenpeace's deputy political director, said: ""These scientists have shown us that it's not too late and we can still avoid the worst impacts of climate change, but only if we get behind the clean energy solutions that can slash carbon pollution. Renewable energy technologies are already the least-cost option in a growing number of major markets, and they're getting cheaper all the time.Rather than turning back towards dirty fuels like coal and gas, now is the time for Ministers to double down on our transition towards a cleaner energy system. This report shows that the sooner we act, the cheaper it will be."" The new report has taken four years to compile. It is expected to say the UN target – to limit global warming to 2 degrees celsius (3.6 degrees fahrenheit) – is feasible only if surging carbon emissions are swiftly braked and then reversed. The first report forecast that global temperatures would rise by 0.3-4.8C this century, on top of roughly 0.7C since the industrial revolution. Seas are forecast to rise by 26-82cm by 2100. The second report, which was issued last month, dwelt on the likely impacts and warned that the risk of conflict, hunger, floods and mass displacement increased with every minuscule rise in temperature. The panel will issue a résumé of all three reports in Copenhagen in October, prior to the next major UN climate summit, which is scheduled to open in Paris in December 2015. The last IPCC assessment report, published in 2007, formed the core of the international debate on climate at the UN's Copenhagen Summit in 2009. The event degenerated into a political brawl and climate negotiations have been stuttering ever since. Climate experts say this failure to act cannot be allowed to continue. UN members must agree to a climate pact that will come into force in 2020. Any later and the costs of mitigating climate change will soar exponentially because there will then be so much carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. UK economist Sir Nicholas Stern said: ""All political leaders should recognise that a powerful case has been presented for accelerating action against climate change by building cleaner and more efficient economies.""Dr Stephan Singer, WWF director of global energy policy, added: ""Renewable energy can no longer be considered a niche market. Renewables must – and should – eventually take the full share of the global energy market within the next few decades."""
"The way to beat Vladimir Putin is to flood the European market with fracked-in-the-USA natural gas, or so the industry would have us believe. As part of escalating anti-Russian hysteria, two bills have been introduced into the US Congress – one in the House of Representatives (H.R. 6), one in the Senate (S. 2083) – that attempt to fast-track liquefied natural gas (LNG) exports, all in the name of helping Europe to wean itself from Putin's fossil fuels, and enhancing US national security. According to Cory Gardner, the Republican congressman who introduced the House bill, ""opposing this legislation is like hanging up on a 911 call from our friends and allies"". And that might be true – as long as your friends and allies work at Chevron and Shell, and the emergency is the need to keep profits up amid dwindling supplies of conventional oil and gas.  For this ploy to work, it's important not to look too closely at details. Like the fact that much of the gas probably won't make it to Europe – because what the bills allow is for gas to be sold on the world market to any country belonging to the World Trade Organisation. Or the fact that for years the industry has been selling the message that Americans must accept the risks to their land, water and air that come with hydraulic fracturing (fracking) in order to help their country achieve ""energy independence"". And now, suddenly and slyly, the goal has been switched to ""energy security"", which apparently means selling a temporary glut of fracked gas on the world market, thereby creating energy dependencies abroad. And most of all, it's important not to notice that building the infrastructure necessary to export gas on this scale would take many years in permitting and construction – a single LNG terminal can carry a $7bn price tag, must be fed by a massive, interlocking web of pipelines and compressor stations, and requires its own power plant just to generate energy sufficient to liquefy the gas through super-cooling. By the time these massive industrial projects are up and running, Germany and Russia may well be fast friends. But by then few will remember that the crisis in Crimea was the excuse seized upon by the gas industry to make its longstanding export dreams come true, regardless of the consequences to the communities getting fracked or to the planet getting cooked. I call this knack for exploiting crisis for private gain the shock doctrine, and it shows no signs of retreating. We all know how the shock doctrine works: during times of crisis, whether real or manufactured, our elites are able to ram through unpopular policies that are detrimental to the majority under cover of emergency. Sure there are objections – from climate scientists warning of the potent warming powers of methane, or local communities that don't want these high-risk export ports on their beloved coasts. But who has time for debate? It's an emergency! A 911 call ringing! Pass the laws first, think about them later. Plenty of industries are good at this ploy, but none is more adept at exploiting the rationality-arresting properties of crisis than the global gas sector. For the past four years the gas lobby has used the economic crisis in Europe to tell countries like Greece that the way out of debt and desperation is to open their beautiful and fragile seas to drilling. And it has employed similar arguments to rationalise fracking across North America and the United Kingdom. Now the crisis du jour is conflict in Ukraine, being used as a battering ram to knock down sensible restrictions on natural gas exports and push through a controversial free-trade deal with Europe. It's quite a deal: more corporate free-trade polluting economies and more heat-trapping gases polluting the atmosphere – all as a response to an energy crisis that is largely manufactured. Against this backdrop it's worth remembering – irony of ironies – that the crisis the natural gas industry has been most adept at exploiting is climate change itself. Never mind that the industry's singular solution to the climate crisis is to dramatically expand an extraction process in fracking that releases massive amounts of climate-destabilising methane into our atmosphere. Methane is one of the most potent greenhouse gases – 34 times more powerful at trapping heat than carbon dioxide, according to the latest estimates by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. And that is over a 100-year period, with methane's power dwindling over time. It's far more relevant, argues the Cornell University biochemist Robert Howarth, one of the world's leading experts on methane emissions, to look at the impact in the 15- to 20-year range, when methane has a global-warming potential that is a staggering 86-100 times greater than carbon dioxide. ""It is in this time frame that we risk locking ourselves into very rapid warming,"" he said on Wednesday. And remember: you don't build multibillion-dollar pieces of infrastructure unless you plan on using them for at least 40 years. So we are responding to the crisis of our warming planet by constructing a network of ultra-powerful atmospheric ovens. Are we mad? Not that we know how much methane is actually released by drilling and fracking and all their attendant infrastructure. Even while the natural gas industry touts its ""lower than coal!"" carbon dioxide emissions, it has never systematically measured its fugitive methane leaks, which waft from every stage of the gas extraction, processing, and distribution process – from the well casings and the condenser valves to the cracked pipelines under Harlem neighbourhoods. The gas industry itself, in 1981, came up with the clever pitch that natural gas was a ""bridge"" to a clean energy future. That was 33 years ago. Long bridge. And the far bank still nowhere in view. And in 1988 – the year that the climatologist James Hansen warned Congress, in historic testimony, about the urgent problem of global warming – the American Gas Association began to explicitly frame its product as a response to the ""greenhouse effect"". It wasted no time, in other words, selling itself as the solution to a global crisis that it had helped create. The industry's use of the crisis in Ukraine to expand its global market under the banner of ""energy security"" must be seen in the context of this uninterrupted record of crisis opportunism. Only this time many more of us know where true energy security lies. Thanks to the work of top researchers such as Mark Jacobson and his Stanford team, we know that the world can, by the year 2030, power itself entirely with renewables. And thanks to the latest, alarming reports from the IPCC, we know that doing so is now an existential imperative. This is the infrastructure we need to be rushing to build – not massive industrial projects that will lock us into further dependency on dangerous fossil fuels for decades into the future. Yes, these fuels are still needed during the transition, but more than enough conventionals are on hand to carry us through: extra-dirty extraction methods such as tar sands and fracking are simply not necessary. As Jacobson said in an interview just this week: ""We don't need unconventional fuels to produce the infrastructure to convert to entirely clean and renewable wind, water and solar power for all purposes. We can rely on the existing infrastructure plus the new infrastructure [of renewable generation] to provide the energy for producing the rest of the clean infrastructure that we'll need ... Conventional oil and gas is much more than enough."" Given this, it's up to Europeans to turn their desire for emancipation from Russian gas into a demand for an accelerated transition to renewables. Such a transition – to which European nations are committed under the Kyoto protocol – can easily be sabotaged if the world market is flooded with cheap fossil fuels fracked from the US bedrock. And indeed Americans Against Fracking, which is leading the charge against the fast-tracking of LNG exports, is working closely with its European counterparts to prevent this from happening. Responding to the threat of catastrophic warming is our most pressing energy imperative. And we simply can't afford to be distracted by the natural gas industry's latest crisis-fuelled marketing ploy."
"About five years back, I was crawling in Brisbane traffic behind one of the city's ubiquitous white utility vehicles on my way to an anonymous city centre office to sit my Australian citizenship test. Stuck to the back of this ute was a large anti-immigration sticker, peeling on one corner, declaring ""Fuck off, we're full,"" to all literate observers.  This, from a citizen of a nation first forcibly grabbed and then reshaped by immigrants, struck me as a statement that was as lacking in compassion for and consideration as it was loaded with sheer existential dumbness.  At the time I was still getting my head around the idea of what was and wasn't meant by ""un-Australian"" - a rubbery cultural touchstone which seemed to mean anything an incumbent government wanted it to mean. I'm still not sure what ""un-Australian"" really means, but I reckon much of it is wrapped up in ideas of what's fair and what's not. Who deserves compassion and help, and who doesn't? Now before you double-check, you haven't stumbled onto an Aussie culture blog in a place where you might have been expecting me rambling on about the latest United Nations climate change report. As 25 years worth of reports from the UN's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change reports have warned, the people to suffer earliest and hardest from the likely impacts of human-caused climate change are the poorer people on the planet. For the most part, not really giving a toss about the impact on less developed countries of our government-endorsed fossil-fueled lifestyles is at the heart of the climate debate. It's a similarly compassionate-free zone inhabited by our xenophobic ute driver. In Australia, current and previous governments at state and federal levels (and of both political persuasions) have pushed for further rapid exploitation and export of fossil fuels. We are both a massive exporter of fossil fuels and one of the biggest emitters, per capita, of greenhouse gases on the planet. But this position as a global fossil fuel dealer is coming under ever sharper ethical and moral questioning. Archbishop Desmond Tutu has called for ""people of conscience"" to ""break their ties with corporations financing the injustice of climate change."" Mr Tutu suggested a boycott of ""events, sports teams and media programming"" that were sponsored by fossil fuel energy companies. ""We can demand that the advertisements of energy companies carry health warnings,"" he added. So what kind of companies or organisations should carry one of Mr Tutu's climate health warnings? A court judgement in the coal-friendly state of Queensland last week will leave many scratching their heads about who might be responsible for pushing the world's emissions of greenhouse gases ever higher. If you thought those liable might be coal mining companies, then the Queensland Land Court has some news. The court passed judgement on a challenge to the giant Alpha coal mine project which would dig up about 30 million tonnes of coal a year from the state's Galilee Basin. Indian energy conglomerate GVK paid Gina Rinehart-owned Hancock Coal US$1.26 billion for a controlling stake in the project, which includes a 79 per cent stake in the mine. The court's non-binding decision was that the state government should only approve the mine if further environmental restrictions were made on the project related to the risk of major impacts on underground water resources. So-called ""make good"" arrangements would also have to be made with the impacted landholders. But the objectors to the mine had also challenged the project on the grounds that it would have an unacceptable impact on the world's climate. Once the coal had been mined, processed, transported and burned, the court heard (and all parties accepted) that this would result in about 1.8 billion tonnes of carbon dioxide being emitted into the atmosphere over the 30 year life of the mine. That's roughly three years worth of the greenhouse gas emissions of the United Kingdom or more than three years worth of emissions from Australia. The bulk of the emissions would come from burning the coal abroad. While the coal company accepted the emissions would be generated, they employed what some lawyers call the ""drug dealers defence"". They argued that if they didn't mine the coal, somebody else would. Stopping the mine, they argued, would not affect the amount of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. The court's presiding member Paul Smith agreed, writing in his judgement: I can sympathise with the position of the objectors who see [greenhouse gas] emissions rising, and the likely adverse climate change consequences that will flow should nothing be done to alter the course that the world is heading down. I have no reason to doubt the eminent expert evidence that was presented in this case to that effect. However, I must on the evidence of this case determine that it is the demand for coal-fired electricity, and not the supply of coal from coal mines, which is at the heart of the problem. This argument takes some understanding, especially given the suggestion that liability for greenhouse gas emissions should rest with the power generators. In India, GVK (a majority owner of the Alpha mine) also happens to be developing two coal power plants that will presumably help drive demand for coal. ""It's not our coal mine's fault, but our power plant's fault,"" the lawyers were not heard to say. For all miners of thermal coal, their only customers are electricity plants. In Australia, there are several examples of energy companies who own both the coal mine and the power plant. The decision over the Alpha mine is now back with the Queensland Government, which last November developed a strategy to speed up the exploitation of the Galilee Basin. In his judgement, Smith acknowledged the Alpha coal mine was a ""watershed issue"" for Queensland's Galilee Basin. Once one gets the go-ahead, the area could be quickly opened up for more. GVK also owns a majority stake in another similar size Galilee basin coal mine. Indian-owned company Adani also wants to build a 60 million tonne per year mine at Galilee and MP Clive Palmer's China First project has plans for a 40 Mt per year coal mine. Last weekend the IPCC released its third of three major reports on climate change, this time looking at how the world can cut emissions to avoid 2C of global warming – a figure considered by some, but not all, to be a threshold for ""dangerous"" climate change Ottmar Edenhofer, a co-chair of the IPCC group that produced the report, said:  ""There is a clear message from science: To avoid dangerous interference with the climate system, we need to move away from business as usual."" The problem is, that Australia and Queensland appears set on business as usual. We are driving a ute at reckless speed towards a risk-laden future with a rear bumper sticker telling the climate literate world what we think of them. Is that un-Australian?"
"You don't need me to tell you how bad climate change is. It's bad. If you want, have a look at the latest report from the IPCC, which not only sets out the myriad ways climate change will mess everything up, but inconveniently points out that it's already happening. It's hard not to feel disempowered. Climate change is caused by everything we do: our entire energy system, itself a subset of our GDP-obsessed, consumerist economy. The one corrective thing that's supposed to sort out such systemic failures – political leadership – cowers and trembles, desperately wanting for both imagination and guts.  Last month the chancellor pledged gleefully to get hold of ""every last drop"" of oil and gas in the UK. Knowing what we know, it's a pathetic promise: the raw maths of climate change warn that we can't burn more than about a fifth of proven global resources of fossil fuels to have a decent chance of maintaining a two degree temperature rise. Our infrastructure, agriculture and whole way of life are built around fossil fuels. Considerable swathes of the City of London remain intertwined with them. Investors have considered the carbon maths, assessed our government, and concluded (not irrationally) that nobody is going to stand up and stop us from burning every inch of our noxious stockpile. The tired response from the go slow crowd is buck-passing balderdash: the UK is only a small proportion of global emissions so, hey, why should we go to all the effort? Nobody else is going to. But no one country – not even India, China or the US – could solve the problem of climate change and green energy alone. Rather than permitting the likes of George Osborne to drill with impunity, it only increases the imperative to lead from the front. If our government is bending over backwards to drill all our possible hydrocarbons, that presumably mean it's OK for other countries to do likewise. In which case, all bets are off. So how to break this logjam? The problem isn't ultimately technological. The price of renewables is plummeting as installation levels creep upwards; the cost of solar panels, for example, has dropped by 60% since 2011. We mostly know how to decarbonise, and we could throw concerted research and development funding at the problems that still fox us. On a long enough timescale, we'd get there anyway: the raw economics will win out as oil and gas is getting more costly to find at the same time as renewables are becoming cheaper. But we don't have a long enough horizon. This is a cultural and moral problem, first and foremost, about how we do things differently. Our economies need a purpose – to meet people's needs, now and in the future – and to achieve that strictly within environmental limits. We must decide, proactively, that economies powered by dirty fuel just aren't credible. In vignettes (such as the launch of a renewable energy cooperative in Balcombe) we glimpse the possibilities for our own islands, and the sort of choices our political leaders must urgently start to take. The most urgent of which is, how do we ensure the fossil fuel industry gets the message that it should shape up or ship out.

"Clean energy will have to at least treble in output and dominate world energy supplies by 2050 in order to avoid catastrophic climate change, a UN report is set to conclude on Sunday. The report produced by hundreds of experts and backed by almost 200 world governments, will detail the dramatic transformation required of the entire globe's power system, including ending centuries of coal, oil and gas supremacy.  Currently fossil fuels provide more than 80% of all energy but the urgent need to cut planet-warming carbon emissions means this must fall to as little as a third of present levels in coming decades, according to a leaked draft of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) report seen by the Guardian. There is heavy emphasis on renewable energy, such as wind and solar power, and cutting energy waste, which together need hundreds of billions of dollars of investment a year. But despite the scale of the challenge, the draft report is upbeat: ""Since [2007], many renewable energy technologies have substantially advanced in terms of performance and cost and a growing number have achieved technical and economic maturity, making renewable energy a fast growing category in energy supply,"" the report says. It also highlights that the benefits of clean energy, particularly in reducing deadly air pollution and providing secure energy supplies, ""outweigh the adverse side effects"". The IPCC report is the last part of a trilogy compiled by thousands of the world's most eminent scientists which gives the most definitive account of climate change to date. The first report, released in September, showed climate change was ""unequivocally"" caused by human activity and prompted Ban Ki-moon, the UN secretary general, to say: ""The heat is on. Now we must act."" The second, published in March, warned that the impact of global warming, from extreme weather to reduced food production, posed a grave threat to humanity and could lead to wars and mass migration. The International Energy Agency said the IPCC's work showed ""the urgent need of enabling a global transition to clean energy systems"". The report will address how to avert the worst dangers by cutting carbon emissions, which have been rising despite the global recession of 2007-08. Nuclear power is cited among the low-carbon energy sources needed, but the draft report warns it ""has been declining since 1993"" and faces concerns about ""safety, nuclear weapon proliferation risks, waste management security as well as financial and regulatory risks"". Another way to produce low-carbon energy is to burn fossil fuels but capture and bury the carbon emissions. The IPCC experts note that, unlike renewable energy, this technology ""has not yet been applied at a large, commercial scale"". The draft report concludes that increasing carbon emissions are due to rising coal use, along with increasing demand for energy from the world's growing population. But it notes that policies implemented to cut carbon emissions will also cut the value of fossil fuel reserves, particularly for coal. It also says increased use of gas could cut emissions in the ""short term"", if it replaces coal. China's vast coal burning represents a huge challenge but a new analysis from Greenpeace, published on Friday, suggests it may have reached a turning point. ""The range of coal caps and anti-smog measures put in place by the Chinese authorities could see the country cut its carbon emissions by more than twice the UK's annual footprint by 2020, making it possible for global carbon levels to peak before climate change spirals out of control,"" said Li Shuo, Greenpeace East Asia's climate and energy campaigner. On Thursday, Nobel peace prize winner Archbishop Desmond Tutu called in the Guardian for an anti-apartheid-style campaign against fossil fuel companies. ""It is clear that [the companies] are not simply going to give up; they stand to make too much money,"" he wrote. Over half a trillion dollars a year are spent subsidising fossil fuels – six times more than spent supporting renewable energy – and US president Barack Obama and other leaders have pledged to phase these out. The draft IPCC report states this could be done without harming the poor: ""Many countries have reformed their tax and budget systems to reduce fuel subsidies, that actually accrue to the relatively wealthy, and used other mechanisms that are more targeted to the poor."" The draft report runs counter to some of the UK's key energy policies. It states that decarbonising electricity is key to cost-effective cuts in emissions, but the coalition government voted down a plan to do this by 2030. The report also warns that building high-carbon energy infrastructure developments will lock societies into high emissions and may be ""difficult or very costly to change"", but UK ministers are strongly pushing shale gas exploration. The UK's carbon plan includes significant burning of biofuels and biomass (usually wood), which is supposed to be carbon neutral. But the IPCC report says scientific debate about whether biofuels cut emissions ""remains unresolved"" and that without policy safeguards ""large scale bioenergy deployment could increase emissions"". Friends of the Earth's executive director, Andy Atkins, said: ""We can only avoid catastrophic climate change if we reduce our dependency on fossil fuels – we're already on track for four degrees warming, which will be impossible for human society to adapt to. We have the technology to prevent dangerous climate change. What we lack is the political will of our leaders to strongly champion renewable power and energy efficiency."" Li said: ""We stand at a fork in road. One way leads to more dependence on dwindling fossil fuels that are wrecking our climate and damaging our health; the other to a world powered by a booming clean energy sector that is already driving growth and creating jobs. The sooner we act, the cheaper it will be."""
"For those concerned about climate change, the ultra-conservative Heartland Institute offers up a calming solution: try thinking of yourself as a pea, instead of a human. Peas in a lab sprouted faster with extreme concentrations of carbon dioxide, the greenhouse gas mainly responsible for climate change than under normal growing conditions, Heartland said. “Which pea shoot would you rather be,” asked Craig Idso, the lead author of a new Heartland publication meant to debunk the authoritative new climate change report released by the United Nations' Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC).  What's good for a pea pod isn't necessarily good for the planet, of course. Idso did not mention how rising temperatures and growing water scarcity might affect plant growth under climate change. It was just one of many lapses by what claimed to be a serious scientific examination of the threat of climate change from the thinktank funded by the Koch oil billionaires and anonymous donors. The Heartland Institute has over the years published its own parallel-universe version of the blockbuster climate reports produced by thousands of scientists under the banner of the IPCC. The IPCC reports are seen as the authoritative account of how climate change is threatening security, food supply and humanity. For the Heartland report, only a handful of reporters turned out, and Heartland complained its offerings were almost never noticed by the scientific press. The event broke up ahead of schedule because Heartland said members had to go meet members of Congress – whose identities the group refused to disclose. Tuesday’s report, a weighty volume of more than 1,000 pages, was funded by three family foundations – whose identities Heartland refused to disclose. The summary – of what purported to be ground-breaking climate science – relied heavily on material published by Idso and Heartland as well as a self-published paper. It otherwise cited only one paper published this century, with most of the references dating to the 1970s. One reference was to a paper published in 1904 and another to 1918. And while in the real world understanding of climate change has moved on, through the work of scientists and real-time evidence in heat waves and killer storms, Heartland’s stable of experts remains resolute in sticking to their arguments that climate change does not exist – or might even be beneficial. “If you look at the real world data it shows that rising levels of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere actually have a positive effect,” Idso said.  The argument has gained some currency among ultra-conservative groups like Heartland, the American Legislative Exchange Council (Alec), and the coal lobby, according to Kert Davies of the Climate Investigation Centre. The main coal lobby, the American Coalition for Clean Coal Electricity, last January released a report demanding the Environmental Protection Agency take into account the positive benefits of increased greenhouse gas emissions. Alec – which has sought to tax homeowners for installing solar panels – adopted Idso’s arguments for its comments to the EPA in 2011, according to Davies. But Idso’s arguments do not appear to have entirely convinced the people at Heartland – who seemed divided on Tuesday as to whether climate change was occurring, or good for the planet. Fred Singer, a retired physicist, told the press conference in Washington DC there was no warming. “There is a consensus that there has been an increase in temperature ... but people now agree it has nothing to do with carbon dioxide,” he said. Joseph Bast, who heads the Heartland Institute, admitted a human factor in climate change, but said: “it is very small. The bigger impact is the increase in carbon dioxide.” As for Idso, he maintained any amount of climate change was for the good. “If you are a plant … you are going to recognise that higher carbon dioxide concentrations are better,” he said. “A little bit of warming is good for the planet.”"
"Homeowners relying on expensive, dirty oil for heating will be offered payments of thousands of pounds from Wednesday to switch to renewable energy alternatives in a government drive to cut carbon emissions from heat. The domestic renewable heat incentive, which was meant to launch in 2012 but has been repeatedly delayed, is the first scheme of its kind in the world, offering financial incentives for low carbon heating technologies including boilers that burn wood pellets. Around 18,000 households who have installed the technologies in recent years are already eligible to start receiving the payments, which will be made quarterly from public money over seven years. Although the scheme is open to people with gas-fired boilers, the upfront and running costs of the technologies means they will be most attractive to homes off the gas grid reliant on oil or electricity for heating. Greg Barker, the climate minister, said: ""This is the first scheme of its kind in the world – showing yet again that the UK is leading the way in the clean energy sector. Not only will people have warmer homes and cheaper fuel bills, they will reduce their carbon emissions, and will also get cash payments for installing these new technologies. It opens up a market for the supply chain, engineers and installers – generating growth and supporting jobs as part of our long-term economic plan."" The technologies eligible for the payments include biomass boilers, solar thermal systems that provide hot water, ground source heat pumps which draw heat from warmth underground and air source heat pumps which extract heat from the air outside a home. The renewable energy industry and rural groups welcomed the launch of the scheme. Dave Sowden, chief executive of the Sustainable Energy Association said: “The industry is delighted the domestic RHI has finally launched and that the journey to cleaner home heating can now begin. Installing low carbon heating technologies into energy efficient homes is one of the most important ways of securing cheap, affordable, clean energy, and this world-first scheme is a very important start.” Henry Robinson, president of the Country Land and Business Association, which represents landowners said: “We have campaigned for such a scheme for years so we are pleased that domestic properties in rural England and Wales now have the opportunity to reduce their heating bills while delivering environmental benefits.""  The RHI differs from the feed-in tariffs for solar panels launched in 2010 – which paid for both electricity generated as well as exported to the national grid – by paying just for heat generated for use at home. Homeowners will have to pay for a green deal assessment of their home, which typically cost £100-150, before being eligible for the RHI scheme. Cathy Debenham, who runs the renewable energy advice website YouGen, said: ""Its aim is to enable renewable heating systems to compete on a level playing field with fossil fuel ones. The payments, which are made over seven years compensate the owner for the price difference between the two, including the cost of borrowing money to pay for installation."" However, she cautioned that people should make sure technologies are right for their property before switching. ""Not all renewable heating is appropriate for every property. Heat pumps run at much lower temperatures than a standard boiler, and so they are most suited to well insulated buildings, ideally with underfloor heating."" ""Biomass boilers are significantly bigger than an oil boiler and will need more space, plus space to store the fuel, which must be kept dry. Solar thermal panels are not much use if you have electric showers, as most of the hot water they generate won't be used."" Oftec, the oil heating industry's trade body, said the high upfront costs of many of the technologies made the RHI ""only fit for the wealthy few."" Tariffs announced today: Solar thermal – 19.2p per kilowatt hour. Upfront cost £3-5,000 Ground source heat pumps – 18.8p per kWh. £11-15,000 Air source heat pumps – 7.3p per kWh. £7-14,000 Biomass boilers – 12.2p per kWh. Up to £15,000"
"Greenhouse gas emissions grew nearly twice as fast over the past decade as in the previous 30 years, bringing the world closer to warming that will bring dramatic and dangerous changes to the climate, according to a leaked draft of a United Nations' report. The report from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) said the growth rate in emissions over the from 2000-10 was higher than expected – even after taking into account the economic slowdown.  ""Global GHG [greenhouse gas] emissions have risen more rapidly between 2000 and 2010,"" said the draft obtained by the Guardian. ""Current GHG emissions trends are at the high end of projected levels for the last decade."" The draft went on to warn that delaying emissions cuts beyond 2030 would make it harder to avoid the severe consequences of climate change. Leading scientists and government officials are in Berlin this week to approve the exact wording of the report before it is formally released on 13 July. The IPCC report is the third part of a trilogy intended to serve as the definitive account of climate change. The first report, released last September, found climate change was caused by human activity. The second, released in Japan last month, warned climate change posed a grave threat to humanity, was already putting food security in jeopardy and could lead to wars and mass migration. It also set out the impacts global warming was having on wildlife. This third part was supposed to be focused on solutions. Instead, the report made increasingly clear the large and growing gap in the scale of the threat and the readiness of those solutions. The draft said emissions grew 2.2% a year on average between 2000 and 2010, compared to 1.3% a year over the entire period from 1970-2010. In 2010-11, global emissions from the burning of fossil fuels grew 3%, the draft went on. The rapid growth in emissions has defied efforts by governments to deal with climate change, and even though the historic recession saw some slowdown it was eventually reduced to a blip in the continuous upward path. ""The global economic crisis 2007-08 has temporarily reduced emissions but not changed the trend,"" the draft said. The culprit for the upward line on the graph was coal, the draft said. The decade saw a big jump in the number of new coal-burning power plants that came online. Coal plants are the most polluting of all power stations, and there are more than 1,000 new plants under construction worldwide. Most of those are earmarked for China and India – although the report pointed out that many of those power plants are supplying factories making goods whose ultimate destination is America or Europe. Other developing countries have also stepped up their use of coal. Germany, Britain and France have also been burning coal, because of low worldwide prices. But their consumption pales beside China, which on its own accounts for about 15% of total global emissions from coal. The expansion of coal-fired power plants – China gets two-thirds of its electricity from coal – have polluted the air and the water. A recent World Bank study estimated 750,000 people died in China every year as a result of air pollution, in large part because of the burning of coal. • The headline on this article was amended on 14 April 2014. An earlier version said greenhouse gas emissions had nearly doubled."

"The job of the chief executive is to scan the horizon and think about the long term. Clearly, you must always balance this with attention to the short term but if you don't pay attention to the future, you will find that all too soon it becomes a present for which you are unprepared. When I look forward, I clearly see resource scarcity, energy price increases and extreme weather as real and growing threats to the long-term viability of business. We live in a world where these major trends pose a significant challenge to the business as usual-model we currently operate, and perhaps the most dominant trend of all is climate change. When a body of experts is giving a clear warning on climate change, it is poor risk management not to listen to them.  This is why I am a signatory to the Trillion Tonne Communique and am encouraging other businesses to sign as well. The Trillion Tonne communique has been drawn up by the members of the Prince of Wales's Corporate Leaders Group, to send a signal from the business community to policymakers gathering in Paris next year for the UN Climate Change Conference. It is asking the negotiators who will be in Paris, and their governments, to join business in thinking about the short and longer term by committing to decarbonise the global economy. Their decision will have an impact on business the world over. A successful business requires a little luck combined with a focus on risk mitigation, seizing the right opportunities, and being meticulous in the execution of your priorities. I've rarely had the luxury of having all the facts. Indeed, it's far more frequent that I'm offered opinions based on the available evidence. To succeed, you have to weigh up what you have and then make a decision. Climate change is no different. We know that global carbon emissions are rising, we know the world's population is increasing, and we know that emissions from countries such as China and India will explode as they develop in our footsteps. We also know there is reason to fear the consequences if our planet warms by more than two degrees. A strong scientific case supports the theory that human activities, rather than natural causes, are causing our planet to heat up. There's also a strong scientific case that the best chance of keeping our planet from warming a further two degrees is to ensure we don't emit more than a trillion tonnes of carbon from C02. We have already spent around half of that trillion tonnes, which means we urgently need to do things differently. In the knowledge that failure to act means risking the long-term viability of my business, I also know we need to make the right choices and investment decisions collectively. I've seen the devastating consequences for those that fail to respond to emerging threats; Woolworths, HMV and Focus, to name but a few. The recent floods cost UK businesses, home-owners and the government billions of pounds. Continuing climate change means more extreme events like those floods. Businesses are feeling the financial impacts of being forced to close and refit premises due to flood or storm damage. We're having to displace workers and invest in the clean-up operations of the affected communities we serve. For my business alone, we are talking about costs of tens of millions of pounds. Businesses are the backbone to successfully growing our economies. We can't afford to be awash with floods – because we are not only piling up sandbags, we are piling up costs. What we need is to hedge – we need to give ourselves the best shot at success and stability – we need the decision-makers in Paris to agree and come up with a plan for all the world's economies to decarbonise urgently. Business won't be at the table in Paris when decisions are being made that will have an impact on our planet, its people and those of us responsible for growing our economies. That's why I'm urging businesses, regardless of their size or country, to sign the Trillion Tonne communique. The greater our number and the more united we are, the more our voice will be heard.

"Climate change is real and a real problem for the world, Apple said on Monday, announcing its progress on environment targets ahead of Earth day. The technology company, publishing a video narrated by CEO Tim Cook on its green initiatives and updated environment web pages, claimed that 94% of its corporate facilities and 100% of its data centres are now powered by renewable energy sources such as solar power.  Lisa Jackson, the former administrator of the US Environmental Protection Agency and Apple's vice-president for environmental initiative, wrote in a letter: ""We feel the responsibility to consider everything we do in order to reduce our impact on the environment. This means using greener materials and constantly inventing new ways to conserve precious resources."" We want to leave the world better than we found it. We’re proud of our progress but we know we have much more to do. http://t.co/iHzF9rUnx1 Greenpeace, which has previously been critical of Apple for sourcing energy from fossil fuels, recently praised the company for improving the energy mix powering its data centres, ranking it above other technology giants such as Amazon. Apple's Maiden data centre in North Carolina is powered by a large 20MW solar farm and biogas fuel cells. Apple said its carbon footprint in 2013 was 33.8m metric tonnes of greenhouse gas emissions in 2013, or around 5% of the UK's annual CO2 emissions for the same year. Around three-quarters of the emissions come from manufacturing. ""We believe climate change is real. And that it's a real problem,"" the company's website now says. The company said its new HQ being built in Cupertino, California, will use 30% less energy than an equivalent building, and will be home to around 7,000 trees. It also highlighted a decrease in the material required to make its products – the new iPad Air uses nearly one-third less material, by weight, than the original iPad.  All the company's retail stores will now take back Apple products for recycling, for free; previously customers had to buy a new product to recycle an old one. In the UK and US, an ongoing scheme offering payments for old iPhones, iPads and Macs also continues. The announcement came ahead of today's 44th anniversary of Earth day, a day of activism born in the US and designed to raise environmental awareness. Cook recently told climate change sceptics that they should ditch Apple shares if they did not like the company's backing for renewable energy and sustainability, leading Virgin group founder Richard Branson to say he was ""enormously impressed"" by Cook's stance and his call for climate change deniers to ""get out of the way"". Apple has come in for criticism from Friends of the Earth for being slow to admit to using tin in its products sourced from the Indonesian island of Bangka, where mining has caused environmental damage and claimed dozens of lives. Last year, Apple sent a team to investigate conditions on the island and has said it will work to improve them."
"Many people have spent a lot of time trying to show that much of our recent climate change is just natural. So far, these studies have died as fast as they've been born.  A recent attempt was made to liken our climate to fans in a stadium, you know those annoying ""waves"" that fans make? Could our climate just be like that? Not likely; let me explain.   The so-called ""stadium wave"", as described by the scientists who coined the phrase, is ""a hypothesized multi-decadally varying climate signal that propagates across the Northern Hemisphere."" It is basically a signal that travels throughout the Earth's climate, in the ocean and atmosphere, and can be sensed by measurements. From author Dr. Marcia Wyatt's own website, you can find a more detailed description. So, could our recent changes in climate be somehow associated with these ""waves""? The great thing about science is these hypotheses can be checked. In fact, a very recent study did just that and found the stadium wave hypothesis lacking.  In the study, authors Michael Mann, Byron Steinman, and Sonya Miller estimate the low-frequency internal variability of the Northern Hemisphere (the stadium waves) by evaluating observed signals. These observations include the impacts of both forced (mainly human-caused) variations and natural variability (energy naturally ""sloshing around"" the Earth). They generated a set of alternative histories based on the statistics of past observations to show that the recent Northern Hemisphere variations are within the range of expected uncertainty.  The authors then show that past analyses which have been used to estimate internal variability have failed to find appropriate variability when it was known ahead of time. These methods errantly show natural variability which is too high and which has a biased phase. As a result, the claims of stadium waves are made based on an incorrect methodology; they are likely an ""artifact of this flawed procedure."" To get into the weeds a bit, the primary natural fluctuation that was focused on is called the Atlantic Multi-decadal Oscillation (AMO for short). The recent studies promoting large natural climate variability deduced the AMO by detrending the time series of North Atlantic sea surface temperatures, and then interpreting the left-over low-frequency variation as the AMO. This means they removed a linear variation. Prior works (here and here for instance) have shown that this method causes artifacts to appear. For instance, if you aren't careful, you might conclude that atmospheric aerosol cooling was actually a natural climate fluctuation. That is, you might confuse human-caused cooling effects with natural fluctuations.  The researchers Mann, Steinman and Miller, further showed that the detrended AMO method yields a climatic variability that is approximately twice as large as prior estimates and outside the 95% error range. They also found that the detrending method got the timing wrong (biasing error in the phase). They compared the true AMO signal and the detrended AMO signal. The detrended signals have amplitudes which are too large by a factor of 2 and they are all in phase. As the authors write, this suggests, ""an artifact of the common forced signal masquerading as coherent low-frequency noise."" As I've written about before, studies which purport to show that significant recent climate variability is just natural are taken seriously by the scientific community. In fact, I think we would all like to conclude that the current climate change is just natural. During the course of scientific investigation, these claims are given their fair hearing. Unfortunately, they have not borne scientific scrutiny well. Distinguished Professor of meteorology Michael E. Mann told me,  ""Some researchers have in the past attributed a portion of Northern Hemispheric warming to a warm phase of the AMO. The true AMO signal, instead, appears likely to have been in a cooling phase in recent decades, offsetting some of the anthropogenic warming temporarily. We conclude that the AMO played at least a modest role in the apparent slowing of warming during the past decade. As the AMO is an oscillation, this cooling effect is likely fleeting, and when it reverses, the rate of warming will increase. Initial investigations into the multidecadal climate oscillation in the North Atlantic were hampered by the short length of the instrumental climate record which was only about a century long. And some of the calculations were contaminated by long-term climate trends driven or ""forced"" by human factors such as greenhouse gasses as well as pollutants known as 'sulphate aerosols.' These trends masqueraded as an apparent oscillation."" My own view is that a bit too much is made of these ""waves"". Humans like to find patterns and give names to patterns that are either real or imaginary. Certainly there are teleconnections between various parts of the climate and certainly those connections might manifest in slow (low frequency) climate variations. But we have a very short history of measurement. In order to be certain, we need measurements of multiple recurrences of the oscillations. We just don't have a long enough period of data.  We also need a clear articulation of the physical processes which cause fluctuations. We do not have that either. Until then, we are just whistling in the breeze (or yodeling in the broccoli as we say in Minnesota). With that said, this doesn't mean we shouldn't continue our search for such important fluctuations. When scientists propose natural variability as a climate-change mechanism, it makes the science better. Either they are right (and we are all better off) or they are wrong (as happened here). Regardless, at the end of the day, our understanding is deeper than before."
"Harvard has become the first American university to sign on to a United Nations-backed code of responsible investment – in a move to assuage a carbon divestment campaign. Six months after explicitly rejecting calls to divest from fossil fuels, managers of Harvard's $33bn endowment will now be guided by a set of investment principles taking into account environmental and social factors such as water and human rights, the university announced on Monday.  The new guidelines, set by the Principles of Responsible Investment organisation, do not commit Harvard to selling existing holdings in fossil fuels. But campaigners still claimed the step as a victory for a divestment movement that has now spread to more than 500 university campuses and other institutions across America and Europe. Nine colleges have so far divested fossil fuels, the campaign said. “A year ago Harvard was no way no how. But science is pushing everyone in the direction of action; students should be proud they've breached the dam of resistance,” said Bill McKibben, a Harvard graduate and founder of 350.org, which has led the campus divestment movement. Campaigning organisation Divest Harvard in its statement noted that the university still had millions invested in fossil fuels.“We need to divest from the problem as we invest in new solutions,” it said. Under the new initiatives announced by Harvard president, Drew Gilpin Faust, the university will ask alumni and donors to help raise $20 million for climate research. The university will also join the Carbon Disclosure Project, requiring companies held by Harvard to report on their carbon footprint. “Harvard has a vital leadership role to play in this work,” Faust wrote in a letter. “As a university, it has a special obligation and accountability to the future, to the long view needed to anticipate and alter the trajectory and impact of climate change.” She also recommitted Harvard to cutting greenhouse gas emissions 30% from 2006 levels by 2016. The university has reduced emissions 21% since then, she said. Harvard was looking into purchasing carbon offsets to make up the rest of the cuts."

"In a sheltered corner of one of the greatest megacities on Earth, there is a place where lizards careen around tree trunks, butterflies drink nectar from vermillion flowers and hummingbirds whisk the heavy air with their wings. Stand in the botanical gardens of the Bosque de Chapultepec (the Chapultepec forest) and listen carefully enough, and something remarkable happens: birdsong begins to pierce the groan of trucks and the screech of taxi horns from the long avenue that bisects the park.  The gardens are home to one of a growing number of azoteas verdes – or green roofs – that are springing up around Mexico City as part of the metropolis's efforts to purge its air of the pollution that has long been among its least-desired claims to fame. The azotea verde atop the circular single-story offices of the botanical gardens, is planted with hardy stonecrop, which can withstand the Mexico City summer, but which also produces oxygen and serves as a filter to draw out the carbon dioxide and heavy metal particles in the air. As well as providing the park's squirrels with an arena in which to practise their parkour, the roof help regulates the temperature of the offices below and soaks up rainwater to keep the building dry. Last year, the city's environment secretariat spent almost $1m (£595,000) on the azoteas verdes project, bringing the total area of green roofs in hospitals, schools and government buildings to 21,949 sq m. This year, the investment will rise by a third. Mexico City's environment secretary, Tanya Müller, says: ""In a city like ours where urban development puts pressure on the space we have at ground level, we have to take advantage of our rooftops to create a green urban infrastructure."" The green roofs do far more than simply purify the air: they reduce the ""heat island effect"", teach children about nature and speed up the recuperation rates of hospital patients, she adds. A little way across town, not far from the city's ancient heart, the Zócalo, sits the secretariat's air-monitoring lab. It too has been given over to greenery and from its neatly planted roof, where dedicated staff congregate for lunchtime exercise classes, the haze that blankets the capital is plain to see. It smudges the outlines of distant towerblocks, as well as the mountains that enclose the city and its 21 million inhabitants. But, as Müller is keen to point out, fighting air pollution demands rather more technological solutions than sowing seeds on rooftops. Her glass-and-steel office, which overlooks the Zócalo, feels like a curious hybrid of an internet startup office and an architectural practice. On the wall by her desk is an enormous screen with a live Twitter feed and electronic maps showing the temperature and ozone levels of Mexico City and the surrounding area. On a wet April afternoon, the ozone levels are creeping above the normal levels, but other pollutants are within the usual range. ""I have this dashboard on my smartphone and it's the same dashboard as the department of air monitoring has and the mayor has,"" Müller says. ""We know how the air quality is every day and whether we have to take decisions."" Readings from the 29 air-monitoring stations in the city and the surrounding state of Mexico can trigger a variety of responses. If pollution levels are seriously high and remain so for 48 hours, the environment secretariat's Hoy No Circula (No driving today) ban kicks in, and those cars with registration plates of a certain colour and two-digit code are not allowed on the roads. Anyone found driving when they shouldn't be has their plates taken away and must pay what Müller describes as a very harsh fine of 20 days' pay based on the Mexico City minimum wage. ""Even though the measures aren't very popular – we're the first administration not to have suspended Hoy No Circula for any holiday – they are very responsible,"" she adds proudly. Unsurprisingly, Müller, who cycles to work, is a big fan of pedal power. The two mountain bikes parked in a rack outside her office, up the stairs from the Diego Rivera murals that decorate the walls, suggest that her staff are too. By expanding the city's Metro system and investing in the Ecobici bike hire scheme – which is used for about 26,000 journeys a day – she hopes to wean people off their dependence on cars. ""We still have a long way to go: although 80% of the population uses public transport, the city is still very car-orientated,"" Müller says. ""What we're trying to do is make people conscious of how you use you car: it has to be in a much more rational and responsible manner."" Other initiatives to improve the city's air quality over the past two decades – such as moving refineries beyond its boundaries and introducing cleaner buses – appear to be paying off. Between 1990 and 2012, levels of ozone fell from 43 parts per billion to 27 parts per billion; sulphur dioxide from 55 parts per billion to five parts per billion, and carbon monoxide from 84 parts per billion to 10 parts per billion. Muller says air quality is her priority ""because it has an impact on your health and that obviously has consequences for your quality of life"". She adds: ""We're working on air quality and climate change together, because whatever we do for air quality and emissions will have a positive effect on climate change. At the end of the day, we want a city that can offer better quality of life for its citizens."" Mexico City's efforts to clean up its act have not gone unnoticed; Müller recently met officials from Tehran who wanted to compare notes, while members of the C40 Cities Climate Leadership Group have also shown interest in the city's smartphone apps. As Mexico begins to shrug off its smog and attendant grimy reputation, Müller believes its strategies could help cities further north. ""What's very interesting for us is what's happening right now in Paris and London: we somehow have this perception that in these very developed, first-world European cities with great transport and infrastructure, you've overcome these issues of air quality,"" she says. ""But we're seeing that it's not so. The origin and the problem is the same: it's the use of private automobiles. People need to know that even if you have a great public transport system, if you do not rationalise private car use, you're going to have problems."""
"A British environmental organisation that has reviewed the draft of a forthcoming UN IPCC report on mitigating climate change has questioned many of the document's recommendations as deeply flawed.  Dr Rachel Smolker, co-director of Biofuelwatch, said that the report's embrace of ""largely untested"" and ""very risky"" technologies like bioenergy with carbon capture and sequestration (BECCS), will ""exacerbate"" climate change, agricultural problems, water scarcity, soil erosion and energy challenges, ""rather than improving them.""  A leaked draft of the as yet unpublished report by Working Group 3 (WG3) of the UN's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), to be officially released in mid-April, was obtained by the Guardian. Dr Smolker, a behavioural ecologist and biofuels expert, said that the alarming impacts of climate change identified by the IPCC's Working Groups 1 and 2 would ""worsen"" as a consequence of such ""false solutions"" which have been increasingly criticised in the scientific literature. The IPCC projects that atmospheric concentrations of carbon dioxide emissions are unlikely to stabilise at 450 parts per million (ppm), accepted by the international community as the safe limit to ensure that global average temperatures do not exceed the 2 degrees Celsius danger level. It is more likely that concentrations could ""overshoot"" to around 550 ppm (if not higher by other less conservative projections). The leaked draft concludes that ""essentially any"" emissions target can be achieved ""regardless of the near‐term path"" of overshoot ""by shifting emissions reductions to the future"":  ""There are no published scenarios depicting a pathway returning to 450 CO2‐e [emissions] by century's end without a negative emissions option when delayed participation is imposed. The vast majority of published 450 CO2‐e scenarios involve overshoot during the century and include a negative emissions technology."" The draft thus recommends ""carbon negative"" energy technologies that might help to draw down carbon from the atmosphere. These include ""large scale utilisation of BECCS""; coal and natural gas with carbon capture and sequestration (CCS) - carbon emitted from burning fossil fuels is captured and injected underground where it is stored indefinitely; nuclear power; and large hydroelectric plants.  The problem, Biofuelwatch's co-director said, is that there is no scientific consensus on whether these technologies actually work. CCS technology is already being used to facilitate intensified fossil fuel exploitation. In bioenergy, it has involved ""capture of fermentation in ethanol refineries"": ""... so far much of carbon captured from bioenergy and other processes is ultimately used for Enhanced Oil Recovery – injected into depleted oil wells to create pressure enough to force remaining difficult to access oil out. This can hardly be considered 'sequestration' or an effective approach to solving the climate problem."" She added that ""burning wood for electricity and heat releases up to 150% as much CO2 per unit of energy generation than does coal"" excluding emissions from ""deforestation, harvesting and transportation.""  According to Dr Smolker, CCS cannot be viewed as ""carbon negative"" due to ""the high costs, and associated high added energy demand for capture, transport, compression and injection."" Even more problematic, she said, is that there is ""little real world testing"" of whether CO2 pumped into underground cavities ""will remain in situ"" indefinitely, or be released, which she describes as ""a dangerous gamble."" Biofuelwatch also criticised the IPCC draft report's recommendation of large-scale bioenergy projects. Bioenergy ""should be considered a driver"" of emissions from agriculture, forestry and other land use, Smolker said, ""not a means of mitigation."" The growing use of bioenergy as a substitute for fossil fuels is encroaching increasingly on land use, and in turn escalating food prices, intensifying land grabbing, and increasing demand for crops, livestock, wood and so on: ""Lands and ecosystems cannot at the same time both provide large quantities of biomass for bioenergy, and still securely act as 'carbon sinks.' It is not possible to have it both ways."" Currently, just under 40% of US corn production is dedicated to ethanol although it provides just ""a pittance of transport energy."" The large areas of land required for meaningful bioenergy production means it would simultaneously undermine food production while contributing to ""escalating food prices."" Although the IPCC proposes bioenergy as the solution to renewable energy, ""it can never provide more than a tiny fraction towards the current and projected growth in demand for energy.""  Stephen Salter, a professor emeritus of engineering design at the University of Edinburgh who has proposed cloud enhancement as one mechanism of geoengineering to address climate change, said that given the import of dangerous warming, techniques to reduce carbon in the atmosphere must be part of the toolbox. But he said the focus should be on the Arctic: ""Those working on geoengineering are largely doing so reluctantly. The concern is that we need to ensure technology is available in case events occur more quickly than expected. The IPCC has not fully accounted for certain feedbacks involving black carbon, methane release, and the rapid loss of the Arctic summer sea ice. A technique like marine cloud brightening by spraying seawater onto clouds to increase their reflectivity, could save the sea ice and help cool the climate with relatively little side-effects that can be controlled with careful application."" But other geoengineering techniques suffer from less certainty, said Prof Salter, who is a member of the Arctic Methane Emergency Group (AMEG). ""Many major proposals suffer from debilitating costs and practicalities, and would take too long – up to a century or more - to work. And their risks are less understood.""  Prof Stuart Haszeldine, a geoscientist also at the University of Edinburgh specialising in CCS, said:  ""Ultimately a full, immediate transition to renewables is the right imperative, but it cannot happen overnight due to the engineering costs and practicalities. So we must reduce our carbon emissions while we are still relying on fossil fuels. Our current emissions trajectory is heading for catastrophe. CCS would allow us to draw down emissions during the transition to renewables.  Every component of CCS has been practiced separately in the industry for decades, so putting them altogether to minimise our carbon footprint makes sense. Several large-scale commercial CCS enterprises will become operational this year, such as the coal-fired plant in Kemper County.  Danielle Paffard of the Centre for Alternative Technology's Zero Carbon Britain project, however, voiced further reservations: ""BECCS isn't useful as a central feature of a climate mitigation strategy, due to the scale of current electricity demand, and requires an enormous reduction of demand to be viable. Any proposal to rely primarily on biomass for baseload electricity generation is never sensible."" Salter, Haszeldine and Paffard have not seen the draft IPCC mitigation report.  In particular, Paffard criticised carbon capture for fossil fuel power plants as a ""red herring"":  ""We can't hope to simply run over a carbon precipice and pulls ourselves back. Government targets must be much more ambitious. Our research has shown that we can run modern societies without relying on fossil fuels, and that transitioning to net zero carbon emissions by 2030 is technologically and economically feasible with the right approach."" Despite reservations, Paffard acknowledged a limited but ""very important"" role for BECCS. Other forms of carbon capture such as peatland conversion, biochar, and extensive reforestation will be ""crucial"" for energy transition, she said:  ""Biomass does have the potential to be very destructive, but if used sparingly it has a place as part of a wider strategy involving renewables, to create synthetic fuels useful for industry and transport. Bioenergy is important as a flexible backup to address long-term energy storage due to the intermittency and variability of renewable sources - but its use must be sustainable, based on 'second generation' non-food crops [e.g. forest and crop residues, municipal and construction waste], not encroach on land-use for food, and combined with extensive reforestation."" The IPCC draft report does emphasise the need to dramatically ramp up solar and wind power, pointing out the superior ""technical potential"" of solar compared to other renewables. Dr Smolker of Biofuelwatch, in contrast, said that the IPCC's central emphasis on biofuels with carbon capture is a ""dangerous distraction"" from the task of ""deeply altering our entire relationship to energy consumption."" She highlighted an unwillingness to recognise the ""fundamental link between 'endless growth economics' and ecological destruction.""  Working Group 3, she said, lacks sufficient expertise to assess the merits of its recommended technologies. Many critical assessments of bioenergy ""come from scientists with a background in ecology and related disciplines and those are barely represented within the IPCC"" - WG3 is staffed largely by economists and engineers: ""The underlying assumption appears to be that business as usual [BAU] economic growth must be sustained, and industry and corporate profits must be protected and maintained. But if we focus on 'BAU economics', seeking and accepting only bargain basement options for addressing global warming - the costs will be far more severe.""

"The rise of social media is being powered by dirty forms of energy such as coal, a report from the campaign group Greenpeace said on Wednesday. The Clicking Clean report praised six companies – Apple, Box, Facebook, Google, Rackspace and Salesforce – for committing to power their data centres with 100% renewable energy. Apple in particular had cleaned up its energy profile, Greenpeace International said.  But Amazon Web Services, which provides a cloud platform for Netflix, Tumblr and Pinterest, was singled out for being secretive about its energy use, and for siting data centres in areas that rely heavily on coal. The company lagged ""far behind its major competitors, with zero reporting of its energy or environmental footprint to any source or stakeholder"", the report said. Twitter and Oracle were also faulted. Microsoft and Yahoo received middling grades in the report, which looked at energy use by 300 tech companies. Electricity use by data centres is one of the fastest-growing sources of greenhouse gas emissions globally, as more people come online. Internet data traffic is expected to triple between 2012 and 2017, Greenpeace said. Companies like Google, Facebook and Apple have built their own clean data centres and pushed for more of that electricity to come from wind and solar power. But not Amazon, which provides a cloud to many well-known online brands including Netflix, Pinterest, Spotify, Tumblr and Vine, Greenpeace said. ""Amazon has been undergoing quite explosive growth. They are providing a huge part of the infrastructure for the internet,"" said Gary Cook, technology campaigner for Greenpeace. ""But if you look at their data centres, their heaviest concentration is in Virginia which has a very dirty energy grid. They have really done nothing at this point to try to leverage their buying power to secure clean energy."" At peak times in the evening, streaming of Netflix and YouTube combined accounts for about 50% of US internet traffic. Much of that traffic is being moved along by electricity coming from coal. In Virginia, the east coast hub of Amazon's operation with 10 data centres, the company gets just 2% of its electricity from renewable sources. Nearly 40% of its electricity is generated by coal, Greenpeace said. The findings are estimates; Amazon did not provide data about its electricity demand. Twitter also received failing grades for failing to disclose its electricity use, despite going public last year. The company rents space in data centres. While it has expanded its footprint in a Sacramento, California data centre with a relatively clean electricity mix, Twitter has also moved into Georgia, a state that relies heavily on coal and nuclear power. The report said Twitter had made no public effort to buy renewable energy for its data centre, or push electricity providers to provide a cleaner mix of fuels. An Amazon spokesperson disputed the report, saying Greenpeace ""misses the mark by using false assumptions on AWS operations and inaccurate data on AWS energy consumption"". However, Amazon did not address the central criticism of the Greenpeace report about its refusal to disclose energy use - as other tech companies now do. The spokesperson argued that the use of Amazon's big data centres in itself saved electricity - and lessened the carbon footprint of computing. ""Running IT infrastructure on the AWS Cloud is inherently more energy efficient than traditional computing that depends on small, inefficient, and over-provisioned datacenters."" Carolyn Penner, a spokeswoman for Twitter, said: ""Twitter believes strongly in energy efficiency and optimisation of resources for minimal environmental impact. As we build out our infrastructure, we continue to strive for even greater efficiency of operations."" Greenpeace is pressing Twitter and Amazon to follow the lead of Apple, Facebook and Google and press electricity companies to invest in wind and solar. Facebook had located a data centre in Iowa, ensuring it was powered by wind turbines. In Utah, eBay disconnected its data centre from the grid and brought in fuel cells, powered by natural gas. ""They [Twitter and Amazon] could totally do the same thing,"" Cook said. The report also criticised tech companies for their support and their membership of the conservative American Legislative Exchange Council (Alec). Alec has been pushing for legislation that would impose fees on homeowners who install solar panels, and roll back clean energy standards in many states. Google, Facebook, Microsoft, Yahoo, eBay, and Verizon Terremark are members of the group."

"Scientific journals have had a bumpy road trying to learn how to deal with climate contrarians. Poor decisions by journal staff in dealing with contrarians have often led to editors resigning and a damaged reputation in the academic community. The latest such example is the journal Frontiers and its response to bullying by contrarians over a paper by Stephan Lewandowsky and colleagues. The paper analyzed the conspiratorial psychology of contrarian comments made on public blogs. As I previously documented, Frontiers received a number of complaints from contrarians that this analysis of their public comments was libelous or defamatory, and the journal ultimately caved and decided to retract the paper.  In its investigation, Frontiers had found no academic or ethical problems with the paper, but was concerned about legal liabilities. The journal and paper authors contractually agreed to a retraction statement saying as much. However, perhaps in the face of criticism from the academic community for failing to support academically and ethically sound research, Frontiers later revised its statement to depart from the contractually agreed statement and shift all the blame to the authors, contradicting the contractually agreed upon statement. This final move backfired and led to the resignation of three of the journal's editors, Ugo Bardi, Björn Brembs, and Colin Davis. Brembs' comments were particularly scathing, ""It is quite clear, why the content of the paper may feel painful to those cited in it, but as long as ""conspiracist ideation"" is not an official mental disorder, I cannot see any defamation. If you don't want to be labeled a conspiracy theorist, don't behave like one publicly on the internet. Therefore, after reading the paper, in my opinion, Frontiers ought to have supported their authors just as their home institution (UWA) is supporting them as their employees."" Robert Brulle, Professor of Sociology and Environmental Science at Drexel University has also informed me that as a result of the Recursive Fury incident, he has declined to write an article that Frontiers requested, and will no longer write or review for any Frontiers publications. The journal's reputation has undoubtedly taken a serious hit in the academic community for failing to stand behind sound research, and then trying to shift the blame to the authors of that research.  The Frontiers debacle is just the latest in a long history of interactions between contrarians and scientific journals that have not ended well for the latter. Unlike the Lewandowsky case, the previous examples involve the publication of contrarian research that's generally fundamentally flawed in peer-reviewed scientific journals, through one of the four approaches illustrated in the graphic below. The first approach is a common one in which a fundamentally flawed paper makes it through the peer-review process into a credible journal. In a paper published by John Abraham, myself, and colleagues last week in Cosmopolis, we examined several examples of flawed contrarian research that simply hasn't withstood scientific scrutiny or the test of time. This first approach isn't necessarily problematic – the peer-review process is necessary but imperfect, and in fact contrary hypotheses are often useful scientific contributions. However, it's important that we recognize and accept when these hypotheses have been disproved. In the second approach, contrarians will often publish a flawed paper in an off-topic journal where it's less likely to be subjected to peer-review by experts in the applicable scientific field. This approach is often taken after a paper has failed to withstand expert peer-review in an appropriate topical journal. We documented several examples of this approach in our Cosmopolis paper as well, including several papers published in off-topic journals by Roy Spencer and Richard Lindzen. In fact, an editor of the journal Remote Sensing resigned after the publication of a flawed Spencer paper, because he felt the journal had failed in its task of ensuring the paper was reviewed by qualified and unbiased experts. ""The editorial team unintentionally selected three reviewers who probably share some climate sceptic notions of the authors ...The problem is that comparable studies published by other authors have already been refuted in open discussions and to some extent also in the literature, a fact which was ignored by Spencer and Braswell in their paper and, unfortunately, not picked up by the reviewers."" In the third approach, a friendly editor gets a position at a journal where he can ensure that contrarian papers are given ""pal reviews."" The infamous example of this approach happened at the journal Climate Research between 1997 and 2003. During that six year period, editor Chris de Freitas published 14 separate papers from a select group of 14 climate contrarians including Willie Soon, John Christy, and Pat Michaels.  The publication of a particularly bad paper by Soon and the journal's refusal to retract it led to the resignation of five of the journal's editors, including recently-appointed editor-in-chief Hans von Storch, who explained the reason for his resignation: ""...the reason was that I as newly appointed Editor-in-Chief wanted to make public that the publication of the Soon & Baliunas article was an error, and that the review process at Climate Research would be changed in order to avoid similar failures. The review process had utterly failed; important questions have not been asked ... It was not the first time that the process had failed, but it was the most severe case"" In another possible example, a new journal called Climate published a fundamentally flawed paper by Syun-Ichi Akasofu that used unphysical magical thinking to try and blame global warming on natural causes. Fortunately the journal soon thereafter published a rebuttal by myself, John Abraham, and colleagues detailing the clear errors in Akasofu's paper. In the meantime, editor Chris Brierley resigned from the journal in frustration, explaining his decision, ""I do not believe that the paper is of sufficient quality for publication and have decided that I do not want to be associated with a journal with such lapses of judgment ... this paper does not pass five of the criteria for a distinction at the MSc level, and is therefore logically not of sufficient quality to deserve publication."" In the fourth approach, contrarians simply form their own journal in which they can publish whatever flawed research they like. This approach was exemplified in the short-lived journal Pattern Recognition in Physics. The journal's editors-in-chief were Nils-Axel Mörner, who denies that sea level is rising and believes in dowsing, and Sid-Ali Ouadfeul, a geophysicist at the Algerian Petroleum Institute. In one of its first issues, the journal published several papers that tried to blame global warming on various astronomical cycles. It had been published by the reputable Copernicus Publishing, but Copernicus quickly terminated the journal, explaining, ""...the initiators asserted that the aim of the journal was to publish articles about patterns recognized in the full spectrum of physical disciplines rather than to focus on climate-research-related topics ... In addition [to violating this understanding], the editors selected the referees on a nepotistic basis, which we regard as malpractice in scientific publishing and not in accordance with our publication ethics we expect to be followed by the editors. Therefore, we at Copernicus Publications wish to distance ourselves from the apparent misuse of the originally agreed aims & scope of the journal as well as the malpractice regarding the review process, and decided on 17 January 2014 to cease the publication of PRP."" It's important to reiterate that research questioning accepted and established science is important and often a useful scientific contribution. However, it's also critical that this contrary research be subjected to proper expert peer-review. Bypassing this standard process undermines the credibility of the research and the journal in which it's published, and often leads to backlash against the journal, for example through the resignations of frustrated editors, and lost academic credibility. Outlandish hypotheses often have more in common with Bozo the Clown than Albert Einstein. It's also important for journals to stand behind sound research that contrarians may find inconvenient, like Lewandowsky's, Michael Mann's, or our consensus paper. Frontiers appears to be the first case in which a journal caved to bullying from contrarians rather than supporting sound research. They've paid a steep price for that decision, losing three editors and credibility amongst academics, who like Brulle, may now think twice before publishing in Frontiers. The lesson to be learned from all of these examples – the best outcome for journals happens when they ensure their publications undergo rigorous peer-review by qualified experts, and when they support the sound research that has passed that test. Note: Lewandowsky is participating in a Reddit/Science Ask Me Anything."

"As governments meet in Berlin, scientists and farmers on the frontline of climate change in the Philippines are at odds over how best to adapt agriculture to the much higher temperatures and weather extremes expected over the next century. While one group argues that hi-tech rice varieties will withstand the greater floods, droughts and storms forecast this week by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), others say small farmers can best respond by avoiding chemicals and addressing problems such as soil fertility and water shortages. In one corner is the International Rice Research Institute (IRRI) in Los Baños, funded with $96m (£58m) from the US and UK governments, as well as major organisations such as Kellogg's and the Gates Foundation. There, with help from the Rockefeller and Ford foundations, scientists in the 1960s crossed rice varieties and, by using herbicides and inorganic fertilisers, more than doubled rice yields. The Asian ""green revolution"" was born, even as the continent was experiencing serious food shortages, and the Los Baños scientists were credited with pulling the region back from the edge of famine. Today IRRI sees climate change as the greatest challenge in 50 years. Temperatures at the research station have risen 2-4C in 40 years, yields are below 1982 levels and minimum temperatures are rising. If the IPCC scientists are correct, yields may fall a further 25% over the next 40 years, potentially triggering the greatest food crisis the world has seen. ""The challenge when IRRI was set up was to grow more rice and to avert hunger,"" says the institute's deputy director general, Bruce Tolentino. His office occupies the old laboratory where on 29 November 1966, where the first strain of IR8 ""miracle"" rice was developed by crossing a Chinese dwarf, Dee-geo-woo-gen, with Peta, a tall variety from Indonesia. Climate change, says Tolentino, needs a new green revolution: ""The challenge now is to rapidly adapt farming with modern varieties to climate change and feed a fast-growing global population, half of which depends on rice as a staple food. One billion people go hungry every day. ""In the 1990s rice yields were growing 2% a year; now they are just 1%. We are unable to keep up with population growth. Temperatures have risen 2-4C. Climate change will reduce productivity. Rainfall is unpredictable and rice is grown in areas like deltas that are prone to sea level rises. We have to gear up for more challenging agro-ecological conditions, we need to be able to use swampy areas and develop varieties that can be grown in salty or flooded areas. We have already launched flood-tolerant rice and we are now introducing salt-tolerant varieties,"" he says. ""The results [of IRRI work] are staggering,"" says Abdelbagi Ismail, the Sudanese principal scientist who helped develop scuba rice, which can survive flooding for 17 days. He and others crossed a flood-tolerant variety traditionally grown by poor farmers in Orissa state, India, with a more high-yielding variety widely grown across Asia. Using marker-assisted gene tracing, but not genetic modification, the scuba rice plant becomes dormant in waters up to 1.5 metres deep and starts growing again only when the floodwater recedes. Scuba rice is being grown by up to 4 million people in flood-prone areas of Bangladesh, Burman and India, Ismail says. ""I was recently in tribal areas of Orissa and scuba rice was like something from the sky for them. They told me that every three years they have a disaster. The poverty there is amazing: most people are landless and only have food for six months. Now they can get 2.5 tonnes per hectare. Once they have food then other things like education can follow. It is so satisfying when you see how it has changed people's lives. But we are just at the beginning – the target is to make it available to millions of farmers."" Drought, salt and more flood-tolerant varieties developed with conventional plant-breeding techniques are being tested at Los Baños, but within a few years GM varieties modified to synthesize betacarotene, a precursor of vitamin A, and others that will contain added iron and zinc may be available. IRRI is also working on an all-purpose GM rice variety that should be able to withstand flooding, drought and salinity. But the holy grail at Los Baños, what some scientists call a game-changer is genetically modified C4 rice, which would mimic maize and a few other crops by using photosynthesis far more efficiently. An international group of scientists, funded by Gates and the UK government to the tune of about $27m a year, is several years into a 20-year C4 programme, but no date is given as to when it might be ready. ""If we managed to re-engineer C4 rice it could give yields 30-50% greater yields,"" says Tolentino. Even as IRRI scientists race to develop climate-ready rice to solve future hunger, thousands of small farmers, who make up 60% of the population of the Philippines, say they are not waiting for hi-tech science but are adapting to climate change in other ways. The high-yielding seeds promised by the green revolution have not helped small farmers get out of poverty, they say. Instead they have gone deeply into debt to pay for chemicals and seeds on the promise of higher yields and better markets. Instead, climate change, in the form of erratic seasons and intense rains, has often ruined crops while middlemen have offered them the lowest prices. ""We take loan for the seeds, and we pay upon harvest. We are usually left with empty sacks. So we take out loans for food and family expenses, and inputs to be able to plant for the next season. Upon harvest, we have leftover debt,"" says a man in a film produced by the Farmer Scientist Partnership for Development, or Masipag, a network of 630 farmers' groups, scientists and Filipinos. Masipag president Chito Medina says IRRI does not look at sustainability. ""Scientists in IRRI are hi-tech scientists, thus you would expect hi-tech farming as their solutions,"" he adds. ""They are highly specialised but this strength is also their weakness when their specialised knowledge is applied to farming, which is a complex system."" In the real world of farming in developing countries such as the Philippines, he says, decisions are made not just according to seed types but depending on soil types, water availability, the presence of pests, the financial ability to buy inputs and issues such as land ownership. Climate change means farmers need to reduce their exposure to weather-related risk, he says. If they use little capital, when a calamity strikes, even if the crops are damaged, they may get hungry but at least they have no debts. ""High-input modern farming methods expose them to more risk because farmers must borrow money to buy seeds, fertilisers and pesticides. When a calamity strikes they get hungry, but more than that, they are indebted."" Since 1986, Masipag farmers have collected 1,300 traditional rice varieties, about 28% of the original traditional rice varieties before the green revolution. Hundreds now breed rice on their own farms and together have identified 18 drought tolerant rice varieties, 12 flood tolerant, 20 salt water tolerant, and 23 pest and disease resistant rice varieties. They are rejecting chemicals and using alternative growing methods such as the system of rice intensification (SRI), which aims to increase yields by stimulating the roots of plants. It has been found to increase yields by 20-100% in many countries including India, Cambodia and Vietnam. ""The flood-tolerant, drought-tolerant varieties developed by IRRI require a high amount of input of chemical fertiliser and pesticides that are not affordable by the majority of poor farmers. Methods like SRI and organic farming are attractive because they are available and affordable and give a better net income. The yield of organic farms and chemical farms are not significantly different but the net income of our organic farmers is significantly higher than chemical farming in the Philippines,"" he says. Seeds are just one resource, and IRRI is not looking at others, say farmers in Mindanao and Luzon, who are also turning to organic farming. ""We get higher yields, have lower production costs, higher biodiversity and therefore better food supplies with SRI,"" said a farmer at a Met Office event for weather prediction training with Oxfam, last week. Antony Dayson, who farms in Sorsogon in Luzon, said: ""We are adapting by diversifying our crops, selecting varieties that we know are better and returning to traditional varieties. We have been to the old farmers in upland areas who are growing varieties like wagwag, dinorado and wado varieties, which are better suited to wet conditions."" Rene Jaranilla, another farmer from Luzon, said: ""I use only 5-15kg per hectare instead of the whole bag like I used to. It saves seeds and water and it generates employment. More farmers are seeing higher yields; people in my area get 3 tonnes an acre, but I get 6 tonnes by using SRI. Those who are using it are seeing better yields. People think it's something new but when they try it they are convinced."" The two different approaches to farming, of cutting-edge science and low-tech sustainable farming, have produced inevitable tensions and mutual distrust, not helped when last year Filipino farmers, including members of groups linked to Masipag, destroyed a GM trial at IRRI. Each group now throws doubt on the other. ""SRI is a package. When you break it down it has to do with selecting the right sees applying varying levels of nutrients. It's best practice. We hesitate to label it SRI because each farmer has their own approach. Some of the results have been remarkable in small, controlled plots but not on a wide scale. There have been some outlandish claims but a lot are anecdotes,"" says Tolentino. ""IRRI scientists don't like the approach we take. They say demonstrations have failed, but they are embarrassed that they have not done it for themselves,"" says Jaranilla. ""There are so many local varieties of rice developed in Asia by farmers. The scientists at IRRI are simply reinventing them through different methods. It is not the variety that counts under the extremes of climate change, but how farmers can spread the risks by growing different crops. These simply need local knowledge, not hi-tech science."""
"""I think climate change is one of the greatest hoaxes ever perpetrated on man."" So said a colleague at a recent meeting of tech executives I spoke at. It was hardly the first time I've heard such a statement. But what happened next was a first in my 13 years of working in the intersection of business and environment. Another executive, someone in the insurance industry (but not coming from an environmental role), actually mocked the climate denier and laughed in his face. ""Are you kidding?"" he said. ""Something like six of the most expensive insurance years in history happened in the last eight years."" We may be seeing a change in cultural norms in business, where it's less acceptable to espouse dated views on some big topics. Take the issue of gay rights in the US. In Arizona a few weeks ago, governor Jan Brewer vetoed a law that would have allowed a bakery, for example, to refuse to make a cake for a gay wedding. But I doubt Brewer had a moral epiphany. In reality, she felt pressure from a business community that feared real economic consequences if the law passed. A range of companies made their displeasure known publicly and the National Football League made a not-so-veiled threat that it might move the 2015 Super Bowl away from Phoenix. In a separate case, Mozilla's CEO, Brendan Eich, resigned under pressure shortly after it emerged he had donated $1,000 in support of Proposition 8, which would have prevented equal marriage in California.  Is the same kind of attitude shift happening on climate change? In addition to watching the late-night mocking of an ill-informed colleague, I recently had another surprising experience with the top 10 executives from a large consumer products company. I polled them with an admittedly leading question: ""Robert Rubin, the former US treasury secretary, said recently that climate change is 'an existential threat' to our species. On a scale of 1 to 5, do you think that … 5 – Yes, it is an existential threat to humanity.4 – Climate change is a serious challenge, but we can adapt and/or it's not imminent.3 – Climate change may be a problem, but it may be natural variation.2 – There may be mild problems from climate change.1 – It could be a hoax or there is no problem. The anonymous voting actually shocked me. Every executive in this conservative, careful company chose 4 or 5 in anonymous voting. My examples of a business awakening are anecdotal, but there is some quantitative evidence of a priority shift in the works. In the latest World Economic Forum Global Risks survey, which polls CEOs and world leaders, the top 10 risks identified by respondents were in essence variations on a couple of themes: economic uncertainty or climate and resource-related issues (""water crises"", ""failure of climate change mitigation and adaptation"", ""greater incidence of extreme weather events"", and ""food crises""). This dawning realisation of the extent of the climate problem is welcome news. But the real question is whether we're acting on a newfound conviction with the urgency required. If more executives believe this is a ""5"" issue, an existential threat, what does that imply? Let's imagine for a moment a similar scenario in personal health. Let's say that 97 out of 100 doctors tell you that you have an imminently life-threatening level of, say, obesity and diabetes. If asked how serious it was, you might say ""5"", which would demonstrate a conviction that drastic changes in diet and exercise are now the top priority in your life. With a ""4"" vote, you'd be saying that you might consider some tweaks to your lifestyle, but only if it's not too inconvenient or expensive. If you select ""3"", you're saying you're not sure the doctors are right (maybe it's just holiday weight you put on) and you'd adopt a wait-and-see attitude. And a ""1"" or ""2"" shows disdain for both the diagnosis and the doctors and a belief that you can eat whatever the heck you want. The equivalent of a ""5"" vote on climate should be dramatic changes in our energy diet – a decarbonisation of industry and society at 6% per year from now on (as calculated by PwC). The list of what that pace of change would require of business leaders includes the following: dramatically increasing energy efficiency and use of renewable energy, supporting government policies to make the change more economic (a carbon price would be extremely helpful), pushing back on investors obsessed with quarterly results at the expense of investments in longer-term health, and deeper conversations both with suppliers and customers about how to cut impacts. These are some of the elements of a profound shift in ""business as usual"" that I'm calling ""the big pivot"". Very few companies are acting on all these fronts with urgency. It's time for business leaders to get more vocal, come out of the closet of denial and talk openly about climate change as a serious challenge and opportunity. As self-help programmes have taught us, the first step is admitting you have a problem. At least on this front, both anecdotally and by survey, there seems to be real progress.

"I don’t usually expect to be picking my way through seaweed, pebbles and assorted debris from the sea when I stroll along the promenade in Brighton, but after the recent storms this is what I found as beach and pavement merged into one.  Walking along the seafront is one of the pleasures of living in Brighton, the commute to London is not. Both were disrupted in the storms, although nothing like the misery caused to people on the Somerset Levels and fellow commuters using the main rail link between Devon and Cornwall. All along the south coast thousands of seabirds were washed up dead on the shoreline.   We know that these extreme weather events are in line with scientists’ predictions of the impacts of climate change. Now these impacts are being felt on our own doorstep, affecting the everyday things we love and depend on – our homes, our public transport, our coastlines. For a long time organisations concerned about climate change have used the large and looming long-term threats to gain attention on this issue. It has created a good movement for change, but any relevant campaign must move with the times. In 2005 more than 100 faith, environment, development and trade union groups came together in an unprecedented partnership to make a stand on climate, and Stop Climate Chaos was born. Four years later we held The Wave, the biggest climate march this country has ever seen.  But fast forward five years and the world has turned, we have had one of the most serious economic crises in history with huge impacts on people all around the world. The rush to pull ourselves back into growth has meant the concerns of the poorest people and the planet have not been top priority. Meanwhile the experts have learnt more about how our land and seas are responding to climate changes and the scientific consensus has strengthened. We knew that people were concerned about climate change and cared about the things which are all around us but that wasn’t being translated into a strong voice within our society; so we realised we needed to talk to people about why. Some surprising things emerged. Many of the people we need to reach – those who care but haven’t turned that concern into action – are turned off by doom and gloom messages about ice caps and apocalypse. They understand the problem, but aren’t motivated to act. So we tried some different approaches, and the one that really resonated was talking to people about the things they love and cherish and which are threatened by climate change. There are so many things close to home that we take for granted that have an uncertain future because of the changing climate. The most important, of course, is our children. But we have been hearing stories about communities in the world’s poorest countries suffering, bees and butterflies whose habitats are being lost, and even chocolate prices soaring due to loss of plantation land in West Africa.  These, and many more, stories will be told through our campaign and captured on our website. The strength of this partnership is in its extraordinary depth and breadth. When else would we see the Women’s Institute, Oxfam and Cafod standing shoulder to shoulder with the RSPB, WWF and Unison on one issue? So we have changed the name to celebrate this – we will now be known as The Climate Coalition. We have got big plans from online campaigns and lobbying opportunities to large scale events and public engagement aimed at recapturing the political and media spotlight. We know that we need to change tack if we are to keep up the momentum needed to wean us off fossil fuels. As politics and society has changed, our message has also evolved. We will not be sidelined, ignored, placated or put in a convenient political box – the things we love are just too important. • Neil Thorns is chair of The Climate Coalition and director of advocacy and communications at Cafod"
"In February 1935, the year of King George V’s silver jubilee, a chimpanzee at London Zoo called Boo-Boo gave birth to a baby daughter. A couple of months later, a little blonde-haired girl was given a soft-toy replica of the zoo’s new arrival to mark her first birthday. This was Jane Goodall’s first recorded encounter with a chimp. Goodall is 80 today (happy birthday “Dr Jane”). In the intervening years, her research on a community of chimpanzees in Tanzania revolutionised our understanding of these primates, our closest living relatives, and challenged deepset ideas of what it means to be human. She then packed in her fieldwork to become an activist, campaigning tirelessly for a more enlightened attitude towards animals and the environment. Along the way she has received nearly 50 honorary degrees, and became a UN Messenger of Peace in 2002 and Dame Jane in 2004.  Though I have only crossed London to meet her, I am struck by the sudden feeling that I have reached the end of some epic, Henry Stanley-like quest… “Dr Goodall?” As I reach out to shake a slender hand, the words “I presume” pop into my head. I suppress them. I follow her into the front room and she politely offers me tea or coffee. There is a sofa beneath the bay window and next to it – as if only just put aside – a large book. I pick up The Chimpanzees of Gombe: Patterns of behavior, Goodall’s magnum opus published in 1986. I flip through its characterful portraits of the Gombe chimps, many of them – like David Greybeard – now household names. Goodall sits down neatly on the sofa with her back to the bright sun. This is a brief pause in her whirlwind travel schedule of more than 300 days a year, but she displays few signs of weariness – worldly or otherwise. She has just been going through proofs of her updated book Seeds of Hope, the first edition of which was troubled by allegations of plagiarism. I don’t want to broach the subject so early in the interview, so I ask instead about her childhood, which I sense is of great importance to understanding Goodall. Having seen a photograph of that doting little girl clutching Jubilee, her birthday chimp, I love the idea that this fluffy character influenced what Goodall would go on to achieve. On this, however, she sets me straight. When she first ventured to Africa in 1957, Goodall says, it had never occurred to her to work with chimpanzees. Rather, she had a far less specific and more romantic dream inspired by fictional characters from the books she had read as a child, notably Dr Dolittle and Tarzan. “I never wanted to be a scientist per se,” she says. “I wanted to be a naturalist.” Goodall tells a story from her childhood that demonstrates how fixated she was by the Africa of her imagination. As a special treat, her mother, Vanne, had taken her to the cinema to see her first Tarzan film. When the curtains drew back to reveal Johnny Weissmuller in the starring role, however, the young Goodall burst into a fit of hysterical tears. In the quiet of the foyer, she composed herself and told her mother firmly: “That is not Tarzan.” When she describes her earliest experiences of Africa, however, they don’t sound all that different from the jungles of her dreams. Not long after arriving in Kenya, Goodall captured the attention of Louis Leakey, the eminent palaeoanthropologist and curator of the Coryndon Museum in Nairobi. Within hours of meeting, she had so impressed him with her knowledge of natural history that he had offered her a job. Within months, Leakey and his wife, Mary, set out on an expedition to Olduvai Gorge in what is now northern Tanzania, and Goodall went too. The place was teeming with wildlife. “There were lions and rhinos and giraffes – I mean, everything was there,” she recalls with a flash of excitement. “I often think that’s one of the most magical times of my whole life.” It was while scouring this ancient landscape for evidence of early humans and other hominids that Leakey first mentioned the idea of establishing a complementary study on wild chimpanzees to the west, at the Gombe Stream Chimpanzee Reserve on the edge of Lake Tanganyika. Three years later, in 1960, Goodall entered the reserve to begin her research. There had only ever been one concerted attempt to study chimps in the wild – and that scientist “had a trail of 22 porters”, Goodall says with a hint of pride in her voice. For the first few months in Gombe, it was just her, her mother and a single hired assistant. “I wanted to be alone,” she says, “but I wasn’t allowed.” Goodall pauses, revisiting that period in her mind. “I’ll never forget going along the shoreline of Lake Tanganyika, then looking up…” Up there, in the densely forested valleys that funnel streams off steep hills to the water’s edge, were the chimpanzees she had come to study. With the assistance of a game warden who acted as escort, Goodall and her mother put up their ex-army tent. “If you wanted air to come in, you just rolled up the sides and tied them with tape,” she says. “Well, the air came in, but the spiders, scorpions and snakes came in as well.” Although her mother was terrified – “You know I’m afraid of spiders!” – Goodall was apparently fearless, setting off up the slopes to explore her new home. “I sat up there and just couldn’t imagine I was there. It seemed absolutely unreal.” The picture Goodall paints – a folding camp bed beside a palm tree in a forest clearing beneath a bright moon, the sound of baboons barking in the distance, a heroine called Jane – could have come straight from an Edgar Rice Burroughs novel. The only thing that’s missing is Tarzan, but maybe he’s up on the hillside with Cheeta. I wonder if the realisation of so fantastical a childhood dream has helped her stay connected to her youth – but again she sets me straight. Rather it is The Birches, the home near Bournemouth in which she grew up: when not travelling, this is where Goodall still returns, to “all my childhood books, the trees I climbed as a child, the cliffs where I walked… I am blessed in this way.” During her first stint in the field, Goodall struggled to get close to the chimps. However, the individual she named David Greybeard proved a particular inspiration, showing her a side to chimpanzees nobody had ever documented before. In late October 1960, she watched David from a distance as he gnawed away at the freshly killed corpse of what was probably a baby bush pig – an observation that ran counter to the then-widespread assumption that chimps were strict vegetarians. A few days later, Goodall witnessed David making and using a tool to feed on ants. I ask her to describe this moment in detail: “There was vegetation in the way and David had his back to me… so what I saw was the hand picking up the tool. I saw the movements. And I saw it was obvious he was eating…” Once David had moved off, Goodall went to investigate and discovered long stalks of grass lying around. Picking a stalk up, she pushed it into one of the narrow entrance holes to the ant colony. The disturbance caused ants to emerge. The chimps, presumably, would then lick them off the grass. After subsequent, clearer sightings of this behaviour, Goodall went to Leakey with the discovery. “I knew it was very important because I’d been around Leakey long enough,” she says. At that point, most people believed humans were the only species capable of making and using tools. In response to Goodall’s observations of David and others, Leakey famously declared: “Now we must redefine ‘tool’, redefine ‘man’, or accept chimpanzees as humans.” I am suddenly aware that Goodall is watching me, back perfectly upright, hands in her lap. She keeps very still, her soft green eyes studying my face as she waits patiently for my next question. I feel a peculiar, strangely comforting empathy with David Greybeard and the other Gombe chimps. Despite Leakey’s excitement over Goodall’s early findings, not everyone was ready to embrace them. In late 1961, she arrived in Cambridge, where Leakey had used his connections to enrol her for a doctorate – not something Goodall wanted to do. “I was only doing this thesis for Leakey’s sake. I’d never had an ambition to be a scientist and be part of academia.” The patronising treatment Goodall received at the hands of her mainly male colleagues can hardly have endeared her to the academic lifestyle. She was criticised for giving her study-animals names and personalities. “I didn’t give them personalities, I merely described their personalities,” she counters. As for Goodall’s reported discovery that chimps used tools: “Some scientists actually said I must have taught them.” She laughs. “That would have been fabulous if I could have done that.” I try to imagine receiving this kind of dismissive treatment, and suspect I would have been infuriated, then crushed. Not Goodall. She says she simply knew that she was right and her critics were wrong. I ask where this conviction came from and, as an explanation, she returns to her youth. “My mother always taught us that if people don’t agree with you, the important thing is to listen to them. But if you’ve listened to them carefully and you still think that you’re right, then you must have the courage of your convictions.” So when her Cambridge colleagues told her she couldn’t talk about chimps having personality, mind and emotion, she begged to differ – because of Rusty the black mongrel. “Rusty had taught me otherwise. If you spend time with animals, you’re not going to betray them by taking away something which is theirs.” Rusty, I discover, was one of two dogs with whom Goodall became friendly in her early teens at The Birches. The other, Budleigh, was a beautiful long-haired collie belonging to the owner of the local sweetshop. “Collies are meant to be bright but he wasn’t,” Goodall says, recalling how Budleigh proved incapable of learning to shake hands. One day, though, as Goodall continued her efforts to train “Buds”, Rusty the mongrel (watching at a distance) raised his paw. “From that moment I realised Rusty was brilliantly intelligent because, even though I wasn’t teaching him, he’d learned by observing my teaching of Buds.” I am struck by what Goodall did next. The young teenager imagined herself inside Rusty’s mind, she says, in an effort to see the world from his perspective and relive the intellectual feat he’d just performed. There are not many children I know who’d do this, I suggest. She considers for a moment: “Probably not.” If her Cambridge colleagues had been patronising, it was nothing compared to the treatment she received at a symposium on primates held at the Zoological Society of London in April 1962. “I gave my first scientific presentation and was terrified, says Goodall. “I practised for hours,” she says. “I was determined not to read and not to say ‘er’ or ‘um’. I have remained true to that ever since.” After three days of talks, the meeting came to a close with a speech by Sir Solly Zuckerman, an anatomist who had studied monkeys in Africa, and gone on to become secretary of the Society and chief science adviser to the Ministry of Defence. Although Goodall had been well received, Zuckerman took the opportunity to fire a volley of pointed comments at the twentysomething newcomer. “There are those who are here and who prefer anecdote – and what I must confess I regard as sometimes unbounded speculation,” he told his audience, as recounted in Dale Peterson’s biography of Goodall, The Woman Who Redefined Man. “In scientific work it is far safer to base one’s major conclusions and generalisations on a concordant and large body of data than on a few contradictory and isolated observations, the explanation of which sometimes leaves a little to be desired.” At the mention of Zuckerman, Goodall’s features sharpen slightly, and the pace of her speech quickens. She dismisses his monkey work as “rubbish”. It is the only bad word she has to say about anyone, and even then she controls the emotion almost before it has appeared. This was not Goodall’s first run-in with Zuckerman. At the end of 1961, there had been a press conference at London Zoo to announce her preliminary findings – and she had hatched a plan to use this public platform to call for an improvement in the conditions of the captive chimps at the zoo. “There was a bare cage with a cement floor,” she explains. During the summer months, the chimps had no shade: “It got boiling hot and there was only one platform, the other had broken, so the male got that and the female had to sit on the floor. It was horrible.” Before the meeting, over dinner with the diplomat Malcolm MacDonald (who had visited her briefly in Gombe and would become Governor-General of Kenya in 1963), Goodall shared her intention to champion the welfare of the captive chimps: “I was really excited.” But MacDonald, with his experience as a politician, could see a flaw. Speaking out on behalf of the chimps to a packed auditorium would be a direct criticism of Zuckerman’s leadership of the zoo. “Do you think he’s going to allow a little whipper-snapper who doesn’t even have a degree to tell him he’s in the wrong?” Goodall recalls MacDonald telling her. “You’ll make an enemy for life, and you don’t want an enemy like that.” Instead, Goodall suggested several simple changes to the chimps’ enclosure that would improve their welfare, and MacDonald worked behind the scenes to see them implemented. “What I learned then is: don’t let people lose face, don’t try to do something publicly until you’ve tried every which way to do it quietly. I’ve found that so helpful to me,” she says, particularly in places like Africa and China. Naturally, Zuckerman took the credit for the improvements to the chimps’ enclosure. “I don’t mind two hoots as long as it gets done,” Goodall says. A capacity for seeing the bigger picture may go some way to explaining her success as an activist. She pinpoints her transformation to 1986, and a chimpanzee conference organised by the Chicago Academy of Sciences to coincide with the publication of The Chimpanzees of Gombe. By then, she’d spent more than 25 years in the field, completed her PhD, established the Gombe Stream Research Center, got married, raised a son and made further groundbreaking observations on chimpanzee society – including insights into chimp communication, sex, mother–infant bonding, inter-community warfare and cannibalism. But at the age of 52, she walked away from the field and turned to a life on the road. “How ridiculous, really, when you think about it,” she says. “What did I think I could do, trotting around Africa with an exhibit of old pictures blown up, and bits of rock and stick?” Her initial focus – facilitated by the Jane Goodall Institute she’d established almost a decade earlier to support her chimp research at Gombe – was to draw attention to the plight of chimpanzees more generally. In the wild, habitat destruction, the bushmeat trade and animal trafficking all posed significant threats to the species’ future – and they still do. “It is horrendous.” Even now, China is asking African governments for chimpanzees and gorillas for entertainment, Goodall tells me. “We feel our sanctuaries, which cost us so much money, aren’t safe any more.” I find myself being sucked into a vortex of gloom, but Goodall is always ready to offer a reason for hope – a word that crops up time and again in the titles of her many books. One reason is what she calls “the resilience of nature”; by way of illustration, she tells me about land reforms in Tanzania in the 1970s that resulted in widespread deforestation around the Gombe Stream Chimpanzee Reserve. “When I looked down,” she recalls of one visit, “it was so totally shocking to see our little oasis of Gombe… It looked like a dust bowl: completely bare hills, overfarmed, more people living there than the land could support.” Today, however, as a result of the Lake Tanganyika Catchment, Reforestation and Education Project, which her Institute began in 1994, the Gombe chimps now have “three to four times more forest than they had ten years ago. It’s regenerated so quickly. So we have 30-foot-high trees.” I feel better already. More than half a century since she first engineered improvements to the conditions of the chimpanzees at London Zoo, Goodall is still fighting hard on behalf of captive chimps too. In the 1980s, she raised ethical concerns about their use in xenotransplanation, which led the medical community to steer away from this practice. More recently, she has worked with Francis Collins, Director of the National Institutes of Health in the US, to phase out their use of captive chimpanzees in medical research; she is delighted the US Senate voted to increase the budget available for retirement of these chimps. “We are beginning to win,” she says. I ask Goodall if she is in favour of a blanket ban on the use of chimpanzees in medical research. “I can’t quite say that. But what I can say is that, ethically and morally, I feel it’s wrong to use them, and it’s absolutely wrong to put them in five-foot by five-foot cages.” Goodall puts chimps at the forefront of the wider debate about the use of experimental animals. “At one time, the scientists said we’ll always need animals for this – and now we don’t,” she says. “If science really puts its mind to getting alternatives… once they do, they’re cheaper and usually safer.” With our time almost up, I realise I haven’t asked after Mr H, the toy monkey who famously travels with her from one venue to the next. Somehow Goodall the activist doesn’t seem complete without him, and I wonder if he might join us. Mr H stands for Mr Gary Haun, a US marine who lost his eyesight in a helicopter crash at the age of 21, then went on to became a professional magician, climb Mount Kilimanjaro, scuba, sky-dive, and much else besides. “He thought he was giving me a stuffed chimp for my birthday,” Goodall recalls – but the soft toy has a tail, so is clearly a monkey. “Gary,” she told him, as she guided his hand towards the evidence of his mistake, “I know you can’t see it… but you have no excuse.” For the last 20 years, Goodall has kept Mr H close as a reminder of another of her reasons for hope: “The indomitable human spirit… He’s been to at least 60 countries with me, he’s been touched by at least four million people. I say that when you touch him, the inspiration rubs off.” Goodall invites me to touch Mr H – but instead of inspiration, I have a sudden, parental panic that he might one day go missing. “I’ve nearly lost him several times but that’s the original,” she says, stroking him gently. Once, she left him on the top of a telephone kiosk in an airport and had boarded her plane before she realised. “I’ll have to get off the plane,” she explained to the attendant, adding: “You’ll have to bolt me in to keep me because I’ve left my most precious object outside.” Still clutching Mr H, Goodall reaches into her bag and another soft toy peeps out. “This is Cow” – a gift handed to her during a recent visit to the dairyland state of Wisconsin. “I was going to give Cow to the next deserving child,” she explains, but instead she has turned her into “a spokesperson” for abused farm animals. She looks at the toy and then talks about it as if she’s giving it praise. “Cow has worked really hard – she has created I don’t know how many vegetarians, even in places like Argentina where they live on meat.” I am reminded of something I’ve read: how Goodall, as a child, loved to arrange tea parties for her soft toys. I wonder if there are others who would like to join us – but it turns out that Jubilee, her childhood chimpanzee, is in Germany, being fitted for a jumpsuit to hold his failing stitching in place. Goodall herself is flying to Germany in a few hours. “I’m going to Düsseldorf, then Vienna, then back to Munich… It still amazes me. Children write to me and say, ‘You taught me, you did it, I can do it too.’ So this is why I have to go on going around. Because it’s making a difference.” When not on the move, she concentrates on her writing. In her latest book, Seeds of Hope, she and journalist Gail Hudson champion plants. But the first edition, published last year, was troubled by allegations of plagiarism, with the Washington Post identifying “at least a dozen passages borrowed without attribution, or footnotes, from a variety of websites”. Goodall accounts for these lapses by citing her hectic work schedule and her chaotic method of note-taking: “I am not methodical enough, I guess,” she says. “In some cases, you look at my notebooks, there’s no way you can tell whether this is from talking to somebody or whether it was something I read on the internet.” I ask if there was any naivety on her part. “Yes, there must be… I have learned. In the future, I shall be more organised even if I don’t have time,” she says. “I shall certainly make sure I know who said something or what I read or where I read it.” Goodall, though, is adamant that she did not intentionally try to pass off anyone else’s words as her own. “I don’t think anybody who knows me would accuse me of deliberate plagiarism.” In a revised edition of Seeds of Hope, to be published this month, Goodall and Hudson have made minor changes to the text to address their critics and added a lengthy notes section. “I don’t think a book has ever been more researched than this one. The notes at the end are about as long as the book.” I ask if she’s concerned that attention will focus on what she’s changed, rather than on the subject matter. “Looking back, it has been a godsend,” she says. “I am really happy for the sake of the plants that we’ve got it right now. I feel this is a book we can really be proud of now.” And then she adds, “Honestly, Henry, who is going to deliberately go out to give me a bad time?” Before I go, Goodall wants to show me some drawings she made as a child. They are reproduced in Me… Jane, a children’s book by Patrick McDonnell. She finds a copy amid piles of books by or about her, and flips to the relevant page. There, across a double spread, are several meticulous sketches of animals. The wing of a pterodactyl above the wing of an eagle; profiles of a cat, horse, crocodile, dog, chimpanzee and human – all to scale with their brains neatly coloured in pink pencil. “They are not very good,” she says. I have spent the last two hours in the polite, inspiring company of a woman precisely twice my age. But as she shows me her drawings, I get the feeling I am talking to the 12-year-old Goodall. Finally, when I hold out my hand for her to shake, she spurns it and offers me something far more rewarding: a chimpanzee embrace. Her delicate arms envelop me, slowly, widely, deliberately. There is something categorically different about this hug; something that will stay with me for ever. “Chimpanzees don’t say goodbye,” she says. I walk to the door, trying to fathom what to make of this. I turn and call out another farewell, but Goodall doesn’t reply. She has turned away from me and doesn’t look back."
"This is a story about bad timing. One of the most disturbing ways that climate change is already playing out is through what ecologists call ""mismatch"" or ""mistiming."" This is the process whereby warming causes animals to fall out of step with a critical food source, particularly at breeding times, when a failure to find enough food can lead to rapid population losses.  The migration patterns of many songbird species, for instance, have evolved over millennia so that eggs hatch precisely when food sources such as caterpillars are at their most abundant, providing parents with ample nourishment for their hungry young. But because spring now often arrives early, the caterpillars are hatching earlier too, which means that in some areas they are less plentiful when the chicks hatch, with a number of possible long-term impacts on survival. Similarly, in West Greenland, caribou are arriving at their calving grounds only to find themselves out of sync with the forage plants they have relied on for thousands of years, now growing earlier thanks to rising temperatures. That is leaving female caribou with less energy for lactation, reproduction and feeding their young, a mismatch that has been linked to sharp decreases in calf births and survival rates.  Scientists are studying cases of climate-related mistiming among dozens of species, from Arctic terns to pied flycatchers. But there is one important species they are missing – us. Homo sapiens. We too are suffering from a terrible case of climate-related mistiming, albeit in a cultural-historical, rather than a biological, sense. Our problem is that the climate crisis hatched in our laps at a moment in history when political and social conditions were uniquely hostile to a problem of this nature and magnitude – that moment being the tail end of the go-go 80s, the blast-off point for the crusade to spread deregulated capitalism around the world. Climate change is a collective problem demanding collective action the likes of which humanity has never actually accomplished. Yet it entered mainstream consciousness in the midst of an ideological war being waged on the very idea of the collective sphere. This deeply unfortunate mistiming has created all sorts of barriers to our ability to respond effectively to this crisis. It has meant that corporate power was ascendant at the very moment when we needed to exert unprecedented controls over corporate behaviour in order to protect life on Earth. It has meant that regulation was a dirty word just when we needed those powers most. It has meant that we are ruled by a class of politicians who know only how to dismantle and starve public institutions just when they most need to be fortified and reimagined. And it has meant that we are saddled with an apparatus of ""free trade"" deals that tie the hands of policymakers just when they need maximum flexibility to achieve a massive energy transition. Confronting these various structural barriers to the next economy is the critical work of any serious climate movement. But it's not the only task at hand. We also have to confront how the mismatch between climate change and market domination has created barriers within our very selves, making it harder to look at this most pressing of humanitarian crises with anything more than furtive, terrified glances. Because of the way our daily lives have been altered by both market and technological triumphalism, we lack many of the observational tools necessary to convince ourselves that climate change is real – let alone the confidence to believe that a different way of living is possible. And little wonder: just when we needed to gather, our public sphere was disintegrating; just when we needed to consume less, consumerism took over virtually every aspect of our lives; just when we needed to slow down and notice, we sped up; and just when we needed longer time horizons, we were able to see only the immediate present. This is our climate change mismatch, and it affects not just our species but potentially every other species on the planet as well. The good news is that, unlike reindeer and songbirds, we humans are blessed with the capacity for advanced reasoning and therefore the ability to adapt more deliberately – to change old patterns of behaviour with remarkable speed. If the ideas that rule our culture are stopping us from saving ourselves, then it is within our power to change those ideas. But before that can happen, we first need to understand the nature of our personal climate mismatch. Climate change demands that we consume less, but being consumers is all we know. Climate change is not a problem that can be solved simply by changing what we buy – a hybrid instead of an SUV, some carbon offsets when we get on a plane. At its core, it is a crisis born of overconsumption by the comparatively wealthy, which means the world's most manic consumers are going to have to consume less. The problem is not ""human nature,"" as we are so often told. We weren't born having to shop this much, and we have, in our recent past, been just as happy (in many cases happier) consuming far less. The problem is the inflated role that consumption has come to play in our particular era. Late capitalism teaches us to create ourselves through our consumer choices: shopping is how we form our identities, find community and express ourselves. Thus, telling people that they can't shop as much as they want to because the planet's support systems are overburdened can be understood as a kind of attack, akin to telling them that they cannot truly be themselves. This is likely why, of the original ""three Rs"" – reduce, reuse, recycle – only the third has ever gotten any traction, since it allows us to keep on shopping as long as we put the refuse in the right box. The other two, which require that we consume less, were pretty much dead on arrival. Climate change is slow, and we are fast. When you are racing through a rural landscape on a bullet train, it looks as if everything you are passing is standing still: people, tractors, cars on country roads. They aren't, of course. They are moving, but at a speed so slow compared with the train that they appear static. So it is with climate change. Our culture, powered by fossil fuels, is that bullet train, hurtling forward toward the next quarterly report, the next election cycle, the next bit of diversion or piece of personal validation via our smartphones and tablets. Our changing climate is like the landscape out the window: from our racy vantage point it can appear static, but it is moving, its slow progress measured in receding ice sheets, swelling waters and incremental temperature rises. If left unchecked, climate change will most certainly speed up enough to capture our fractured attention – island nations wiped off the map, and city-drowning superstorms, tend to do that. But by then, it may be too late for our actions to make a difference, because the era of tipping points will likely have begun. Climate change is place-based, and we are everywhere at once. The problem is not just that we are moving too quickly. It is also that the terrain on which the changes are taking place is intensely local: an early blooming of a particular flower, an unusually thin layer of ice on a lake, the late arrival of a migratory bird. Noticing those kinds of subtle changes requires an intimate connection to a specific ecosystem. That kind of communion happens only when we know a place deeply, not just as scenery but also as sustenance, and when local knowledge is passed on with a sense of sacred trust from one generation to the next. But that is increasingly rare in the urbanised, industrialised world. We tend to abandon our homes lightly – for a new job, a new school, a new love. And as we do so, we are severed from whatever knowledge of place we managed to accumulate at the previous stop, as well as from the knowledge amassed by our ancestors (who, at least in my case, migrated repeatedly themselves). Even for those of us who manage to stay put, our daily existence can be disconnected from the physical places where we live. Shielded from the elements as we are in our climate-controlled homes, workplaces and cars, the changes unfolding in the natural world easily pass us by. We might have no idea that a historic drought is destroying the crops on the farms that surround our urban homes, since the supermarkets still display miniature mountains of imported produce, with more coming in by truck all day. It takes something huge – like a hurricane that passes all previous high-water marks, or a flood destroying thousands of homes – for us to notice that something is truly amiss. And even then we have trouble holding on to that knowledge for long, since we are quickly ushered along to the next crisis before these truths have a chance to sink in. Climate change, meanwhile, is busily adding to the ranks of the rootless every day, as natural disasters, failed crops, starving livestock and climate-fuelled ethnic conflicts force yet more people to leave their ancestral homes. And with every human migration, more crucial connections to specific places are lost, leaving yet fewer people to listen closely to the land. Climate pollutants are invisible, and we have stopped believing in what we cannot see. When BP's Macondo well ruptured in 2010, releasing torrents of oil into the Gulf of Mexico, one of the things we heard from company chief executive Tony Hayward was that ""the Gulf of Mexico is a very big ocean. The amount of volume of oil and dispersant we are putting into it is tiny in relation to the total water volume."" The statement was widely ridiculed at the time, and rightly so, but Hayward was merely voicing one of our culture's most cherished beliefs: that what we can't see won't hurt us and, indeed, barely exists. So much of our economy relies on the assumption that there is always an ""away"" into which we can throw our waste. There's the away where our garbage goes when it is taken from the curb, and the away where our waste goes when it is flushed down the drain. There's the away where the minerals and metals that make up our goods are extracted, and the away where those raw materials are turned into finished products. But the lesson of the BP spill, in the words of ecological theorist Timothy Morton, is that ours is ""a world in which there is no 'away.'""  When I published No Logo a decade and a half ago, readers were shocked to learn of the abusive conditions under which their clothing and gadgets were manufactured. But we have since learned to live with it – not to condone it, exactly, but to be in a state of constant forgetfulness. Ours is an economy of ghosts, of deliberate blindness. Air is the ultimate unseen, and the greenhouse gases that warm it are our most elusive ghosts. Philosopher David Abram points out that for most of human history, it was precisely this unseen quality that gave the air its power and commanded our respect. ""Called Sila, the wind-mind of the world, by the Inuit; Nilch'i, or Holy Wind, by the Navajo; Ruach, or rushing-spirit, by the ancient Hebrews,"" the atmosphere was ""the most mysterious and sacred dimension of life."" But in our time ""we rarely acknowledge the atmosphere as it swirls between two persons."" Having forgotten the air, Abram writes, we have made it our sewer, ""the perfect dump site for the unwanted byproducts of our industries … Even the most opaque, acrid smoke billowing out of the pipes will dissipate and disperse, always and ultimately dissolving into the invisible. It's gone. Out of sight, out of mind."" Another part of what makes climate change so very difficult for us to grasp is that ours is a culture of the perpetual present, one that deliberately severs itself from the past that created us as well as the future we are shaping with our actions. Climate change is about how what we did generations in the past will inescapably affect not just the present, but generations in the future. These timeframes are a language that has become foreign to most of us. This is not about passing individual judgment, nor about berating ourselves for our shallowness or rootlessness. Rather, it is about recognising that we are products of an industrial project, one intimately and historically linked to fossil fuels.  And just as we have changed before, we can change again. After listening to the great farmer-poet Wendell Berry deliver a lecture on how we each have a duty to love our ""homeplace"" more than any other, I asked him if he had any advice for rootless people like me and my friends, who live in our computers and always seem to be shopping from home. ""Stop somewhere,"" he replied. ""And begin the thousand-year-long process of knowing that place."" That's good advice on lots of levels. Because in order to win this fight of our lives, we all need a place to stand. • This column first appeared in The Nation.

"Never accuse science of neglecting the smallest and apparently least significant detail in its efforts to understand fully how the Earth and all that's in it keeps going.One of the latest arcane revelations comes from scientists in Switzerland, who describe in the Public Library of Science journal PLOS One why we should not heap blame on camels for adding to the methane already in the atmosphere.Camels – and their camelid relatives, llamas, guanacos, alpacas, vicuñas, dromedaries and Bactrian camels – do produce methane, which is more than 20 times as potent a greenhouse gas as carbon dioxide. But they produce significantly less of it than ruminants like cattle, sheep and goats.When they are digesting their food, ruminants emit large quantities of methane, around 20% of global methane emissions. So far the assumption has been that camels, with their similar digestive systems, produce the same amount of the gas.But now researchers at the University of Zurich and ETH Zurich have shown that camels release less methane than ruminants.Ruminants and camelids are similar but not identical. Both groups have stomachs with several chambers, enabling them to regurgitate food from one chamber in order to reduce it in size by renewed chewing. That is why people had assumed till now that camelids and ruminants produce similar amounts of methane. But the researchers have concluded that in absolute terms camels release less methane than cows and sheep of comparable body size.It is slightly more complicated than that: if you compare methane production with the amount of what the team calls ""converted feed"", then methane releases are the same in both groups. But the amount of converted feed is what matters.The research may be less esoteric than it at first appears. Working with Zurich zoo and private camel keepers, the researchers measured methane production in three types of camelids. They found that all three had a lower metabolism than ruminants – because they eat less.One of the report's authors, Dr Marcus Clauss, a veterinary surgeon from the Vetsuisse Faculty of the University of Zurich, said: ""For each unit of digested food, ruminants and camelids produce the same amount of methane. But camels generally have a lower metabolism and hence eat less than domestic ruminants. So the total amount of digested fibre per day is lower in camelids, hence the total amount of methane produced is also lower.""The authors say the camelids' lower metabolism may be important for countries with lots of camels, like the dromedaries of the Middle East and Australia, or the alpacas and llamas of South America. But they do not advocate a switch from beef and lamb to camel meat.Dr Clauss says: ""Personally, I do not think this has relevance to agricultural systems, because there are many other things to consider. For example, I am sure you could not produce the same amount of meat in the same time from a camel as you can from a steer."" "
"December 2009 was supposed to be the turning of the tide, when humans collectively liberated the future from the carbon scourge. But at the United Nations climate change conference  in Copenhagen collaboration ran hard against the reality of global politics. The meeting ended in disorder, despondency and an accord that tacitly admitted the world could not work in cooperation.  Developing countries sharply felt the pain of the missed opportunity. The developed world had promised them billions of dollars in support while simultaneously removing the means to fulfil the pledge. They left Copenhagen calling the pseudo-deal a ""suicide pact"". The question had been: could the world agree on meaningful, binding reductions in emissions to avoid dangerous climate change? Preceding the final day of negotiations, US president Barack Obama said: ""While the reality of climate change is not in doubt … I think our ability to take collective action is."" Leading into the conference, expectations had been raised to extraordinary heights. A global advertising campaign run by the UN called for a treaty under the strapline 'Hopenhagen'. Writing during the meeting, the Guardian's George Monbiot said the 15th conference of parties was ""the moment at which we turn and face ourselves. Here ... humankind decides what it is and what it will become."" But soon reality hit home. The US was intransigent on legally binding emissions reductions. China refused to accept international verification of its own efforts. Many countries, gripped by financial crisis and austerity, offered less than expected. On the final evening of the conference, after 12 days of inconclusive negotiations, Obama joined heads of major developing countries and in three hours in a closed room the leaders knocked out a draft document that would become known as the Copenhagen accord. It included commitments to keep global temperature rises below 2C and to raise $100bn (£60bn) per year by 2020 to help developing countries cut emissions. But nothing on emissions reduction targets. The plenary neither accepted nor rejected the accord, simply 'noting' it – the UN version of diplomatic purgatory. Many viewed the non-agreement in Copenhagen as the death rattle of climate change collaboration and climate justice. Lumumba Di-Aping, head of the G77 group of 130 poorest nations called it ""a suicide pact, an incineration pact in order to maintain the economic dominance of a few countries."" Meena Raman who represented Third World Network at the conference says: ""It was absolutely disastrous. It caused a decade of non-negotiations."" Michele de Nevers, was attached to the World Bank delegation. She says the lack of an overarching agreement made setting a carbon price impossible. ""Whether it was a high price or a low price didn't matter as much as the fact that there would be an agreement on what the reduction of emissions was going to be … which would make all of these carbon markets for climate finance kick in functionally."" De Nevers says the $100bn per year pledged for developing countries would have been ""very easy to reach"" had the world had a functioning carbon market. Instead the onus for fundraising has fallen on nation states. So far, the total pledged stands at $37.5bn, almost half of which comes from Japan. Yvo de Boer  who was the UN climate chief during the conference, says Copenhagen needed to be seen as a reality check for the climate change process. ""Paradoxically, one of the most significant outcomes of Copenhagen has been that it has lead us to fundamentally rethink what we actually need an international agreement for … I think Copenhagen severely damaged people's belief in multilateral negotiations as a way of achieving results."" Two months before the conference, de Boer told the FT that Copenhagen was not going to deliver a new treaty. Copenhagen's problem was the ""wildly differing expectations"" people had for the meeting, says de Boer. A mistake he sees being repeated in the lead up to the already much-hyped Cop 21 in Paris in 2015. He says the world must quickly define a ""common sense of purpose"" for Paris, or hazard failure a second time. De Boer suggests four clear goals for the Paris summit that could be agreed to without the need to create a binding international agreement: • All countries should commit to a contribution, as opposed to a target. • All countries should commit to translate that contribution into national law as it is carries more weight than international law. • There should be a provision to review commitments or contributions every few years to take stock if we're still on track for the two degrees goal and adjust as necessary. • Finally, there needs to be a mechanism created to make clear the financial needs of developing countries and also agree on how those financial needs are going to be met. As campaigners anticipate the specific outcomes of Cop 21, it remains to be seen whether the conference will step out of the shadow of Copenhagen and revive trust in multilateral negotiations as a way of achieving progress.

"For perhaps the first time, someone has tried to qualify the resilience of cities. Grosvenor, the London-based property company led by the Duke of Westminster, analysed more than 100 independently verified data sets in order to determine two key elements of what makes a city resilient: its ""vulnerability"" on the one hand, and its ""adaptive capacity"" on the other. Vulnerability was measured by looking at climate threats, environmental degradation (including pollution and overconsumption due to sprawl), resources (particularly access to energy), infrastructure and community cohesion. Weakness in any of those areas reduced a city's score.  Adaptive capacity, or a city's ability to prevent and mitigate serious threats, was a combination of governance (high value here on democracy, freedom of speech, community participation, transparency, accountability and long-term leadership vision), strong institutions, learning capacity (including good technical universities), disaster planner and finally funding (from budget to credit and access to global funding). Rob Ford and ice storms notwithstanding, Toronto tops the list, following by Vancouver and Calgary and closely trailed by several US cities. London is 18th, suffering as Grosvenor pointed out from social tensions due to lack of affordable housing. Eight of the weakest 20 cities are in the Bric countries of Brazil, Russia, India and China, where blistering economic growth has not yet led to long-term resilience. One particularly disturbing trend is that some of the least resilient cities on the list are also the ones where the population is expected to grow fastest.

"Unilever, Shell, BT, and EDF Energy are among 70 leading companies today calling on governments across the globe to step up efforts to tackle climate change. The companies, which have a combined turnover of $90bn, say the world needs a ""rapid and focused response"" to the threat of rising global carbon emissions and the ""disruptive climate impacts"" associated with their growth.  In a communiqué coordinated by The Prince of Wales's Corporate Leaders Group, the signatories demand governments put in place policies to prevent the cumulative emission of more than a trillion tonnes of carbon, arguing that passing that threshold would lead to unacceptable levels of climate-related risk. The statement urges political leaders to set a timeline for achieving net zero emissions before the end of the century, design a credible strategy to transform the energy system, and create a plan to tackle the global economy's reliance on fossil fuels, especially unabated coal power. The intervention follows the publication of a renewed warning from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) that the world is on track for dangerous levels of warming and needs to urgently strengthen efforts to cut greenhouse gas emissions and enhance climate resilience measures.  The report is to be followed by a further update from the IPCC, which will explore the actions and technologies needed to cut emissions and mitigate climate change. Niall Dunne, chief sustainability officer at BT, said the communiqué highlighted the wide-ranging corporate support that exists for ambitious action to tackle climate change risks.  ""We need to get beyond the concept that progressive climate change policy is bad for business: it can be a huge driver of innovation and create opportunities for growth and prosperity,"" he said. ""Conversely, there isn't an organisation I know of which isn't already being impacted by climate change at some level. ""Collective responsibility across governments, business and civic society is vital to ensure the world is on track for net zero emissions before the end of the century."""
"If you are embarking on a long and essential journey, it really pays to book early. That is the key message from Sunday's landmark UN report that sets out the route to averting catastrophic climate change. By starting right now to end the era of dirty fossil fuels and create a new world of clean energy, not only do you ensure you arrive at your destination – a safer world – but you also get the cheapest ticket. The report's message was as clear as a travel agent's advertisement: buy now or pay a premium later.  The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change's chair, Rajendra Pachauri, drew on his early years as a railway engineer to drive the point home: “The high speed [carbon-cutting] train will leave very soon and all of the global community will have to be on board.” But his IPCC colleague, Youba Sokona, a scientist from Mali and one of the trio who led the new report, was clear about the limits of the new plan: “We are the mapmakers: the [powerful] are the navigators.” He said the report is “telling truth to power”: the question now is whether the powerful want to listen.  The IPCC report sets out multiple possible routes. Some, based on renewable energy and cutting energy waste, are low-risk and comfortable, rather like a fast electric train. Other more circuitous routes, such as delaying action and then being forced to suck carbon out of the air later, look more like a four-wheeled drive over a mountain range. The IPCC has put a definitive map on the table and shown that the price of climate action is affordable. But the hardest choices remain in the hands of the powerful: which route to take and, even more difficult, who pays for the ticket. The statements deleted from the final report summary, which is aimed directly at policymakers, reveal the political battles ahead. All mentions of transferring hundreds of billions of dollars a year from rich to poor nations to pay for going green were excised. Even the simple statement that 70% of all emissions come from just 10 big nations – think China and the US – was deemed too much like naming and shaming.  Nonetheless, many stark messages remain: all dirty fossil fuel use will have to end in the coming decades; huge stocks of coal, oil and gas will have to remain in the ground; countries and companies relying on fossil fuels may suffer big financial losses.  Choosing the route away from civilisation's looming climate car crash now falls to the world's leaders, with a deadline of December 2015 in Paris for a global deal. But they can no longer claim they don't know the way or can't afford the fare. As US secretary of state John Kerry put it on Sunday: “This report makes very clear we face an issue of global willpower, not capacity.”"

"What will waste look like in the future and how well equipped are we to minimise its environmental impact? According to the World Bank report What a waste, cities across the world currently generate roughly 1.3 billion tonnes of solid waste per year. By 2025 we can expect this to have increased to 2.2 billion tonnes.  Population growth, urbanisation and changing consumption patterns have all contributed to the increasing challenge of waste management in cities around the world. New markets are being created, products are becoming more diverse, and they are being consumed – and disposed of – in greater volumes. So in the future we can predict waste to be more complex, and there to be a lot more of it. This has important environmental implications. If present waste management trends are maintained, the food waste we place in landfills is likely to increase methane output from 34 million to 48 million tonnes. And the issue is not restricted purely to the problem of organic matter. Dealing with electronic, chemical and industrial waste will increasingly need to be integrated into management systems. For low income countries, this holds particular challanges. With higher rates of urbanisation putting pressure on existing infrastructure, they will be faced not only with a larger volume of waste production but managing it will be up to five times more expensive. Could a potential waste management crisis actually be an opportunity to innovate in disguise? How can different actors work in partnership to find low-cost, environmentally friendly solutions? And in what type of waste management technologies and programmes is funding most effectively placed? Join us on Thursday 1 May from 1-3pm BST to discuss these issues with our expert panel.

"The global humanitarian aid system is being ""stretched to breaking point"" by climate change, war, population growth and extremism, and must be overhauled to ensure that more is done to prepare for disasters rather than merely relieve them, the British government will warn on Friday. In a speech to the World Bank spring meetings in Washington, the international development secretary, Justine Greening, will argue that the international community must ""up our game"" in the face of such crises as last year's typhoon in the Philippines and the conflicts in Syria, Central African Republic and South Sudan.  ""There is a growing danger that while some countries are graduating from aid, the most fragile and vulnerable countries will be left far behind,"" she will say. ""The humanitarian system is already stretched to breaking point. The reality is that we are facing ever more demands on the system, as we deal with the effects of a changing climate, growing population, conflict and extremism."" Greening, who will also announce a £60m package to improve international disaster preparedness, will suggest five areas in which the international community can work to ease the burdens on emergency assistance providers. As well as encouraging governments to support local civil society organisations, target aid more effectively by listening closely to its recipients, embrace technological breakthroughs and use long-term development strategies to minimise the effects of humanitarian disasters in areas of extreme poverty, she will stress the benefits of preparedness and resilience. Greening is expected to point out that less than 5% of all humanitarian funding – or less than 1% of foreign aid – was spent on emergency prevention in 2009. Under the newly announced initiatives, the British government will spend £40m on the creation of a Disasters and Emergencies Preparedness Programme and a further £20m on a new Unicef/Word Food Programme (WFP) fund to assist their disaster planning in 11 high risk areas. The Disasters and Emergencies Preparedness Programme is intended to provide expert training, simulation drills and monitoring systems to countries – such as Sudan, Ethiopia, Nepal, Bangladesh and Nepal – that are particularly vulnerable to natural disasters. It will also fund innovative technology projects that can monitor and track disasters and provide more detailed risk analysis in disaster-prone regions. The new Unicef/WFP fund is designed to help the two agencies improve their planning in 11 high-risk areas – Afghanistan, Burma, Nigeria, Pakistan, the Philippines, Chad, Madagascar, Central America, Central Asia, African Great Lakes and the Syria region – where 17 million people are at risk of disaster. The announcement of the new package from the Department for International Development comes three years after an independent review by the former Liberal Democrat leader Lord Ashdown warned that the department's influence within the international humanitarian system had waned because it had become too ""shrill and inconsistent"". The review, which examined Britain's response to humanitarian disasters and emergencies, urged DfID to adopt a new approach, recommending: ""DfID's influence in bringing about much-needed change and reforms will be increased if it spends more time building alliances, and less time acting alone."" Last month, the International Medical Corps UK and the European Commission launched a joint campaign to highlight the humanitarian and economic benefits of investing in local first responders. ""International relief workers are indispensable for saving lives but the vital importance of local first responders should not be overlooked,"" said the corps. ""Training and preparing these local first responders is central to building the resilience of local communities to future disasters. Every dollar invested in preparedness saves up to seven in disaster recovery, and countless lives are being saved or improved."""
"Archbishop Desmond Tutu has called for an anti-apartheid-style boycott and disinvestment campaign against the fossil fuel industry for driving global warming, just days ahead of a landmark UN report on how carbon emissions can be slashed. In an article for the Guardian, the archbishop writes: ""We live in a world dominated by greed. We have allowed the interests of capital to outweigh the interests of human beings and our Earth. It is clear [the companies] are not simply going to give up; they stand to make too much money.""  Tutu, one of the most revered figures of South Africa's anti-apartheid struggle and a key backer of the economic and moral campaigns that helped end the system, says: ""People of conscience need to break their ties with corporations financing the injustice of climate change. We can, for instance, boycott events, sports teams and media programming sponsored by fossil-fuel energy companies."" The Nobel peace prize winner also called for investors to dump their fossil fuel stocks: ""It makes no sense to invest in companies that undermine our future. Already some colleges and pension funds have declared that they want their investments congruent with their beliefs."" The archbishop's intervention, just before the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change report, due out on Sunday, is the strongest yet in a rapidly growing global campaign against oil, gas and coal firms that is uniting anti-global warming activists with financial institutions who want to avoid a trillion-dollar crash in fossil fuel stocks. A leaked draft of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change report states that, to avoid dangerous levels of warming, investment in fossil fuels must start falling by tens of billions a year. The draft says emissions of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gasses grew nearly twice as fast over the last decade as in the previous 30 years. Emissions grew 2.2% a year on average from 2000-2010, compared to 1.3% a year over the period from 1970-2010. In 2010-2011, global emissions from burning fossil fuels grew 3%. The good news, says Tutu, is that a divestment campaign has begun, started 18 months ago in the US. And it has grown faster than campaigns that targeted apartheid, tobacco and arms manufacturers, according to Oxford University research. The research has shown that past divestment campaigns succeeded by stigmatising their targets – using ""moral pressure"" according to Tutu – and exerting financial pressure. In the UK campaigners are targeting the £5bn of fossil fuels stocks owned by UK universities and, last month, the country's top doctors called for urgent divestment. ""Those who profess to care for the health of people perhaps have the greatest responsibility to act,"" wrote Sabaratnam Arulkumaran, president of the British Medical Association, and Fiona Godlee, editor in chief of the British Medical Journal. ""Firstly, we should push our own organisations – universities, hospitals, primary care providers, drug and device companies – to divest from fossil fuel industries completely and as quickly as possible and reinvest in renewable energy sources."" Tim Ratcliffe, European divestment coordinator for the campaign group 350.org, said: ""It was a turning point when physicians spoke out against investments in the tobacco industry. This should serve as a wake-up call to investors to pull their money out of high-carbon assets."" Fossil fuel firms are also facing escalating pressure from investors, with some large pension funds having already divested. The world's biggest sovereign wealth fund, itself built on oil and gas revenues, is now formally considering dumping its fossil fuel stocks. The Norwegian finance ministry, which manages the $850bn fund, said: ""An expert group will evaluate whether the exclusion of coal and petroleum companies is a more effective strategy for addressing climate issues and promoting future change than the exercise of ownership and exertion of influence."" Other investors, including the Ceres coalition which manages $3tn collectively, have demanded fossil fuel companies confront openly the risk of a ""carbon bubble"", by either diverting their investment to clean energy or giving the money back to shareholders. The bubble risk exists because only a third of the reserves currently on the books of fossil fuel companies can be burned if the world is to have a good chance of restricting climate change to 2C, a goal to which the world's governments are already committed. If global action is taken to slash carbon emissions those reserves become worthless, or ""stranded assets"". However, fossil fuel firms still spend huge sums – about $650bn in 2013 – exploring for new oil, gas and coal to add to the stockpile, despite declining profits. Citi bank, HSBC, Deutsche Bank and Goldman Sachs, as well as ratings agencies Standard and Poor's and Moodys, are among the big financial players who have already warned investors of the carbon bubble risk. The leaked IPCC draft, seen by the Guardian, says this trend of rising investment in fossil fuel extraction and power plants needs to switch into reverse, falling by $30bn a year until 2030, if carbon emissions are to be cut sufficiently to have a good chance of limiting climate change to 2C. At the same time investment in low-carbon electricity supplies, such as renewables and nuclear, will have to rise by $147bn a year, while investment in energy efficiency in transport, buildings and industry will have to increase by several hundreds of billions of dollars a year. The IPCC report also warns that cutting carbon emissions may devalue fossil fuel assets, especially coal. Stocks in most companies mining for coal, the dirtiest fuel of all, have already plunged steeply since 2012. China, the biggest importer of coal, is taking action to curb its use in the face of appalling air pollution, and new research concludes that two in every five coal-fired power stations could become stranded assets in next 40 years. In the US, five coal mining companies, equal to $4bn in assets, have filed for bankruptcy since 2007, while from 2011-2013 coal stocks in the US fell 60%. However, the shale gas boom in the US has been a significant factor in making coal uneconomic. The world's biggest oil company, ExxonMobil, was forced last month to publish a report explaining how it was going to adapt its business to a world in which emissions were limited. But while the shareholders that demanded the move welcomed the new transparency, ExxonMobil concluded it was ""highly unlikely"" that global governments would cut carbon sufficiently to keep climate change under the internationally agreed 2C limit. ""Investors now know that ExxonMobil is not considering a low-carbon scenario in its planning, which places shareowner capital at risk,"" said Natasha Lamb, director of equity research and shareholder engagement at Arjuna Capital, which helped force the disclosure. ""We want to engage the companies head-on so there is not a calamity, as we got with the tech bubble, the financial services bubble and the housing bubble. But if Big Oil can't redirect capital to low-carbon energy alternatives, investors will [by divesting]."" BP, Shell and Total are all discussing the carbon bubble risk publicly to some extent but Chevron has refused to do. ""We have now called the bluff of the oil companies to indicate what carbon trajectory they are betting on,"" said James Leaton, research director at the analysts Carbon Tracker, which has pioneered the financial analysis of the carbon bubble. ""Now it is up to the investors to act on that."" Carbon Tracker research suggests carbon capture and storage – which would clean up fossil fuel burning by burying its emissions – will be able to deal with just 4% of total global reserves. ""There is a momentum gathering,"" Leaton said. ""Whether it is investors in Australia or Norway, people have seen there is less upside to coal and the amount of capital expenditure going into coal seems to have peaked. We're really pleased that there is now a recognition that doing nothing and hoping it will be all right is not an option."""
"It is not often that big business comes to Washington to seek regulation. But a group of companies including IKEA, Jones Lang LaSalle, Mars, Sprint, and VF Corp did so this week, asking Congress to take steps to prevent catastrophic climate change. Executives organized by the business coalition BICEP (Business for Innovative Climate and Energy Policy), testified before a Senate and House task force on climate change, telling lawmakers about their own corporate commitments to reduce carbon pollution. Then they fanned out across the Capitol to lobby on behalf of a clean-energy financing bill.  They did so on the first anniversary of the release of the Climate Declaration, a corporate call-to-action that has been signed by more than 750 companies. It was a reminder to legislators that the US Chamber of Commerce, the coal industry and the Wall Street Journal editorial page do not speak for all of corporate America when they oppose government action to regulate carbon pollution. ""Business is not a monolith,"" said Anne Kelley, who coordinates BICEP's lobbying efforts. ""That's been the message of BICEP since the beginning."" But if BICEP has shown that hundreds of companies favor political action on climate, its efforts so far have been drowned out in Washington by those of the US Chamber and its allies, a US Senator told the group. Senator Sheldon Whitehouse, a Rhode Island Democrat and a strong advocate of climate action who convened the hearing, said BICEP's voice is ""a murmur and not a message"", and he urged companies to spend more of their political and reputational capital on the climate issue.  ""You've got to take the next step, and say, 'our lobbyist in Washington is going to add this issue to the agenda'"", Whitehouse said.  He called on big, brand-name companies that are ordinarily fierce competitors – Coca-Cola and PepsiCo, Fedex and UPS, Target and Walmart – to unite around the climate issue. ""I'd love to see the CEOs of Coke and Pepsi on a screen saying that we compete like crazy with one another, but one thing that we all agree on is that climate change is real,"" Whitehouse said. That's unlikely to happen anytime soon. Even those companies that have joined BICEP and back climate regulation admit that the issue has yet to rise to the top of their Washington priority list. While climate change is a pivotal issue for coal companies and the utility industry, it is not front and center for most firms. ""It's not realistic for me to say this is going to be part of our core agenda,"" Amy Hargroves, director of corporate responsibility and sustainability for Sprint, told me after the hearing. Sprint understandably pays more attention to telecommunications issues or antitrust policy. Jim Hanna, director of environmental affairs at Starbucks, said many companies don't align their government relations work with their sustainability efforts. Sprint and Starbucks have both signed the Climate Declaration, joining such companies as eBay, Gap, GM, Intel, Microsoft, Nestle and Unilever. But the declaration is an anodyne call for a ""coordinated effort to combat climate change"", without specifying what that effort will entail. An insider described it to me as ""a gateway drug"", designed to start a conversation that will progress as momentum builds. Similarly, this week's lobbying effort focused not on an economy-wide program to curb climate pollution but on an obscure piece of legislation known as the Master Limited Partnership Parity Act, which is intended to lower the cost of financing clean energy. BICEP members also attended a White House briefing about forthcoming EPA rules to curb pollution from existing power plants. ""You are going to see full-on support from BICEP for the carbon rules,"" Kelley said. Whitehouse urged the BICEP members to aim higher. ""We are tantalizingly close"" to a ""significant piece of climate legislation"", he said, expressing a view that is not widely held in Washington. He predicted that EPA's power plant rules will be a ""game changer"" that will force big emitters to rethink their use of fossil fuels, that climate change will be a winning issue for Democrats in the 2014 congressional elections and that a corporate shift in favor of climate regulation could make a decisive difference.  ""The denial castle is built on sand, and the sand is eroding fast"", he said. Speaking of erosion, several of the corporate executives who spoke described severe weather which may be climate-related as a threat to their businesses. Kevin Rabinovitch, director of global sustainability at Mars, a major buyer of chocolate, said: ""We see crops suffering from climate change, and that flows through to us in terms of price."" Letitia Webster, senior director of global corporate sustainability at VF Corp, whose brands including Wrangler, Timberland and North Face, said their operations could be affected by climate change because they buy a lot of cotton, which is affected by drought in terms of its price and availability. VF also sells into the ski industry, which is threatened by warmer weather. Webster said the company would like to buy more clean energy, but that the economics are challenging. ""Renewables are difficult right now,"" she said. ""It's often a six or seven-year ROI (return on investment)"", which isn't quick enough to satisfy top executives. By contrast, IKEA said it is stepping up its commitment to low-carbon energy. The company announced that it is making its first wind investment in the US by purchasing an 98 megawatt wind farm under construction in Illinois. IKEA – which is privately-held company owned by a Dutch Foundation – has allocated $2bn to invest in wind and solar by 2015, and it aims to generate as much renewable energy as the total energy it consumes by 2020. That's a bold and expensive commitment – and one that few US companies, including those in BICEP, have been willing to match."
"Good Friday and Saturday will bring the best weather of the Easter bank holiday weekend, with forecasters predicting dry and sunny skies and temperatures in the mid-teens across the UK. But the outlook on Sunday and the bank holiday Monday is for cloudier conditions with the chance of rain across England and Wales.  The Met Office warns that this may herald a longer period of unsettled weather, possibly lasting until the end of the month. The mild winter and warm spring have meant that there is a wealth of wildlife on display for those staying in the UK, from bees and butterflies to blossom and buds. Bluebells are flowering far earlier than in last year's cold spring, with peak displays expected in time for Easter, according to a survey by the Woodland Trust. The charity said nearly 200 observations of native bluebells had been submitted to the Nature's Calendar website, which asks the public to submit sightings of natural events that mark the changing seasons. Just 43 records had been submitted by this time last year, as the UK struggled to shake off cold weather. The trust is expecting a much earlier average first-flowering date for bluebells than in 2013, when the average date across the UK was 5 May. The earliest average first-flowering date on record was 4 April 2012. Latest figures from the British Trust for Ornithology show butterflies have already emerged in significant numbers in gardens around the country, seen in 23% of gardens, at this time of year compared with 4% last year. A survey by the Centre for Ecology and Hydrology has already received reports of many of the UK's 46 species of ladybird. An extremely mild winter led to signs of spring as early as January, with snowdrops and hazel flowering then, plus sightings of ladybirds and butterflies. Generally, the rising temperatures of climate change mean spring is arriving earlier in the UK. British flowers came out two to 12 days earlier in the past 25 years than in any previous quarter-century , and the seasonal timing of reproduction has shifted forward by about 11 days between 1976 and 2005, previous research has shown. The warmer weather has also helped domestic tourism. About 3.4 million people are taking an Easter break of at least one night's stay in the UK and 6.5 million are planning a day trip over Easter, according to VisitEngland. The tourist board's chief executive, James Berresford, said the holiday industry had rallied following the floods and severe weather earlier this year and it was ""business as usual for tourism"". Over the weekend, UV levels are expected to be low to medium. However, the Met Office said there was an ""ozone anomaly"" affecting the UK at the moment, with less of the gas in the upper atmosphere able to absorb the UV rays before they reached the ground, meaning that levels could be higher than predicted in some areas. But the weather is unlikely to break any records. The warmest Easter on record was on 28 April 2011, when temperatures hit 27.8C (82F) in Wisley, Surrey. The coldest was on 31 March 1986, with -9.8C (14F) recorded in Lagganlia, Inverness-shire, and the wettest was on 14 April 1963, with more than 148mm (5.8in) of rain falling at Oakeley Quarry, near Blaenau Ffestiniog, in Gwynnedd, Wales. • This article was amended on 18 April. The earlier version referred to the Saturday of the bank holiday weekend as Easter Saturday."
"When an international group of 77 institutional investors with more than $3tn in assets asked the world's 45 largest fossil fuel companies to assess the risks that climate change poses to their business, they were aware they were asking a tough, complex question.  Knowing this, investors launched the Carbon Asset Risk Initiative to spur fossil fuel companies to assess the risks climate change poses to their business based on two scenarios: a business-as-usual scenario under which the world's fossil fuel use continues to grow, warming the earth to levels society may not be able to adapt to; and a low-carbon scenario where governments achieve their stated goal of limiting the average temperature rise to below 2C.  Many of the 45 companies that received this request are responding – among those, Exxon Mobil, the world's largest publicly traded energy company, which agreed to publish a report after investors agreed to withdraw a pair of related shareholder resolutions. This agreement was considered by many to be groundbreaking. And if the company had in fact provided the information requested by investors, the report itself would have been. While the report is a positive step, providing investors with useful information about the company's views on managing climate risk, it mostly sidesteps investors' concerns by dismissing a low carbon scenario as ""highly unlikely"" and glossing over the climate change implications of the company's own Outlook for Energy. According to the report, Exxon Mobil does expect increasing government action to curb emissions, but not to the level required to limit global warming to below 2C, which the company claims would be unaffordable. In fact, the report says the emissions projections in the company's Outlook for Energy are comparable to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change scenario that projects a temperature rise well above the international two degree goal. The company focuses on the costs of action and largely ignores the costs of inaction, suggesting that policymakers should balance mitigation, adaptation, and other social priorities.  This key issue – that inaction on climate change will carry significant economic costs – was underscored by a report the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) released the same day as Exxon Mobil's report. According to the IPCC, ""Throughout the 21st century, climate-change impacts are projected to slow down economic growth, make poverty reduction more difficult, further erode food security, and prolong existing and create new poverty traps.""  And interestingly, to make the case that a low carbon scenario would be unaffordable, Exxon Mobil cites a 2008 International Energy Agency (IEA) report that concluded: ""To halve today's emission levels would require additional investments of the order of USD 45 trillion."" What the company does not point out is the second half of IEA's conclusion, which said: ""Although this is a large number in absolute terms, it is small relative to the expected growth in global economic activity over the next forty years - and small relative to the cost of inaction."" More recently, the IEA said in 2012 that achieving a low carbon scenario would be affordable, requiring an investment of $36tn that would generate fuel savings of more than $100tn.  Considering that Exxon Mobil not long ago denied the science of climate change outright, this report shows the company has come a long way and this is an important step forward.  While the report discusses a number of actions the company is taking to manage climate risk, it is disappointing that it declined to assess the risk that investors asked it to simply because it does not see the risk as likely. Risk is not just the probability of an event occurring, but also the impact of the event if it were to occur.  No one can predict the future. The oil and gas industry is accustomed to boom and bust cycles and also has a history of overestimating demand. Exxon Mobil itself paid tens of billions for its shale gas specialist subsidiary XTO just before the natural gas price dropped precipitously. Profits from the investment have yet to materialize, demonstrating that even Exxon Mobil can be wrong about the future. Referring mainly to its own Outlook for Energy, Exxon Mobil's report concludes with surprising certainty that none of its reserves, either on its balance sheet or that it plans to bring onto its balance sheet in the future, will ever be stranded. The company says this is supported by ""all credible scenarios"", apparently dismissing Citi's projection that global oil demand could peak as soon as 2020 and IEA's 2C scenario, not to mention the fact that, under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, governments worldwide have committed to a formal goal of limiting global warming to below 2C. From Exxon Mobil's report, we might reasonably assume the company is betting against this. The bottom line is that oil demand might not grow the way Exxon Mobil expects it to. Even if the company is right that a low carbon scenario is ""highly unlikely"", that does not mean it should be dismissed. Meanwhile, producing oil is getting more expensive, so Exxon Mobil and its peers have to spend more shareholder capital to produce less oil and are seeing their profitability decline as a result. They actually need demand to keep growing so that prices stay high – around $120 per barrel, according to Goldman Sachs. Yet, if prices get too high, consumers will use less as alternatives become more economic. This means that the oil industry could be facing a shrinking window of opportunity, making companies like Exxon Mobil vulnerable to any scenario other than the one in its Outlook for Energy. Considering this, is it really prudent for Exxon Mobil to be so certain it is right? Andrew Logan is oil and gas program director at Ceres, a US-based nonprofit organization mobilizing business and investor leadership on climate change. Ryan Salmon is senior manager in the oil and gas program at Ceres."
"It is already taking shape as the 21st century urban nightmare: a big storm hits a city like Shanghai, Mumbai, Miami or New York, knocking out power supply and waste treatment plants, washing out entire neighbourhoods and marooning the survivors in a toxic and foul-smelling swamp. Now the world's leading scientists are suggesting that those same cities in harm's way could help drive solutions to climate change.  A draft report from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), obtained by the Guardian, says smart choices in urban planning and investment in public transport could help significantly lower greenhouse gas emissions, especially in developing countries. The draft is due for release in Berlin on Sunday, the third and final instalment of the IPCC's authoritative report on climate change. ""The next two decades present a window of opportunity for urban mitigation as most of the world's urban areas and their infrastructure have yet to be constructed,"" the draft said. Around 1 billion people live in cities and coastal areas at risk of sea-level rise and coastal flooding – and those figures are expected to rise in the coming decades. Most of the high-risk areas are in Asia, but the US east coast, where the rate of sea level rise is three or four times faster than the global average, is also a ""hotspot"", with cities, beaches and wetlands exposed to flooding. But those at-risk cities also produce a large and growing share of emissions that cause climate change – which makes them central to its solution. ""They are at the frontlines of this issue,"" said Seth Schultz, research director for the C40 group of mega-cities taking action on climate change. ""And on the whole cities have extraordinarily strong power to deliver on these things."" Even in America, where Republican governors and members of Congress deny the existence or have rolled back action on climate change, cities are moving ahead. South-east Florida faces a triple threat – flat, built on porous rock, and in line for high sea-level rise. Planners in four south-eastern counties are preparing for 24 inches of sea-level rise by 2060 – which could put a large area around Miami underwater. Beaches and barrier islands are already starting to disappear. Miami and other towns flood during heavy rain storms and full-moon high tides, and saltwater is already seeping into the network of canals in the Everglades. ""Sometimes it is tempting to think those impacts just occur in small coastal areas, but they are more extensive than that,"" said Jennifer Jurado, director of natural resources for Broward county. Her nightmare scenario in a future of rising sea level would be flooding from both directions – the coast and inland – with saltwater contaminating groundwater reserves, and saturating farmland. Jurado and officials in three other south-eastern counties of Florida have teamed up on a plan to cut emissions and protect populations from future sea-level rise. Officials started with computer modelling to draw up details plans of what Florida would look like under future sea-level rise. Broward county is now restricting development in areas at risk of two feet of sea-level rise. Water districts in Sweetwater and other towns south of Miami are installing pumps at $70m each to divert storm run off water and pump it back into the ocean. And while Florida's Republican governor, Rick Scott, has put climate change efforts on hold, Broward county last month committed to getting 20% of electricity for county from renewable sources and increasing energy efficiency by 20%. Homeowners are being offered rebates on their property taxes to install solar panels. The county has also pledged to cut greenhouse gas emissions 80% by 2050. Across the country in another Republican-controlled state, Salt Lake City in Utah has also been dealing with climate change. Salt Lake City, which is at risk of running out of water because of climate change, set ambitious targets to cut emissions, and was the first city in America to commit to offsetting emissions from official travel. Meanwhile, Utah's state legislature this month passed bills offering new financial incentives for solar panels and plug-in vehicles. The bills also require Utah to convert 50% of state transport vehicles to alternative fuels or plug-ins by 2018. Such initiatives are becoming more common across America as city officials take future climate change into account for planning, zoning and land use, said Christina DeConcini, director of government affairs for the World Resources Institute. ""I think there is a growing focus on climate change,"" she said. ""A lot of cities have sustainability departments and people focusing on it, and more and more of the work they are doing is focused on climate and climate impacts."" The reason, she said, was transparent. ""Cities that are more at risk are definitely paying more attention."""
"Tony Abbott declared the Western Australia half-senate election to be a ""referendum"" on the carbon price in his first major door-stop as prime minister in Perth last year If there is a new election it will be another opportunity for the people of Australia to say no to the carbon tax and frankly I welcome another opportunity for the people to participate in a referendum on the carbon tax.  While the idea of elections in general and this by-election specifically being referendums is utter nonsense, on Abbott's own criteria the results of the senate by-election is a repudiation of Abbott's carbon price policy specifically and his climate policy generally. The count is still continuing in Western Australia, but at the time of this writing, the Liberal party jettisoned around 175,888 votes since the 2013 election and the re-run. What's more, over 285,500 people in Western Australia chose not to vote at all in Abbott's so-called referendum. This is a 21% lower turnout than 2013, where 1.3 million people voted. Only 1.02 million people voted this time around. On the Sunday after the election, The Guardian's Bridie Jabour wrote:  Abbott said the 5.6% swing in the Senate election rerun was ""typical"" and one of voters' main expectations was that the government would get rid of the carbon and mining taxes. ""As far as I am concerned the very strong take-out of this result is that the Australian people yet again have voted to get rid of the carbon tax and get rid of the mining tax, and I expect these taxes to be swiftly scrapped,"" he said. It is utterly risible to suggest that Abbott can claim a ""mandate"" for repeal of the carbon price in such a circumstance. Even if you add up all the parties who oppose the carbon price (the Liberals, Nationals and Palmer United Party), on the current count they reached less than 50% of the vote. (It is also a truism that people vote a certain way for a range of reasons and on a range of policies. Abbott's notion of a single issue being the sole cause for voting behaviour is mischievous.) This is Abbott's third failed referendum on the carbon price. The first one was during the 2013 federal election, where he declared the election to be ""more than anything... a referendum on the carbon tax"". This first referendum was a non-starter, with a massive no-show at the ballot box and a paltry 1.5% swing to the Liberal Party (the LNP actually had a swing against it), despite a three-year fear-mongering campaign. The second referendum was the Griffith by-election, where serial LNP candidate Bill Glasson lost to pro-carbon price Labor candidate Terri Butler. Before the by-election, Abbott once again nailed the carbon price referendum colours to the mast, saying in a statement: The by-election will be an opportunity for the people of Griffith to vote for a candidate that will support the Government's plan to build a strong and prosperous economy and a safe and secure Australia. In particular, it will be an opportunity to vote for a local member who will vote to scrap the carbon tax, reduce electricity prices and ease cost of living pressures. Well, the people of Griffith rejected Abbott and his candidate who would ""vote to scrap the carbon tax"". Of course, Abbott should be expected to push an entirely self-serving view that as the executive, he should have free reign to implement his regressive climate policies. Australia's democracy doesn't work this way; Australians have voted for a senate that will not give Tony Abbott a rubber stamp. As Lenore Taylor and Gabrielle Chan note, Abbott must negotiate all his legislation through this new senate. This includes repeal of the carbon price. For Tony Abbott to so categorically tie the results of the Western Australian Senate election to the repeal of the carbon price demonstrates the fundamental hollowness of his climate change policies. Simply, he has no policy because he and many of his most senior ministers, advisors and supporters do not believe climate change is real. Unfortunately for Mr Abbott, a majority of Australians do still consider man-made climate change to be a real. This is despite the relentless campaign of fear, uncertainty and doubt run by News Corp in Australia and tens of millions spent by other conservative organisations. In fact, the most recent polling suggests that attitudes about human-caused global warming has strengthened since Tony Abbott was elected, and at an all-time high. Fifty six percent of Australians now accept that climate change real and is human caused. At the same time, the most recent Essential Report shows that disapproval of Tony Abbott has remained at the high level of 47%, putting his net approval ""under water"" by six points. Such an unpopular prime minister is in no position to be dictating terms or making demands on senators. It is utter nonsense to suggest that any election is a referendum on a single policy. Australia's democracy does have a system to determine this -- genuine referendums.  However, using Abbott's argument that the Western Australian senate election was a referendum, it is clear that voters repudiated the abolition of the carbon price, and rejected the Abbott government's shameful, negligent climate policy."

"Nearly 100 professors have accused Harvard of a failure of leadership on climate change and called on the university to sell off its investments in fossil fuels. In an open letter released on Thursday, some 93 faculty members urged Harvard to purge its nearly $33bn endowment of all holdings in oil and coal companies.  The letter amounts to a rejection of an initiative announced by the university president, Drew Faust, earlier this week committing Harvard to new investment guidelines – but stopping short of divestment. The faculty members said they were “disappointed” Faust had decided to keep Harvard invested in the industries that cause climate change.“Our university invests in the fossil fuel industry: this is for us the central issue,” the letter said. “We believe that the corporation is making a decision that in the long run will not serve the university well.” The open letter, supported by scientists and department heads, represents the latest round in the escalating campaign, at Harvard and other campuses to get universities to sell off their holdings in fossil fuels. The campaigners are actively targeting some 250 college campuses but Harvard – which has the biggest endowment of all – is the richest prize. Nine colleges have so far committed to selling off their stocks, as have a number of cities including Seattle. As the Harvard faculty letter points out, the divestment movement got a push recently from the United Nations and the World Bank, which have both endorsed divestment as a way of fighting climate change. The faculty members argue Harvard's refusal to purge its portfolio of oil and coal stocks was inconsistent with the university's commitment to influence corporate behavior as a way of stopping climate change. Faust this week signed the university on to United Nations-backed guidelines for responsible investment. She also said Harvard was seeking to raise funds for climate research. But the letter argues Harvard would be far more effective if it used its multi-billion endowment to push corporations to act on climate change. “How, exactly, will the university 'encourage' fossil fuel corporations in 'addressing pressing environmental imperatives'? Will Harvard initiate or support shareholder resolutions? Will it divest from coal companies? Will it ask questions at shareholder meetings?” the letter asks. It goes on: “We know that fossil fuel use must decrease. To achieve this goal, not only must research and education be pursued with vigor, pressure must also be exerted. If there is no pressure, then grievous harm due to climate change will accelerate and entrench itself for a span of time that will make the history of Harvard look short."""
"Butterflies returned to the skies last year with four-fifths of British species increasing after the worst summer on record, but overall numbers were still well below average. An unusually sunny midsummer gave respite to rare species threatened with extinction following a disastrous 2012, in which fewer butterflies were recorded by volunteers and scientists than at any time since records began.  Targeted conservation work also helped populations of the endangered high brown fritillary, which increased numbers by 133% in 2013, and the Lulworth skipper, up by 162%, according to the UK Butterfly Monitoring Scheme (UKBMS) that began in 1976. Common garden species such as the small tortoiseshell, which had suffered a dramatic decline after a run of unreliable summers also rallied, also recovered. The small tortoiseshell improved its numbers by more than 200% in 2013 to record its best year for a decade. Fine weather and gentle winds also brought large numbers of small tortoiseshells, peacocks and whites over from the continent, with last year also proving to be a notable summer for the distinctive clouded yellow. Butterfly recorders for the UKBMS counted 1,900 of these powerful migrants, mainly across southern England. But overall numbers were still well below average with last year the 14th worst summer since monitoring began. The exceptionally cold spring was a struggle for butterflies that usually emerge in April and May, with the endangered pearl-bordered fritillary falling by 22% compared to 2012 and numbers of the grizzled skipper falling by 45% to a historic low. Rare species such as the Duke of Burgundy continued to struggle after suffering local extinctions during the recent run of bad summers. Such specialist species are finding it difficult to recolonise lost ground. ""After seven really bad years we saw a good emergence last summer,"" said Dr Tom Brereton of Butterfly Conservation, which runs the monitoring scheme with the Centre for Ecology & Hydrology. ""But there's only so much recovery that can be done in one year – we need a breeding season beyond that to get things going."" This spring has been encouraging with large numbers of small tortoiseshells, brimstones and peacocks successfully hibernating as adult butterflies and emerging across the country. Butterfly populations always fluctuate because of the weather but the data collected by thousands of volunteers and scientists shows that more than 70% of Britain's 59 species are experiencing long-term declines, due to habitat loss, industrial farming and climate change. ""The majority of warmth-loving butterflies should be benefiting from climate change because in Britain they are at the northern edge of their range but that's outweighed by the negative effects of habitat loss and fragmentation,"" said Brereton. Some British butterflies are spreading northwards, but climate change is happening so quickly that some species are struggling to adapt fast enough. In some cases, there is a developing mismatch between a butterfly's life-cycle and the availability of food plants or nectar as crucial plants flower before a butterfly emerges from its pupae. Other species find themselves stranded on tiny islands of protected land or nature reserves because habitat is so fragmented, unable to move to more suitable territory as the weather becomes too hot or dry. Extreme weather events – including droughts and the record wet winter – also make small residual populations of butterflies more vulnerable to extinction. Dr Marc Botham, ecologist at the Centre for Ecology & Hydrology, said: ""Annual changes are largely associated with the weather. However, the data show that a number of species have been significantly declining over the last 38 years. This highlights the importance of maintaining long-term monitoring, reliant on the immense dedication of thousands of volunteers, to determine species and habitats of conservation priority."""
"Last month, and within a week of the UN issuing a bitter warning about how climate change was decimating coffee growing around the world, the London coffee festival took place in Brick Lane. At first glance, these two events seem to lie at opposite ends of the cultural, not to mention geopolitical, spectrum. So far apart, in fact, that you suspect someone of planning a bad-taste joke. On the one hand, you have 25 million poor rural households under threat because there are no longer enough cool mountainsides on which the highland coffee bean can flourish. Add in leaf rust and the berry borer beetle – both as nasty as they sound – and you have a recipe for misery – not to mention a poor, expensive harvest. Meanwhile, on the other side of the world, in the post-industrial space that is the Old Truman Brewery, there are young men with bushy beards and girls with Pocahontas plaits fussing about the relative merits of single estate v blended.  If ever there was a perfect occasion to launch into a rant about the decadence of the whole connoisseur coffee thing, then this might appear to be it. What could be more appalling than fiddling with your baby Gaggia while once-cool mountainsides burn in the heat of the unfiltered sun? But think about it for a little, and it becomes clear that these two teams – the subsistence farmers and the hipster baristas – are actually playing for the same side. One of the impacts of coffee shortages, says the UN, will be to push up the price of your morning latte. Annoying, yes, but there's nothing like having an everyday commodity suddenly turn into a luxury good to make you value it properly. Naturally you want to do right by it too: getting the temperature and the pressure spot-on no longer seems like fussing so much as due diligence. In putting coffee at the heart of our lives we are returning to how things used to be. It was Britain – not France or Italy – that introduced coffee culture to Europe in the late 17th century. The first coffee house was opened in Oxford in 1650, and within two years the idea had spread to London. It was not, though, the taste of this muddy new beverage that drew people – or rather men. By the 18th century the Georgians were routinely comparing coffee to mud, old shoes and shit, although, with the muddle-headedness of consumers everywhere, they also liked the fact that you could get endless refills for a penny. What really mattered to them, though, was how coffee was consumed. Too expensive and fiddly to be made at home, you (a male) took yourself off to a coffee shop to read the papers and talk politics – not just to friends and colleagues, but strangers too. In the democratic space of the coffee house, men of every rank sat down together and shouted in one another's faces. The fabulous independent coffee shops that have sprung up in the past five years aren't quite like this. If you're one of those contributing to the consumption of the 1.7bn cups chugged down in coffee shops annually in the UK, you'll know that shouting at strangers while frothed up on caffeine isn't why you go there. You're more likely to be cocooned in your singular world, staring raptly at your laptop and savouring the flavour of a bean that has been micro-roasted just up the road. But it doesn't matter what gets you through the door. The point is coffee has once again become both a destination and an event. Back in the 1960s there was a television advert for Maxwell House that included the catchy line ""there's an awful lot of coffee in Brazil"". It turns out that there isn't, actually, just as there isn't all that much in Uganda or the Philippines either. Which is why we should treat it with care, creativity and even love. We need to know about the people who harvested it, and why they can't any more. And if the other side of that concern involves getting geeky about grinds and pressure bars, then so be it."
