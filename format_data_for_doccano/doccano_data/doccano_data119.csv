"Do I really have to march? It’s actually a serious question: I mean, marching’s rather ... military, isn’t it? Bit aggressive. Bit too much like what the baddies on the other side would do, don’t you think? Wouldn’t you rather saunter? Or stroll? Mince, even? A hop, a skip or a jump – anything but stern-faced, humorless marching. And let’s face it: we’re probably going to need a sense of humor.  Remember 15 February 2003? If you’re taking the trouble to read this, then you probably went to an anti-war march that day. Didn’t turn out so well, did it? Nothing really changed. The “largest protest event in human history”, as we remember it today, was effectively ignored. That left a nasty taste. It might even have put you off the idea of protesting forever. The marching boots were thrown to the back of the cupboard and you went into a major sulk. Maybe you even wrote a song about it. Yeah, that’ll tell ‘em. You wrote the words:  If you don’t like it then leave or use your right to protest on the street. Yeah, use your right –  but don’t imagine that it’s heard. No: not whilst c***ts are still running the world. – “Running the World” (2006) And you thought: “Yes! Smash the system!” And then ... time passed. Until you got this email: On Sunday, Sept 21, a climate march through midtown Manhattan will kick off a week of high-profile climate events in the Big Apple. Promoted as an effort to bring unprecedented attention to climate change, the gathering comes just as international climate negotiations ramp up in a major push toward a new global accord. The People’s Climate March, being called the ‘largest climate march in history’ by organizers, will potentially draw over a hundred thousand people to walk through Manhattan and show a level of demand for action not seen since the era of Civil Rights marches and anti-Vietnam protests. Can you be arsed? Do you risk being disappointed again? Or do you sit this one out? I mean, climate change is a bit old-hat now, isn’t it? And some people say it doesn’t even exist – people like ... Nigel Lawson. (A note for non-British readers: you may be more familiar with his daughter, the TV chef Nigella Lawson. The fact that he gave his daughter a “feminized” version of his own name tells you all you need to know about him, really.)  Back in 2008, I sailed the coast of Greenland on a vessel chartered by the organization Cape Farewell and saw the effects of global warming firsthand. It exists. On the way home, we spent a few hours in Reykjavík’s international airport waiting for a connecting flight back to the UK. I bought an ashtray made out of lava. When I got back home, I turned the TV on. It was the morning of the stock market crash and I learned that Iceland, the country I had been visiting not four hours previously, was effectively bankrupt.  That gave me a strange feeling because I hadn’t noticed. The sun had still been shining as I walked through the airport terminal. People had gone about their everyday business as usual, there had been air to breathe and nothing to betray the cataclysm that had befallen the entire country. How could that be? This was a financial crisis! The Big One! THE ECONOMY was at risk! Why was the world still turning? You whisper now, but could it be that there is a higher power than … THE ECONOMY? I know that sounds a bit sacrilegious, but could it be that THE ECOLOGY is actually the biggie? That maybe having air to breathe, water to drink and land to inhabit could be more important than the fluctuations of the FTSE or the Dow Jones? It’s just a thought – a thought that most people instinctively understanding, but that the political classes have yet to grasp.  In the end it all comes down to a single letter – R – that has somehow gone astray over the years. Exactly when did “government for the people” become “government of the people”? When did the function of government change from public service to crowd control? From protector to pimp? The People’s Climate March this Sunday is important. Because governments won’t put the case for action on climate change too strongly – no, that might be interpreted as being “anti-business”. It might dissuade corporations from building factories in countries that sign on to climate agreements. It might be harmful to THE ECONOMY. So once again it will be left to ordinary people to point out the blindingly obvious fact that destroying the place you live in is not a good idea. It really isn’t. And the powers that be would do well to heed the cold, hard truth that there are more of us than them, that we are heartily sick and tired of being ignored.  That’s not a threat, you understand. I just thought I’d point it out. Yep, it’s “once more unto the streets, dear friends” (you know you want to, really), and I would like to suggest that you dance your way along the route. Much more fun than marching. Further reading:"

"Why is it so difficult to teach climate change in our classrooms? My kids hear climate change discussed in the news as a very real threat, but it is largely absent from school science curricula. In fact, most children the world over don’t receive any formal academic reasoning to put the vast amount of information and opinions into context, and they have no credible outlet to ask their own questions.  To date, many attempts to educate the public – and our kids – about climate change have relied on scare tactics that focus on superstorms, massive floods and ominous weather patterns to generate fear. But fear actually can inhibit the desire to learn more and take action – particularly in young people.  And, because the subject of climate change can prove highly conceptual to students if the science is not well understood, there’s been much debate among educators about how exactly it should be taught – not just at the high-school and university level, but from grade school and up. So it’s no surprise that many teachers choose to avoid climate change altogether in their classrooms. The trouble is that today’s students will be tasked with managing tomorrow’s climate change impact – and jobs requiring science, technology, engineering and math (Stem) skills already are on the rise. That demand will only continue to expand as the effects of climate change progress and more effort is needed to create and execute mitigation tactics and adaptation plans.  Teaching climate change shouldn’t be about preaching to our kids. A good science curriculum should empower students to ask their own questions and give them the tools to find and understand the answers themselves. After all, we know that students learn best when they can figure things out for themselves, rather than being given facts to be memorized – the charred ceilings of many high school chemistry labs can attest to that.  Climate change curricula should be based on real-time empirical data, encourage hands-on participation and problem-solving, and offer a pragmatic approach to what individuals can do and are doing to combat climate change. And linking firsthand observations to national climate-monitoring programs and using 400,000 years of atmospheric carbon dioxide samples provided by institutions such as Nasa helps students see the real-life applications.  In theory, teaching climate change shouldn’t be controversial. Nasa has already shifted from exclusively exploring outer space to exploring our planet – and a large portion of its research now focuses on the impact of climate change on our environment. The legendary space agency, charged with leading the world in scientific discovery, confirms what 97% of climate scientists on the ground report: Earth’s climate is changing, in large part as a result of the buildup of greenhouse gases released by human activities. If exploring space can be cool, with a planetary mobile in every classroom, why not saving the planet?  Using what we know about education and our planet’s systems, the Chicago Botanic Garden teamed up with Nasa to develop a new climate change curriculum to ensure that our kids have the opportunity to learn about the realities facing our world. We hope this new set of tools will empower educators across the country to get involved and grasp that they can teach climate change effectively in their classrooms. The future of our communities, natural resources and ecosystems depends on how well we understand, value and protect the habitats and species that sustain our world. We need to be proactive and give young learners the tools to observe the effects of a changing climate for themselves. It’s one more way to invest in the future of our planet and let our kids shape the world that soon will be theirs. To quote Carl Sagan, “This is our world. It is our responsibility to cherish it.”"
"The heirs to the fabled Rockefeller oil fortune withdrew their funds from fossil fuel investments on Monday, lending a symbolic boost to a $50bn divestment campaign ahead of a United Nations summit on climate change. The former vice-president, Al Gore, will present the divestment commitments to world leaders, making the case that investments in oil and coal have an uncertain future.  With Monday’s announcement, more than 800 global investors – including foundations such as the Rockefeller Brothers, religious groups, healthcare organisations, cities and universities – have pledged to withdraw a total of $50bn from fossil fuel investments over the next five years. The Rockefeller Brothers Fund controls about $860m in assets, said Beth Dorsey, the chief executive of the Wallace Global Fund and the Divest-Invest movement, which has led the divestment campaign. About 7% are invested in fossil fuels. But the Rockefellers’ decision to cut their ties with oil lends the divestment campaign huge symbolic importance because of their family history. The divestment move also helps bring a campaign launched by scrappy activists on college campuses into the financial mainstream. But for oil, there may not have been a Rockefeller fortune. John and William Rockefeller were the co-founders of the Standard Oil Company, which at the time operated the world’s biggest refineries, and overtime spawned Exxon, Amoco and Chevron. Now, after a year of deliberations, the descendants of those original Rockefellers had decided the time had come to move away from oil. “John D Rockefeller, the founder of Standard Oil, moved America out of whale oil and into petroleum,” Stephen Heintz, president of the Rockefeller Brothers Fund, said in a statement. “We are quite convinced that if he were alive today, as an astute businessman looking out to the future, he would be moving out of fossil fuels and investing in clean, renewable energy.” In addition to the Rockefellers, the World Council of Churches, which represents some 590 million people in 150 countries – also pulled its investments from fossil fuels on Monday. The move represented a turning point for a movement which began by demanding that universities purge their financial holdings of ties to the fossil fuel industry. About 30 cities have also chosen to divest, including Santa Monica and Seattle. “When you have the Rockefellers and the World Council of Churches and institutions with global reach coming together and divesting, then this movement which began just three short years ago has really reached a significant turning point,” Dorsey said. In that time, supporters such as Archbishop Desmond Tutu have framed divestment from fossil fuels as a moral imperative – like the anti-apartheid movement of a generation ago. “Climate change is the human rights challenge of our time. We can no longer continue feeding our addiction to fossil fuels as if there is no tomorrow, for there will be no tomorrow,” Tutu said in a video address. The Rockefeller Brothers Fund over the years has been a big supporter of environmental causes, including to campaign groups opposed to fracking and the Keystone XL pipeline, which made for an awkward fit at times with its continued investment in oil and gas. The family plans to first divest from tar sands commitments. A number of universities have also started to cut their ties with fossil fuel – with Stanford University dropping coal holdings from its $18bn endowment. But divestment remains a hard sell. The University of California system said last week it would continue to hold on to fossil fuels. Harvard University has also resisted pressure from faculty and students to divest – although Yale has said it will look into whether renewable energy offers a better bet in the long run. “In the last great divestment campaign, Harvard said no before it said yes. I think it’s just a matter of time,” Dorsey said. “Unlike with the anti-apartheid movement, this is not just an ethical issue. There is a powerful financial reason as well.”"

"This week a landslide in Kashmir killed more than 400 people and left hundreds of thousands stranded by flooding. As the world adjusts to a changing climate, scientists expect to see rising numbers of landslides like this. Climate change is accelerated in mountain regions, where temperatures and rainfall patterns are already changing. It’s hard to predict exactly how rainfall will be affected in any one place, but the lashings of rain that affect monsoon regions are forecast to get stronger. Rainwater clogs up the tiny air gaps in soil, bringing already unstable land closer to the brink of collapse. The loss of snow and ice which binds together loose debris on hill slopes is disappearing, further increasing the chance of dangerous landslides.  British universities produce a large amount of the world’s leading research  into landslide hazards, but much of it remains locked behind publishers’ pay walls. Landslides rarely come as a surprise to the geological community, and yet they often aren’t on the agenda of NGOs working on the ground. If valuable research is shared effectively, it can help reduce the risk of disasters. In 2010 a landslide in India-controlled Kashmir, fed by strong monsoon rains, wiped out a Tibetan refugee camp on the flood plain below. Hundreds were killed. If development practitioners had consulted with geologists, they never would have located the refugee camp on a flood plain. Some scientists are now working to get their research into the hands of people that need it, but communication channels between academics and NGOs are not yet well established. A conference on the sustainable development of the Himalayas, held in the small town of Leh in June this year, invited internationally acclaimed scientists from the UK, USA and central Asia to speak alongside politicians, development practitioners and local experts. But events like these, sadly, are rare. Scientific research needs to be publicly available and disseminated in easily understandable terms, and development practitioners need to integrate research into their practice. Both groups can benefit further from consultation with communities in the affected regions. Over a tenth of the world’s population live in mountain regions, where they are highly exposed to dangerous events such as floods and landslides. Many of these people live below the poverty line, often without access to radios or telephones, making them particularly vulnerable. We need scientists, local communities and NGOs to work closely together if we want to reduce the risk of future disasters. One place where such cooperation is already in action is in the Himalayan kingdom of Baltistan, where scientists have been consulting with the local elderly. Tracking past disasters is important for understanding how they may cause problems in the future. This can be assessed through traditional fieldwork techniques as well as high-tech observations from satellites, but historical records are invaluable for understanding risk at a local level. In Baltistan illiteracy rates are high and the ongoing Kashmir war has prevented much outside access and documentation, so the memories and stories of the elderly have become important historical records. These records are invaluable for understanding risk at a local level. One example of where this has proven to be useful is the case of Ruzi Mohammed who we interviewed. Ruzi said he suspects that he is around 110 years old. He is illiterate and has only left his village once, when he travelled for three days by foot to see a doctor. Scientists spoke to Ruzi about his memory of a flood when he was four years old (around 1907): “My family heard the water coming and we climbed up the hillside. The water came around the corner very quickly and we watched our village being washed away. Only the mosque survived.” From Ruzi’s description of the flood, geologists were able to guess that it was caused by a dam burst following blockage of the Indus River (a secondary hazard that can result from landslides). NGOs and local authorities can also benefit from community consultation. In 2005 a rainfall-triggered landslide destroyed the village of Panabaj, Guatemala, in 2005. The relocation site chosen by authorities stood on an alluvial fan, where there was a high risk of further landslides. In this case the affected community, fearing a second disaster, lobbied hard for an alternate site. Local communities have an intimate knowledge of the land that is often overlooked outside experts. Geologists, sadly, expect to hear more stories of disasters coming out of the world’s mountain regions in the coming decades. This additional effect of climate change presents a major challenge to those working in disaster relief, but one that we are better prepared to fight if scientists and NGOs work closely together and integrate the wisdom of local communities.

"Institutional investors managing £15tn of assets have called for an ambitious global climate deal to give them certainty to invest in clean technology. More than 340 institutions including BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager, AXA Group and Legal & General Investment Management, have called for strong policies to drive action on climate change.   The organisations want governments to put a “stable, reliable and economically meaningful” price that polluters have to pay for their carbon emissions, which will help scale up investment towards clean power and energy efficiency.  Ahead of a UN climate summit in New York next week, the investors are also calling on governments to phase out subsidies for fossil fuels, an estimated £370bn worldwide a year, five times the £60bn paid in renewables subsidies. The institutions warned that experts say an extra $1tn (£600bn) a year on average up to 2050 is needed to limit temperature rises to 2C and avoid the worst affects of climate change.  Global investment in clean energy in 2013 was just $254bn (£160bn).  In a statement, the investors, who also include the BBC Pension Trust, BT Pension Scheme, Aviva Investors, Standard Life Investments and Church Commissioners for England, set out action they will take to tackle climate change.  But they warned: “Gaps, weaknesses and delays in climate change and clean energy policies will increase the risks to our investments as a result of the physical impacts of climate change, and will increase the likelihood that more radical policy measures will be required to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Stronger political leadership and more ambitious policies are needed in order for us to scale up our investments.”  A number of investors are already taking action, a report launched alongside the statement shows, such as the UK’s Environment Agency Pension Fund which is on track to have 25% invested in companies and assets contributing to low carbon and climate resilient activities by 2015.  Zurich Insurance Group is investing up to £1.2bn in AAA-rated green bonds, and global banking firm ING Group is increasing its renewable energy project loans to almost £1bn and has reduced exposure to coal power in its project loan portfolio from 63% in 2006 to 13% in 2013.  Stephanie Pfeifer, chief executive of the European Institutional Investors Group on Climate Change (IIGCC), one of four investors groups co-ordinating the statement, said: “The international investor community has today made it clear that the status quo on climate policy is not acceptable. Investors are taking action on climate change, from direct investment in renewables to company engagement and reducing exposure to carbon risk.  “But to invest in low carbon energy at the scale we need requires stronger policies. At the UN climate summit next week, policymakers can ensure pockets of climate leadership turn into mainstream actions.”  The UN summit in New York, organised by secretary general Ban Ki-moon, aims to drive action to tackle emissions in the run-up to talks in Paris at the end of next year, when it is hoped a new global treaty on climate change will be agreed."
"The US secretary of state, John Kerry, promised to put climate change “front and center” of American diplomacy on Monday, raising expectations for this week’s United Nations climate summit. A day before the first world leaders’ meeting on climate change in five years, Kerry said he would take it upon himself to make sure the international community steps up to deal with the threat. “This is an enormous challenge, and this is why the United States is prepared to take the lead in order to bring other nations to the table,” Kerry said in remarks at the start of a week of climate-themed events in New York. “As secretary of state, I promise you I am personally committed to making sure this is front and centre of all our diplomatic efforts.” The commitment offered a much-needed boost to the UN summit, being held on Tuesday. More than 120 world leaders are expected to attend. But a high-level roster of no-shows, with big carbon polluters such as China, India, Australia and Canada staying away, plus the lack of a defined objective, had raised doubts that the gathering would produce concrete results. Much of the action, it seemed, was from the sidelines of the summit. On Sunday, there was a record turnout in New York City for a climate demonstration – more than 310,000 marched through the city’s streets, according to an estimate provided by organisers, including the UN secretary general Ban Ki-moon, foreign ministers, and members of the US Senate. In total, around half a million people attended events held around the world. Ban said he had been deeply moved by the march – and he hoped the world leaders meeting on Tuesday had the same response. “I am overwhelmed by such a strong power, energy and voice of people – I hope this voice will be truly reflected to the leaders when they meet … Climate change is [a] defining issue of our time and there is no time to lose,” he said. “There is no plan B because we do not have plant B.” The French foreign minister, Laurent Fabius, said: “I think that it showed people are now much more aware in all our countries of how important this topic is.” Meanwhile, the World Bank, businesses and NGOs primed to unveil a host of new initiatives meant to speed the development of a low-carbon, clean energy economy. The World Bank on Monday announced that 73 national governments – including China, Russia, and countries in the European Union – had agreed to put a price on carbon. In a separate initiative, the Rockefeller Brothers Fund, a charitable institution set up by the heirs to the oil empire, said it would phase out its holdings in fossil fuels, in an important symbolic boost to a campaign which has seen the withdrawal of $50bn in fossil fuel assets. A number of governments and organisations are expected to announce other initiatives at the summit to reduce areas lost to deforestation, especially through the cultivation of palm oil. Kerry’s remarks suggested the Obama administration will remain focused on climate until late 2015, when negotiators are expected to gather in Paris to finalise a deal to cut carbon emissions and help poor countries deal with global warming. Obama is expected to reaffirm that commitment in his remarks to the climate summit on Tuesday. The president will also hold up his initiatives to cut carbon pollution from power plants and from cars as evidence that America is taking climate change seriously. Kerry said those efforts also extended into the diplomatic sphere. He noted that the US had been working closely with China to reduce emissions – an effort that resulted in an agreement last year to phase out the use of a powerful climate-warming HFC used in air conditioners and refrigerators. The two countries together are responsible for 45% of the world’s carbon pollution. “I’ve sent a directive to every single one of our 275 missions, embassies and consulates that the chiefs of missions are to put this issue on the front burner in all of our interventions with host countries, wherever they may be,” Kerry said. America will not, however, be offering significant sums of cash to help poor countries deal with climate change. Developing countries have said such a commitment is crucial to securing a deal. The promise of engagement from Kerry follows assurances from United Nations officials and diplomats that Tuesday’s summit – and climate change negotiating session in Lima in November – will avoid earlier mistakes. A similar leaders’ summit convened by Ban in 2009 failed to produce the understanding needed to forge a climate deal. A Copenhagen summit collapsed three months later. But Mary Robinson, the UN special envoy on climate change, said the UN would not fall into that trap again. “This is a different environment to Copenhagen,” the former Irish president told the Guardian. “Pressure on leaders for an agreement is building up more than 12 months ahead. I think leaders realise they need to have transformative change.”  Robinson played down concerns that China and India had snubbed the secretary-general’s meeting, as neither Chinese president Xi Jinping and India’s prime minister Narendra Modi are planning to go. “China [is sending] a very, very senior participant,” she said.  She said she was hopeful of progress. “We need 10 to 12 leaders to be ambitious ... President Obama, I hope, will make a strong statement at the summit. ”  This week’s summit of leaders will be followed by a series of meetings by ministers and other officials culminating in a crunch conference in Paris next December. At that meeting, governments are supposed to forge a new global agreement on greenhouse gases for beyond 2020, when current emissions targets run out.  By the end of next March, said Robinson, all major economies, developed and developing, should have put forward their proposals on national emissions targets for beyond the end of the decade.  But key issues remain to be resolved, including whether future emissions should be divided up according to a “carbon budget”, based on scientific estimates of how much more carbon dioxide can be poured into the atmosphere without pushing the world over 2C of warming above pre-industrial levels. That symbolic threshold is regarded as the limit of safety, beyond which the effects of climate change – including droughts, floods and extreme weather – are likely to become severe and potentially irreversible.  There are still deep divisions over how far major developing countries should have to take a share of emissions cuts, and to what extent issues such as the historic responsibility for emissions, per capita emissions, and likely future economic circumstances should be taken into account.  The attempt to draw a distinction between the events of Copenhagen and the current negotiations reflects the high stakes involved. Paris is widely seen as a last chance for the UN process, which has been running since 1992 but has suffered a series of highs and lows, including the 1997 Kyoto protocol, which went unratified by the US, the drama of the Copenhagen summit, and long wrangling over seemingly intractable issues such as how to provide financial incentives for cuts in emissions and a price on carbon.  For some countries, the stakes are even higher. Anote Tong, the president of Kiribati, one of the Pacific Ocean’s small island nations, visited the Arctic before this week’s meeting. He told the Guardian: “We are facing [climate change] now. I have seen how much ice is being lost and it is very serious. I will be bringing this message.”"
"News of the deaths of four Peruvian tribal leaders (Illegal loggers blamed for murders in Amazon, 10 September) is especially resonant because their killings should have been avoided. It was well-known that one of the victims, Edwin Chota, a high-profile environmentalist, received numerous death threats from illegal loggers clearing forest on land that he was trying to secure rights to. Chota was committed to protecting the forest that sustained him and local communities. His death is part of a rising trend in Peru, as our recent report Deadly Environment revealed, with over 58 environmental defenders killed in the country since 2002. Over half of these deaths occurred in the last three years.  Illegal logging is rampant in Chota’s Amazon Ucayali region. It is gutting the rainforest of rare woods like mahogany and tropical cedar, and increasing local tensions and violence. Loggers are literally getting away with murder and seem to enjoy impunity from the law. Peru is hosting this year’s climate conference in December. It is tragically ironic that while governments flounder over international measures aimed at protecting the environment, they fail to recognise, respect and protect people like Chota, who put their lives on the line in the name of real environmental protection. People like Edwin embody the courage and tenacity needed to resolve our climate crisis, but we are losing them in the silent battles waged far from the boardrooms where decisions are made. Peru could lead by example and act to protect environmental defenders as one of our best hopes for the future.Chris MoyeForest campaigner, Global Witness • Naomi Klein is right to call Richard Branson to task for failing to deliver on his climate pledges (Sticky business, Weekend, 13 September). Reneging on such public statements is disappointing and sets a bad example. But pointing the finger at people like Branson ignores the role of government in addressing climate change. Government’s role is – or ought to be – to set the parameters within which business operates. If our politicians refuse to accept their responsibilities, it is unrealistic to expect business leaders to go it alone and make changes that, while beneficial in the long term, will put them at a competitive disadvantage.Rufo QuintavalleParis, France"
"As has become the norm for media outlets owned by Rupert Murdoch, just before a half million people participated in the People’s Climate March around the world, The Wall Street Journal published an opinion piece downplaying the risks and threats posed by human-caused global warming. The editorial was written by Steven Koonin, a respected computational physicist who claims to have engaged in “Detailed technical discussions during the past year with leading climate scientists,” but who is himself not a climate scientist. Koonin did admit that the climate is changing and humans are largely responsible, and noted,  There is well-justified prudence in accelerating the development of low-emissions technologies and in cost-effective energy-efficiency measures. This is a step in the right direction. Unfortunately, Koonin’s editorial focused almost exclusively on the remaining uncertainties in climate science. Ironically, he stated, Any serious discussion of the changing climate must begin by acknowledging not only the scientific certainties but also the uncertainties, especially in projecting the future.  But Koonin himself got the certainties wrong. For example, we know that humans are the main cause of the current climate change, responsible for about 100% of the global warming since 1950. However, Koonin’s editorial claimed, The impact today of human activity appears to be comparable to the intrinsic, natural variability of the climate system itself. This is simply incorrect. As climate scientist Michael Mann told Climate Science Watch in their thorough response to Koonin’s piece, The fact is that the actual peer-reviewed scientific research shows that (a) the rate of warming over the past century is unprecedented as far back as the 20,000 years paleoclimate scientists are able to extend the record and (b) that warming can ONLY be explained by human influences. Indeed, it is the RATE of warming that presents such risk to human civilization and our environment. Climate scientists Michael Oppenheimer and Kevin Trenberth also took issue with Koonin’s assertion about the impact of human activity, saying, Warming is well beyond natural climate variability and projected rates of change are potentially faster than ecosystems, farmers and societies can adapt to without major disruptions. Many details remain to be settled, and weather and natural variability will always mask some effects, especially regionally. But economic analysis of these risks supports substantial action beyond “no regrets” strategies. To argue otherwise as Koonin does is to ignore decades of research results. Koonin primarily focused on the uncertainty in the specific impacts of continued rapid global warming. However, he glossed over the fact that those uncertainties range from generally bad impacts to potentially catastrophic impacts. Even in a best case scenario, climate science research indicates that we anticipate experiencing widespread coral mortality, hundreds of millions of people at risk of increased water stress, more damage from droughts and heat waves and floods, up to 30% of global species at risk for extinction, and declined global food production, for example. Those are the anticipated impacts if we limit global warming to not much above 2°C warming as compared to pre-industrial levels. Accomplishing that would require intensive efforts to reduce human greenhouse gas emissions, and if we fail, the consequence will be far worse. The good news is that slowing global warming can be accomplished with minimal economic impact. In fact, economic research consistently shows that reducing greenhouse gas emissions, if done right, is far cheaper than paying for the damages caused by unabated climate change. For example, a revenue-neutral carbon tax could create jobs and grow the economy. Two recent studies by the New Climate Economy Project and the International Monetary Fund likewise found that reducing carbon pollution could grow the economy, as summarized by The Guardian. As Koonin noted in his piece, risk management is key in determining how to respond to the threats posed by climate change. On the one hand, we have a threat to the entire global climate on which every species on Earth relies, which humans are in the process of destabilizing at a rate more rapid than many species can adapt. On the other hand, we have concerns about the impacts of climate policy on the economy. However, numerous studies have found that if done right, those policies can grow the economy, and will certainly be cheaper than paying for the damages of unabated climate change. While uncertainties remain about whether the impacts of climate change will be bad, catastrophic, or somewhere in between, that’s precisely the kind of scenario in which uncertainty is not our friend. When faced with a risk to something so important, humans are usually smart enough to take action to manage that risk. For example, we buy home insurance, we wear seat belts, and fewer people now smoke than in previous generations who were unaware of the associated risks. It’s critical to grasp not just that there are uncertainties about the impacts of climate change, but what those uncertainties tell us about the range of potential outcomes. It’s easy to simply say “the impacts are uncertain,” but when those uncertainties range from bad to catastrophic, taking action to mitigate the threat is a no-brainer. Additionally, larger uncertainty means that we can’t rule out the most catastrophic potential impacts, and actually makes the case for taking action stronger, as a study published earlier this year showed. The bottom line is that while there are and always will be uncertainties in climate science that require further research, it’s already been several decades since we’ve understood climate change well enough to justify taking serious action to solve the problem. The longer we wait, the costlier those actions become, and the worse the impacts of human-caused global warming will be. The hundreds of thousands of people who marched yesterday understand that, but the Murdoch media hasn’t caught up yet."
"The internet giant Google has announced it is to sever its ties with an influential rightwing lobbying network, the American Legislative Exchange Council, accusing it of “lying” about climate change.  The move, ahead of a United Nations summit on climate change, delivered a victory to campaigners and the UN’s newly minted initiative to persuade companies to shun climate-denying business lobbies.  Google’s chairman, Eric Schmidt, told National Public Radio that the company had joined Alec, a lobby group that shares model legislation, for a campaign on an unrelated issue. But he said: “I think the consensus within the company was that that was some sort of mistake, and so we’re trying to not do that in the future.” Alec’s views on climate change were not in line with Google’s, he said.“The facts of climate change are not in question anymore. Everyone understands climate change is occurring, and the people who oppose it are really hurting our children and our grandchildren and making the world a much worse place. And so we should not be aligned with such people — they’re just, they’re just literally lying.” A UN briefing document, entitled “Are you engaging responsibly in climate policy”, is due to be unveiled formally at the climate summit. It calls on business leaders to take a close look at the climate policy of trade associations – and quit those groups if they try to block climate policies.“Are your lobbyists – and your trade group’s lobbyists – advocating for policies that advance your company’s public climate policy goals,” the briefing document asks. “Are any individuals or groups (inside or outside the company) misrepresenting the company’s policy positions?”The UN found 45 corporations belonged to lobby groups which took anti-climate positions.In Google’s case, the tech company said it was a mistake to join Alec and would not renew its membership at the end of the year.The lobby group was behind the successful campaign to ban planning for sea level rise in North Carolina, and campaigns in several states to roll back regulations promoting wind and solar power.Microsoft quit Alec last July."
"According to the climate change experts, it is only a matter of time. The city of Surat (population 4.5 million), in the state of Gujarat on the west coast of India, will soon be exposed to recurrent flooding, with the risk of malaria and dengue fever epidemics in its aftermath. It also faces higher temperatures, which may force companies to relocate. So its citizens are planning for twin disasters that rapid urban development and global warming bring in their wake. In 2008 Surat, which owes its success to the textile, diamond and petrochemical industries, was one of the pioneer members of the Asian Cities Climate Change Resilience Network (Acccrn) set up by the Rockefeller Foundation. It now receives technical and financial assistance to identify threats and test solutions. “Cities are where the interplay of climate risk and poverty lead to the direst consequences,” the Foundation warns on its website.  After coping with the challenges of rapid development and efforts to reduce poverty, Indian cities must learn to be resilient. By 2030 they will produce 70% of the country’s wealth and be home to 590 million inhabitants. Earlier this year a report by the Delhi-based Energy Resources Institute predicted that failure to adapt to climate change would lead to economic loss and social damage, particularly among the most vulnerable. But several features could make Surat a model for the future. “The municipal corporation is stable and there is overall consensus about climate-related threats. The business community is involved, because it realises better than anyone how much it could lose,” says Mahesh Rajasekar, who heads the Taru Leading Edge consultancy that is framing the city’s resilience strategy. Surat is already used to flooding. In 2006, three-quarters of its surface area was flooded, resulting in losses totalling hundreds of millions of dollars. Its vulnerability is due to its location at the mouth of the Tapi river, fed by a drainage basin covering 65,000 sq km. Surat also ranks fourth worldwide for the speed of its development; the population almost doubled between 2001 and 2011. Rapid urbanisation, along much of the Tapi, has exacerbated the risk of flooding, blocking any outlet for runoff. “Planners don’t even have the time to think ahead; buildings go up before the city’s administrative borders have even been extended,” Rajasekar explains. With hotter weather, the monsoon is shorter and rainfall heavier, raising the risk of severe flooding. Surat has little option but to anticipate, in the hope of limiting the damage. Several automatic weather stations have been installed inland to forecast the intensity of rainfall and its impact on the water level in the Ukai dam, 100km upstream from the city. “We can control the flow from the dam to prevent it overflowing, and when it does overflow we can model flooding in Surat, district by district. So it’s possible to forecast the extent of flooding between eight hours and four days before the event,” says Mehul Patel, a Taru project leader. “We’re ready for flooding,” says city engineer Jatin S Shah. “We have identified the people in each neighbourhood who know how to swim and boats are in storage at fire stations. In the event of flooding, people can take refuge on their roof and move to their neighbour’s, jumping from one terrace to the next.” But it is the aftermath of flooding that is feared more. Conditions would be ideal for the outbreak of epidemics. With stagnant water and high temperatures mosquitoes would proliferate, spreading malaria or dengue fever. As it is, much of the population is packed densely into housing that lacks adequate sanitation and sewerage. “Close supervision is the best way of preventing the onset of epidemics. Which population groups will be affected? In which areas? To have access to this information, every evening all the doctors and hospitals in the city text us a list of cases they have diagnosed,” says Dr Vikas Desai, head of the Urban Health and Climate Resilience Centre, tasked with documenting epidemics linked to climate change. In addition to disease and flooding, rising temperatures are in themselves a problem in a region that already experiences intense summer heat. “In factories and slums air-conditioning is too expensive. The heat might drive the workforce away and rising temperatures impact on productivity,” says Kamlesh Yagnik, former head of the South Gujarat chamber of commerce. Various solutions are being explored, including painting rooftops with reflective paint that acts to lower temperatures inside. Local governance needs to be rethought from top to bottom for the city to become truly resilient. “The key to success will be coordination between all municipal departments,” Desai says. The Surat Climate Change Trust already brings together business leaders, policymakers and scientists. The city council will appoint a resilience manager this month and the authorities also benefit from exchanges with other Acccrn members, set to reach 100 by the end of the year. There are several scenarios for Surat’s future. The most optimistic foresees a dynamic economy and decentralised management of resources. But in the worst case the city council will prove unable to cope with urban sprawl and climate shocks, fuelling conflict between communities, rising crime and the departure of industry.

"Naomi Klein is the star of the new American left. At 44, the writer and activist has twice written blockbusters combining ground-level reporting and economic analysis that challenged people to take a hard look at what they took for granted: their shopping choices, America’s place in the world, and the devastating effects of arcane trade policy and rampant free market ideology. Along the way she gained a following that spans academics, celebrities and street and factory protesters. Her first book, No Logo, about the power of brands over sweatshop workers in Asia who made the products (and the consumers in America and Europe who consumed them), politicised a generation of twentysomethings. It became the handbook of the anti- globalisation protests, and inspired two Radiohead albums.  Seven years later, her second book, Shock Doctrine, analysed how wars, coups and natural disasters were used as a pretext to impose so-called “free market” measures. Now Klein is back, writing about capitalism, only this time the fate of the entire planet is at stake. With her new book, This Changes Everything: Capitalism vs The Climate, Klein hopes to set off the kind of powerful mass movement that could – finally – produce the radical changes needed to avoid a global warming catastrophe and fix capitalism at the same time. She argues that we have all been thinking about the climate crisis the wrong way around: it’s about capitalism – not carbon – the extreme anti-regulatory version that has seized global economies since the 1980s and has set us on a course of destruction and deepening inequality. “I think we are on a collision course,” she says. Twenty-five years ago, when the first climate scientist was called to testify to Congress and make global warming a policy challenge, there might have still been time for big industries to shrink their carbon footprints. But governments at the time were seized with the idea that there should be no restraints on industry. “During that time,” Klein writes, “we also expanded the road from a two lane, carbon-spewing highway to a six-lane superhighway.” When we meet in her Toronto home, Klein is juggling a schedule that combines the standard author book readings and television interviews and planning for an event in New York City billed as the biggest climate march ever seen. Her husband, film-maker Avi Lewis, is out shooting a companion film due for release in January. The two text back and forth during our chat. Klein does not easily fit into most people’s view of a committed environmentalist. She drives a car (it is a hybrid). She flies, already a lot more than most people, and is set to rack up air miles that would make her, by her own admission, “a climate criminal”. There is a brightly coloured plastic playhouse in the garden that was probably made in China. Yet she confesses to getting weepy when she thinks about the future under climate change. In a long conversation over the dining table, Klein says she is not about to purge her life of plastics or fossil fuels. She says she is not going to be trapped into “gotcha games” about personal habits. And she is definitely not going to subscribe to the idea that climate change ranks above all other causes. “I think there has been this really bad habit of environmentalists being insufferably smug, where they are sort of saying: ‘This is the issue that beats all other issues’ or, ‘Your issue doesn’t matter because nothing matters if the earth is fried.’” Klein says committed environmentalists aren’t her target anyway. “What I hope is less about what the greens will do, but what people who don’t consider themselves part of the green movement will do,” she says. “This book is not written for the environmental movement. It is written much more for people who would never read a book about climate change but are engaged with economic justice of other kinds.” That is where Klein believes she can do the most good. “I want to act, if I can, as a bridge for people who read Shock Doctrine or No Logo. People who are sitting out for whatever reasons.” Klein admits that even with her reputation for producing brainy economic analysis, and a crack research team to which she gives generous credit in the book and in conversation, it took three years of “marinating” in the material. “I have amazing research help. Basically what I spend my money on is research,” she says. “The way in which people talk about climate is just so wonky and so abstract and such a boys’ club that it makes a lot of women just roll their eyes or feel that they are somehow not qualified,” she says. “I certainly had to fight that feeling in myself in order to write about it.” The idea of writing about climate change took hold of Klein around the time of the 2009 Copenhagen climate summit – legendary now as a failure of international diplomacy. The summit of world leaders, convening soon after the US had its first “green president” in Barack Obama, was supposed to put the major economies on a glide path to cutting emissions. Klein came to the meeting planning to write about the great fight between rich and poor countries over the historic responsibility the US and Europe bore for causing climate change. She had dared to hope at one point that a climate deal would be the great equaliser – compensating Africa and Asia for colonialism. But the summit collapsed under the weight of those expectations. Leaders from Africa and small south Pacific Island states, which are slowly drowning under rising sea levels, wanted a more aggressive action that would limit the temperature rise to 1.5C; leaders from rich countries deemed the proposal bad for businesses and rejected it for fear it could cost them votes. “I wasn’t prepared for the naming of that inaction by the industrialised world as racism,” Klein says. “I was struck by the fact that African delegates were using words such as genocide, describing a two-degree temperature target as allowing Africa to burn.” She pauses. “I found the Copenhagen experience pretty devastating.” It was a difficult time for Klein personally as well. After the publication of Shock Doctrine, she was on the road for almost two years. She barely saw her husband. While she was travelling the world giving speeches and being hailed as an inspirational figure, Klein found herself in a rut. “I think I was profoundly depressed about 2008-2009,” she says. “I have always told myself that I would not spread hopelessness.” There are figures on the American left who just get up on stage and do these doom and apocalyptic presentations and it can be quite compelling. But I have seen it enough that I have told myself that if I ever get to that point, I will stay home.” She became convinced it was time to retreat, at least for a while. “I just didn’t feel that I had anything to offer, where I wasn’t just indulging my own despair.” There were other difficulties. Klein writes in the book of the surprising realisation that she did want children after all, and of her struggles through what she calls the “fertility factory” and miscarriages before she finally became pregnant. Her son, Toma, turned two this summer. The book is dedicated to him. But as she was preparing for publication, Klein was diagnosed, and operated on, for thyroid cancer; she says flatly she will not discuss the illness beyond that. For readers of Klein’s earlier works – or of Thomas Piketty’s analysis of inequality – the central message of the book will sound familiar. Capitalism, since it was unshackled by the deregulation of the 1980s, has widened the gap between rich and poor. The top 3% held 55% of all wealth last year, up from 45% in 1989. The bottom 90% controlled 24.7% of wealth, according to statistics released this month by the Federal Reserve. “It is not like everything is fine except for the problem that the temperature is going up a little bit,” Klein says. “If the only problem with capitalism was this slight temperature increase, we would really be cooked. But the fact is that there are lots of problems with this system, and on top of all of those problems, it is destabilising our planet’s life support system.” Klein believes the gap between the 1% and everyone else and the powerlessness of local governments to take control are casualties of global capital. To follow the course of action she prescribes would require a hostile takeover of large parts of the environmental movement. But that would be entirely warranted, it seems. Environmental groups have wasted time trying to recruit big business and billionaires to adopt pro-climate measures, she says. In the meantime, economies have continued to spew out carbon pollution, making a climate fix far more difficult. “We need an ideological battle. It is still considered politically unthinkable just to introduce straight-up, polluter-pays punitive measures – particularly in the US.” To Klein, environmentalists should have just gone to war on business, and on the whole concept of capitalism. In a devastating chapter, she details how the US’s biggest environmental group, the Nature Conservancy, earned money from oil and gas drilling on a parcel of Texas land it had set aside for conservation. She writes about the nightmarish scenarios surrounding geoengineering, or hacking the planet, by spraying seawater into the sky to create cloud cover, or simulating a volcanic eruption to fill the lower atmosphere with ash. Elsewhere, Klein takes on Richard Branson for failing to live up to his promise to set aside $3bn to fight climate change. “So much hope was put in this parade of billionaires to try and reconcile capitalism with climate,” she says. “When Branson entered the climate game, he posited it specifically as an alternative to regulation. He said ‘the governments aren’t going to do this, we’re going to do this. Go to the UN climate summit in a couple of weeks and it’s all going to be the new green economy and the head of Bank of America sitting down with the president of Mexico – and we are all going to do it together.’” She remains irritated. “That is a dangerous idea at this stage of history. We now have two decades to measure that model. We are not talking about a theory here, we are talking about a track record. I think it’s fair to say: ‘OK, we tried it your way and we don’t have another decade to waste.” In truth, Klein is vague in her book and our conversation about exactly how this would come about. In the book she talks about “an effervescent moment” – when popular protests converge to bring about real change – which comes after a section in the book titled “Magical Thinking”. There is a curious failure to really get to grips with questions about a real-world solution – Klein must have anticipated being asked. Especially given that she has often been acutely focused on what popular movements need to do to bring about concrete change; her message to Occupy, for instance, was that the movement needed to impose clear structures and institutions. If capitalism is going to destroy the world, why wouldn’t capitalism fix itself – if only for its own survival? “I don’t know if capitalism wants anything. The system itself doesn’t think as an entity – it thinks as a collection of self-interested profit-seeking units.” Asked why Obama is such a peripheral figure in her book, Klein is ambiguous. “I do think Obama is interesting but more in the sense of an absence,” she says. “Obama should have used the economic bailout of 2009 to impose new rules on car companies,” she says. (In fact, Obama used the bailout to spend up to $100bn on home retrofits, subways, and other climate-friendly measures. Klein overlooks these entirely.) “The fact that Obama blew that moment, to me, is one of the great tragedies of our times.” The fix she proposes broadly relies on scattered groups of climate organisers, grassroots and indigenous people’s groups that have been ready to take on corporate power in a way that Big Green is not. Klein admits that most environmental groups are too white, male, and middle class to connect with women, African-Americans, Latinos and the poor who will bear the brunt of climate change. She recalls that in their first manifestos, the Occupy protesters never even mentioned global warming. Klein is on the board of one of those emerging grassroots groups: 350.org has played a lead role in reframing a mundane pipeline project, the Keystone XL, until it was seen as one of the most critical environmental decisions of Obama’s presidency. The Keystone XL project, meant to transport tar sands crude from the vast Alberta tar sands, would probably be well on its way to completion, if the protests by 350.org and Nebraska landowners had not made the project a national issue. Obama has repeatedly put off making a decision about the pipeline. But the deciding factor in that delay was almost certainly the wealthy Democratic donors pushing behind the scenes, and threatening to cut off election funding. Even so, Klein continues to sees the Keystone fight, widespread local protests against fracking and campus divestment campaigns as the way forward on climate change. She argues there is little scope for individuals on their own to accomplish much, giving the examples of Toronto’s impressive carbon-cutting efforts. “It’s been kind of disastrous,” she says. “While we are all doing these green things, our country’s emissions are soaring because of the tar sands. People start feeling kind of like jerks. We are just sort of like suckers.” She goes so far as to lump centrist environmental leaders together with groups such as the Heartland Institute, which denies the existence of climate change. “Between the Heartlanders who recognise that climate change is a profound threat to our economic and social systems and therefore deny its scientific reality, and those who claim climate change requires only minor tweaks to business-as-usual and therefore allow themselves to believe in its reality, it’s not clear who is more deluded,” Klein writes in the book. Those are fighting words. Over the past few years, the oil and coal lobbies and, increasingly, super-rich ultra-conservatives in America have spent close to $1bn a year building a network of rightwing organisations that have blocked efforts to cut the emissions that cause climate change – often by claiming that climate change is not even happening. More than half of the Republicans elected to Congress now deny the existence of climate change. There are already signs of a pushback on Twitter from some environmental bloggers, even before the book’s release. But Klein – who over the years has endured pro-corporate backlash of her two earlier books and a ferocious assault for criticising Israel’s conduct against the Palestinians, says she is ready for it. “I think I have been through attacks that are far more personal and far more intense than what I am going to experience with this book.” She says she sees a new breed of climate activist, ready to go after corporate power in a way that Big Green is not. “They are going after the fossil fuel companies directly as opposed to just trying to go into business with them and gently cajole them into doing the right thing,” she says. At the same time she argues there has been a shift in attitudes about how people treat one another. “I am not in despair. I am excited by what I am seeing. I think that the task is enormous. I think we are nowhere close to where we need to be, but I think we are on a track. There is a track,” she says. • This Changes Everything: Capitalism vs the Climate by Naomi Klein is published by Allen Lane on 16 September."
"About 80% of the world’s economic output comes from cities, but they also account for 70% of energy use and associated emissions. At least 1bn people are expected to swell the population of developing world cities in the next 15 years, but if that growth is unstructured and unplanned it will incur economic, social and environmental costs – a lower quality of life for city residents, and problems for the future in global warming.  This does not need to be the case, as cities can be planned on sustainable lines with better quality of life, mass public transport, green spaces and better amenities – all of which will also enhance economic growth. Development on these lines could reduce the capital requirements for urban infrastructure by more than $3tn (£1.85bn) over the next 15 years, the report found. With the global population set to top 8bn by 2030, feeding the world will be an ever harder task. Increasing the productivity of existing agricultural land will be key.  If an eighth of the world’s degraded agricultural land were restored using modern techniques, it could feed 200m more people by 2030, and lead to lower greenhouse gas emissions. Clean energy systems will be crucial. The costs of key renewable energy technologies, especially wind and solar power generation, have fallen rapidly, and low-carbon energy could account for more than half of all new electricity generation within 15 years. Energy efficiency must also be pursued, lowering costs and improving economic productivity. These moves could also help to provide electricity for the more than 1bn people who currently do not have it. We are using too many of the planet’s resources too profligately, and part of the reason is that our economies are geared not to value resources properly. For instance, subsidies for clean energy amount to only about $100bn a year, but fossil fuel subsidies top $600bn. Phasing out bad subsidies will supporting good ones could lead to a reallocation of resources to benefit economies and the poor. A lack of public financing and support for low-carbon infrastructure means that capital is not being allocated to sustainable infrastructure, including low-carbon transport and industries. Financial instruments such as green bonds and risk-sharing between public and private institutions could cut the cost of capital for sustainable growth, for instance by up to about a fifth for low-carbon electricity alone. New technologies and the promotion of existing low-carbon industries could play a strong role in driving economic growth while cutting emissions. This must encompass IT and communications, innovation in materials, life sciences and other aspects of technology. This will require well-targeted public expenditure on research and development as well as the removal of market barriers to new technologies and business models. All of these will require new policies and a stable regulatory framework to encourage growth and investment along sustainable lines. The report recommends setting a price on carbon, committing to an end of deforestation globally by 2030 with appropriate support for forested nations, the restoration of at least 500m hectares of lost or degraded forests by the same date, and a ban on new unabated coal-fired power plants in developed countries immediately, and in rapidly developing countries (middle income countries) by 2025."
"Efforts to forge a new global agreement on global warming will not repeat the mistakes that dogged the landmark climate summit in Copenhagen five years ago, Ban Ki-moon’s special envoy on climate change has vowed. “This is a different environment to Copenhagen,” Mary Robinson, the former president of Ireland, told the Guardian. “Pressure on leaders for an agreement is building up more than 12 months ahead. I think leaders realise they need to have transformative change.”  More than 120 heads of state are meeting at a climate summit in New York on Tuesday, convened by the UN secretary-general in the hope that a series of personal meetings will allow them to break the stalemate that has marked climate negotiations for most of the last two decades. It is the first time that world leaders will meet to discuss global warming since the Copenhagen summit. Although that occasion produced the first joint commitments on emissions by major developing as well as developed economies, it was marred by scenes of chaos and recriminations in the closing hours. But Robinson, who served as UN high commissioner for human rights from 1997 to 2002, said that this time there should be a deal on the table in advance of governments meeting. Though a comprehensive climate deal has often seemed elusive, Robinson insisted that the world’s governments would be capable of a solution. “We have done it before, on issues such as slavery. We need to move as rapidly as possible.” She played down concerns that China and India had snubbed the secretary-general’s meeting, as neither Chinese president Xi Jinping and India’s prime minister Narendra Modi are planning to go. “China [is sending] a very, very senior participant,” she said. She said she was hopeful of progress. “We need ten to 12 leaders to be ambitious...President Obama, I hope, will make a strong statement at the summit. ” This week’s summit of leaders will be followed by a series of meetings by ministers and other officials culminating in a crunch conference in Paris next December. At that meeting, governments are supposed to forge a new global agreement on greenhouse gases for beyond 2020, when current emissions targets run out. By the end of next March, said Robinson, all major economies, developed and developing, should have put forward their proposals on national emissions targets for beyond the end of the decade. But key issues remain to be resolved, including whether future emissions should be divided up according to a “carbon budget”, based on scientific estimates of how much more carbon dioxide can be poured into the atmosphere without pushing the world over 2C of warming above pre-industrial levels. That symbolic threshold is regarded as the limit of safety, beyond which the effects of climate change - including droughts, floods and extreme weather - are likely to become severe and potentially irreversible. There are still deep divisions over how far major developing countries should have to take a share of emissions cuts, and to what extent issues such as the historic responsibility for emissions, per capita emissions, and likely future economic circumstances should be taken into account. The attempt to draw a distinction between the events of Copenhagen and the current negotiations reflects the high stakes involved. Paris is widely seen as a last chance for the UN process, which has been running since 1992 but has suffered a series of highs and lows, including the 1997 Kyoto protocol which went unratified by the US, the drama of the Copenhagen summit, and long wrangling over seemingly intractable issues such as how to provide financial incentives for cuts in emissions and a price on carbon. For some countries, the stakes are even higher.  Anote Tong, president of Kiribati, one of the Pacific Ocean’s small island nations, visited the Arctic ahead of this week’s meeting. He told the Guardian: “We are facing [climate change] now. I have seen how much ice is being lost and it is very serious. I will be bringing this message.”"
"Desmond Tutu, the Nobel peace prize winner and activist, has called for an international campaign to boycott mining companies, oil corporations and other businesses involved in the trade of fossil fuels. Writing exclusively in the Observer prior to this week's UN climate summit in New York, Tutu says the same approach that was taken by the 1980s anti-apartheid campaign, of which he was a leader, should now be adopted in the battle to halt global warming. ""The most devastating effects of climate change – deadly storms, heat waves, droughts, rising food prices and the advent of climate refugees – are being visited on the world's poor,"" he states. ""Those who have no involvement in creating the problem are the most affected, while those with the capacity to arrest the slide dither. Africans, who emit far less carbon than the people of any other continent, will pay the steepest price. It is a deep injustice.""  In his Observer article, Tutu urges world leaders including President Barack Obama to take a strong lead in setting up carbon emission curbs. However, he also proposes the launching of a populist campaign that would mirror the anti-apartheid campaigns, which argued that firms which conducted business with apartheid South Africa were aiding and abetting an immoral system. The businesses were targeted and their goods were boycotted. Now Tutu wants to repeat this process for global warming. ""Nobody should profit from the rising temperatures, seas and human suffering caused by the burning of fossil fuels,"" he states. ""We can boycott events, sports teams and media programming sponsored by fossil fuel companies; demand that their advertisements carry health warnings; organise car-free days and other platforms to build broader societal awareness."""

"A number of commentators – including one in the Guardian this week – have suggested that refugee law and protections should be extended to include people affected by climate change. But many Pacific islanders explicitly reject the idea of “climate refugee” status.   On the face of it, that seems like a strange decision. Kiribati’s president Anote Tong has predicted that rising sea levels will make the island nation uninhabitable in 30-60 years. Aren’t many Pacific islands facing climate impacts that mean their citizens will have to move?   Despite that, last week President Tong told ABC News: “I have never encouraged the status of our people being refugees … We have to acknowledge the reality that with the rising sea, the land area available for our populations will be considerably reduced and we cannot accommodate all of them, so some of them have to go somewhere, but not as refugees.” There are a number of reasons why “climate refugee” status does not make sense for people who might have to move. Legally, the idea of a “climate refugee” is contentious. It currently has no standing in international law. And even if it did, the concept would be fraught with problems.  When people move because of the impacts of climate change, they tend to move within their own country. This is clear from testimonies of people fleeing recent disasters in the Philippines: “I lost one of my grandchildren and my younger sister. Early the next morning, rescue workers came with boats and they took us to an evacuation centre.” – ShelterBox / Reuters “We were trapped in the house for two days until someone came and rescued us in a boat, and we were taken to the local gymnasium which was being used as an evacuation centre. We stayed there for a week but it was so crowded that we decided to leave and go back to the ruins of our house.” – ReliefWeb These testimonies are a good illustration of the evidence on movement during disasters. People move very short distances, without crossing international borders and often return to their homes as soon as possible. A modified Refugee Convention would be of no use to them.  Slowly unfolding disasters like droughts, changing rainfall and desertification create different patterns of movement. It is often internal, and often from the countryside to cities. When people do cross a border, it is often to find work. Although climate change might be among the factors causing their movement, their primary motivator is employment. For many this can be a vital escape route. Though many see the situation in cities as being equally desperate to the situations they are fleeing. Take this testimony is from a Colombian farmer affected by changing rainfall patterns: Rains recently have been very intense – very intense… We don’t want to leave our land: here are our past, our memories, our ancestors. We don’t want to move to other parts, we don’t know what to do there. We would turn into delinquents. We’d enter into a cycle of poverty which happens in the cities. Protecting these people means two things: making sure they can move to find work legally if they want to, and making sure the places and work are safe. In these requirements lie a much bigger question of urban development that cannot be fixed by altering the Refugee Convention. Rightly or wrongly the term “refugee” conjures powerful images. Tended camps; people moving in urgent distress; leaving their homes and walking huge distances. Powerful photos of the Za’arti refugee camp in Syria spring to mind when you say the word “refugee.” In the Pacific, it also brings to mind images of people making desperate ocean crossing to gain entry to Australia. The media is awash with photos of people huddled in small boats. The desperation and drama is inescapable.  Across the world, refugees encounter racism and discrimination. Host governments often do little to challenge this. In the UK, we continue to imprison people seeking asylum. The rise of far-right parties across developed countries has fueled anti-refugee sentiment. In the Pacific, the Australian government has drawn sharp criticism from human rights campaigners and academics over its treatment of refugees and asylum seekers. So the prospect of becoming a refugee comes with a lot of baggage. This is a tragic reality. But it explains why many people do not like the term “climate refugee” and why they do not see the creation of climate-refugee status as a good solution. So what is the answer? Many civil society groups within the Pacific talk about migration with dignity. In practice, this can mean a number of things. It could involve planned relocation, where entire communities move together. Cultural practices, family connections and customs are maintained and the community is reestablished in a safer location. Or it can mean migration bit by bit and integration into new communities. Many people from Pacific island nations are already working and studying abroad. Some see the continuation of this trend as the solution.  As Ursula Rakova, an environmental campaigner from the Carteret Islands, puts it: “Our plan is one in which we remain as independent and self-sufficient as possible. We wish to maintain our cultural identity and live sustainably wherever we are.” Alex Randall runs the Climate Change and Migration Coalition, a network of refugee and migration NGOs with a shared concern about climate change.

"Rethinking prosperity is a vital task because our prevailing vision of the good life – and the economics intended to deliver it – have both come badly unstuck. Financial markets are unstable; inequality is rising; and despite the 500,000 or so people who took to the streets before Tuesday’s UN Climate Summit in New York, tackling climate change still faces a “frustrating lack of progress”. If this were not enough, the proposition that more is always better has signally failed to deliver, particularly in the affluent west. But questioning these values is deemed to be the act of lunatics, idealists and revolutionaries. This was brought home to me at the launch of the Sustainable Development Commission’s inquiry, Redefining Prosperity, which explored the relationship between economic growth and sustainability. “So this is what sustainability means,” fumed one disgruntled Treasury official. “Going back to live in caves.” This visceral response served as a foundation for my work at the commission, prompting me to frame our entire inquiry as a careful attempt to unravel the “dilemma of growth”. Beneath the dynamics of unemployment and the pervasive logic of consumerism, it was disconcerting to find an even deeper cause, a kind of existential angst about our place in the world.  Five years of austerity policy has done nothing to assuage that anxiety. When David Cameron announced that he was putting his cabinet on a war footing in the “global race for growth”, you could almost smell the fear of failure that haunts us all: a fear so powerful we would rather throw ourselves on the mercy of global competition than stop for a second to scrutinise what truly brings us prosperity and revise our economics to fit it. “A global race … means an hour of reckoning for countries like ours,” warned the Tory leader. “Sink or swim. Do or decline.” Politicians love this kind of rhetoric. But is it too demanding to expect something better from science? Enlightenment thinkers never intended progress to be a relentless expansion of desire. They suggested rather that society could learn to improve itself through a critical attention to the world around us and to our own place within it. We learned over time that this scrutiny could never be entirely dispassionate. But neither should it substitute dogma for careful inquiry. Don’t get me wrong. There is much to admire in the New Climate Economy report: Better Growth, Better Climate. Its careful accounting of the additional investment needed for a low-carbon transition is timely. Its ten-point Global Action Plan is absolutely spot-on. To get any government to pay serious attention to just one element in the plan – bringing down the cost of capital for low carbon investment – would be a serious accomplishment. Does any of this justify the overt framing of the entire report around a dubious claim that we can eat our cake and still have it? As President Obama tweeted on the day the report was released: “[t]his study concludes that no one has to choose between fighting climate change and growing the economy.” If you want the president of the most powerful nation in the world to sit up and tweet, you obviously shouldn’t start by stimulating deep-seated anxieties. Still, this doesn’t quite excuse the sideswipes that Better Growth, Better Climate launches in the direction of those less than convinced by the existing economic model. We learn early on, for instance that questions of growth have been “embroiled in controversy and ideological argument”; and we’re reassured that the approach of the New Climate Economy, by contrast, has been “to adopt the perspective of those who make the major economic decisions which affects people’s lives today”. In the hands of Nobel-prize-winning Paul Krugman, this thinly veiled appeal to the wisdom of the incumbency verges on outright ridicule directed at those who dare to question it. Better Growth, Better Climate “may sound too good to be true, but it isn’t”, insists the New York Times columnist. “These are serious, careful analyses.” He denounces any suggestion that decoupling growth from carbon emissions might prove difficult as “a fuzzy-headed misconception” and accuses the “left-leaning” growth sceptics of getting into bed with the extreme right climate sceptics. Krugman’s intent is clear: don’t touch growth, it’s sacrosanct. I’m reminded ultimately of Gandhi’s improbable claim: “First they ignore you, then they laugh at you, then they fight you, then you win.” It’s good to know that we’re beyond the ignoring stage. And it’s probably right to acknowledge there will be struggles ahead. That’s precisely as it should be, because there are real, complex challenges inherent in confronting the dilemma of growth – not the least of which is what to do about the visceral fear that haunts our economics and undermines our hope. But none of this should stand in the way of rethinking prosperity; and there are perfectly sound reasons for supposing that improving our prosperity is not at all synonymous with growing the economy.

"Poor countries have had to divert large chunks of their budget to adapt to climate change and run the risk of crowding out spending on health and education, a new report suggests. Over four years from 2008-11, Ethiopia committed 14% of its national budget to climate change, or nearly half of the national spending on primary education. Meanwhile, Tanzania spent 5%, which is almost two-thirds of its health spending, according to the report by the Overseas Development Institute (ODI).  Ethiopia, Tanzania and Uganda, the three countries featured in the report, are heavily dependent on rain-fed agriculture and have all experienced higher temperatures and reductions of water sources consistent with climate change. All have invested heavily to adapt their farming and cities in the absence of promised international aid, said Neil Bird, a climate researcher at ODI who wrote the report. The study exposes large funding gaps between each country’s proposals to address climate change and what is available. Ethiopia’s climate change strategy calls for annual spending of $7.5bn (£4.5bn), but the country is estimated to be able to afford only around $440m per year. Tanzania needs around $650m a year to address current climate risks and enhance its resilience but can only spend of $383m. Uganda’s climate change policy is estimated to cost $258m per year compared to current public spending in the region of $25m per year. The report, released on the eve of the New York climate summit where world leaders will seek to catalyse action on climate change, highlights how poor countries are overwhelmingly having to finance adaptation to climate change themselves: “There is an existing international commitment to provide $100bn a year from 2020, but ODI’s research shows that the current estimates of global adaptation finance amount to a tiny fraction of that sum”. “In the whole of sub-Saharan Africa, international support to assist countries adapt to climate change has averaged only $130m annually, far less than the $1.1bn that the UK alone spent on the floods three years ago, in what Archbishop Desmond Tutu calls ‘adaptation apartheid’,” said Bird. In contrast to the minimal help offered to countries that have played no role in man-made climate change, rich countries are already investing heavily in adaptation through strengthened flood-defence systems, coastal protection and other measures. The UK spent approximately £700m on flood defences between 2010 and 2011. Poorer countries and their citizens have to address the adaptation challenge with far fewer resources, says the report. “While richer countries invest heavily in flood-defence systems, coastal protection and other projects, poorer countries have no choice but to divert scarce resources, potentially reversing the progress made in tackling poverty,” said Kevin Watkins, executive director of ODI. In Ethiopia, Tanzania and Uganda climate change is seen as an economic development issue rather than solely an environmental concern. This is reflected in the spending ministries such as agriculture, water and energy. Relevant government programmes include irrigation projects, dry-land management initiatives and development projects designed to promote renewable energy and energy efficiency. The ODI urges greater transparency to increase confidence in the effectiveness of climate finance and proposes a new approach to supporting national action on climate change. This suggests that public climate finance from the international community should match the level of domestic public spending relevant to climate change in those countries acknowledged to be the most vulnerable."
"Barack Obama applied the brakes to the most critical component of his climate change plan on Tuesday, slowing the process of setting new rules cutting carbon pollution from power plants, and casting a shadow over a landmark United Nations’ summit on global warming. The proposed power plant rules were meant to be the signature environmental accomplishment of Obama’s second term.  The threat of a delay in their implementation comes just one week before a heavily anticipated UN summit where officials had been looking to Obama to show leadership on climate change. In a conference call with reporters, the Environmental Protection Agency said it was extending the public comment period on the power plant rules for an additional 45 days, until 1 December. The delay follows heavy lobby by Republicans and industry lobby groups to delay the rule – or withdraw it outright. Fifteen governors had called on Obama and the EPA to withdraw the proposed regulations, which would cut carbon pollution from existing power plants. Some electricity companies had argued that the rules were extraordinarily complex, clocking in at about 1,600 pages, and they needed extra time to study the full implications. But a delay puts the EPA on an even tighter deadline to finalise the rule before Obama leaves office in 2016. Even before Tuesday’s extension, the initial comment period for the new EPA rule was already longer than the norm. The EPA’s acting assistant administrator, Janet McCabe, insisted that extending the comment period would not put the rule in jeopardy. “We will have plenty of time,” she said. McCabe also brushed aside suggestions that the delay would send the wrong message to leaders arriving for the UN climate summit in New York next week. UN officials called the leaders’ meeting – the first in five years – to help build momentum for efforts to seal a global climate change deal by the end of 2015. Some officials had said the US power plant rules could help get the other big emitters, notably China and India, to cut their own emissions. The EPA official said the snag in the EPA rules would have no effect on the summit. “The message it sends is that we want the best rule possible,” McCabe said. “I think it is clear from that action that have been taking all along at the EPA that we are fully committed to moving this rule through and getting it finalised.” The proposed rule, announced in June, would cut carbon pollution from the country’s power plants by an average of 30% over 2005 levels. Some of those reductions could be achieved by switching to natural gas, but the new rules would have caused the shutdown of many coal plants. The coal industry, some utility companies, and Republicans in Congress have accused Obama and the EPA of waging war on coal with new rules. A number of campaigners said they hoped the delay would give the EPA time to wear down industry opposition to the rules. However, a leading industry lobby group, Americans for Clean Coal Electricity, remained unmoved by the promise of extra time to review the proposed rule. “The fact remains that the agency’s proposed regulations are among the costliest our country has ever seen,” the lobby group said. “Considering how fundamentally flawed these regulations are, EPA could save all involved a lot of time, money and economic hardship if it just withdrew its proposal altogether.” The threatened delay in the power plant rules also overshadowed a key environmental initiative at the White House on Tuesday to phase out production and use of a powerful greenhouse gas used in refrigerators and air conditioners by 2020. The White House, noting the UN summit, said the measure would help remove one of the biggest threats to the climate in the short-term. The measures announced on Tuesday follow on from a series of deals to reduce hydroflourocarbons (HFCs) with China and the G7, HFCs are 10,000 times stronger than carbon dioxide as a greenhouse gas. “Unless we act now, US HFC emissions are expected to nearly double by 2020 and triple by 2030,” the White House said in a statement. Under the initiative, about two dozen chemical and other companies, including Dupont, Honeywell and Coca Cola, agreed to phase out or eliminate the use of HFCs throughout the production chain. Government contractors also said they would cut down on the use of HFCs. A number of the companies at the White House on Tuesday had already begun to phase out their use, in response to European Union measures and in anticipation of an eventual ban on some types of coolants. But Durwood Zaelke, president of the Institute for Governance and Sustainable Development,said the initiative on HFCs was still a move in the right direction. “The White House has managed to cajole industry into bolder commitments phasing out higher HFCs and greater energy efficiency refrigerators and supermarket chillers that make our food cold,” he said. “This is what the president can do when Congress wil not act. It is a big step.”"

"The secretary general of the United Nations, Ban Ki-moon, is to join a public march calling for action on climate change this weekend. “I will link arms with those marching for climate action,” Ban told a press conference. “We stand with them on the right side of this key issue for our common future.”  His unusual step – high-ranking officials do not normally attend mass public protests – is a measure of how high the stakes are at a summit next week of world leaders, called by the secretary-general, to discuss climate change. Barack Obama, David Cameron and scores of other heads of state and government from around the world are expected to talk about ways to cut greenhouse gas emissions, in preparation for a crunch meeting in Paris next year at which world governments are supposed to sign a new global agreement on the climate. Ban said: “Action on climate change is urgent. The more we delay, the more we will pay in lives and in money. The climate summit that I am convening one week from today has two goals: to mobilise political will for a universal and meaningful climate agreement next year in Paris; and second to generate ambitious steps to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and strengthen resilience. We are anticipating an impressive turnout of leaders from government, business, finance and civil society. Most important, we are expecting significant commitments and progress.” No further details were available on Ban’s involvement, but the organisers of the climate march are hoping for tens of thousands of people to turn out in support of their aims. Ban has appointed Leonard di Caprio, the actor, as a UN “messenger of peace” with special responsibility for climate change. “His global stardom is the perfect match for this global challenge,” Ban said. Di Caprio will address the opening of the climate summit in New York on 23 September. Assembling world leaders to talk about climate change is a risky strategy, however. The last time Ban called such a summit was before the Copenhagen climate conference of 2009, which marked the first time that developed and major developing countries made joint commitments on curbing greenhouse gas emissions but was a PR disaster as the final days were marked by chaos and recriminations. The UN’s hope is that bringing leaders together in a series of private meetings will allow them more latitude to make new commitments, which are needed as current targets to cut emissions run out in 2020. Already, the Chinese and Indian governments have indicated that they will not send high-ranking officials to the summit, with both Narendra Modi, India’s prime minister, and Xi Jinping, China’s leader, unlikely to attend. Mindy Lubber, president of Ceres, a global coalition of investors concerned about climate change, said the secretary general’s decision to attend the march “sent a very important signal” about the importance of the summit. “This is a chance for real progress,” she told the Guardian. Though governments have been meeting to talk about climate change for more than two decades, the momentum behind next week’s meeting could lead to a breakthrough, she said."
"Today marks an important milestone in the emergence of a growing and increasingly significant movement to withdraw investments from fossil fuels and reinvest them into clean energy. Ahead of the UN Climate Summit, it has been announced that organisations and individuals controlling investments of more than £30bn have committed to divesting their dirty energy investments, seven of which – controlling £250m of assets – are from the UK. It was only three years ago that the Divest-Invest movement was founded: it’s goal to encourage institutions, foundations, charities, wealthy individuals – in fact anyone with investments – to commit to taking them out of industries that promote fossil fuels and into the clean energy sector. Three years on and almost 170 foundations and 600 wealthy philanthropists controlling a staggering £30bn of finance have pledged to do just that, and while this might, in the context of the global financial markets, be a drop in the ocean, it is an encouraging start. Like any other sector, the clean energy sector depends increasingly on funding from the capital markets. The more we invest in them the quicker the technology like solar, wind and tidal power will become part of our everyday lives.  But this movement is not driven by sentiment; it’s driven by long-term economic reality. Titans like Exxon Mobil have been underperforming the S&P 500 over the past five years, causing savvy investors to look beyond traditional powerhouses for opportunities. It’s becoming clear that the planet only has sufficient fossil fuels to power our houses and power stations for a very limited period. These declines aren’t the result of a crackdown in climate policy, they are the result of market forces. Coal is declining because of the surge in cheap and abundant gas, while cheap oil is harder to come by, leading excavators to tap exotic and sensitive reserves, such as remote deposits in Arctic waters. Gas itself is notably volatile, and many industrial users are opting to lock-in stable renewable energy in a 20-year power purchase agreement, rather than risk gas’s mercurial highs and lows. Meanwhile, non-fossil energy is roaring down its cost curves: the price of solar panels, for example, has dropped 70% over the past five years. This isn’t environmentalism, it’s the free market, and the results are impressive. On some days Germany gets over half its power from the sun and wind. Soon it will be drawing 30% daily as a matter of course. The conventional wisdom was that we should pursue maximum returns through a realpolitik investment strategy, even if that meant investing in climate change. But new realisations have helped us turn conventional wisdom on its head: it is a fact that the world is getting hotter because we keep putting heat-trapping gases like carbon dioxide into the air when we burn fuel for electricity. Every year we burn coal, oil and gas, we add another blanket to the planet. The upshot is that we have a set carbon budget. If we bust this budget, there’s no line of credit to back us up, no extra planet to go home to. At least five major studies over the past 18 months – most recently PricewaterhouseCooper’s 2014 Annual Report – stress that we are dangerously close to busting our carbon budget. Yet companies such as Shell and BP are together spending close to a trillion dollars in looking for additional reserves to exploit. We don’t accept this logic, and nor do other members of the coalition of fossil free investors we are proud to join this September 22 in New York City. High net-worth individuals, such as Ben Cohen of Ben & Jerry’s Foundation; cities, such as Oakland in California; academic institutions, such as Stanford University; faith groups, such as the Quakers; health care systems, such as the British Medical Association; and pension funds, such as Darwin Superannuation Fund, are divesting their portfolios of the top 200 coal, oil and gas producers. They are getting out while the getting is good, and seeding the clean energy future while they are at it. Of course, divestment is not the only option, but there is a need for holders of investments to act like owners and take responsibility for the impact of their investments. At the very least they must engage with the issues to ensure that the risk of assets being stranded – where they suffer from unanticipated or premature write-downs, devaluations or conversion to liabilities – is considered and action is taken by companies, organisations and individuals to avoid this risk. It is no surprise that the fossil-free movement is the fastest growing divestment movement in history: the financial and moral imperatives to divest from the past and invest in the future have never been so seamlessly paired. We hope the heads of state gathering this week at the UN Climate Summit will take a lead also. I’m proud that UK foundations are taking up the challenge, but more needs to be done to show the world that we can be leaders on the global stage when it comes to a green future.

"This weekend saw what’s been called the largest climate march in history. From London to Dhaka and Delhi, an estimated 570,000 people in 161 countries took part in events to call for action ahead of the UN Climate Summit which starts onTuesday 23 October in New York. Added to the people power on the streets was a strong dose of celebrity endorsement. We’ve seen Sir Paul McCartney rapping about the environmental impact of eating meat, and actress Emma Thompson calling climate denial “a form of collective suicide”. There is little doubt that the People’s Climate March, and the publicity it has galvanised, marks one of the most visible, organised, and global engagements with the issue of climate change. What is less certain is what this energy and visibility will amount to. For now, the objective is seemingly to put pressure on leaders to come to New York with strong commitments. But the meeting in the US is only a stepping stone to the key milestone on the horizon: COP21 in Paris next year. It is there that a new global climate treaty will being pinned down. So once this week’s placards have been put back in the cupboard and the face paint washed off, will the momentum dissipate before December 2014, let alone survival until the Paris discussions? The disappointment of previous climate conferences - notably Copenhagen in 2009 where hype and hope turned to hurt – still looms in the collective memory of the movement. So how can campaigners and civil society leaders prevent history from repeating itself and capitalise instead on the renewed momentum?  What is the best strategy for ensuring that the energy on the streets translates into tangible policy change? And what groups are in the best position to take leadership on the issue?

"Barack Obama will not be pledging any cash to a near-empty fund for poor countries at a United Nations summit on climate change next week, the UN special climate change envoy said on Friday. The UN secretary general, Ban Ki-moon, has challenged the 125 world leaders attending the 23 September summit to make “bold pledges” to the fund, intended to help poor countries cope with climate change.  The UN has been pressing rich countries to come up with pledges of between $10bn and $15bn. “We are putting a lot of pressure for them to do it at the summit on the 23rd,” the UN envoy and former Irish president, Mary Robinson, told the Guardian on the sidelines of a US Agency for International Development meeting. But she added: “I know the United States is not going to commit because I’ve asked.” Obama put climate change at the top of his second term agenda, and the administration unveiled a host of new green measures in the run-up to next week’s meeting, including an initiative to cut the extremely potent greenhouse gas used as a coolant in refrigerators and air conditioners. Obama’s speech to the summit will showcase those US actions, such as proposed new rules cutting carbon pollution from power plants. “The president will use his speech at the climate summit to call on other leaders to keep their ambitions high and to work for a strong global framework to cut emissions,” White House adviser John Podesta told a conference call with reporters. Todd Stern, the state department climate envoy, told the call those measures put Obama in a stronger position to help broker an international climate deal next year. But cash for the Green Climate Fund – to help poor countries move off fossil fuels and protect their people from rising seas, heat waves and other consequences of climate change – will not be part of Obama’s agenda at this UN meeting. The summit is intended to help catalyse action on climate change – and UN officials have said repeatedly it is not a negotiating session. Instead, the meeting is being seen as a test of willingness of rich and poor countries to buckle down in the next 15 months and do the work needed to reach a deal that will cut greenhouse gas emissions and help insulate the world from effects of climate change. Climate finance is a critical part of reaching a deal. Poorest countries did the least to cause climate change, but scientists say they will suffer the worst impacts. Rich countries committed to the Green Climate Fund in 2009, pledging to mobilise $100bn a year by 2020 to help poor countries deal with climate change. So far, only Germany has made a significant contribution, with Chancellor Angela Merkel pledging $1bn over four years in July, potentially poisoning the atmosphere for future negotiations. “We must have a commitment on the Green Climate Fund. It has to be capitalised to a minimum of $10bn and hopefully between $12bn and $15bn,” Robinson said. “It is important for the trust between countries that rich countries really take responsibility. There were commitments made to have $100bn a year by 2020 but we are still not seeing that fleshed out.” Developing countries have said they want to see promises of $15bn for the fund this year. Leaders of small island states, which face getting drowned by sea level rise, are also demanding to see cash – as well as strong action on climate. “From those of us on the front line – or from our perspective on the water line – we need to hear the leaders at the the summit say very clearly they are prepared to take stronger actions than before to reduce emissions,” Tony de Brum, the foreign minister of the Marshall Islands, told a conference call hosted by the World Resources Institute thinktank. “They also need to bring climate financing to the table.” Robinson said she expected to see pledges from European countries and South Korea at the summit, and maybe Mexico and Costa Rica as well, to demonstrate that the UN is casting the net wider for funding. Other UN officials were hopeful of filling the pot. Bob Orr, a UN assistant secretary general for policy, said the organisation hoped to see funds beginning to flow at the summit. “The secretary general has been calling on all the government of the world to fill this empty shell,” he told a panel organised by the Center for American Progress. “We will see a good downpayment on that next week.”"
"The nostalgia is as powerful as the crowd’s determined presence. As climate change protesters filled New York City’s Avenue of the Americas on Sunday, the red lettering of Radio City Music Hall’s vertical sign added its baffled chorus, a muttering bystander perplexed by these people and the crisis about which they speak and sing. Change? What change? Who’s talking about change? This auditorium built in 1932, with its hydraulic stage that can raise a nativity scene miraculously from nowhere for its Christmas show (I know, I took the backstage tour once), is a survivor from an age long before anyone worried about the climate. God knows we had our troubles in the 30s, Radio City might say if it could speak, but the rain and the sun were fixtures. Now what?  All the architecture of the part of Manhattan seen in this photograph – just west of the Rockefeller Center on an avenue crowded with skyscrapers like great silver bricks, regular and strong as the land that made them – dates from America’s golden age of self-confidence, when Manhattan was the city of the Empire State, when - crises of capitalism aside – corporate wealth would just keep growing and the world getting more modern. Manhattan is capital of the modern, as the modern was defined from roughly 1920 to 1970. Yet its reassuringly old-fashioned vision of the new is thrown into startling relief by this photograph of a demonstration against uncontrolled industry, against the irresponsible use of resources, agains modernity as New York has defined it so iconically. At the top of the avenue, beyond the crowd, floats the green canopy of Central Park. Laid out before the skyscrapers, this is more than an urban lung. It is a time machine, for among its layers of civilized leisure, artful landscaping, fields and playgrounds, this park preserves massive outcrops of rock unchanged since Manhattan was a wilderness. Those rocks are more timely now than Radio City’s faded glamour. History does not move forward. That is one lesson of the climate crisis. There is no inevitable forward rush of progress, as capitalists and communists both believed when the Avenue of the Americas was paraded by men in metallic-grey suits to the far-off strains of jazz from downtown. The architecture of confidence that looms over the marchers in this photograph is outmoded. Its beauty today lies in its quaint, straight-lined belief in a future that turned out to be stranger than Sinatra. The trees in the park are more in tune with the reality the marchers are drawing attention to. They were specific in their facts, those people down there. This was the hottest summer on record. The world is headed for a 4.5C temperature rise. This is a new New York, being born out of the old. Can the city that once proudly symbolized carbon consumption and energy excess – from the Chrysler Building to the Pan-Am Building – become a center of resistance to the destructive forces chewing up the world’s future? Or perhaps that is too optimistic. For much as the architecture that frames this picture is a blast from the past, a nostalgic memory of booms gone by, it also expresses something deeply attractive, to many people, about the modern dream. Logically, to save the planet, we need to be running for those trees. We need to reject the big brash concrete and steel dreams of the modern metropolis and cultivate simple, more rustic aspirations. To green the imagination. Yet skyscrapers are still being built, all over the world. People love them. The dream of Manhattan is infectious. Everyone wants a piece of it. Marching through Manhattan, between precipices of sublime modernity, the climate movement needs to find a way to subdue their lingering old world allure. The modern city and its poisons need to become smaller and softer. Yet it is not easy to make our imaginations prefer the green trees to those majestic towers and their dangerous, intoxicating fantasy of freedom from nature."

"Julie Bishop has told a UN summit that Australia has an “ambitious” carbon emissions reduction target but did not address the crucial question of what the country’s goal of dealing with climate change beyond 2020 will be. The foreign affairs minister told the Major Economies Forum in New York that Australia was “serious about taking practical steps in response to climate change”.  “In terms of ways to drive near-term action on climate change, Australia remains committed to reducing emissions by 5% below 2000 levels by 2020,” she said. “This is an ambitious target. Australia will reduce emissions by 22% against business-as-usual levels. This compares well to other major economies. It has bipartisan support in Australia.” Bishop said Australia was committed to a “global and enduring climate agreement in 2015”, which is when nations gather in Paris to set what many hope will be strong emissions reduction commitments beyond 2020. She said it was important that the major emitters, such as the US and China, put forward their pledges well in advance of the Paris meeting. Australia would “consider its post-2020 target as part of the review we will be conducting in 2015 on Australia’s international targets and settings”. “This review will focus on the extent to which other nations, including the major economies and Australia’s trading partners, are taking real and comparable action to reduce emissions,” she said. Bishop was speaking ahead of a one-day UN meeting, attended by 125 world leaders, that is intended to galvanise governments to create strong post-2020 commitments. Ban Ki-moon, the UN secretary general, has called for “bold announcements and actions” from nations, while a series of rallies held across the world ahead of the meeting urged governments to take urgent action to head off dangerous climate change. While Australia plans to cut emissions by 5% by 2020, the US has a target of 17% by this period, on 2005 levels. The European Union’s 28 member states have a commitment to a 20% emissions cut by 2020, with the European Commission president committing this week to a 40% reduction by 2030. Australia’s Climate Change Authority, which the Coalition government wishes to abolish, has called the country’s 5% goal “inadequate”, calling for a reduction of at least 15%. The Coalition’s plan to reduce emissions is its Direct Action policy, which it has yet to legislate. The $2.55bn plan involves the paying of grants to businesses that wish to reduce their emissions. The government has not conducted any modelling on the effectiveness of the policy, with independent analysis finding that it will struggle to meet the 5% reduction target. Figures released this week showed that the world emitted a record 36 billion tonnes of greenhouses gases in 2013, with that total set to rise by a further 2.5% this year. This puts the planet on course for warming of between 3.2C and 5.4C by 2100 – a temperature level that is considered largely incompatible with modern human civilisation. John Connor, chief executive of the Climate Institute, said from New York that it would be a “great disappointment” if Bishop did not at least lay out a timeline for Australia’s post-2020 emissions targets at the UN summit. “We also really want Australia to reiterate its commitment to avoiding 2C of global warming,” he said. “We can’t pretend a 5% is adequate. You may get away with that in polite diplomatic circles, but no nation really believes 5% is a fair dinkum effort. “I think there’s a broad disappointment with what Australia’s doing, following the repeal of the carbon price. We are now moving to the margins because we are showing very little ambition. That’s a risky thing to do given that we are a high-carbon economy.”"
"The Canadian government is hell-bent on exploiting the Alberta tar sands to the fullest extent possible, even at the expense of the global climate. Canada simply cannot meet its carbon pollution reduction pledges if it continues to expand tar sands operations. While the American government has finally begun to take the threat of climate change seriously and do something about it, the Canadian government has merely played lip service to the problem. 50 Canadian climate researchers have reached the point where they feel the need to speak out, using the People’s Climate March on September 21st as a catalyst to call for action. To that end, they penned the following letter.  On September 21st more than a thousand events are planned around the world to demand stronger action on climate change, echoing New York’s People Climate March. As Canadian researchers who study Climate Change and Sustainability, we strongly support this global mobilization. Canada is running a sustainability deficit. Unlike budgetary deficits, it does not seem to preoccupy our politicians. Canada has repeatedly missed its own climate change emission reduction targets. Last January, Environment Canada acknowledged that Canada won’t meet its least ambitious target to date, proposed in 2009 as part of international climate negotiations coined the Copenhagen Accord.  Meanwhile, President Obama presented a Climate Action Plan indicating that, unlike Canada, the United States will meet their Copenhagen commitment to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. The US plan identifies carbon dioxide as a toxic substance akin to mercury. It highlights the health threats that “carbon pollution” poses and explains how the cost of adapting to climate change will soar unless we take rapid action now. Obama’s plan also emphasizes the positive legacies of confronting climate change including future job security, economic competitiveness, and overall well-being. Tomorrow is today; we can no longer wait to take up the opportunity to change course and begin to act. Countries must phase out fossil fuels to transition towards cleaner energy sources thereby guaranteeing both human and environmental wellbeing. To help Canada face this challenge, we have joined forces as a multi-disciplinary group of environmental and sustainability scholars to bring to public attention evidence-based research useful for developing constructive, forward-looking proposals. Our initiative, the Sustainable Canada Dialogues, brings together 55+ researchers from a wide range of disciplines including: agriculture, ecology, economics, energy, forestry, mining, philosophy, physics, political science, resource management, sociology and transport.  Our hope is that bringing together the best solutions-based research in the country will highlight what is possible and encourage public engagement and ultimately political action. In the upcoming 2015 election, Canadians will have an opportunity to demand that politicians and parties protect Canada’s social well-being, economic competitiveness and extraordinary environmental assets by addressing climate change. Moving quickly and effectively on climate change will require a national conversation from all corners of society, a conversation we hope will benefit from evidence-based research on pathways forward.  Canada’s current inaction on sustainability hinders our ability to play a positive role in the negotiations leading to the Paris-Climate Conference where more than 190 countries will meet in December 2015 with the aim of producing a more ambitious global climate change agreement. World leaders will revisit existing emissions reduction targets, which even if met will lead to a warming 2oC higher than the critical temperature identified by scientists. We believe Canada should act as a leader rather than a laggard in this process. Opportunities for leadership begin with the preparatory activities for the 2015 Paris-Climate Conference. On September 23rd the UN Secretary General, Mr. Ban Ki-Moon, invites all Heads of State to a Climate Summit designed to generate momentum for acting on climate change. In response to this invitation, NGOs and environmental advocacy groups are mobilizing to participate in the People’s Climate March  on Sunday, September 21st. In Canada, over 100 events are planned from Newfoundland to Vancouver Island.  The time has come to accelerate the transition towards a low carbon society ensuring that the next generation of Canadians can inherit a productive economy with high social well-being standards, live in sustainable cities and enjoy Canada’s unique wildlife, pristine lakes and ice capped mountains. For that world to be ours tomorrow, we must act today. On behalf of the Sustainability Canada Dialogues,"
"Barack Obama has welcomed a report finding that reducing greenhouse gas emissions can be achieved at a low cost and with added benefits in the form of a better quality of life for people around the world. In remarks on Twitter, Obama said: ""This study concludes that no one has to choose between fighting climate change and growing the economy."" The reaction is significant in advance of key talks next week convened by the United Nations, when world leaders will meet in New York to discuss climate change for the first time since 2009.  Ban Ki-moon, the UN secretary-general, who will convene next week's meeting, said: ""We can no longer afford to burn our way to prosperity. We must manage climate risk for sustained – and sustainable – economic progress. We need a structural transformation in the global economy. This report argues for a new model where economic growth and climate action are mutually reinforcing – and it shows how we can build it. There is no time to lose."" The report, on the New Climate Economy, was co-authored by leading economist Lord Stern and involved a roll-call of international institutions including the World Bank, the International Energy Agency and the OECD group of rich countries. It concluded that tackling climate change would add only a small amount – about $240bn – to the trillions of dollars of investment that will take place around the world in the next decade and a half, in order to accommodate a growing population. But the authors warned that if the growth takes place along current, high-carbon lines then the world will be locked in to high carbon emissions for decades to come. For only a small amount of extra investment, businesses and governments can achieve economic growth alongside lower carbon dioxide emissions, which could halt climate change and lead to a better quality of life for citizens, through cleaner air and water and a better environment. The report is the most significant intervention in climate politics by Lord Stern since his 2006 review of the economics of climate change found that the short-term costs of tackling emissions were far outweighed by the benefits. Ed Miliband, leader of the UK's Labour party, said: ""Better Growth, Better Climate, is a hugely important report for those who care both about safeguarding our environment for our children and creating a successful, fairer future for us all. ""This report shows there is no contradiction between tackling climate change and growing our economies. However, it is clear a lack of political leadership is undermining the opportunity to act on climate change and secure the jobs of the future. That is why we need a Labour government that will champion a low carbon economy both in the UK and overseas."" Natalie Bennett, leader of the Green party, said: ""Lord Stern is showing the kind of joined-up, evidence-based thinking that's sadly been entirely lacking in British policymaking to date. As he points out, providing warm, comfortable, affordable-to-heat homes, would not only tackle fuel poverty and stress, but also cut excess winter fuel deaths and demands on the NHS, as well as carbon emissions."" She highlighted investments in public transport as a key measure. Sandrine Dixson Declève, director of the Prince of Wales's Corporate Leaders Group, which includes a variety of large UK businesses, said: ""The good news is that economic growth and action on climate are not incompatible. On the contrary, there are myriad possibilities for all sectors to get involved in driving low-carbon growth and economic transformation. ""But we must not wait: the longer we leave it, the higher the costs. Governments and business must act together to ensure the decisions we make today are the right ones to deliver a safe and sustainable future for all."""
"Before the cacophony of noise around next week’s climate talks in New York becomes deafening, it is worth taking a moment to remember the fundamental reasons behind the wish to prevent global warming. Who better to help us than 82 year-old Archbishop Desmond Tutu, a key figure in the fight against apartheid, who has written a prayer ahead of the Peoples’ Climate March and UN secretary general Ban Ki Moon’s climate leaders’ summit.  Tutu, archbishop emeritus of Cape Town and a Nobel peace laureate wrote: “Through greed, we have established an economy that destroys the web of life. We have changed our climate and drown in despair. Let oceans of justice flow. May we learn to sustain and renew the life of our Mother Earth. We pray for our leaders, custodians of Mother Earth, as they gather in New York City at the climate talks. May they negotiate with wisdom and fairness. May they act with compassion and courage, and lead us in the path of justice for the sake of our children and our children’s children.” Tutu’s contribution forms part of a new prayer platform Ourvoices.net which launches today. Christiana Figueres, head of the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change, which manages the global climate change talks, is supporting the site which she says offers “a pathway for contemplation, empowerment and action across faiths east and west, north and south.” The site is supported by leaders and practitioners from Buddhist, Christian, Confucian, Daoist, Jewish, Hindu, Humanist, Indigenous, Jain, Muslim, Shinto, Sikh, Unitarian Universalist and other communities.  Tutu knows only too well from the years of struggle in South Africa that prayers on their own will not change the world. We need to focus attention on actively influencing the political debate and convincing every sector of society, from business and politician to citizens, to take action to reduce carbon emissions. But what spiritual leaders from all traditions are able to remind us about, via prayer and contemplation, is that to have a meaningful impact, we must not forget the importance of focusing on forgiveness, compassion and humility as well as provision for the suffering, and justice for the oppressed.  Figueres believes that engaging with faith groups is essential to building a coalition that is able to transcend traditional political party lines. She recently wrote in the Guardian: “In supporting greater ambition by nations, religious and faith groups can assist in shaping a world that is less polluted and damaged and healthier, safer and more secure for every man, woman and child. There are a myriad of ways in which churches and mosques to synagogues and temples can assist towards an ambitious climate agreement.”  What Tutu reminds us is that at the heart of our failure to tackle climate change is the loss of our deep connection to the source of our wellbeing – the Earth. This is also recognised by other spiritual leaders such as Thich Nhat Hanh, the 87-year-old Zen master, who believes disaster can be averted only if there is a recognition that people and planet are ultimately one and the same.  Thay, as he is known to his hundreds of thousands of followers around the world, has written a book called The Energy of Prayer in which he argues that it helps us to change our own individual consciousness, which in turn changes our collective consciousness.  “You carry Mother Earth within you,” Thay told Guardian Sustainable Business. “She is not outside of you. Mother Earth is not just your environment”. “Fear, separation, hate and anger come from the wrong view that you and the Earth are two separate entities, the Earth is only the environment. You are in the centre and you want to do something for the Earth in order for you to survive.”  Read more like this: Join the community of sustainability professionals and experts.

"As world leaders meet today at the United Nations in New York, they will face intense pressure to act. The discovery that North Korea has been secretly pumping climate-altering chemicals into the atmosphere in an attempt to destroy agricultural production across the US has sparked an international crisis. That’s not true, of course. There is indeed a summit today, called by UN secretary general Ban Ki-moon, to discuss dangerous climatic disruption. It’s a disruption that may in fact lead to the collapse of many of the world’s main agricultural regions. But since it’s only dull old global warming, a subject swaths of the public seem to find less interesting than watching paint dry, the politicians don’t have to worry too much about being held to account.  So why can we be confident that the North Korean scenario would lead to rapid political mobilisation while the huge threat we really do face will generate mere empty promises? Why does the former quicken the pulse, and the latter induce widespread indifference? This raises a larger question about our own psychology: why do most people understand that climate change is a major threat yet, when asked to name the greatest dangers to civilisation, still seem unable to bring it to mind? The primary reason is that our innate sense of social competition has made us acutely alert to any threat posed by external enemies. In experiments, children as young as three can tell the difference between an accident and a deliberate attack. Climate change confounds this core moral formula: it is a perfect and undetectable crime everyone contributes to but for which no one has a motive. There is no outsider to blame. We are just living our lives: driving the kids to school, heating our homes, putting food on the table. Only once we accept the threat of climate change do these neutral acts become poisoned with intention – so we readily reject that knowledge, or react to it with anger and resentment. Even worse, climate change appears to contain a royal flush of other qualities that are notoriously hard for our brains to engage with: it requires immediate personal sacrifices now to avoid uncertain collective losses far in the future. The cognitive psychologist Daniel Kahneman, who won a Nobel prize for his studies of how irrationally we respond to such issues, sighed deeply when I asked him to assess our chances: “Sorry,” he said, I am deeply pessimistic. I see no path to success.” I would agree with him if indeed climate change really were uncertain, impossibly costly and located in the far future. It can easily seem so, if that’s how you are determined to frame it. However, many economists, such as Nicholas Stern and Hank Paulson, George W Bush’s former treasury secretary, see it differently. So do the 310,000 protestors who jammed 30 blocks of Manhattan, and the tens of thousands more in London on Sunday shouting with heartfelt conviction that climate change is real, happening now and entirely actionable. For them the real obstacle – memorably represented on one float in New York as a 15 metre-long octopus – is the oil and gas industry and its tentacles of political influence. And herein lies the real challenge. Climate change can be anything you want it to be. It can be here or there, in the present or the future, certain and uncertain. It seems that we see climate change as a threat – and are therefore able to harness that innate reaction to an external enemy – only once it is poured it into the mould of our familiar stories, with their heroes and villains. So my fellow advocates for action create this enemy narrative with dramatis personae from our past struggles – corrupt politicians, malignant corporate executives, fat bankers, lazy journalists, slippery lawyers and an apathetic public. All the while, however, our opponents are mirroring these actions. During a raucous evening with members of the Texan Tea Party I was told in predictably blunt language that liberal environmentalists are the real enemy, and that we have invented this scam to extend government control. Like most conservatives, they failed to see that it is climate change itself that poses a threat to their values, freedoms and property. This tendency to confuse the facts of climate change with the narratives constructed from them is just as common among politicians. I can safely predict that the leaders gathering in New York will stress the urgent need to control greenhouse gases but remain mute about the $1tn a year spent bringing yet more fossil fuel reserves into production. In 25 years of negotiations, no measure to control fossil fuel production has ever been discussed. It does not exist anywhere in the official narrative. For the general public, too, there are gaps and blind spots. Most people have never discussed climate change with anyone outside their immediate family. A third cannot recall having talked about it with anyone at all. And, counter-intuitively, climate-related trauma seems to make people even more reticent. Speaking to the victims of Hurricane Sandy and the 2011 Texan drought and wildfires, I could not find anyone who could recall a recent conversation with their neighbours about climate change. Battered communities, it seems, find strength in the hope of recovery, and actively suppress any disheartening discussion of underlying causes or future threat. So if we are to really mobilise action on climate change it is vital that we recognise that it exists in two forms: the scientific facts and the far more potent social facts of constructed narratives or deliberate silence. It is the latter that provide the basis on which we accept, deny or ignore the issue, reinforced by our innate need to conform to the norm within our social group. However, seen in this light, the situation is far from hopeless. Like the cycles that govern global energy and carbon systems, public attitudes are subject to positive feedback effects that can amplify small changes and result in rapid shifts. Strong visible protest and increased media coverage can break the climate silence and create wider engagement. Above all, though, we need to recognise that the narrative we choose will shape what happens from now on. We may continue to fall back on our need for an enemy. But the very best story would be a one of common purpose, based around our shared humanity."
"Action on climate change is not bad for business, it is “the only rational choice”, Prince Charles will tell a summit of world leaders meeting to discuss the issue. In a video message to the UN climate summit in New York next week, the prince will also say that it will not be possible to meet the climate change challenge unless business and government work together. The Prince of Wales’s Corporate Leaders Group, whose members include Coca Cola Enterprises, EDF, Jaguar Land Rover, Philips and Tesco, is urging governments to use the summit to accelerate action on tackling climate change. The business group is calling for politicians to be more ambitious in international negotiations on a new climate treaty, which it is hoped can be agreed in Paris next year, and to commit to concrete actions to drive down greenhouse gas emissions.  In the video message, the prince will say: “The battle against climate change is surely the most defining and pivotal challenge of our times. “We cannot meet the climate change challenge unless business and government actively work together. “Through the work of my Corporate Leaders Group, I am encouraged that more and more businesses are supporting a transformative goal of reaching net zero greenhouse gas emissions well before the end of the century. “Taking action on climate change is neither inherently bad for business nor against economic interests. It is, in fact, the only rational choice.” His comments will come after the publication of a report showing that choosing between growth and tackling climate change is a “false dilemma” because the two can be achieved together. Innovative technology and new investment in cities, energy and agriculture is giving all countries opportunities for economic growth at the same time as cutting emissions, according to the New Climate Economy report from the Global Commission on the Economy and Climate. More than 120 leaders, including UK prime minister David Cameron, are expected to attend the climate summit next week in New York, which has been convened by UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon to drive action on global warming ahead of the Paris talks in 2015. Philippe Joubert, chairman of The Prince of Wales’s Corporate Leaders Group, said: “There is a powerful and growing consensus among leading businesses on the need for action. “More companies and investors are committed to bold leadership on climate than ever because they know it makes business sense. “Now is the time to accelerate both ambition and action ahead of the UN meeting in Paris in 2015 at which leaders will need to agree a new global deal.” Paul Polman, chief executive of Unilever, which is a member of the group, said: “The next 15 years are critical. Around $90 trillion (£55 trillion) will be invested in cities, land use and energy infrastructure globally between now and 2030. The scale of this investment means there is a huge opportunity to create better growth and tackle climate change.” In a separate development, on Thursday leading investor institutions managing £15 trillion in assets called for an ambitious climate deal and strong policies to give them certainty to invest in clean technology."
"There are plenty of immediate concerns in a fire: protecting homes and businesses, saving lives, limiting the number of acres consumed and so on. But increasingly, researchers and policymakers are finding that the lingering health and safety impacts of wildfires may be far more worrisome – and more widespread. Smoke, after all, can travel any way the wind takes it, exacerbating an array of health problems in cities hundreds of miles from the original fire. In 2002, for example, a fire in Canada caused a 30-fold increase in fine particulate matter in the air in Baltimore, 1,000 miles away.  According to Kim Knowlton, a senior scientist with the health and environment program at the Natural Resources Defense Council (NRDC), that level of air pollution can contribute to a variety of respiratory and cardiac issues and has even been correlated with premature death and low birth weights. In a 2011 study, conducted in partnership with researchers at the University of California at Berkeley and the University of California at San Francisco, Knowlton found that more than 760,000 encounters with the health system between 2000 and 2009 could be attributed to exposure to wildfire smoke.  These health problems carried a steep price tag: $740,000 in direct healthcare costs and more than $14bn in overall health costs once the value of lives lost prematurely was factored in. The 2003 wildfire season in southern California alone resulted in 69 premature deaths, 778 hospitalizations, 1,431 emergency room visits, and 47,605 outpatient visits, mostly for respiratory and cardiovascular health problems aggravated by smoke exposure.  Scientists fear that, as climate change intensifies, the conditions that make wildfires likely – namely heat, drought, and shifting weather patterns – are becoming increasingly common, laying the foundation for more wildfires and a major public health crisis. In fact, there is evidence to suggest that we may already be in the midst of one: a 2011 brief from the NRDC found that two-thirds of US citizens live in counties affected by smoke conditions. “It’s really bad stuff,” Knowlton says. “It’s not just the particulate matter in the smoke, but also that it carries ozone precursors, contributes to the formation of ground-level smog, and can contain carcinogens, ammonia, organic acids and metals.” In its most recent report, the National Climate Assessment addressed the potential costs and risks of wildfire-related health concerns, noting that smoke from a fire could contribute to health impacts in regions far from the original disaster. Moreover, the report argued, particulate matter from wildfire-related smoke could affect atmospheric properties and thus weather patterns. The National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences, NIEHS, has also addressed this side of the wildfire issue. For the past five years, it has taken a particular interest in research that examines climate change-related health impacts on vulnerable populations, and in 2010 launched dedicated funding for this research. The first of those grants began in 2011, including a project at Yale that aims to pinpoint which populations are most vulnerable to the health impacts of forest fires under a changing climate. Still more research attempts to quantify the financial impact of wildfires. The 2008 fire season led to almost $2.2m in hospital costs in the Reno-Sparks area of Nevada, while the 78,000 wildfires in California between 1999 and 2013 burned approximately 3.8m acres and incurred more than $4bn in suppression costs, a recent Union of Concerned Scientists study reports. And these impacts are likely to increase. In a Harvard University study on the effects of wildfires on US air quality, researcher Xu Yue estimates that by the middle of this century wildfires will have increased the amount of fine particulate matter in the air from 46% to 70%, and the amount of black carbon from 20% to 27%, relative to today’s numbers. Not only are respiratory and cardiac issues expected to rise, but also, in a seemingly endless and vicious loop, the particulate matter and other chemicals contained in wildfire-smoke will further exacerbate climate change. A 2010 study from the National Center for Atmospheric Research and the University of Colorado at Boulder estimates that wildfires in the contiguous US and Alaska release about 290m metric tons of CO2 a year, which is the equivalent of 4%-6% of the nation’s CO2 emissions from burning fossil fuels. The Clean Air Act has gone a long way toward reducing the amount of particulate matter and other pollutants emitted into the air by companies. However, the act doesn’t cover air pollution caused by wildfires, and the combination of climate change and continued development in fire-prone areas could negate much of the improvement that it has brought about.  In a recent research brief, the Nasa Air Quality Applied Sciences Team alluded to this problem. It began by pointing out that US air quality has vastly improved in recent years: “Eight-hour averages of surface ozone (O3) have declined by nearly 20% since 1990, while 24-hour averages of fine particulate matter (PM2.5) have dropped by 25%.” The report then noted, however, that these improvements are vulnerable to atmospheric disturbances: “Unusual weather can interrupt that trend, as was seen in the hot dry summer of 2012, when Chicago and St Louis experienced double the average number of O3 episodes from the previous four years.” Given the difficulty of regulating fire-related air pollution, state and local agencies have focused instead on better communicating health risks to the public, creating early-warning systems, and integrating wildfire risks into climate adaptation plans. That means looking at everything from land-use management and development permits to forest management in an effort to minimize the impacts of wildfires in the future.  Even shifting the time of year that fire departments conduct controlled burns could have an impact; recent research has shown that extreme heat exacerbates the health impacts of fires, and thus recommends that controlled burns happen in the spring.  “There’s always a confluence of factors that contribute to any wildfire,” Rachel Cleetus, senior climate economist with the Union of Concerned Scientists, explains. “There’s development, whatever creates the initial spark, and past fire-suppression practices that have led to this accumulation of biomass that’s just a tinder box. Climate is adding an additional layer of risk, and that risk is only increasing.” Helping people to understand the connection between climate change, wildfires, and their own health might help to address the problem as well.  “When climate change impacts are described as being on humans and family members and in the here and now and in your neighborhood as opposed to in forests in Colorado or polar bears in the Arctic, people tend to respond more and show more concern about the issue,” says John Balbus, senior public health advisor at NIEHS. But of course, climate is not the only issue, nor is it the only area in which the general public has an impact on wildfire risk. As Cleetus says: Cutting emissions is critical, but it won’t help people right now – we’re already locked in to temperature change for the next couple decades. We do need to cut emissions so it doesn’t get worse, but what can we do in the short term? We can invest in fire-proofing measures. We can limit further development in wildfire-prone areas and manage our forests better. In a way it’s learning to live with fire a little bit because that’s where we are. That’s a part of our national policy conversation that’s very difficult. Amy Westervelt is an Oakland, California-based freelance reporter who covers the environment, business and health.

"Lord Stern, one of the world’s most influential voices on climate economics, does not mince his words when it comes to criticising those who take a narrow view of prosperity and highlighting the devastating consequences of global warming. “You have to be a complete idiot to think that GDP sums up prosperity,” says Stern, who believes we need to develop broader measures of success and combine this with a return to core values if we are to convince people to act to prevent runaway climate change.  Stern, who wrote the landmark 2006 Stern review of the economics of climate change, says if we fail to take heed of the danger signals, we risk temperatures rising this century to levels we haven’t seen for tens of millions of years. “Hundreds of millions of people, perhaps billions of people would have to move,” he warns. “If we’ve learned anything from history that means severe and extended conflict.  “We couldn’t just turn it off. You can’t make a peace treaty with the planet, you can’t negotiate with the laws of physics. You’re in there, you’re stuck. Those are the stakes we’re playing for and that’s why we have to make this second transformation, the climate transformation and move to low carbon economy.” Stern has co-authored the recently published New Climate Economy report, which argues that the world can head off the worst effects of climate change, and enjoy the fruits of continued economic expansion, if it moves quickly to invest in a low-carbon economy. He says he hopes the study will influence key decision makers because it was written with the support of a coalition of respected politicians, economists, think tanks and institutions, including the World Bank, the International Monetary Fund, the OECD, the International Energy Agency and the UN.  He dismisses the arguments of more radical economists who believe that we need to stop our fixation with growth, arguing that the economy needs to keep expanding if we are to have a hope of eradicating poverty. “To those who want to knock out growth from objectives, I find they’re close to reprehensible because for me the two defining challenges of this century are overcoming poverty and managing climate change. “We fail on one, we fail on the other. So I think to say that we should just switch off growth is to miss big aspects of what matters about poverty. And so it worries me. It’s also politically very naive. If you turn it into a pissing contest between growth on the one hand and climate and environment on the other and say you’ve got to choose, you’re setting yourself up for failure.” Stern says investments in renewable energy must be combined with a rethinking of our understanding of prosperity, which he believes will lead to what he terms better growth.  “It means thinking differently about health, about the way we live in our cities and about the strengths of our communities,” he says. “It’s not that GDP is idiotic but it’s mostly about the use of labour resources and what it produces. But there are very important parts of this story about prosperity that get missed out.” How does Stern, who is president of the British Academy, believe we can start to measure prosperity that goes beyond GDP? He says it is vital to start from the perspective of people understanding what they mean by wellbeing and what they value, whether it is family, community, arts or sport.  “You can be reasonably empirical about what moves people and then you go and try to collect data on that,” he says. “Once you understand what it is it you’re trying to capture and create indicators, you can then start to talk about policy.” The 68-year-old peer says it’s vital we go back to recognising the importance of Aristotle’s belief in the need to understand what it means to be a virtuous person and to whom we owe a duty of care. “I’ve been an academic all my life and I look at the evidence of what works and what doesn’t work,” he says. “But if you ask yourself what you’re trying to do, that’s spurred by values, by what’s important to you.” For Stern, the heart of his values lies in the importance of family. Speaking immediately after introducing his two-week old granddaughter Rosa on stage at a TEDx talk in New York, he said: “I’m 68 and I am thinking what will Rosa be like when she’s 68? We’re talking about towards the end of this century and what we do now will determine whether the next 100 years is the best of centuries or the worst of centuries.” “Are we going to look our grandchildren in the eye and tell them that we understood the issues, that we recognised the dangers and the opportunities, and still we failed to act?” Stern believes that it is time for religious leaders, politicians and the media to act more responsibly, pointing in particular to the importance of the Pope’s statement earlier this year that if we destroy creation, creation will destroy us. Also key to changing hearts and minds is the field of arts, with Stern pointing to Barbara Kingsolver’s book Flight Behaviour, which he says is not only wonderful in describing the human condition but also in questioning our relationship with the environment. “It’s not just the policy wonks like me we need to try to assemble the evidence and set it out,” he says. “You have to do that because emotional argument without rational evidence on cause and effect doesn’t get you all that far. But rational argument about cause and effect alone doesn’t get you there either.” Read more stories like this: Join the community of sustainability professionals and experts.

"350.org is a global climate organisation that has rapidly expanded to become a leading voice across the world for action on climate change. Blair Palese is the Australian CEO of 350.org, and she has enormous experience in fossil fuel and oceans campaigning. 350.org is one of the primary organisers for the people's march on 21 September, and Blair has written this guest blog to explain why tens of thousands of Australians will be marching.  This weekend will see be the biggest public climate event in history. More than 100,000 people will march in New York alone and hundreds of thousands of others will join them on the streets of 150 countries around the world, all calling for climate change action. RT @350: Exactly 1 week to the #PeoplesClimate March worldwide - Will you be there? pic.twitter.com/gjrPZVf9Ud — 350Australia (@350Australia) September 15, 2014 This weekend also will see the heads of state from more than 125 countries, including Barack Obama and David Cameron gather in New York for a summit on climate change organised by Ban Ki Moon. This is the first time world leaders have come together on the issue since the landmark Copenhagen summit in 2009 and the UN Secretary General hopes the summit will inject new momentum to reach a global deal on cutting greenhouse gas emissions in Paris at the end of 2015. Amazingly Australia's our own prime minister, Tony Abbott, will be in New York for the UN Security Council meeting – no doubt to talk about war – but refuses to attend the Climate Summit. Although this may have come as a disappointment for the EU Commissioner for climate action, few in Australia are surprised as this government has already made its priorities and prejudices abundantly clear. Dare @TonyAbbottMHR to show up to the UN Climate Summit next week: http://t.co/YMsKrwJLLE pic.twitter.com/LLfNFGDsLU — 350Australia (@350Australia) September 16, 2014 The fact that the Prime Minister of Australia, the world's second largest exporter of coal, has chosen to shun this summit speaks volumes about why we need the People's Climate Mobilisation. With global leaders so far failing to act in the world's best interest to address climate change, it's time for the global public to not only show that it is demanding change but that we will also act together to bring about the change we need. People's Climate events are planned in almost every continent in the world. In Bogata, Columbia, over 10,000 people are expected to join in a march through the capital calling for action. In rural Papua New Guinea, students from a primary school will march to a nearby lighthouse, recently semi-submerged due to rising sea levels. In Tanzania, the Maasai people plan to march, calling for action to protect their ancient homeland in the Serengeti. On the other side of the world, on the border between Vancouver and Seattle, thousands of people will link hands across the boundary to show that climate change knows no borders. ""We have the power!"" Let's use it and make the #PeoplesClimate Mobilisation huge.

There are over 30 People's Climate events taking place in Melbourne, Sydney, Adelaide, Perth, Canberra and Brisbane, as well as on Magnetic Island on the Great Barrier Reef, in Alice Springs, Darwin and the remote mining town of Mount Isa. Organisations such as Get Up!, Avaaz, the Australian Youth Climate Coalition, Our Land Our Water Our Future and the Leard Alliance are working nationally to organise and support large and small events alike. One of the most impressive things about the day and the 2,000 plus events taking place across the globe is not just the individuals organising and taking part but the thousands of organisations – including unions, medical professionals, faith, social justice and community groups and those fighting for the rights of immigrants, refugees and indigenous peoples, that have signed on. The People's Climate Mobilisation is about how we use this opportunity to build the networks we need to demand global leadership and real action on climate change. Why are you marching? Fill in your own reason: http://t.co/2FDnBl7JiX pic.twitter.com/4ZRjLMKZBd — 350 dot org (@350) September 14, 2014 Together, on Sunday, we'll be calling for Action Not Words and we'll be hoping to sign up hundreds of thousands of people to stand up for the planet they care about. Whether it's divesting your bank, super fund, university or church from fossil fuels, supporting the shift to renewable energy at your home or in your community or taking action on the ground at places like the Leard Blockade at Maules Creek, the Galilee Basin or the proposed gas fields of WA, we all need to get involved to overcome the influence and dominance of the fossil fuel industry working to stop movement on climate change. Solutions, not superstorms. http://t.co/5O1awzX36g #peoplesclimate pic.twitter.com/H3PISj7ReB — 350 dot org (@350) August 22, 2014 People around the world, and especially Australians, realise that we can't leave the fate of the planet up to our politicians. We need to work together around the world, raise our voices, and apply pressure where it counts if we are going to see tangible change. This is why we are calling on all Australians, regardless of political allegiance, cultural background or profession, to join us on Sunday and show that, contrary to the opinions of many of our politicians, we DO care about the planet and what happens to it beyond our generation.

"You published two letters on 8 September setting out the importance of acting against climate change. The implication of both is that the government needs to do more. Both were signed by individuals who lobby against civil nuclear power, by far the major source of carbon-free electricity around the world. Hinkley Point C, when built, will produce more carbon-free electricity than all windfarms currently operational in the UK. To act as if carbon-free nuclear is not part of the solution is destructive and threatens our planet. This is understood by more thoughtful environmentalists but not apparently Greenpeace, WFF or the Green party. As a consequence their credibility in matters of climate change and decarbonisation is deservedly very low indeed.David Mowat MPConservative, Warrington South • The call for action on climate change on 21 September from Ricken Patel et al coincides with the middle of Community Energy Fortnight. Community groups are taking action on climate change by developing renewable energy projects and by promoting energy efficiency measures. These groups reduce their communities’ carbon emissions and reduce fuel poverty, fuel bills and reliance on fossil fuels.Liz MeddingsHillfields Energy Group, Bristol  • 21 September is not only the start of a summit on climate change. It is also UN Peace Day – and a chance to highlight the links betwen the two issues. Armed conflict causes environmental damage, contributes to global warming by its use of fossil fuels (the US military is the largest single user of them), and inhibits the actions needed to deal with global warming. A fraction of thecurrent annual $1.75tn military spending transferred to mitigation of and adaptation to climate change could transform the situation, and remove many of the causes of conflict – a benign circle.Frank JacksonFormer co-chair, World Disarmament Campaign"
"The extent of sea ice in Antarctica is set to reach a record high, scientists said on Tuesday, as they announced that Arctic sea ice appeared to have shrunk to its sixth lowest level ever. The NSIDC said that satellite data was expected to shortly confirm whether the maximum extent of sea ice at the opposite pole, in Antarctica, had set a new record.  “Antarctic sea ice is poised to set a record maximum this year, now at 19.7 million sq km (7.6m sq m) and continuing to increase,” the centre, considered one of the world’s top authorities on sea ice data, said in a statement. Jan Lieser, of the Antarctic Climate and Ecosystems Co-operative Research Centre (CRC), told Australia’s ABC News that: “This is an area covered by sea ice which we’ve never seen from space before.”  The conundrum of why Antarctic sea ice appears to be expanding as the Arctic decreases had puzzled polar observers, but scientists have suggested that the reason Antarctic ice extent appears to be increasing is due to changing wind patterns. Figures released by the National Snow and Ice Data Centre in Boulder, Colorado, show that the so-called Arctic sea ice minimum – the point where the extent of sea ice there is at its lowest after the summer, before it begins to refreeze for winter – is expected to be confirmed imminently and would be millions of square kilometres below the long-term average. At 5.09m sq km, the extent of Arctic sea ice this year would be the sixth lowest on record, slightly worse than last year, though not as extreme as the record set in 2012 when it plunged to less than 3.5 million square kilometres. However, the centre noted that there had been a particularly strong retreat of sea ice in the Laptev Sea and although the reasons for that were not yet clear, sea temperatures there had been up to 5C higher than average. The amount of sea ice cover in the Arctic has been showing a long-term decline as climate change takes hold, with temperatures rising more rapidly in the Arctic than the rest of the planet."

"All of Dr Seuss’s children’s books – or, at least, the best ones – are sly, radical humanitarian and environmental parables. That’s why, for example, The Lorax was banned in some Pacific Northwest districts where logging was the chief economy.  Or there’s Horton Hears a Who: if you weren’t a child (or reading to a child) recently, it’s about an elephant with acute hearing who hears a cry from a dust speck. He comes to realize the dust speck is a planet in need of protection, and does his best for it.  Of course, all the other creatures mock – and then threaten – Horton for raising an alarm over something they can’t see. (Dissent is an easy way to get yourself ostracized or worse, as any feminist receiving online death threats can remind you.) And though Seuss was reportedly inspired by the situation in post-war Japan when he wrote the book, but its parable is flexible enough for our time.  You could call the scientists and the climate activists of our present moment our Hortons. They heard the cry a long time ago, and they’ve been trying to get the rest of the world to listen. They’ve had to endure attacks, mockery, and lip service ... but mostly just obliviousness to what they’re saying and what it demands of us.  Recent polling data suggests most of us do want to see things change. “Two in three Americans (66%) support the Congress and president passing laws to increase energy efficiency and the use of renewable energy as a way to reduce America’s dependence on fossil fuels,” reports the US Climate Action Network. But I hear firsthand from people who aren’t particularly informed and still tell me that they are avoiding thinking about climate because it’s too late.  It is nearly too late, because we’ve know about climate change for 25 years, but the most informed scientists think that we do have a chance and some choices, if we make them now.  To listen to such scientists is an amazing and sometimes terrifying thing: they fully comprehend what systemic collapse means and where we are in that process. They – and others who pay attention to the data – see how terrible the possibilities are, but they also see the possibilities for averting the worst.  Seuss’s Horton was alone. Climate activists in the United States are a minority, but there are vast numbers of people across the world who know how serious the situation is, who are facing it and who are listening and asking for action. Some of them will be with us when the biggest climate march in history takes place on Sunday in New York City – starting on the southern edge one of the nation’s largest urban green spaces, Central Park, running around Times Square and then moving west to the Hudson River – to demand that the UN get serious with this attempt to hammer out a climate change treaty at its summit next week. A whole lot more people are going to come together to demand that our political leaders do something about climate than have done so before. In a symbolic action, at 12:58pm local time, they will observe a collective couple of minutes of silence dedicated to the past. Wherever you are on Sunday, you can join us in observing that silence and remembering the millions displaced last year by the kinds of floods and storms that climate change augments, or the residents of island nations whose homes are simply disappearing under the waves; the small shellfish whose shells are dissolving or the species that have died out altogether; the elderly and inform who have died in our longer, hotter heatwaves or the people who died in New York’s Hurricane Sandy not quite two years ago. At 1pm local time, we will face the future, and demand that our leaders face the music. The marchers will make two minutes of noise, and every pot-banger, church-bell-ringer, hornblower and drummer on earth is invited to join in. Churches are invited to ring their bells; synagogues to blow their shofars; mosques to use their loudspeakers; secular humanists to get their brass bands on. Get your own pots and pans, or your trumpets and whistles.  We needed someone to ring the alarm all these decades of inaction. On Sunday don’t wait to hear it from someone else: make some noise yourself. It’s time to start making the future we hope for instead of waiting for the one we fear.  I wish that I could write a pat ending for the story of how we saved the earth, but that is, so to speak, all up in the air right now.  But at the end of Horton Hears a Who, the small people of Whoville decide to make a huge roar so that everyone else could hear them: they all roar and bang and blast, but it takes a boy named Jojo (playing with his yoyo) to add his yapping voice to the roar for them to become audible.  This is our planet: our little blue sphere in the Orion Spur of the Milky Way Galaxy, with the beautifully elaborate systems of birds and insects and weather and flowering plants all working together – or that used to work together, and which are now falling apart. And it’s your voice that’s needed, so raise it on Sunday. Join the roar, so that everyone who wasn’t listening finally has to hear. • This article was updated on 17 September 2014 to reflect that the the New York City Police Department only granted the People’s Climate March permission to march to Sixth Avenue, and not all the way to the United Nations building on First Avenue."
"This week, I will witness a key test of whether we will betray our children, grandchildren and future generations through a lack of ambition and will. I will be at the headquarters of the United Nations in New York on Thursday to listen to David Cameron, Barack Obama and more than 120 other political leaders outline how they intend to tackle the growing risks from climate change. The summit has been called by the United Nations secretary general, Ban Ki-moon, to try to build high-level support for efforts to reach an international agreement to avoid dangerous levels of global warming, which is due to be signed in Paris in December 2015.  The ambition is that countries will outline how they intend to stop and reverse, within the next 10 years, the growth in annual emissions of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases, and put us on a path towards zero emissions by the second half of this century. Without a treaty, it will be hard for the world to avoid the potentially catastrophic impacts of the global average temperature rising by more than 2C degrees above its pre-industrial level. The consequences of creating a climate not seen on Earth for millions of years will not be suffered primarily by us but by those who will be here next century. By then, if the climate has warmed by three degrees or more, the Earth is likely to have passed a number of tipping points, such as irreversible melting of the Greenland ice sheet, leading to gradually accelerating and potentially irreversible disruption of lives and livelihoods. Even though nearly all of us will be gone by the start of the next century, it is we who have to determine in the next 15 months whether our descendants in the 22nd century will have to cope with the risks created by a climate that modern Homo sapiens, less than 250,000 years old, has never experienced. This choice is shockingly clear from the scientific evidence for climate change that has now been assembled. But we have constructed an economic and political system that leads us to disregard this threat to the prosperity and wellbeing of our children and grandchildren. We make decisions about our economy based on models that discount the future such that the further in the future someone is born, the less they are worth. This means the impacts of climate change on them are simply dismissed. Yet a major report published last week, The New Climate Economy, showed that many of the actions we have to take to prevent future generations from facing huge risks from climate change would also have other more immediate economic benefits, such as reducing local air pollution. We hold public discussions about climate change that are mediated by newspapers and broadcasters, many of whom are obsessed with perpetuating controversy about whether there is a problem, instead of focusing attention on what should be done. Yet few of the editors of our national media bother to cover the mounting evidence that the UK is already experiencing climate change. Our seven warmest years and four of our five wettest years on record have all occurred from 2000 onwards. This year has so far been both the warmest and wettest since records began in 1910, and has included the rainiest winter we have seen. But worst of all, we have constructed a political process that focuses on narrow, near-sighted concerns rather than on the profound long-term challenges that we face. In doing so, we have undermined the legitimacy of our democratic elections by alienating many young people who are turning their backs on traditional party politics, not out of apathy, but out of sheer disgust and disillusionment. It is a symptom of how little politics has to offer the young that none of the leaders of the three biggest political parties in parliament has made a major speech on climate change since the last election more than four years ago. Meanwhile, Ukip has surged in popularity, mainly among older voters, while embracing outright denial of climate change as part of its laughable energy policy that pledges a revival of coal, the dirtiest of the fossil fuels. It is little wonder then that there could be a record low turn-out of young voters in the general election next May, even though whichever party wins will help to decide whether there should be a strong international agreement on climate change. Our best hope is for young voters to express their despair about our dismal politics, not by boycotting the general election as some have advocated, but instead by speaking out loudly and fiercely, and forcing potential MPs to confront long-term issues such as climate change in the run-up to the next general election. In doing so, they would ensure that their best interests, and the best interests of future generations, are not betrayed by those political leaders who will decide in Paris next year whether the world will avoid dangerous climate change."

"As we have begun to see the effects of climate change more severely, more frequently and closer to home, so too have film-makers been spurred to address the consequences of an irrevocably damaged environment in new ways. In both fiction and non-fiction, climate change is no longer depicted as the eventual cause of future calamity, but a reality affecting everyday life.  On the heels of documentaries that hoped to raise awareness by laying out the facts about climate change have come new ones showing the consequences of our behavior through spectacular images of an increasingly inhospitable environment.   An Inconvenient Truth, that PowerPoint presentation of a documentary from 2006, stands as a prototype of activist filmmaking, the kind of movie that caused Roger Ebert to write, apparently for the first time in his career, “you owe it to yourself to see this film.”  It bets on the power of reason: Gore leads viewers with calm determination through facts and figures, laying out the problem at hand. ‘How can you ignore the truth?’, the film seems to ask. Years later, it seems Gore’s ‘truth-telling’ hasn’t been as successful as he’d hoped, and a series of more recent docs have broached new ways of approaching the issue.  James Balog’s Chasing Ice is no less eager to change the mindset and behavior of its audience than Inconvenient Truth; in fact, Balog explicitly states at the beginning that he is former climate change skeptic who has now seen the light, positioning his film as a hopeful catalyst for other similar transformations.  But Balog is also a photographer by trade, and his approach is correspondingly more visual than Guggenheim’s in Inconvenient Truth: the doc follows him and his crew as they trek into the Arctic and produce multi-year timelapse videos that dramatically show the melting of ice caps and glaciers. Inconvenient Truth, of course, also had photos displaying similar evidence, but Balog’s images go much further.  Beyond eliciting understanding, they’re clearly produced to inspire awe.  The images that Edward Burtynsky and Jennifer Baichwal produce in their documentary Watermark are equally striking. Unlike Chasing Ice, Watermark is not exclusively concerned with climate change. Its focus is on water in general, the ways we live with it, use it in religious worship, and attempt to control it.  There’s certainly a romanticizing element to the film; Like Balog, Burtynsky is a photographer and much of the doc shows him taking wondrous shots of environmental landscapes—of sprawling farmland, rivers, and rice terraces. But knowing what we do about climate change, the images of these locales carry a spectral warning of their vulnerability. In a sense, then, Watermark takes for granted a certain amount of environmental awareness. It certainly places climate change within a larger panorama of issues, which is the same thing that many recent narrative films have done.  Most often, climate change appears in fictional movies like The Day After Tomorrow, Snowpiercer, or – remarkably ahead of its time – Waterworld as a set-up or explanation for disaster. In films like Night Moves and Beasts of the Southern Wild, though, it becomes a basic fact of the world we live in.  The two movies are miles apart in tone: Night Moves is a low-key thriller about three environmental activists planning to bomb a dam in Oregon; Beasts is an exuberant quasi-fantasy set in an isolated Louisiana community as it prepares for, and then deals with the aftermath of a large storm.  Yet in their own ways—whether by realistically profiling characters determined to force decreased consumption or by magically positing the existence of a raging band of aurochs, thawed out after centuries of captivity in the Arctic ice caps – both offer stories that sense that the end of Gore’s 10-year warning approaches. In that respect, perhaps the best film we have about climate change is Jeff Nichols’s Take Shelter. Much like the 2008 remake of The Day the Earth Stood Still, but with more compelling results, Take Shelter signals how climate change has become our equivalent to the mid-20th century nuclear scare. The movie tells the story of Curtis, who begins having visions of deadly storms and, to the dismay of his family, proceeds to spend all his time and money building a storm shelter.  As a film about contemporary anxieties, Curtis’s visions could symbolize a number of fears, but it’s not hard to tell which is the most pressing and obvious one. Throughout the film, Curtis repeats his warnings, continues his plans, and his demeanor in doing so can only be described as paranoid. Yet we all live with the prospect of similar threats and what’s most worrisome, then, is how we seem a little less crazy every new day that we repeat them."

"Eight years ago, Richard Branson, the tie-loathing adventurer (as his Twitter feed has it) and figurehead of Virgin Atlantic airlines, Virgin Galactic space travel and so on, pledged to invest around $3bn (£1.85bn) in green technologies by 2016. A $25m investment went into the Virgin Earth Challenge, a prize for inventing something to suck up all the planet-wrecking carbon emitted by gas-guzzling industries like his own. Some goes into developing low-carbon fuels. Some pays for the snazzy Carbon War Room, a sort of green-tech Dragons' Den. ""Gaia capitalism"", Branson has called his vision. ""We have to make it a win-win for all concerned."" That 2016 deadline is fast approaching. How much, Naomi Klein asked Branson, will he have put into his pledge by then? ""I suspect it will be less than $1bn right now,"" he confessed. He has been busy elsewhere in the meantime, launching Virgin America airlines, V Australia airlines, Virgin Atlantic Little Red airlines, and investing heavily in Virgin Galactic, perhaps because – as he has started saying – he has a plan to move to Mars. Klein doesn't necessarily follow the people who see Branson's green shenanigans as ""a cynical ploy"" to build his brand and confuse his critics. But you can grant him his good intentions and still think all this greenwash doesn't make a lot of sense.  There can be no doubt that climate change is happening; it has already started wreaking damage, and is set to do much more. Temperatures have risen by nearly 1C since the industrial revolution, and in 2012 the World Bank predicted a rise of 4C by 2100, bringing ""extreme heat waves, declining global food stocks, loss of ecosystems and biodiversity and life‑threatening sea-level rise"". And yet coordinated international response is completely missing. The 2009 Copenhagen climate summit settled for a half-hearted 2C target, then failed to secure commitment even on that. Obama seems stuck, as the US fracks and drills its heart out and Canada tears up Alberta in the race for tar. Climate, politics and business are caught in a vicious triangle, and at the moment it's the climate that is getting squeezed. The only way to resolve this is with tough, fair, world-level regulation. But instead we have a vacuum, into which pours all manner of noxious nonsense. Climate-change deniers, luxuriantly astroturfed. Charities cosying up to fossil-fuel interests, including one, Klein has discovered, that has put oil and gas wells on its own bird reserve. Clever chaps who should know better – Stephen Hawking, the lads from Freakonomics – with their fantasies of terraforms and geo-engineering. Eddying little markets in non-solutions: carbon offsets, emissions trading, organic nappies. What's wrong with us that we've let this happen? Klein argues that humans don't cause climate collapse, and nor does carbon. The problem is a particular arrangement of these elements – in other words, capitalism, the whole point of which is to find resources and exploit them. It's a habit of mind, if you like, a form of behaviour. As such, it can be changed. Except that most of the time we cannot see this, because we are ""locked in, politically, physically and culturally"" to the world that capital has made. ""We lack the collective spaces in which to confront the raw terror of ecocide,"" is how Klein encapsulates the problem. Lucky for everybody then that opening up such spaces is exactly what Klein does best. I'll never forget the interview with her in the Guardian after the publication of her first book, No Logo (1999). So quietly and sensibly you scarcely noticed, she completely shifted the terms of the anti-corporate argument, and the one about what politics in the 21st century is for. On her own development, from shopping addict to activist-intellectual: ""The only way I got consumerism and vanity into a sane place in my life … was by becoming interested in other things."" On why she won't judge you if your shoes were made in a sweatshop. ""This is not a consumer issue, it's a political issue … Products are just stuff."" Shopping or not shopping is neither here nor there: politics is about law and democratic structures. If politicians aren't doing what people think they should be doing, it's up to those people to find a way of getting them to change. And yet, as The Shock Doctrine (2007) made plain, Klein also knows that what she's up against is extreme. Capital has learned lots recently about using disaster as a cash cow, from Katrina to Baghdad. ""And there are plenty of signs that climate change will be no exception"" is how she starts this book. Her task is to take a potential catastrophe of unimaginable reach and to be calm and welcoming, drawing new people in. She does vast amounts of travel and research and thinking, then crafts all of it to the scale of her own voice: the voice of a pleasant, funny, unthreatening-looking woman with layerings and lowlights, a husband and a baby, living in Toronto in what US Vogue, in its current issue, calls ""a middle-class brick home"". (You can access the Vogue piece from Klein's website, and it's worth reading. As are what Klein calls her ""two issues"" with it: that they mentioned her recent treatment for thyroid cancer, ""not a subject I would have chosen to be public about"", and that a promise was broken not to identify the brand of shirt she's wearing in the pictures – ""Lots of people make nice white shirts."") Capital, Klein argues, has been separating humans from the world around them since the discovery of steam. But it is what she calls ""our great collective misfortune"" that just as leaders started waking up to the emissions problem in the early 1990s, they were also establishing the World Trade Organisation, and with it, a ""new era"" of hyperactive deregulation, tax-cutting and privatisation of public space. When historians look back, as Klein says, they'll see the two processes in parallel, each pretending not to know about the other: the climate movement, ""struggling, sputtering, failing utterly"" and corporate globalisation, ""zooming from victory to victory"". The climate movement needs to think harder about capital, if it is to have a chance of getting real. But it's difficult to spot climate change as it happens, because it moves so spasmodically and is by its nature ""place-based"". What do I know about the mines of Nauru or gas flares on the Niger Delta? What can I do about flooding in the Maldives or New Orleans? ""Sacrifice zones"" is what Klein chillingly calls the places most depredated: ""Poor places. Out-of-the-way places. Places where residents lack political power, usually having to do with some combination of race, language and class."" But even in the rich world, most people don't notice the dwindling of nature in their parks and gardens; or if they do, they are so sickened, they have to stop noticing right away. Which is why Klein sees the living wage as a climate issue. The main reason so many people are so careless is because they are worn out. Her own eureka moment came, in 2009, she writes, over lunch with the Bolivian diplomat Angélica Navarro Llanos. ""Using chopsticks as props,"" Navarro Llanos explained how tough international climate action might mobilise what she called ""a Marshall Plan for the Earth"". For the first time, Klein saw that climate change is not an abstract, sciencey matter, and that it's far too important to be left to the knit-your-owns. Her proposals for what she calls ""a politics based on reconnection"" involve real, ordinary, active humans, working in properly modern, complex societies. Green industries, such as renewable energy and public transport, are all much more labour-intensive than their fossil-fuel equivalents. ""Climate action is in fact a massive job creator as well as a community builder and source of hope."" Klein hopes this book will be read by people who don't read climate-change books (such as me). So it's probably my duty to warn you that it is quite wordy, and sees things from a North American angle, and is a bit more vague about renewable energy than I'd like. But so what – it's an unavoidably difficult and complex subject. The argument is signposted throughout with striking buzzwords: Extractivism, Big Green, No Messiahs, Blockadia. Not to mention the brilliant title – an executive summary in itself. There's one especially good bit, that completely stopped me dead. If you follow the climate science, you'll have heard the talk about how change doesn't happen incrementally but touches sudden ""non-linear tipping elements"", which may at any moment run completely out of control. Well, Klein also discusses a paper called ""Is Earth Fucked?"" by the geophysicist Brad Werner, which models the likely progress of ""earth-human systems"" towards various unpleasant outcomes, unless one remaining node of unpredictability is activated: ""people or groups of people"" who resist. Klein has timed her book to come out the week before the 2014 UN climate summit opens in New York City, and is on the board of 350.org, the group planning the People's Climate March that will greet it. We can only wish her and her fellow campaigners all the very best. • To order This Changes Everything for £13.50 with free UK p&p call Guardian book service on 0330 333 6846 or go to guardianbookshop.co.uk."
"I recently had lunch with Mary Wenzel, a senior vice president at Wells Fargo who directs the bank’s environmental projects. The bank’s efforts are laudable: it intends to finance business opportunities that protect the environment to the tune of $30bn by 2020, it’s making its offices more efficient, it’s a big-time supporter of a nonprofit called Grid Alternatives that delivers solar power to low-income people, and so on.  But when I asked Mary whether Wells Fargo has declared itself to be in favor of a carbon tax or a cap on carbon dioxide emissions, she told me that, no, that’s a step the bank has not yet been willing to take. In that regard, Wells Fargo is typical of most big companies in the US. None of the big Wall Street banks – Bank of America, JPMorgan Chase or Citi – has taken a strong political position on the climate issue, as best as I can tell. And although a dozen or so big companies, including an oil company (Shell), utilities (NRG Energy, Duke Energy) and GE joined together back in 2008 to form the U.S. Climate Action Partnership to call for regulation of greenhouse gases, their efforts have gone dormant. With the exception of the Business for Innovative Climate & Energy Policy’s Climate Declaration (weakly-worded as it is), America’s corporate leaders have largely been missing in action when it comes to the climate issue. I thought about all that when I heard today that Patagonia, the outdoor clothing company, is closing its New York stores Sunday until 3pm so that its employees can join the People’s Climate March. CEO Rose Marcario will join the march. Patagonia has also printed a full-page ad about the march in The New York Times. In a blog post, Marcario writes about her great-grandfather, an immigrant laborer who with others worked to build on the city’s streets because “they wanted to create a better future for their children and grandchildren”. That’s what this march is about, she writes: It is the work of this generation to make clear we reject the status quo – a race toward the destruction of our planet and the wild places we play in and love. We cannot sit idly by while large special interests destroy the planet for profit without regard for our children and grandchildren. We have to keep the pressure on. That means being loud and visible in the streets, in town halls and our capitals, and most important, in our elections – voting for candidates who understand we are facing a climate crisis. Meanwhile, Patagonia has launched a crowdsourced art campaign called Vote the Environment that is designed to inspire voters – especially young people – to support candidates who will act on behalf of the future and the climate in the upcoming midterm election. Now I understand that Patagonia is a private company, and a relatively small one, that markets itself to consumers who love the outdoors. It’s a low-risk proposition for Patagonia and Marcario to join a climate march. Cynics will suspect that Patagonia is inviting marchers to gather in its Central Park West store for coffee and bagels on Sunday morning in the hope that they will come back later to buy its pricey gear. But even acknowledging that Patagonia is sui generis, I’m struck by the vast distance between Patagonia (and a handful of other forward-thinking companies) and mainstream corporate America. Imagine the CEOs of big banks, GE or Walmart marching for climate action. It’s inconceivable. What is conceivable – and what’s fair – is to ask those CEOs to follow the lead of business leaders such as Marcario and the Risky Business trio of Hank Paulsen, Michael Bloomberg and Tom Steyer by engaging, in a serious way, in the climate debate. That means putting climate regulation at the top of their companies’ Washington agendas, and refusing to support political candidates who don’t have a plan to deal with the climate crisis.

"World leaders must commit themselves to holding current rises in global temperatures to 2C. That is the stark message of experts and campaigners in the runup to the United Nations climate summit that will be held in New York later this week. They say that 2C is the maximum temperature increase that the world can tolerate without causing environmental mayhem, and they insist that politicians attending the meeting, including Barack Obama and David Cameron, must agree to that upper limit.  ""If Obama and the others decide that 2C has to be the limit, then negotiators will subsequently find it so much easier to hammer out a framework for curtailing carbon dioxide emissions over the next year,"" said Nicholas Stern, the British economist and climate expert who will be attending the meeting. ""If they have a specific goal – a 2C limit – then that will make it so much easier to design carbon emission limits for different countries,"" he told the Observer. The importance of setting an upper temperature limit is also backed by Archbishop Desmond Tutu, writing in the Observer. ""Our environment is already saturated with carbon,"" states the Nobel peace prizewinner and activist. ""If we don't limit global warming to two degrees or less, we are doomed to a period of unprecedented instability, insecurity and loss of species."" The meeting in New York is not part of the United Nations' official climate negotiating process. Instead it has been called by UN secretary-general Ban Ki-moon to kickstart the full-scale carbon emission negotiations that are scheduled to be held in 2015. These are intended to culminate in official talks in Paris next year when it is hoped that a framework will be hammered out for limiting carbon emissions over the following three decades. ""More than 120 world leaders are going to attend the conference in New York, and that will be extraordinarily important in setting the agenda for the Paris talks,"" added Stern. ""If those leaders agree to that temperature limit, the decision will open up all sorts of negotiating avenues."" Scientists say that humans have now poured around 1,950bn tonnes of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere – by burning fossil fuels – over the last 200 years. If that total reaches 3,670bn tonnes, they add, it will be hard to avoid a 2C rise in global temperatures and that would trigger a host of devastating changes to the climate. These would include major rises in sea levels, the melting of ice-caps, droughts in Africa, America and Asia, storms and ocean acidification. The trouble is that, at present rates of fossil fuel consumption, that 3,670bn-tonne limit will be reached in less than three decades. The aim of the New York meeting – which will be marked by a people's climate march in several cities, including London on Sunday – is to give new impetus to climate change negotiations which have stalled over the past two or three years. ""The United Nations has run up against governments and leaders of industry who have until now put short-term economic and political goals ahead of our collective long-term survival,"" writes Tutu. ""We can no longer tinker about the edges."" Observers at the meeting will look for a strong lead from Obama. According to Stern, it is critically important that the US president announce his commitment to limit global temperatures to a rise of no more than 2C. It is also hoped that the Chinese leadership will play a more active role in talks, he added. The New York meeting takes place amid increasing worries about climate change and in particular about surging carbon dioxide levels, the major cause of global warming. These levels rose at their fastest rate for 30 years in 2013, according to figures released this month by the World Meteorological Organisation. The carbon dioxide content of the atmosphere now stands at 142% of what it did before the industrial revolution, with concentrations reaching 396 parts per million last year, an increase on the previous year of 2.9ppm. At this rate, annual concentrations are likely to pass the symbolic 400ppm level by 2015, say scientists. ""Our weather is becoming more extreme due to human activities such as the burning of fossil fuels,"" said World Meteorological Organisation secretary-general Michel Jarraud. ""We must reverse this trend by cutting emissions of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases across the board. We are running out of time."" It was also revealed last week that this summer was the hottest since global temperature records began in 1880. According to a report that was published last week by the US National Climatic Data Centre, the world's land and ocean surfaces averaged 16.35C in August 2014, a temperature that was 0.7C above the average for the 20th century."
"The idea of senior executives of major global businesses marching alongside communists, socialists and anarchists would have been unthinkable even a couple of years ago. But the threat of global warming brought them all together onto the streets of New York on Sunday to take part in the world’s largest climate demonstration, with an estimated 300,000 marchers (or 125,000, depending on whose numbers you believe).  Many activists see big businesses as the largest obstacle to environmental and social justice. Despite concerns that they may not be welcomed, a small number of progressive business leaders – and those who believe that corporates can be part of the solution – decided it was important to be part of the rainbow coalition of activist groups. One high-profile corporate executive in the crowd was Peter Agnefjäll, CEO of home-furnishing multinational Ikea, who was joined by the company’s chief sustainability officer Steve Howard. They demonstrated alongside members of the newly created We Mean Business coalition, including Aron Cramer, head of corporate sustainability network BSR. The biggest contingent from any one company was a group of nearly 100 employees of Unilever, including Kees Kruythoff, president of North American operations; Henry Schrimer, chief financial officer for North America; global chief sustainability officer Jeff Seabright; Jonathan Atwood, vice president of sustainable living and corporate communications; and a group of employees from its ice cream subsidiary Ben & Jerry’s, including co-founder Jerry Greenfield. Key US leaders driving the move to renewable energy were also present, including David Crane, CEO of energy group NRG. We’ve asked executives who attended the People’s Climate March to tell us why they joined and to describe their experience here: My impression is that, since the Vietnam War protests, mainstream Americans tend to believe that people who take to the streets to agitate for social causes are far-left-wing radicals bent on being destructive rather than constructive. As the CEO of a Fortune 250 company - and an energy company no less - I am anything but a radical leftist. I came to the march to show that all of us, all across the political spectrum, ‘own’ this issue and we owe it to our children to act.  At 1pm, when the moment of reflection made its way back to us, I was impressed by the totality of the silence, but then when that moment terminated in a roar that surged from the front of the line in midtown, around the Park and three miles up the canyon of Central Park West to our position on 84th Street, I felt a cathartic surge: We can do this. The people will make this happen.  Public-policy makers are constantly told by their pollsters that the American public doesn’t care about global warming. Hopefully, the climate march will make them think differently. I have come to New York this week together with colleagues from Ikea to attend the UN Climate Summit, to be part of the People’s Climate March and to share what we are doing in our business. I am here as a business leader, as a private citizen and as a father of two lovely children to call for ambitious measures to tackle climate change. It was fantastic to see so many people come out Sunday to march for the climate. We know from talking to our customers that people care about climate change, but seeing people from all different backgrounds at the march is powerful. Being here, it was clear that climate change is one of the biggest issues we face because it affects everyone. People were marching because they want governments and businesses to step up their efforts. At Ikea, we believe that the prosperity of communities everywhere and the future success of business depends on tackling climate change. As well as taking action, it is important for companies like ours to stand up and call for policy makers to lead.  We believe in a #brightfuture. Who's with us? #peoplesclimate #peoplesclimatemarch pic.twitter.com/NZ7oLxJGLd It was amazing to see and feel the collective energy of so many people calling for action on climate. As someone who has worked on climate for a long time, it was an incredibly hopeful moment, a sense that we might just be reaching a tipping point.  Americans from all walks of life were there, an amazing diversity of views and perspectives all rallying around the need to take action now. We had over 100 Unilever and Ben & Jerry’s employees (including co-founders Ben Cohen and Jerry Greenfield) there to show our support. There were many other businesses there too as part of the We Mean Business coalition. But it was also clear that many in the march see corporations as fundamentally a part of the problem.  I understand that view; in fact, my daughter tends to share it. I have a different theory of change in which business can provide the leadership and innovation to drive change at scale. Today was beautiful. #PeoplesClimate #ActOnClimate @350 pic.twitter.com/62GYrqYJgv Riding back on the bus to Vermont, as tired as my feet are, I know one thing for certain. This was not just the end of a long day, but the beginning of a real movement that world leaders will find increasingly hard to ignore. What makes me so optimistic about the march is not just it size, but it’s diversity. More than 1,700 groups helped organize it, from First Nations and youth to labor unions and corporations. There were executives from multinational companies and employees from smaller progressive companies like Ben & Jerry’s. These were not just the usual suspects; these were unusual allies.  I am not a scientist or an expert on climate change; I am an ice cream guy. But I do know that the more business leaders who are willing to walk out of the boardroom and walk into the streets, the more likely we are to avoid the climate crisis that is looming so large before us. This is the problem! @pourmecoffee no mention on Meet The Press, Face The Nation, State Of The Union, Fox News Sunday pic.twitter.com/NvdIJ5Bxu2 Marching with an estimated 300,000 people calling for action on climate change Sunday in New York was exhilarating. The energy was uniformly positive and future-focused. This manifestation of public opinion, which drew from many parts of the US (red states and blue states alike) and many different communities of interest, demonstrated that there is indeed growing interest in government action. And while there were few business representatives in the crowd, a great many from the private sector are present and committed, as we will see at various Climate Week events, including the Ban Ki-Moon’s summit tomorrow. All of us assembling in New York need to play a long game, however. The businesses that are acting on climate have a uniquely important role to play, by demonstrating what’s possible, implementing available efficiency gains today and explaining to policymakers that climate action will in fact preserve our prosperity. A single day’s march is an inspiration. Turning that human energy into decisive action is how the real results will be delivered.  Marching with my friends @unileverusa at #peoplesclimate march pic.twitter.com/pRcYvnzIK6 The climate march was an amazing thing to behold – a serious citizens’ movement. But there was a strange tension, with both a significant theme of anti-corporate sentiment and also representation from companies like Seventh Generation and Unilever, leading with its Ben & Jerry’s brand. I can’t say with a straight face that activists have little reason to mistrust companies, but “business” encompasses far too big a swath of society to make a broad-based condemnation meaningful.  First, there are many clean-economy companies providing solutions that want action on carbon and climate as much as anyone. But there are also mainstream companies that get it and that are supporting the cause by, for example, moving to 100% renewable energy.   The business community must take part in – or even lead the charge to – the clean economy, if for no other reason than this simple reality: business is not separate from society; it’s actually one of its biggest manifestations. Many of those marchers are employees, after all.  We need to stop pretending that business can thrive without a healthy planet or equitable society, or that we can build a prosperous world without the skills, tools, resources and innovation that business provides. We’re all in this together, which – in the end – is what this march was all about.  Dr Sylvia Earle says that what we do in the next 10 years matters more than what humanity does in the next 10,000. Our use of last century’s economic ideologies and technologies fuels the slow-motion wreck called global warming. So on Sunday I joined hundreds of thousands of friends in the People’s Climate March. I could have walked with NGO’s, academics or even at the head with the glitterati. But it’s hard to do business on a dead planet, so I walked with business. We have all the technologies we need to solve climate chaos, but at the measured pace of imperfect markets, we haven’t time for business as usual. I was proud to march beside Unilever, which has committed to becoming 100% renewably powered. Nothing scares politicians like people in the streets. When CEO are in the streets with the anarchists, the UN Secretary General, senators and school kids, we’ve made history. It was such a privilege to stand shoulder-to-shoulder with a third of a million people in New York, all calling for bold climate action. The science is clear; so is the business case.  Seeing a number of CEOs marching, many for the first time, is a clear sign that companies are finally recognizing that business as usual is no longer an option, and that climate change is not only one of the greatest risks, but also one of the biggest opportunities of our time.  To help accelerate the transition to a low-carbon economy and unleash a new era of sustainable economic prosperity for all, it’s critical that many more business leaders join this growing movement for change. I just hope the rallying cry from New York inspires governments and many more companies to take action. We need ambitious policies, new business models and bold leadership. Addressing climate change will require unprecedented collaboration between business, governments and civil society, and it’s great to see all three sectors marching together in this historic mobilisation.  Let’s hope we can continue to build this momentum on the critical road to an ambitious climate agreement in Paris next year. The values-led business hub is funded by SC Johnson.

"Texas has proposed re-writing school text books to incorporate passages denying the existence of climate change and promoting the discredited views of an ultra-conservative think tank. The proposed text books – which come up for public hearing at the Texas state board of education on Tuesday – were already attracting criticism when it emerged that the science section had been altered to reflect the doctrine of the Heartland Institute, which has been funded by the Koch oil billionaires.  A report from the Texas Freedom Network and the National Centre for Science Education on Monday found a number of instances where the proposed texts rejected recognised science. In the proposed 6th grade texts, students were introduced to global warming amid false claims that there was scientific disagreement about its causes. “Scientists agree that Earth’s climate is changing. They do not agree on what is causing the change,” the passage reads. It quotes two staffers at the Heartland Institute who are not scientists. However, as the analysis noted, there is no scientific disagreement about the causes of climate change. The report said the entire section was misleading. “Scientists do not disagree about what is causing climate change, the vast majority (97%) of climate papers and actively publishing climatologists (again 97%) agree that human activity is responsible,” the report said. The NCSE experts also took issue with the prominence given over to Heartland. The views of a fringe were given greater prominence than the findings from the thousands of scientists contributing to the United Nations’ blockbuster IPCC reports on climate change on the opposite page. Minda Berbeco of the NCSE said that the disinformation was a disservice to a new generation of Texans who will have to deal with climate change. “Climate change will be a key issue that future citizens of Texas will need to understand and confront, and they deserve social studies textbooks that reinforce good science and prepare them for the challenges ahead,” she said in a statement. Kathy Miller, the president of the Texas Freedom Network, suggested that the proposed text books had been deliberately aligned with the political ideology of the rightwing Tea Party. A majority of Republicans in Congress deny the existence of global warming or oppose action on climate change. The NCSE reviewers also found disinformation on climate change in the proposed 5th grade text books. The passage reads: “Some scientists say it is natural for Earth’s temperature to be higher for a few years. They predict we’ll have some cooler years and things will even out.” But the centre said that was incorrect. “We are not aware of any currently publishing climatologists who are predicting a cooling trend where ‘things will even out.’” The reviewers said the proposed 6th and 8th grade texts also contained false statements on the causes for the thinning of the ozone layer."
"Climate scientists have just established what did not make a vast chunk of Antarctic ice shelf break off 12 years ago and start floating northwards. They report in the journal Science that they can rule out instability in the bedrock on which the Larsen-B sheet was grounded. That leaves “surface warming” as the most likely explanation: in other words, it could have been climate change as a consequence of increasing atmospheric carbon dioxide that made the 3,250 square kilometres of ice up to 200 metres thick break off from the rest of Antarctica. This was pretty much the conclusion that many people jumped to at the time, but scientists needed to explore other possible causes, and this cautious confirmation of climate change tells the world something about scientific rigour: only once the sea floor was exposed could researchers, in a series of cruises, make seismic measurements and take samples of the mud below. Scientists have to make certain, and while they take time to make certain, politicians may take time to decide how to react, and then how much to react. Had the case of the Larsen-B ice shelf been an isolated indicator, then perhaps energy secretaries and climate ministers would have been justified in moving at the same glacial pace. But in the 12 years before the dramatic collapse of the ice shelf, and in the 12 years since, researchers on all the world’s continents have performed similar rigorous and repeated checks on many thousands of observations of manmade climate change, and the answers all point in just one direction.  Climate change is on the way, with attendant extremes of heat and windstorm, drought and flood, and of course threats to global food security. There may be a legitimate argument about the economic price of concerted political action: there is no longer much argument about the far greater price of global inaction. A UN summit in New York on 23 September is being hailed as the best chance so far to achieve real political movement on an international scale. It is a fair bet that whatever agreements are reached, these will not be enough to halt or even significantly slow the rise in the planetary temperatures. Perhaps this is too pessimistic. But it is a concern based on experience rather than fatalism. The latest episode in the long-running drama of London’s airport expansion plans indicates how seriously Britain takes the carbon dioxide crisis: politicians and their advisers debated alternatives for Heathrow, Gatwick and the mayor of London’s preferred estuary complex, but none of them pointed out that to save energy and cut emissions the world must reduce air travel, and go on reducing it. The message from climate science has not changed in the last 25 years. Every week, new research adds to the urgency. The science is rigorous, the political response must be vigorous.​"
"Rising sea levels are a “sleeping giant” issue that will put at risk coastal infrastructure worth up to $226bn, a new report has found. Analysis by the Climate Council found Australia was likely to experience a sea level rise of 0.4m to 1m by the end of the century, with a “high end” scenario of 1.1m possible if the world warmed by about 4C compared with pre-industrial temperatures.  In this worst-case scenario, $226bn in property, including houses, schools, hospitals and ports, would be exposed to flooding and erosion, making much of it unviable. The report says Sydney is “particularly vulnerable” to sea level rises, as flooding that now comes once every 100 years could occur every month. South-east Queensland would suffer $2bn in damages from just a 0.2m sea level rise, while about 80% of Victoria’s coastline is vulnerable to higher sea levels. Rising sea levels are caused by the melting of glaciers and polar ice caps as the planet warms. Thermal expansion, when the ocean expands due to warming, also contributes to a higher sea level. The global sea level is currently rising by an average of 3.2mm a year. The Climate Council’s report warns that these seemingly small increases matter because they severely exacerbate extreme weather events, making coastal areas more vulnerable to storm surges and flooding. Just a 10cm sea level rise trebles the risk of coastal flooding. Along with flooding, more than half of Australia’s coastline, about 31,000km, is vulnerable to recession, where the ocean eats away and degrades the coastline. The advancing seas will cause problems for the tourism industry, the report predicts, with the Great Barrier Reef and Kakadu national parks put at risk. Sandy beaches such as those on the Gold Coast, in Tasmania and Perth could all suffer erosion. Professor Will Steffen, a co-author of the report, said Australia’s sea level would depend on a number of factors. “There are a range of projected sea level rises and 1.1m is on the highest end,” he told Guardian Australia. “There is concern about the west Antarctic ice sheet, which may not remain stable throughout the century, while Greenland is losing mass too. “Put simply, if you’re an investor in infrastructure you’d expect to be around at the end of the century, get planning for a 1m sea level rise. There are quite a few cities where there will be a thousand-fold increase in one-in-a-century floods, which makes things unviable because you’ll be mopping up every month.” Steffen said radical cuts in carbon emissions, along with a more integrated plan to secure coastal buildings, were required to deal with the looming problem. “There is some good planning going on – for example the people building the new runway at Brisbane airport listened to the science and realised they are on low-lying land that’s prone to flooding,” he said. “They moved it up higher to minimise the risk. “But a lot of councils are carrying the can and it’s hard for them when they don’t have supportive state and national governments. “It appears we don’t have that support in Australia. If you look at the countries successful in getting emissions down, countries like the UK and Germany, they don’t have time for climate sceptics, they get on with the job of preparing their countries for climate change. “It’s disappointing to see Australia moving backwards rather than joining that kind of movement.”"
"South Asia’s rivers are again in furious flow with India’s northern state of Kashmir hit by the worst floods in 50 years. Its capital, Srinagar, has been overwhelmed by the deluge, with road links to the rest of India washed away and villagers marooned on rooftops. India’s prime minister, Narendra Modi, has declared a national disaster. However, with crops and livestock under water, a state that was re-emerging from years of conflict has suffered a cruel setback. On the Pakistani side, the flooding has been equally devastating with more than 300 dead, 2.3 million people affected and rural livelihoods decimated as cotton fields are intentionally flooded to save cities.  We have been here before. Only four years ago an epic flood engulfed large swaths of Pakistan, displacing 20 million people across the country, leading the UN to describe it as the worst humanitarian disaster of its time. In response to the 2010 floods, a younger generation of Indian and Pakistani leaders joined hands and created a platform to foster bilateral cooperation on shared risks and vulnerabilities. Chief among these was climate change and its manifestation in extreme weather events such as the floods, which the World Meteorological Organisation (WMO) attributed to climate change. The efforts of these young Indians and Pakistanis led to meetings in Lahore, Delhi and Davos, starting a conversation around the climate risk faced by both countries and challenging politicians to unite around the shared necessity of climate action. Action is now needed more than ever. Climate change is both a challenge as well as an opportunity for these two nuclear nations. It is a risk that can no longer be ignored, and has to be managed. How to deal with the shared resource of its river waters and what to do when they break their banks in an era of climate change is a key challenge for both India and Pakistan. At the upstream end this will require improved bilateral cooperation on transboundary water management in the Indus river basin. At the downstream end this will need shared expertise and collaboration on improving disaster-risk management. As this month has shown, cataclysmic floods present a real danger to both countries. Both have been ravaged by intense and unseasonable rainfall in the Indus river basin. On 2 September, Kashmir was hit by more than 200mm of rain in less than 24 hours – four times the average monthly rainfall. Yet the state does not have a single flood forecasting station or a disaster management department. As we saw with Pakistan in 2010, this was a disaster waiting to happen. In its fifth assessment report the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) has strengthened its assessment that extreme rainfall will be a feature of climate change as weather patterns shift across south Asia. While we may not be able to predict when disaster strikes, one can plan for it better and prepare accordingly. Given the shared nature of the problem, efforts at a solution too must be shared. This was the message from India and Pakistan’s young leaders in Lahore two years ago. Today it is more resonant than ever. History is not an encouraging guide. The closest south Asia has come to a joint environmental monitoring system for floods is with the WMO-led initiative, the Hindu Kush-Himalaya hydrological cycle observation system. The project has established a regional flood information system to facilitate exchange of hydrometerological data to mitigate casualties and property damage among member countries. These initiatives are vital, but their limitations have been demonstrated by the drama unfolding in India and Pakistan. With new prime ministers at the helm in both countries, there is a unique opportunity to exercise leadership. Both Modi and Nawaz Sharif are from border states and have shown remarkable willingness to engage in peace-building, despite persistent acrimony from their armed forces. Acknowledging that the deadly floods are not an act of god but a symptom of climate change would be a first step towards acknowledging a common vulnerability. This could pave the way to a new era of pragmatic cooperation, embracing basic data sharing at a decentralised state level, encouraging border states (to begin with) to cooperate on climate change, water and disaster risk-management strategies. This may seem far-fetched, but existing initiatives have demonstrated a local will for cooperation. It is now for leaders to act. The stormy monsoon clouds that have brought so much misery to the subcontinent may yet have a silver lining – if they can deliver a climate peace dividend to both peoples.   • Saleem H Ali, professor and research director at the University of Queensland in Australia, and Malini Mehra, founder of the Centre for Social Markets, are the initiators of the Young Global Leade rs Indo-Pak Initiative of the World Economic Forum"
"Campaigners will march through central London this weekend to demand global action on climate change, in one of thousands of events worldwide ahead of a UN climate summit. Some 2,000 events are taking place in 150 countries on Sunday, with more than 100,000 people expected to take to the streets of New York – where next week's summit is being held – to demand leaders take action to tackle rising temperatures. The summit has been convened by the UN secretary general, Ban Ki-moon, in a bid to drive action and momentum towards talks in Paris in 2015, where it is hoped a new global climate treaty can be agreed.  In London, campaigners will be joined by celebrities including actress Emma Thompson and musician Peter Gabriel, and church bells will ring to mark the march through Westminster to parliament, where speeches and a rally will be held. Thompson said: ""There is little time left to prevent the worst excesses of climate change, yet our world leaders continue to stall. ""I've witnessed the impact climate change is already having on the melting Arctic and on poverty-stricken communities in the developing world. We can't go on pretending nothing's happening. I'll be at the march, and I hope I see you all there."" In a statement posted on his website, Peter Gabriel said: ""This big blue ball is the only possible home for humanity in the near future. If our family home was being destroyed and poisoned in the same way, we would do something immediately. ""This is not just a campaign for activists, but for everyone who wants to live on a planet capable of sustaining us. We will only achieve a sustainable future if global citizens demand global action."" Alex Wilks, campaign director of Avaaz, one of the organisations supporting the march, said: ""On 21 September people will join together in huge numbers in the streets of London, and all over the world, calling on leaders to stop climate change destroying everything we love."" Other events around the world include an event in rural Papua New Guinea, where primary school students will march to a lighthouse semi-submerged due to rising sea levels, and a demonstration at the US-Canadian border near Vancouver, where people will link hands to show climate change knows no borders. In New York, Ban has said he will join marchers who are demanding ""action not words"" at the summit next week, which is being attended by more than 120 world leaders including the British prime minister, David Cameron. WWF-UK's chief executive, David Nussbaum, who is attending the summit, said: ""Next week's summit in New York is a special opportunity for the prime minister to show international leadership and clarity of vision – to protect so much about the world around us that so many of us hold dear. ""Action on climate change needs rapidly to build momentum towards a global climate agreement in 2015 to build a positive future for both people and nature."" Ahead of the summit, major investor institutions and business leaders have joined calls for action on tackling global greenhouse gas emissions."

"Thanks to a column that ran in the New York Post a few days ago I think I might now know the physical size of climate science denial – it’s about 500 cubic kilometres. For those still working in imperial measurements (that’s you America), this is about 120 cubic miles.  The New York Post column by two climate science denialists claimed that “the ice caps aren’t melting”. Yet a recent assessment published in March 2014 in the journal The Cryosphere used new satellite measurements to estimate that the world’s major ice sheets in Greenland and Antarctica are now shrinking at the rate of about 500 cubic kilometres a year. That’s a lot of ice to deny is melting. Perhaps they missed it because it’s gone?  But just how much is it? If you took all the ice disappearing every year from Antarctic and Greenland and covered Manhattan Island with it, you’d have a chunk of ice more than five miles high.  For those taking part in the climate change march in the Big Apple on Sunday, or for those watching it, you might want to look to the skies and try and imagine just how much ice that actually is. Australia’s Prime Minister will be in New York next week too, but he won’t be there in time for the UN climate summit for world leaders that will include UK Prime Minister David Cameron and President Barack Obama.  For every second it takes you to read this blog post, ice sheets in Greenland and Antarctica lost more than 15,000 tonnes of ice (some clever techy person should do one of those ‘fun’ countdown widget thingies).  Alternatively, the volume of ice being lost from the two main ice sheets every year is about the same as all the water that flows out of the Mississippi River in a year. The New York Post column ran in the Rupert Murdoch-owned tabloid earlier this week and was written by Canadian Tom Harris and Australian Bob Carter – two long-serving climate science denialists (in my opinion, obviously!).  The column, which patently wasn’t fact checked, started with an attack on actor Leonardo DiCaprio, who will be one of the speakers at the UN Climate Leaders Summit next week.  DiCaprio has narrated and helped finance a series of short films on climate change, the first one titled “carbon”. Carter and Harris obviously hate the fact that one of the world’s most recognisable actors is using his global reach to warn people about fossil fuel emissions. Here’s the video they don’t like. Bob Carter is associated with at least ten different groups around the world that all reckon human-caused climate change is either some kind of hoax or a beat-up. His publishing record on climate change in the scientific literature is close to non-existent. The record for Tom Harris, an Ottawa-based climate “sceptic”, is even closer to nothing. Carter and Harris asked the more than half a million readers of the New York Post to “consider” a few statements they presented as fact but which are actually misrepresentations of the real world.  So let’s “consider” their truthiness. Carter and Harris claim that global warming stopped in the late 90s.  If this statement appears to be inconsistent with the fact that we have just experienced the warmest decade on record and that sea levels continue to rise, ice sheets continue to melt and the oceans continue to build up heat, then that’s because it is. For more on the global warming pause that isn’t, see my previous Planet Oz post. Carter and Harris also tell New Yorkers “rates of sea-level rise remain small and are even slowing”. They claimed that “over recent decades” tide gauges show sea level is going up by about 1 mm per year and satellite data shows an annual rise of 2 to 3 mm. A bunch of factors dictate the world’s changing sea levels. As ocean’s warm, they expand. As ice that’s grounded on land melts (ice sheets), that raises sea levels. Water stored on land – either catchments of through flooding – also has an impact. Natural cycles – mainly ocean temperatures in different parts of the Pacific Ocean – need to be factored in too. Australian scientist Dr John Church is one of the world’s leading authorities on sea level change, with about 100 papers published in scientific journals on the subject. I asked Dr Church about the claims from Harris and Carter. He pointed me to a scientific paper published in 2011 in the journal Surveys in Geophysics showing that in fact, tide gauges record that sea level has been rising at about 2.8mm per year since the early 90s, not the 1mm claimed by Carter and Harris. Dr Church told me: Sea level is clearly continuing to rise, we have a much better understanding of why than previously and the observations are consistent with model projections.  A number of people are doing attribution of sea level to anthropogenic causes now. Sea level is a long-term issue and will have significant impacts. I also asked Dr Church about Carter and Harris’s claim that the “executive summary” of reports from the UN’s International Panel on Climate Change were “written by the politicians.” Dr Church was a drafting author of the summary for policymakers for the latest major IPCC report on the science underpinning climate change. He said That is an insult to me and I suspect many others. Yes governments approved the final Summary for Policy Makers on a line-by-line basis – but the draft was written by the scientists and the scientists had to approve every change that was made – indeed the changes that were made were mostly for clarification.  Carter and Harris also try to tell New York Post readers that “all CO2-based climate models” are wrong because they have not accurately reproduced temperature over the last 15 years or so. This is also false. Dr James Risbey, a climatologist at Australia’s CSIRO science agency, authored a scientific paper in the journal Nature Climate Change earlier this year looking at how climate models have actually been doing. I asked Dr Risbey about Carter and Harris’s claim. He told me: The statement that the recent slowdown in global surface temperature “contradicts all CO2-based climate models” is simply wrong. On the contrary, extensive evaluations of the models have shown that they give good estimates of the warming trends. On 10 to 20 year time scales the rate of warming of global surface temperature speeds up and slows down relative to the long term average rate of warming. Those variations in the rate of warming are driven by variations in ocean circulation (and other processes). That is, CO2 drives a relatively steady warming (on these time scales), but the actual rate of warming experienced fluctuates about that ‘steady’ rate because of natural fluctuations in ocean circulation. The fallacy of the argument that the recent slow down in surface warming contradicts the models is apparent by comparing the 15 years prior to 1998 where the observed rate of surface warming was faster than the average rate from model predictions. That didn’t mean that the models were under-predicting warming rates. It just meant that model averages reflect the steady CO2 warming, but ocean circulation can speed up or slow down that rate for a decade or two. Back in the New York Post, Carter and Harris ask readers to consider that satellites show record levels of sea ice in Antarctica. On the face of it, the fact that sea ice in Antarctic has been growing at rates not seen in the satellite era (1979 onwards) seems to contradict the idea that ice can grow in a warming world. But as I‘ve explained previously, it doesn’t. Ice sheets in the Antarctic are losing mass at a rate of about 159 thousand million tonnes (gigatonnes) a year.  Some scientists say the major west Antarctic ice sheet has already started a long term collapse that could change eventually change the world’s coastline. One study finds that sea ice could be on a temporary rise because fresh water freezes more easily – and there’s now more fresh water from the melting ice sheets than before. Neither do Carter and Harris mention the precipitous long-term decline of sea ice in the Arctic. Even if you think it’s scientifically relevant to compare the Arctic to Antarctica (it’s not because one is a land mass and the other is an ocean) since 1979, the Arctic has been losing about 1.8 million square kilometres of ice, whereas Antarctica has been gaining about 0.28 million. Perhaps Harris and Carter deliberately targeted the sympathetic New York Post for their climate denialist spin because of the rallies and top level UN meetings going on there in the coming days. Global leaders have a lot of work to do between now and a major UN meeting in Paris in 2015 when a new global agreement is supposed to be agreed. Doing nothing about climate change because you deny the scientific evidence exists is one thing. Doing nothing about it when you apparently accept the real world evidence is perhaps even more damaging.  Watch out for the melting ice."
"“There’s nothing I can do in my life to compensate for the fact that the world would be better without me in it,” says Duncan Macmillan, smiling over his coffee. It’s a bleak statement, but one that the writer and director explains is grounded in climate science. Each of us in the west, with our hefty carbon footprints, is a drain on the planet’s resources. When we meet, Macmillan is buried deep in research about the worsening state of the environment. This is all in aid of 2071, a new project for the Royal Court that he is co-writing with climate scientist Chris Rapley. For the past six months, the two men have been meeting regularly at University College London, trading their respective expertise in an attempt to bring climate change centre stage.  Directed by Katie Mitchell, 2071 follows her 2012 show Ten Billion, in which scientist Stephen Emmott painted a gloomy picture of our planet’s future. Macmillan tells me that Rapley’s outlook is more complex, challenging our understanding of how we affect the environment. “I thought I was concerned and had read well about it,” he says, “but it’s a whole other thing talking to Chris.” “I sound like a broken record,” Macmillan laughs a moment later, catching himself using the word complicated yet again to describe Rapley’s insights. Conversation with Macmillan is punctuated with these moments of thoughtful, anxious self-awareness. Intense but amiable, he has a tendency to pause mid-thought, picking apart his own statements as soon as he makes them. It’s a tendency that Macmillan’s plays share. Monster, the play that scooped two awards in the inaugural Bruntwood prize for playwriting, prodded uncomfortably at ideas of responsibility. In Lungs, a conversation about starting a family is folded into concerns about the state of the planet, interlacing the personal and the global. And when approaching George Orwell’s Nineteen Eighty-Four, Macmillan and co-adapter Robert Icke set out to “represent the challenge” of the novel’s ambiguities rather than attempting to solve them. “I can’t speak for what theatre can or should do, but I know from my perspective I’m interested in complexity,” says Macmillan. “Chris [Rapley] keeps saying, ‘It’s a little bit more complicated than that.’ And I’ve always thought that would be a really good subtitle for any good play.” The same complexity applies to Macmillan’s career. Increasingly, he has been working in a number of different roles, from co-directing Headlong’s 1984 with Icke to collaborating with Mitchell on her multi-media productions in mainland Europe. One frustration, however, is the pigeonholing impulse of the British theatre industry. “I think there’s a perception that the playwright is someone who writes the spoken text and that everything else is the domain of the director,” says Macmillan, adding that this is not the case with many of his projects. Not that spoken text doesn’t interest Macmillan any more. He admits that Lungs, for instance, “is essentially just talking”. That play, which is currently on the road with touring company Paines Plough, spans one long conversation over several years. Its agonised back and forth between a couple deciding whether or not to have children was Macmillan’s attempt to wrestle with some of his own anxieties. “I found myself worrying about these things and I didn’t know the solution,” he says, discussing the “anxiety debt” that his generation has inherited. “Putting characters on stage who talk about those anxieties makes them quite absurd. And they are. It is absurd that you can have a conversation now about whether or not you want to start a family and at the same time you can be talking about the industrial revolution.” At the same time as travelling the UK, Lungs is also part of the repertoire at the Schaubühne in Berlin, in a German production directed by Mitchell. While the form that Macmillan initially imagined for the play – no sound, no lights, no props – was an attempt to “break out of a certain kind of formal cul-de-sac”, Mitchell’s production finds a new visual metaphor to communicate the narrative. In her version, the two actors are poised throughout on static bikes, powering the stage lights as they pedal. “What I enjoy most as a theatre-maker and as an audience member is getting my brain to do more than one thing at once,” says Macmillan, pointing to Mitchell’s production of Lungs as one example. Another is Every Brilliant Thing, which tours alongside Lungs this autumn. In this interactive monologue, misery and ecstasy are two sides of the same coin. The subject might be suicidal depression, but the show itself manages to be joyously life-affirming. “It’s the least cool piece of theatre ever, in some ways,” says Macmillan. Staged in the round in Paines Plough’s portable Roundabout auditorium, the formal gesture of the show is deliberately democratic, while its message for those struggling with depression is unashamedly heartfelt. “You’re not alone, you’re not weird, you will get through it, and you’ve just got to hold on. That’s a very uncool, unfashionable thing for someone to say, but I really mean it.” Like so much of Macmillan’s work, Every Brilliant Thing came out of a desire to say something that wasn’t being said. “I didn’t see anyone discussing suicidal depression in a useful or interesting or accurate way,” he says. Similarly, at the time of writing Lungs, he felt that he “wasn’t seeing enough about what it’s like to be alive now”. He positions both of these plays as interventions of a kind, adding with an apologetic smile, “that sounds really grand”. Theatre at its best is, he says, “incredibly direct and incredibly interventionist”. He talks about Wallace Shawn’s monologue The Fever, which the actor and playwright took into people’s homes to shock them into a crisis of conscience. “I find that really inspiring.” So is 2071 an intervention? The questions it poses – “What is happening to our planet, and what is our role in that?” – would suggest so. Still, Macmillan insists, it is not quite as simple as issuing a manifesto for saving the planet. As Rapley might say, it’s a bit more complicated than that. • Lungs and Every Brilliant Thing are at Roundabout @ Hackney Downs Studios until 27 September; 2071 is at the Royal Court 5-15 November."
"August 2014 was marginally the warmest August worldwide since records began 130 years ago, according to new data from Nasa’s Goddard Institute for Space Studies. Temperatures measured by government meteorological offices using land, sea and satellite data suggest this year’s global high was very close to those of 2011, 2008, 2006 and 2003. Overall, temperatures were 0.70C above the 1951-1990 baseline temperature average.  But Nasa warned against reading too much into a single month’s records. “The key issue for climate are the long-term trends, not individual months”, said Nasa-GISS director Gavin Schmidt.  2014 is shaping up to be one an exceptionally warm year, with March 2014 the third hottest since 1880, and May and June the hottest ever. Earlier this year it looked certain that an El Niño event would develop in the Pacific ocean following a rise in sea temperatures, which could be expected to result in extreme weather effects around the world by Christmas. However, expectations of a strong El Niño have since faded. The US west continues to swelter under a prolonged drought while much of the north and eastern US has been noticeably cooler than average for much of 2014. Record temperatures up to 4C above normal have been recorded in west Antarctica, even as the extent of sea ice has reached record levels. "
"Australia is under pressure to commit to a “bold” new post-2020 greenhouse emissions reduction target at next week’s special UN summit, even though it has not yet legislated a policy to meet a minimum pre-2020 target, judged by its own independent adviser to be inadequate. The foreign minister, Julie Bishop, will represent Australia at the New York summit, where the UN secretary general, Ban Ki-moon, has called for announcements of “bold actions and bold commitments” to build momentum towards a successful post-2020 international climate deal at a conference in Paris next year.   “We absolutely need Australia to use the UN summit to commit to bringing forward a post 2020 target well in advance of Paris,” said the deputy director of the Climate Institute, Erwin Jackson. The Abbott government has pledged to review its target to reduce emissions by 5% of 2000 levels by 2020 early next year, and Bishop’s office referred to this commitment when asked what Australia might say at the summit. The government has not said whether this review would extend to considering what deeper emission reduction targets Australia might commit to after 2020.  The government has repealed Labor’s emissions trading scheme but not yet legislated its own policy to try to meet the 2020 target – an emission reduction fund – and without substantial amendment the plan is unlikely to pass the Senate. Modelling has found that cutting emissions further than 5% under the Coalition’s proposed Direct Action plan would be prohibitively expensive – even if the policy is legislated. This was the same charge levelled by Malcolm Turnbull when he explained in 2011 that continuing to use a big government taxpayer-funded scheme to reduce emissions in the long term would “become a very expensive charge on the budget in the years ahead”. And the independent Climate Change Authority, which the government has not yet succeeded in abolishing, recommended in February that the pre-2020 target should be trebled to at least 15% and that Australia look to a longer term target of between 40% and 60% reductions in emissions by 2030.  Tony Abbott has insisted the government will not commit to anything beyond the minimum 5% target “in the absence of very serious like-binding commitments in other countries and there’s no evidence of that”. More than 120 heads of state are planning to attend the summit. Abbott has always made it clear he would not be among them, even though he will be in New York the next day to attend the special UN security council meeting convened by the US president, Barack Obama. On Wednesday Abbott said he could not get to New York a day earlier for the climate summit because parliament was sitting.  “My first duty in a sense is to the Australian parliament and that’s where I’ll be early in the week,” he told ABC radio. “There are quite a lot of things happening in the Australian parliament in the next week or so.” Obama and the UK prime minister, David Cameron, are attending the climate summit, but the leaders of China and India are not. Some countries are expected to use the summit to make pledges to a global climate fund, designed to help poor countries deal with climate change – as Germany did in July with a promise of $1bn. But soon after taking office last year, Abbott confirmed Australia would be making no further commitments to that fund. The previous Labor government deposited $500,000 last year to help the new fund get established, as well as committing almost $600m to a “fast-start” fund.  A spokesperson for Bishop told the Guardian at the time, “the Green Climate Fund is currently in the design phase and Australia will consider its longer term involvement in the fund once its design has been further progressed.” The summit is the first time since the failed 2009 Copenhagen climate negotiations that so many world leaders have gathered to discuss global warming. It is not designed to do deals but rather to build momentum to the UN conference to be held in Paris in December 2015."
"A pair of climate scientists recently had a dispute regarding how much global warming humans are responsible for. Gavin Schmidt from Nasa represented the consensus of 96–97% of climate experts in arguing that humans have been the dominant cause of global warming since 1950, while Judith Curry from Georgia Tech represented the opinions of 2–4% of climate experts that we could be responsible for less than half of that warming. Curry is to be the featured speaker on this subject at a National Press Club event tomorrow hosted by the Marshall Institute; a right-wing thinktank that has spread misinformation about the dangers of smoking, ozone depletion, acid rain, DDT, and now climate change. She may also discuss the subject at an event next week hosted by the fossil fuel-funded right-wing think tank Texas Public Policy Foundation (TPPF).  The exchange between Schmidt and Curry can be read on RealClimate – a blog run by climate scientists. The discrepancy in both the quantity and quality of the supporting evidence used by each scientist was one of the most telling aspects of their debate. For his part, Schmidt referenced the most recent IPCC report. The IPCC summarises the latest and greatest climate science research, so there is no better single source. The figure below from the IPCC report illustrates why 96–97% of climate science experts and peer-reviewed research agree that humans are the main cause of global warming. The black bar indicates the amount of global surface warming observed from 1951 to 2010. The green bar shows the amount of warming caused by human greenhouse gas emissions during that time. The yellow is the influence from other human effects (mainly cooling from human sulfate aerosol emissions, which scatter sunlight), and the orange is the combined human effect. Below those are the contributions from external natural factors (mainly the sun and volcanoes) and from natural internal variability (mainly ocean cycles), while the whiskers show the uncertainty range for each. Notice that the green and orange bars are both bigger than the black bar. This shows that greenhouse gases have caused more warming than has been observed over the past six decades, but some of that was offset by cooling from human aerosol pollution. And the best estimate from the body of peer-reviewed climate science research is that humans are responsible for more than 100% of the global surface warming since 1950, with natural factors probably offsetting a little bit of that with a slight cooling influence.  Schmidt illustrated this key point in the figure below, which is called a probability distribution of the warming caused by humans since 1950. The curve is centered at about 110% – the most likely value for the human contribution to global warming, while the probability of the human contribution being less than 50% is almost nil. Again it’s important to remember that the IPCC report is just a summary of the latest and greatest climate science research. The figures above are supported by the papers that have specifically investigated the attribution of recent global warming. This isn’t just one study; it’s based on many studies that are all in strong agreement. As the IPCC report concluded, It is extremely likely that human activities caused more than half of the observed increase in GMST [global mean surface temperature] from 1951 to 2010. This assessment is supported by robust evidence from multiple studies using different methods. It’s not just “more than half,” it’s also most likely close to 100%. In fact it’s just as likely that humans are responsible for about 160% of the global surface warming since 1950 as it is that we’re only responsible for 50%. Curry disagrees with the expert consensus on this issue, but her arguments are rather muddled and “confused,” as Schmidt puts it. Her main argument is that there is uncertainty regarding the contribution of internal variability. The problem with that argument is that over long periods of time (like the six decades since 1950), positive and negative phases of ocean cycles tend to cancel each other out, and thus internal variability doesn’t have a large influence on long-term temperatures. As the first figure above shows, the IPCC estimates the temperature influence of internal variability since 1950 at ±0.1°C, during which time we’ve seen about 0.65°C global surface warming. Curry also references a report written by Nic Lewis for the anti-climate policy think tank Global Warming Policy Foundation (GWPF), which I wrote about here. The GWPF report argues that the climate sensitivity is toward the lower end of the IPCC estimated range. However, the report is biased towards Lewis’ preferred approach, finding poor excuses to reject the many other methods that arrive at higher climate sensitivity estimates. Moreover, recent research has identified flaws in Lewis’ approach that explain why it incorrectly yields the lowest climate sensitivity estimates. In any case, even if the GWPF were correct, it wouldn’t disprove that most of the warming since 1950 is human-caused. Curry’s other reference is to a single paper written by Zhou & Tung at the University of Washington in 2013, which concluded that roughly half of the global surface warming over the past 32 or 50 years could be explained by ocean cycles (specifically, the Atlantic Multi-decadal Oscillation). Matt Ridley also recently referenced this paper in an error-riddled Wall Street Journal editorial (debunked here and here and here and here). However, as Schmidt points out, Tung and Zhou assumed that all multi-decadal variability was associated with the Atlantic Multi-decadal Oscillation (AMO) and did not assess whether anthropogenic forcings could project onto this variability. It is circular reasoning to then use this paper to conclude that all multi-decadal variability is associated with the AMO.  Recent research led by Michael Mann has confirmed that the approach used by Tung and Zhou misidentifies external influences on the AMO as being part of its internal variability. The problem with relying on a single paper (aka “single study syndrome”) is that flawed studies sometimes get published. On the other hand, when many studies using multiple independent approaches arrive at similar results, they’re probably right. Schmidt’s supporting evidence is far stronger than Curry’s. Thus although Curry doesn’t understand why so few experts agree with her, it’s easy to see why 96–97% of climate scientists and their peer-reviewed research agree that humans are the main cause of global warming. That’s what the scientific evidence overwhelmingly shows. While it’s possible to find one or two flawed papers arguing to the contrary, the balance of evidence is tilted heavily to the side of human-caused global warming.  It’s about as settled as science gets. In fact, it’s about as settled as the fact that smoking causes cancer, chlorofluorocarbons cause ozone depletion, sulfur dioxide causes acid rain, and DDT is toxic. Although the science is inconvenient for certain industries and the political think tanks they fund (like the Marshall Institute and TPPF), these effects all pose dangers to public health. Climate change perhaps most of all."
"The world is heating up under the pressure of rising greenhouse gas emissions, and the consequences will be dire: an increase in extreme weather, droughts, floods, a loss of agricultural productivity, people living precarious lives pushed closer to the brink. But it does not have to be so. Halting the rise of carbon emissions is possible – not only possible, but achievable at a modest cost that will be more than outweighed by the manifest benefits. We spend a little more now, to recoup in the next few decades in the form of breathable air, drinkable water and an atmosphere that doesn't cook us. Sounds familiar? The New Climate Economy report, co-authored by Nicholas Stern, is published on Tuesday but it echoes the warnings first set out in stark terms in his landmark review of the economics of climate change in 2006. Then, his findings were revolutionary. Naysayers had argued that climate change was just too big a problem, too expensive to solve, requiring as it does an overhaul of the world's energy systems and economy. Stern proved – in language that economists can understand – that it could be done, that dealing with climate change need not cost the earth.  Today, the data is clearer than ever and the New Climate Economy report, endorsed by a roll-call of the world's major institutions including the World Bank, the OECD and the IMF, spells it out. If we want economic growth, we can have it – while reducing greenhouse gas emissions and building a new economy that brings a better quality of life for all, and most of all to those living in developing countries where the great majority of future population growth will be. But we can only achieve all of these goals together if we grasp the opportunity within the next 15 years. If we wait any longer, the window will close and we will be doomed to an ever-heating planet and an illusion of growth that in fact impoverishes us all. The first comprehensive study bringing together all of the world's knowledge on climate change came in 1988, with the inaugural report by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. It concluded that global warming was probably the result of human activities but more scientific research was needed. In the intervening decades, that research has been done and the results are clear. The fifth IPCC report, published in stages from last year to this autumn, sets out clearly the ""human fingerprint"" on the climate change that is happening, and is projected to get worse. With all of that scientific knowledge has come technological innovation. Wind turbines were an expensive novelty in the 1980s. Today, several generations of the technology later, they can compete with fossil fuels in generation capacity and on cost. Solar panels have dropped in cost so rapidly that they are economically viable without subsidy in many regions, even those not blessed with constant sunshine. Even fossil fuel-burning power plants have become more efficient, and electric cars provide an alternative to gas-guzzlers, while better building design and more advanced electrical equipment mean we can enjoy modern facilities without rising emissions. All of these innovations are available for us to use here and now, not decades in the future. Yet still we are building fossil fuel power plants, exploring for gas that is ever harder and more expensive to find, steaming oil from tar sands. We do so – companies do so on our behalf – because it still, more than 20 years after the world vowed in 1992 to ""avoid dangerous climate change"", makes economic sense to burn carbon. As this report underlines, we know what we need to do. We have known it for years. What is stopping us?"
"There is an important discussion to be had about the future of scientific publications.  As a practicing and publishing scientist, I am judged by the quality and quantity of my contributions to the scientific community. Traditionally, this comes down to counting how many papers I publish and weighting them by the quality (impact) of the journals where the papers appear. A fancy word for this is “Impact Factor,” which is a measure of the frequency papers in a particular journal are cited compared to the number of papers published.   The highest impact journals are often the hardest to get published in, sometimes having acceptance rates as low as 10%. Typical impact factors depend a lot on your field of study. In journals like Nature and Science, the impact factors are very high. In specialized journals and in specialized fields, the impact factors are much smaller.  In my native field of heat transfer, impact factors as high as 2.5 are rare. In climate science, flagship journals like the Journal of Geophysical Research and Geophysical Research Letters have impact factors in the 3–5 range – this means that the technical field of geophysics has a higher citation rate then say, heat and mass transfer. Journals such as Nature and Science, broad-category journals with huge readership, have citations rates of 42 and 31, respectively. In this traditional model, universities pay each year (often thousands of dollars) to carry the journals. The universities then typically received both hard copy and e-copies of papers which faculty can then obtain. More recently, many library consortia have gone to an electronic-only system. It is probably obvious that with strengths of this system come weaknesses.  A glaring problem is that the subscription fees are quite large and very few practitioners in a field purchase the journals. Instead, they can purchase specific papers that they are interested in, often for $20–40 per article. It is commonly said that the papers are “behind a pay wall.” But, this pay wall is important.  A publisher cannot simply give papers away for free – they would rapidly go out of business. On the other hand, an author can opt to make their papers available without a pay wall, but the author has to pay for this option. My colleagues and I recently wrote a major ocean heating paper and paid multiple thousands of dollars to make it freely available. This money came from our research budgets – budgets that are already tight.  So into this mix enter open-access publishers. Instead of selling papers, they make the articles freely available to the public. On the one hand, this system dramatically alters who can gain access to articles. The papers can be freely downloaded anywhere in the world (hugely important if you are a researcher in the developing world). In addition, open-access journals typically do not print papers in hard copy form, thus saving money on printing and shipping. But how can these journals survive? They do that by charging the author. Fees range anywhere from $100–$1000 or so.  So, whenever a scientist opts to make their papers open-access, they (or their institution) are paying for this service. It is important for the public to recognize this. Publishing behind a “pay wall” does not mean a scientist is hiding anything – it is a necessary part of the business model of traditional journals. And, when journals have a pay wall, they are not gouging the public. These payments cover the costs of editing, printing, formatting, etc.  Many journals, whether open access or not, are for profit enterprises, but they are enterprises that provide a valuable service to society. (Other journals are published by universities and consequently do not fit into this mold).  A problem can arise, however, when open-access journals solicit papers and publish them with sub-quality review as a means to increase profit. These types of journals are often termed “predatory” in that they prey on professors (although faculty shouldn’t be so naïve). All of this presents researchers with a tough choice. Publish in a top-tier journal and likely get a higher profile amongst your peers but a significantly reduced readership outside of academia. Or, publish in open-access venues and increase your public readership but incur publishing costs and lower citation rates among your peers. I would say that most academics have chosen the first approach – shunning the new open-access route and staying with the tried and true journals. I am more mixed. I think there are real benefits to making my research available to a larger audience. On the other hand, I want to ensure that my work is well received by colleagues and has an archived life so that years from now, researchers can read my contributions.  In the end, most of my work is published in the very top thermal-sciences journals such as the International Journal of Heat and Mass Transfer, and Numerical Heat Transfer, with impact factors 2.5 and 1.8, respectively. Recently, I have written in open-access journals, particularly when the subject is not specialized, or when I think it will be of interest to a broad audience. When I write in open-access venues, I hope that my publication payments will guarantee a permanent archive, a broad readership, and top-quality editing. With many new journal ventures beginning each year, it is hard to anticipate which will be around in the years and decades to come. Some ventures are clearly going to be successful, such as Hindawi, Copernicus, SciELO, and Scientific Research. Others may not be successful, particularly if they cannot ensure high quality articles within their pages. An expert on this topic, Dr. Lars Bjørnshauge has taken an active role to categorize these open journals. He founded the Directory of Open Access Journals in 2003 which applies quality metrics to the venues. He summarized his view when he told me,  Open access publishing (with or without) Article Processing Charges is here to stay, not only because of the well documented benefits for the researcher, but as well because more and more research funders, universities and governments has realized that open access to public funded research benefits research, industry, innovation, health etc. and therefore has issued open access mandates and policies requesting that the results of the research should be freely available and reusable. People can learn more about open-access mandates at roarmap.eprints.org. The DOAJ provides a global service listing and disseminating information about fully open access journals providing extensive information about charges, licensing, archiving arrangements etc. The new criteria will enable researchers, universities, research funders and other stakeholders to find good publication channels. So perhaps it is best to share my own guidelines – questions I ask when I decide to go the open access route. As someone who has had the fortune of receiving very tough open-access reviews and broad public access to papers, I will continue to pick and choose a route that is best for each paper that I write. It is clear that researchers will be watching this exciting evolution in scientific publishing. Only time will tell how things play out in the coming years."

"The world can still act in time to stave off the worst effects of climate change, and enjoy the fruits of continued economic growth as long as the global economy can be transformed within the next 15 years, a group of the world's leading economists and political leaders will argue on Tuesday. Tackling climate change can be a boon to prosperity, rather than a brake, according to the study involving a roll-call of the globe's biggest institutions, including the UN, the OECD group of rich countries, the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank, and co-authored by Lord Stern, one of the world's most influential voices on climate economics.  The report comes ahead of a UN-convened summit of world leaders on global warming next week at which David Cameron has pledged to lead calls for strong action. ""Reducing emissions is not only compatible with economic growth and development – if done well it can actually generate better growth than the old high-carbon model,"" said Stern. It is his most significant intervention in climate politics since the landmark 2006 Stern review of the economics of climate change, which made the case that tackling climate change as a matter of urgency will be cheaper than attempting to deal with the effects of the problem decades in the future. That report marked a revolution in thinking on global warming, and was a major factor in the agreements forged in Copenhagen in 2009 by which developed and major developing countries for the first time set out joint measures to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. The economic transformation proposed in the new report will improve the lives of billions, the authors argue, from people suffering from air pollution in crowded cities to farmers struggling with poor soils in developing countries, the authors found. But achieving this change will require strong political action to set limits on carbon dioxide emissions, while promoting alternatives such as renewable energy, sustainable cities, teaching modern farming techniques and better-designed transport. The world is expected to add billions of people to the global population in the next two decades, and trillions of dollars in economic growth – but if the massive expected growth of developing world cities is poorly managed, and global investment is poured into existing high-carbon infrastructure, then a unique opportunity to change the pattern of prosperity will have been lost, and billions of people will be left the poorer as a result, the report warns. Stern gave the example of cities, which if designed on public transport can have more efficient economies – because people aren't spending hours commuting and polluting, with its attendant effects on health – as well as better quality of life and lower carbon emissions. The energy and climate change secretary, Ed Davey, told the Guardian that the UK has already seen benefits from focusing on clean development, and was committed to helping developing countries do the same. He said: ""It has required UK business and international investors to recognise the costs of failure and the benefits of change and it has been sustained by a strong, vocal and committed network of NGOs, pressure groups and activists who have been instrumental in sustaining political will and public acceptance."" At next week's climate summit, the UN secretary general, Ban Ki-moon, will convene heads of state and government from around the world to discuss climate change for the first time since the 2009 Copenhagen conference, which produced the first commitments from major developing countries such as China and India to curb emissions, and marked the first time the US agreed to binding emissions targets, but was widely derided for the scenes of chaos that accompanied it. Convening world leaders again is a risky strategy, but is seen by the UN as essential to lay the ground for a crunch meeting in Paris next year, at which world governments will attempt to forge a new agreement that will cut global greenhouse gas emissions after 2020, when current pledges run out. The EU has vowed to cut emissions by 40% by 2030, compared with 1990 levels, but is the only major developed country bloc to have laid out clear plans. Today's report, the New Climate Economy, from the Global Commission on the Economy and Climate, says that although technological ""fixes"" to climate change – such as renewable energy, low-carbon fuels, better urban design and better use of agricultural land – are growing fast, they are currently nowhere near enough to produce the transformation needed. As new power stations, cities and transport networks are built today, they are still being engineered on a high-carbon basis – coal-fired power plants, roads rather than public transport, slums without facilities rather than planned developments – and once these are built they lock in high carbon emissions for decades to come. Breaking that cycle requires a coordinated effort, from rich and poor countries, that prioritises sustainability and penalises high-carbon growth, for instance through a price on carbon. Such efforts will come at a price, but this is far outweighed by the benefits in economic growth and improvements in health, the report suggests. For instance, reducing the world's dependence on coal and other dirty fuels will cut air pollution and remove a key source of strain on healthcare systems. The Global Commission on the Economy and Climate, launched a year ago by the UK along with six other countries, has involved the World Bank, the International Monetary Fund, the OECD, the International Energy Agency and the UN, as well as several research institutes, and former world premiers. It has been chaired by the Mexican president, Felipe Calderón, and advised by leading economists including Lord Stern and Nobel prize winners Daniel Kahneman and Michael Spence. Ottmar Edenhofer, chief economist at the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research, and an adviser to the report, said: ""Economic growth and emissions reductions can be achieved together, the report clearly confirms … Pricing CO2 is key. The heaven above us today is a waste dump for gases that harm our climate system. Wealthy states are disposing of them, free of charge, at the expense of all of us. If emitting CO2 came at a reasonable price, this would stabilise investors' expectations so they can push forward the innovation of climate friendly technologies."""

"We are almost out of time to build a zero carbon future, and the devastating impacts of global warming will only become worse if our leaders do nothing. Tens of thousands of people in Australia and many thousands more around the world marched today to send this message to delegates in New York for the United Nations climate summit. Were you at today's #PeoplesClimate march? It was big. #PeoplesMarch #Melbourne pic.twitter.com/nBxMIrwNSS — Alexander White (@alexanderwhite) September 21, 2014 Over 20,000 people marched in Melbourne, listening to politicians like Labor's Mark Butler and the Greens party's Christine Milne call for climate action. Turtles against #climate change listening to Mark Butler. #peoplesmarch #Melbourne pic.twitter.com/sjqqUOFrOr — Alexander White (@alexanderwhite) September 21, 2014 This global event is an amazing confluence of international civic action, a full twenty-four hours of people power calling for the de-carbonisation of our world. The fact that it can happen at all is a reason to be a climate optimist. The science of global warming is unequivocal. The physical evidence is in: the temperature is rising to dangerous levels far faster than most worst case scenarios. Current trends will lead us to 4°C of global warming or worse by the end of the century. If we exceed 2°C then it is likely the warming will be irreversible and enormously dangerous. Climate related catastrophes are already increasingly commonplace. Cyclones, fires, floods, droughts, melting glaciers and unseasonal weather are more commonplace than ever before. As they become more common and more severe, communities and societies will be impacted; lives and jobs will be displaced. A new, zero carbon future is possible. The New Climate Economy report released last week shows that lasting economic growth is possible through deep structural reform that transforms the global economy into a low-carbon, climate resilient one. Developing countries will be at the heart of these changes, but rich nations like Australia must do their fair share through carbon reduction policies and through investing in new, clean renewable energy technology. At the Melbourne climate march, many of the signs called for the Abbott government to retain the renewable energy target. The target is one of the few remaining structural policy reforms to assist with reducing Australia's carbon emissions. WOW! 30,000 Australians joined the #PeoplesClimate march in #Melbourne today! Amazing images: https://t.co/SehZhlsZaD pic.twitter.com/UhgLouRqod — Avaaz (@Avaaz) September 21, 2014 The renewable energy target rates as one of the most effective bi-partisan policies of the last decade. It is also enormously popular, with polling by the Liberal-party aligned firm Crosby Textor showing that more than 80 percent of Australians support the target, and as many as 70 percent of Liberal voters want the target unchanged. While the policy was once bi-partisan, it is no longer, with senior Liberal government figures calling for it to be frozen, wound back or abolished. It is essential that policies such as the renewable energy target remain. It is also important that the disastrous decision made by the Abbott government to repeal the carbon pricing legislation be reversed as soon as possible. Carbon prices, shadow prices and emissions reduction measures are now a reality in over forty nations, with twenty regions now having some form of carbon pricing. Structural reform is essential to reign in carbon pollution and cut emissions. In the USA, the climate march is backed by an ""unprecedented coalition of 45 major labor groups, including heavy hitters such as the Service Employees International Union (SEIU) — a group that Henn said ""doesn't mess around"" — along with prominent grassroots environmental organizations like 350.org as well as religious organizations"". It is heartening that increasingly environment groups are joining forces with other civil society groups like unions, faith groups and development agencies. Internationally, unions are building a global campaign under the banner ""no jobs on a dead planet"". These alliances and campaigns in civil society, as well as ones in the business world, are the start of a positive civil society ""tipping point"", guided by the optimistic hope that we can still act to stop global warming. As I publish this article, the climate marches continue, a colourful, vibrant call for actions not words, to stop the greatest threat to our future. We can no longer continue with business as usual. We can't rely on politicians doing the right thing in New York; each and every one of us can take action now. Follow the climate marches live on The Guardian here."

"If you want to understand why we are not making faster progress towards creating a more equitable society that operates within ecological limits, then it’s worth understanding the importance of the void. One of the core fears around our industrialised society, which we are largely refusing to face up to, is the belief that there is no credible alternative to the current global economic system, which is now undermining our prosperity and may even threaten our civilisation.  The current economic system has created great wealth and brought hundreds of millions of people out of abject poverty, but in its search for continuous growth, it is increasingly becoming a destructive force that is stimulating climate change, resource scarcity, growing inequality and biodiversity loss on an epic scale. As the well-known fund manager Jeremy Grantham has stated: “People simply do not get the point that you can’t have sustainable growth forever. You can have sustainability forever, or growth for a few years. Capitalism does millions of things better than the alternatives. However, it is totally ill-equipped to deal with a small handful of issues. Unfortunately, they are the issues that are absolutely central to our long-term well-being and even survival.” The collective failure to re-imagine another pathway results in focusing our intellectual power on trying to prop up the existing system, even though this is akin to putting a plaster on a gaping wound. This is the sort of thinking that led the president Bush to urge Americans to “go shopping more” to help dig the country out of recession – doing more of the thing that helped trigger the crisis in the first place. In fact, our very addiction to consumerism, like all other addictions, is designed to avoid having to look into the abyss of our own lives. But if we are to restore some sense of balance to the world, it is vital we move away from the actions of the famous quote: “spending money you don’t have for things you don’t need to impress people you don’t like.” With all this in mind, Guardian Sustainable Business is launching a new section called Rethinking Prosperity. The purpose is to showcase the vibrant community of academics, thought leaders and practitioners around the world who are exploring systems change. These range from new initiatives such John Fullerton’s regenerative capitalism to organisations that have been diligently working on these issues for decades, such as the New Economics Foundation. While our gaze is to the future, we also recognise the need to keep critiquing the current system and looking for key intervention points which can be leveraged for change. We’ve specifically avoided using the words “economy” or “capitalism” in the section title because we want to take a broad approach to the idea of prosperity and recognise that economic notions of prosperity can compete or interact negatively with broader societal objectives such as health and happiness. Besides engaging experts from the worlds of business and finance, we will also see what we can learn from the arts as well as looking at psychological and spiritual approaches to overcoming the issues we face. We want to ensure we do not just focus on the industrialised north, but also see what lessons we can learn from the south, and we want to bring to the fore voices of young economists and activists who rarely have a voice in the mainstream media.  New narratives are particularly needed in the business world. When we launched Guardian Sustainable Business more than four years ago, we wanted to demonstrate how business could return to being a force for positive change in the world. While modest progress has been made, companies remain constricted by the straitjacket of profits maximisation and short-termism and are therefore forced to only tinker around the edges of change. Even the more enlightened companies are locked into a model of ever-increasing growth. Peter Bakker, the president of the World Business Council for Sustainable Development, declared that if all the sustainability initiatives of every company in the world were combined, they would not stack up to a row of beans when compared to the scale of challenges we face. While Rethinking Prosperity will look at theories of change, it will also focus on taking action. It would be foolish to underestimate the scale of the challenge and the likely turbulence of any transition to a new system. But it is vital we stay positive and look for realistic alternatives. Is economic growth necessary for, or at odds with, human prosperity, and when we strip everything away, what does human flourishing truly look like on a finite planet?

"Tens of thousands of people have attended climate change rallies across Australia, in the first leg of a global wave of protests calling for tougher action to reduce greenhouse gas emissions ahead of the UN climate summit in New York next week. The main People’s Climate March rally was held in Melbourne on Sunday, with Victoria police estimating at least 10,000 attended. Organisers put the figure closer to 20,000, with families, young people and the elderly making the most of the sunshine to urge the prime minister, Tony Abbott, to do more to tackle climate change.  There were also marches in Sydney, Canberra, Adelaide, Brisbane, Perth, Newcastle and Darwin. The rallies, along with gatherings in cities across south-east Asia and Europe, are a prelude to what is expected to be a 100,000-strong climate march in New York. Protesters at the Australian rallies, organised by 350.org and activist group GetUp, denounced the Coalition government’s axing of the carbon price. There was also vocal support for the renewable energy target, currently under review, and the protection of ecosystems such as the Great Barrier Reef. A one-day summit will be held by the UN next week to galvanise political support for a new international treaty to cut greenhouses gases beyond 2020. The final stages of the agreement will be hammered out at a UN meeting in Paris in 2015. Leaders from more than 120 countries will attend the summit, although this number does not include Abbott, who will be in New York the following day for a UN meeting on security issues. The foreign affairs minister, Julie Bishop, will represent Australia at the climate conference, although she will reportedly not reveal what Australia’s emissions reduction target beyond 2020 will be. Australia currently has a goal of a 5% cut in emissions by 2020, based on 2000 levels. Mark Butler, Labor’s environment spokesman, told journalists before the Melbourne climate rally that Abbott should have attended the UN climate meeting. But Butler would not specify what Labor’s position was on post-2020 emissions cuts. “Both major parties had strong commitments to carbon pollution reduction based on a range of conditions,” he said. “It’s not clear whether those conditions have been satisfied. We haven’t got a position [on post-2020] yet. That’s the serious work Australia should be doing now, but instead the Abbott government is busy dismantling the good work we’ve done to date.” Greens leader Christine Milne told the rally Australia should be net carbon zero by 2050, adding: “The reign of fossil fuels is over. What we now have to do is end the reign of the fossil fools who keep it going. “We want no more delays. Climate change is real, it is accelerating, we are on a trajectory for four degrees of warming which is an unlivable planet and we won’t stand for it. That is what we have to convey to Tony Abbott and leaders around the world.” The Melbourne rally was brimming with personal antipathy towards Abbott, with a giant puppet of the prime minister paraded throughout the crowd and verbally abused. One placard depicted Abbott as a wolf. But the mood was generally good-natured, and perhaps even a little downbeat compared to a previous climate rally in November, which took place before the carbon price was repealed. Chants of “What do we want? Climate action. When do we want it?” were met with the odd call of “10 years ago” rather than the planned “now.” It felt like a crowd weary of fighting this battle. Melbourne woman Victoria Marshall-Cerins was there with her daughter Anna. “I’m deeply concerned about my children’s future, they are the ones who will have to clean it up,” she told Guardian Australia. “Australia is now dragging its heels. From one of the world’s leaders, we’re now going backwards. We’re embarrassing.” Marshall-Cerins said she didn’t like to talk about the ramifications of climate change in front of Anna. “She gets quite anxious,” she said. “It’s hard to articulate in front of her. It’s the single greatest threat to our way of life since the 1940s.”  Jeremy Lawrence, who had donned a papier-mâché shark as a hat, said he was marching as an “economic rationalist and libertarian”. “We have a lot of old coal-fired power stations ending their useful life,” he told Guardian Australia. “They have to be phased out in a rational way. “The cheapest way of supplying electricity to the whole of the country is distributed solar. I just don’t understand what the problem is for the Liberal party, which is meant to be the economic rationalist party, to support that.” The Climate Institute said it hoped to see Australia’s timeline for setting post-2020 emissions reduction goals in New York. “We will be looking for a recommitment to the international goal of avoiding 2C warming and an independent, transparent process and timeline for new post-2020 targets, which Australia is due to indicate to other countries next year,” said John Connor, chief executive of the Climate Institute. “Now is the time for Australia to come clean on its commitments. Is the government going to be fair dinkum about these climate negotiations, or will they be playing poker with the planet’s wellbeing?”"

"This Changes Everything is as much about the psychology of denial as it is about climate change. “It is always easier to deny reality,” writes Naomi Klein, “than to allow our worldview to be shattered, a fact that was as true of diehard Stalinists at the height of the purges as of libertarian climate deniers today.” Much of this book is concerned with showing that powerful and well-financed rightwing thinktanks and lobby groups lie behind the denial of climate change in recent years. There is not much reasonable doubt as to the findings of science on the subject. As a result of human activities, large-scale climate change is under way, and if it goes on unchecked it will fundamentally alter the world in which humans will in future have to live. Yet the political response has been at best ambiguous and indecisive. Governments have backed off from previous climate commitments, and environmental concerns have slipped down the policy agenda to a point at which in many contexts they are treated as practically irrelevant. For Klein none of this is accidental. Following on from her 2007 book, The Shock Doctrine, a timely and powerful exposé of the environmental and social devastation wrought by neoliberal policies of “shock therapy”, Klein interprets the marginalisation of climate change in the political process as the result of the machinations of corporate elites. These elites “understand the real significance of climate change better than most of the ‘warmists’ in the political centre, the ones who are still insisting that the response can be gradual and painless and that we don’t need to go to war with anybody… The deniers get plenty of the details wrong… But when it comes to the scope and depth of change required to avert catastrophe, they are right on the money.”  The first of the book’s three sections details how the environmental movement has been derailed by the financial crisis and the aftermath of austerity, together with the corporate promotion of climate denial. In the last of the three Klein deals with the movements that are springing up in a wide variety of contexts to challenge the neoliberal order. The second section, dealing with what Klein calls “magical thinking”, is in many ways the core of the book. Here she considers technical fixes for climate change, including schemes of geoengineering. In one of the more grandiose schemes, dimming the rays of the sun with sulphate-spraying helium balloons has been proposed in order to mimic the cooling effect on the atmosphere of large volcanic eruptions. The risks of such technical mega-fixes are obvious. As any climate scientist will tell you, we simply don’t know enough about the Earth system to be able to re-engineer it safely. Yet as Klein notes, such madcap schemes will surely be attempted if abrupt climate change gets seriously under way. Klein is a brave and passionate writer who always deserves to be heard, and this is a powerful and urgent book that anyone who cares about climate change will want to read. Yet it is hard to resist the conclusion that she shrinks from facing the true scale of the problem. When I read The Shock Doctrine (Guardian review headline: “The end of the world as we know it”), I was unconvinced that corporate and political elites understood what they were doing in promoting the wildly leveraged capitalism of that time, which was already beginning to implode. The idea that corporate elites are in charge of the world is even less convincing today. The neoliberal order has recovered, and in some countries even achieved a spurious kind of stability, but only at the cost of worsening global conflicts. The fantasy of a global free market has given way to the murky struggles of geopolitics, with great powers jostling for control of natural resources. This is a dangerous world, but not because an all-powerful elite is in charge. None of the states contending for power in the Middle East, Ukraine or the South China Sea can control or predict the consequences of their actions. No one is in charge in the world’s conflicts. Another problem with pinning all the blame for climate crisis on corporate elites is that humanly caused environmental destruction long predates the rise of capitalism. As Klein herself observes in an interesting chapter on what she calls “extractivism” – the economic model that treats the Earth as a bundle of resources waiting to be exploited – human activity was already changing the climate centuries ago. “We started treating the atmosphere as a waste dump when we began using coal on a commercial scale in the late 1700s and engaged in similarly reckless ecological practices well before that.” Moreover, though Klein doesn’t explore the fact, it’s worth bearing in mind that the extractive model was applied on a vast scale in the centrally planned economies of the former Soviet Union and Mao’s China, where some of the largest and worst 20th-century environmental catastrophes occurred. Along with most environmentalists nowadays, Klein doesn’t discuss overpopulation. But there can be little doubt that population pressure has been a powerful driver of environmental crisis. The extractive economy began with the invention of agriculture, which may itself have been a response to rising human numbers. Even before the spread of farming, migrating hunter-gatherers were implicated in a number of great extinctions. Population growth is slowing in many countries at the present time, but there will still be 8 or 9 billion human beings on the planet within the lifetime of many now living and pressures on resources can only increase. Though she identifies the prevailing type of capitalism as the culprit in the climate crisis, Klein doesn’t outline anything like an alternative economic system, preferring instead to focus on particular local struggles against environmental damage and exploitation. In many ways this makes sense, but in a global environment of intensifying scarcities, giving priority to local needs is unlikely to be a recipe for harmony. Whether in the Congo in the 1960s or Iraq at the present time, internecine conflicts – exploited and aggravated by the geopolitical stratagems of great powers – have led to a condition of endemic war. Throughout This Changes Everything, Klein describes the climate crisis as a confrontation between capitalism and the planet. It would be more accurate to describe the crisis as a clash between the expanding demands of humankind and a finite world, but however the conflict is framed there can be no doubt who the winner will be. The Earth is vastly older and stronger than the human animal. Even spraying sulphuric acid into the stratosphere will not trouble the planet for long. The change that is under way is no more than the Earth returning to equilibrium – a process that will go on for centuries or millennia whatever anyone does. Rather than denying this irreversible shift, we’d be better off trying to find ways of living with it.

"At exactly 1pm on Sunday, the streets of New York City are going to fill with the sound of clanging pots, marching bands, church bells and whatever other kinds of noisemakers that participants of the People’s Climate March decide to bring along. It’s being called the “climate alarm”, and the general idea is that a whole lot of people are going to make the very loud point that climate change is a true emergency for humanity, the kind of threat that should cause us to stop what we are doing and get out of harm’s way.  Is it a stunt? Well, sure, all protests are. But the mere act of expressing our collective sense of climate urgency goes beyond symbolism. What is most terrifying about the threat of climate disruption is not the unending procession of scientific reports about rapidly melting ice sheets, crop failures and rising seas. It’s the combination of trying to absorb that information while watching our so-called leaders behave as if the global emergency is no immediate concern. As if every alarm in our collective house were not going off simultaneously. Only when we urgently acknowledge that we are facing a genuine crisis will it become possible to enact the kinds of bold policies and mobilize the economic resources we need. Only then will the world have a chance to avert catastrophic warming. It’s not simply that our leaders aren’t leading us – at an appropriate gallop – away from fossil fuels and towards the renewable energy revolution that is both technologically and economically feasible. It’s that most of them are doubling down on the very energy sources that are most responsible for the crisis, cheering on the extractive industries as they dig up the most greenhouse gas-intensive fossil fuels on the planet: oil from the tar sands, gas from fracking, extra-dirty lignite coal. Surrounded by such wild contradictions, most of us perform all sorts of mental tricks to try to reconcile the irreconcilable. Those scientists and environmentalists must be exaggerating, we tell ourselves. Or there must be more time before we really need to change. Or maybe: the experts are just on the verge of figuring out a techno-fix. But does anyone really believe these fairy tales? Sunday’s climate march will serve many purposes for its many participants: meet up, boost morale, exert political pressure. But sounding the alarm together will help us bring our actions in line with our emotions. So many of us are scared of what is happening to the world around us; for one day, we will come together and show it. Yes, we will be showing that sense of existential urgency to our politicians. But we will be showing one another. By sounding this people’s alarm, we will also be saying that we are no longer waiting for politicians to declare climate disruption an emergency and respond accordingly. We are going to declare the emergency ourselves, from below, just as social movements have always done. The day after the march, many will be taking part in Flood Wall Street events, to draw clear connections between the logic of frenetic profit-making that rules financial markets and the collective failure to take the measures necessary to prevent runaway climate change. The true leaders are not the ones who will show up at the United Nations next week in motorcades. The true leaders are the people next to us in the streets: the people who already achieved, and are fighting to defend, a moratorium against natural gas fracking in New York state. The Indigenous communities using their hard-won land rights to try to stop the suicidal expansion of the Alberta tar sands in Canadian court. The grassroots environmental justice groups in New York City that have been fighting the siting of toxic refineries and incinerators in the neighbourhoods for decades. And the students who have been demanding that their universities divest their endowments from fossil-fuel stocks, on the grounds that such businesses have made an immoral bet against all of our futures. These are the people showing us what it looks like to act upon those terrifying warnings from climate scientists. To run away from the fire, instead of towards it. Naming climate change as a clear and present danger is not a solution in itself, of course. But it is the critical first step. Forcefully expressing our collective sense of urgency will help us resist the next attempt to tell us that some manufactured economic imperative is more important than the stability of the planet – whether it’s the supposed need for more government austerity, or the need to grow the economy at any cost. That sustained sense of urgency will allow us to demand the kinds of bold action required to get off fossil fuels, and move to a regenerative economy, in the brief window we have left. More from Guardian US on the People’s Climate March:"
"Tim Cook is the CEO of Apple, possibly the world’s most innovative company and inarguably its most valuable – just ahead of fossil-fuel giant ExxonMobil. So his appearance at the opening of Climate Week 2014 on Monday lent a little celebrity buzz to a day which otherwise had a been-there-done-that feeling about it. The climate change issue, Cook told a gathering of business and political leaders in New York, resonates with Apple’s workers and with its customers, which is why the company has moved from environmental laggard to green leader in recent years, winning plaudits even from Greenpeace.  “The long-term consequences of not addressing climate are huge,” he said. “I don’t think anyone can overstate that.” Cook said he doesn’t believe there’s a tradeoff between the economy and the environment. “If you innovate and you set the bar high, you will find a way to do both,” he said. “You must do both.”  One example? The company is building its new headquarters, which, Cook expects will be “the greenest building on the planet”. None of this came as a surprise. Apple hired Lisa Jackson, the well-respected former EPA chief, to lead its sustainability efforts last year, and the company has signed the Climate Declaration, which describers tackling climate change as “one of America’s greatest opportunities of the 21st century”. And at Apple’s annual shareholder meeting in March, Cook bluntly told a critic of the company’s sustainability efforts that “if you want me to do things only for ROI (return on investment) reasons, you should get out of this stock.” This week, Cook, who is 53, described climate change as a defining issue for his generation. “Boomers have to look at ourselves deeply and ask if we want to be the first generation who leaves the world worse off,” he said. Cook was one of the few fresh faces to appear in the course of a day when The Climate Group, the nonprofit organizer of the kickoff event, trotted out mostly veterans of the climate wars: CEO Paul Polman of Unilever, Richard Branson of the Virgin empire, Ikea CEO Peter Agnefjäll and chief sustainability officer Steve Howard, Aron Cramer of BSR and Peter Bakker of the World Business Council for Sustainable Development. To no one’s surprise, UN chief Ban Ki-moon declared: “We must have this global climate change agreement by 2015.” John Kerry, the US secretary of state, said: “It is absolutely imperative that we decide to move and act now.” Meanwhile, Unilever’s Polman said that the world’s leading companies “are asking for a price on carbon” and for an end to the “perverse subsidies” for climate-destroying fossil fuels. And Ikea’s Agnefjäll added: “We want to have a positive impact on people and the planet.” Well, sure. The trouble is, corporate executives have been mouthing such platitudes for years. Despite all of the big talk and the big goals – GE’s Ecomagination, Walmart’s sustainability commitments, IBM’s Smart Cities program and all the rest – many companies around the world continue to grow production based on power plants that burn coal and natural gas, making the overall problem worse, not better.  Just last weekend, scientists reported that global emissions of greenhouse gases rose by 2.3% in 2013 to record levels, with much of that growth driven by the industrialization of China and India. That’s not unexpected given there is little or no regulation of greenhouse gases in China or the US, the world’s two leading emitters, and no appetite for curbing emissions in much of the developing world, where more than 1 billion people live without electricity. Apple may build green headquarters and carbon-neutral data centers, but its suppliers in China who manufacture iPhones and iPads generate tons of climate pollution. This is why some longtime climate warriors argue that companies must get serious about spending their political capital on behalf of pricing carbon. As climate activist Charles Komanoff put it this week: “A carbon tax is the only way for the climate damage caused by burning fossil fuels to be brought inside the arc of individual and societal decision-making that determines how much of those fuels society uses and, thus, how much carbon it emits.” BSR’s Cramer, an organizer of the new, broad-based We Mean Business coalition, also argues that voluntary corporate commitments won’t get us where we need to go. “It is the best companies that understand the limitations of what they can do on their own,” he said. Some see signs of progress. Mike Barry, the sustainability chief at retailer Marks & Spencer, told me: “I sense that behind the usual suspects this time there are hundreds and maybe thousands of companies lined up. Business needs to become political with a small ‘p’.” Ikea’s Howard went further. “I think this is a watershed moment,” he said. Increasingly, companies understand the costs and risks of climate inaction, and they are ready to make low-carbon investments, he said. “It’s created a buzz in the business community.” Better late than never. As Cook put it: “From our point of view, the time for inaction has passed.” The values-led business hub is funded by SC Johnson.

"Rich nations should make the deepest emission cuts and provide most money if countries are to share fairly the responsibility of preventing catastrophic climate change, says a major new study. Calculations by Stockholm Environment Institute (SEI) scientists and Friends of the Earth suggest the UK would need to make cuts of up to 75% on 1990 emission levels by 2025 and would also need to transfer $49bn (£30bn) to developing countries. The US would have to cut slightly less, but transfer up to $634bn to make a fair contribution.  But in a fair system of shared responsibility, most developing countries would be net receivers, says the report, released ahead of Ban Ki-moon’s climate summit in New York on Tuesday. Kenya would receive $2bn, and be allowed to increase its emissions by more than 50%, while Peru would be allowed to double its emissions and receive $6bn. South Africa would have to cut emissions only marginally, but would receive $13bn, and the Philippines would be given $6bn, although it would have to cut emissions by up to 46%. The first scientific attempt to link precise emission cuts and the money needed to hold temperatures to a 1.5C rise by 2025 takes UN data and calculates each country’s “fair share”. It does so by factoring in how much carbon each country has emitted historically, how much wealth it has and its population. The principle of fairness, and the right of some countries to receive support, are accepted in the UN climate talks. Given its population, wealth and limited historical responsibility, China could argue that it has the right to increase its emissions by about 40% by 2025, but if the world is to hold to a 1.5C target it needs to cut its emissions on today’s levels by 25% to 45%. “That difference could cost China up to $497bn – transfers that would need to be made via access to technology,” says the report. Equally, Russia is said to deserve financial help to move away from fossil fuels given its fall in emissions since the end of the USSR and its relative poverty. But Brazil would get almost no financial support and would have to reduce its emissions by 22% on 1990 levels to do its fair share. “In the Philippines we know we have to take action, and the analysis shows that on our own we can only increase our emissions by 40% or so by 2025, which is less than what is currently projected. We are struggling to stop the expansion of coal in order to meet that fair share,” said Lidy Nacpil, of the Jubilee South-Asia/Pacific Movement on Debt and Development. She added: “But the science also shows that the Philippines’ fair share will not be enough, and to stop climate change we must do more to reduce emissions than would be expected. “We are demanding the transfer of resources in order to do that, estimated here to be up to $9bn a year by 2030. We call this a part of the climate debt owed to us and it is needed if we are to confront climate change while still responding to the needs of people. “These deep cuts have to happen. That’s the realistic demand from people facing the full brutal force of climate change.” Asad Rehman, from Friends of the Earth, said: “It’s the wealthy industrial nations that are largely responsible for the climate crisis we currently face, so it’s only fair they face up to their responsibilities by making large cuts in their emissions and funding climate action in the developing world too. “It’s a basic moral principle that those with more responsibility have to take more action, and also that those with more wealth contribute more. What should each country do is an ethical question.” The fraught question of how responsibility for tackling climate change should be divided has dogged the UN climate talks for more than 20 years. Britain and other rich nations have argued that all countries should have broadly equal per capita emissions by 2050. But this is proving unacceptable in the talks for many developing countries. This is because it ignores historical responsibility for accumulating greenhouse gases emitted over the past 200 years, and because it gives a greater share of the remaining emissions that can be burned without causing catastrophic warming to rich countries. “Using UN data we can work out what the limit on climate pollution should be for the whole world,” said Sivan Kartha, senior scientist at the SEI and the report’s author. “[This approach] shows not just what the whole world has to do, but it also helps people answer the fundamental question of the UN climate talks: what should each country do?” • This article was amended on 22 September 2014 to add missing words to the final quote.

"The island paradise is under attack. Thanks to destabilizing forces of climate change – rising sea levels and strengthening storms, particularly – some of Earth’s most picturesque locations are being scrubbed from the map. And the residents of these postcard settings are being forced to consider relocating to avoid being swept away into the sea. In Tuvalu, a collection of reef islands and atolls midway between Hawaii and Australia, saltwater intrusion has already made it difficult to grow traditional crops, and the rainfall that provides much of the drinking water has become unreliable. Despite investments in freshwater storage systems and makeshift bulwarks to slow coastal erosion, much of the nation – where the average land height is a mere 2 meters (about 6.5 feet) above sea level – will likely be under water by the end of the century.  “It’s already like a weapon of mass destruction,” Tuvalu Prime Minister Enele Sopoaga said last month of the impact climate change is having on his nation. In what has been called a landmark ruling, New Zealand’s immigration court in August granted a Tuvaluan family legal residency after the pair’s attorneys argued, in part, that climate change and overpopulation has made life untenable on their native island. The ruling in favor of Sigeo Alesana and his family came just three months after New Zealand rejected the world’s first climate refugee claim, that of Ioane Teitiota from Kiribati.  Because the 1951 United Nations Convention on the Status of Refugees still doesn’t recognize climate change as valid factor for refugee status, the New Zealand attorneys representing the Tuvaluan couple also relied on more traditional arguments – including the existence of established family relationships inside New Zealand – to make their clients’ claim. “To be successful, it need[ed] to be argued beyond the convention, which is what we did,” Carole Curtis wrote the Guardian by email. But the roughly 10,800 residents of Tuvalu are by no means the only ones at risk of losing their homes to climate change. While the estimates of future migrants vary widely, from tens of thousands to one billion, there’s little question that an increase in climate refugees is on the way.  The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change reported in a 2012 paper that forced migrations will likely grow in the years ahead. “For locations such as atolls,” the report reads, “in some cases it is possible that many residents will have to relocate.” A thousand miles due west of Tuvalu, a staged relocation effort has been underway for years, as hundreds of islanders from the Carteret atoll make their way to the larger island of Bougainville, 50 miles southwest. The increasing infertility of the atoll soils, a consequence of increasing saltwater intrusion, has been a major factor in the decision to relocate, said Ursula Rakova, who is helping lead the Carteret islanders to the “big island”.  “On mainland Bougainville, food crops do not necessarily have to be planted, you leave something on the ground and within the next couple of days it is growing,” she said.  However, on the Carterets, is it difficult to get things to grow in the increasingly saline soil and malnourishment is common. “Women and children may drink a young coconut in the morning and this [must] hold them for the rest of the day,” Rakova said. Considered the most climate-vulnerable nation in South Asia by the Asian Development Bank, Maldives is also suffering the brunt of rising seas. As with the Tuvalu, talk of back-channel negotiations for future mass migrations to Australia, has long buzzed among residents of this chain of 26 atolls. “It’s a slow onset, little impacts,” said Thilmeeza Hussain, a former UN representative from the Maldives who has since founded Voice of Women, which she describes as the only NGO addressing climate change and women in the world’s lowest-lying country. “For example, people living closest to the beach, their houses may get washed away by a storm but nobody’s talking about it because it’s just one or two houses. But what do they do? It’s a small country and we don’t have homeowner’s insurance and things like that. People spend their whole life savings to build these homes and they’re left with nothing.” The observation highlights the IPCC’s finding that the worst elements of the climate-driven disasters in the next 20 to 30 years will likely be due more to a lack of resources within a community than a dramatic shift in storm intensity.  It’s a point that Texas-based climate scientist, Katharine Hayhoe, named earlier this year as one of the world’s most influential people by Time Magazine, drives home.  “The biggest reason I study climate change is because of the impact that it has on the people who don’t have the resources to adapt,” Hayhoe said. “We have a perception, many of us, that climate change is about saving the polar bears.” Of course, it’s not only island dwellers who are being forced from their homes by human-caused global warming events: the 2010 Pakistani floods, one of the largest displacement events of the last decade, drove millions from their homes powered by the additional heat generated by industrial greenhouse gas emissions thickening in the upper atmosphere, according to the World Meteorological Organization. And today’s extreme drought gripping California, threatening to settle into a potentially decades-long megadrought, may come to cause major conflict and dislocation, according to prominent climatologist and author Michael E Mann. “It’s not just record drought, it’s off-the-scales drought,” he said. “We think of environmental refugeeism as something that afflicts the developing nations but not us. But if the drought in California becomes the new normal, and there’s a very real possibility that it does, then we are going to see people driven from their communities, driven from that state. It will not be able to meet the water needs of its population if we continue on this course that we’re on.” The difference between an extreme climate event and a humanitarian disaster has a lot to do with a community’s preparedness and resources, Hayhoe stressed.  “When Hurricane Katrina struck, for example, most of those with the resources to evacuate – both in terms of transportation and information – did,” she said. “The people who did not have access to that struggled to get away, maybe couldn’t get away, and didn’t have the insurance to rebuild their houses.” Itza Carbajal was 14 years old when the United States’ costliest disaster smacked the coast with a nearly 30-foot wall of water. The next day, she and her mother joined a three-car caravan out of the city as the flood-control levies – mere blocks from their newly purchased home – began to fail and the mayor ordered a mandatory evacuation. “I think that the situation of New Orleans presents us with a prime example of what happens when vulnerable people are left to fend completely for themselves both before, during, and after the storm,” Carbajal, now a community organizer in San Antonio, Texas, wrote the Guardian. “As a natural disaster, I think Katrina demonstrates more about our own negligence as humans towards the needs of our earth, as well as our own arrogance as to how much control we have over this planet.” Most of New Orleans sits below sea level and the storm eventually left most of the city – including the Carbajal’s home – submerged in as much as 20 feet of water. Of course, the resources available to weather such an event are even more limited in tiny Tuvalu. So while the most recent gathering of small island states held in Samoa this month failed to take up the pressing issue of expanding definitions under the UN Convention on the Status of Refugees, you can expect Prime Minister Sopoaga to be less gentle when he co-chairs a UN climate summit in New York City on 23 September. “There are no boundaries to the effects of climate change,” he told Australia’s ABC. “We are dealing with saving human lives – and therefore saving Tuvalu is also saving the world.” The Vital Signs platform is funded by Avery Dennison, Domtar and Chiquita.

"The link between economic growth and action to reduce the risks of climate change is the focus of the New Climate Economy report issued on Tuesday. Its credentials are impressive and its findings emphatic.  Released by a global commission of 24 global economic leaders from government, business, finance and academia, led by former president of Mexico Felipe Calderón, the year-long study has involved individuals from over 100 organisations across every continent and advised by a panel of world-leading economists chaired by Lord Nicholas Stern. It has come to a clear conclusion – action on climate change can improve economic performance. This report provides compelling further evidence that firmly supports the UK’s vision for a global climate deal in Paris 2015 that I launched last week in the city of London – which was clear that prosperity and climate action can go hand in hand. The reason, the New Climate Economy report concluded, is that raising resource efficiency, stimulating innovation and new investment in infrastructure are making it possible to tackle climate change at the same time as improving economic performance. That means new opportunities to improve growth, create jobs, boost company profits and spur innovation for all countries that take action now. The report finds that over the next 15 years, trillions of pounds could be saved by building low-carbon into the key sectors of the global economy that include our cities, agriculture and energy. This could include better connected and more compact cities, through to restoring degraded lands and focusing on a transition to clean energy to improve economic performance and quality of life with lower emissions. And we are putting this into action. The UK has been at the forefront of developing the climate change policy architecture that can ensure climate action is integrated into economic decision making.  This includes the 2008 Climate Change Act, which was the world’s first long-term, legally-binding national framework for reducing emissions, through our innovative carbon budgets regime. This means that our five year carbon budgets – that will eventually reach out to 2050 – are now being looked at as a potential model in other countries and we have already delivered on our first budget, which has seen a reduction in UK emissions by 24% between 1990 and 2012. The 2013 Energy Act, for example, is creating the world’s first low-carbon electricity market and we are attracting record amounts of investment in renewables and our low carbon business sector is booming. In renewables, almost £29bn of investment delivered since 2010 and 2013, was a record year – with £8bn invested across the range of renewables technologies. Electricity generation from renewable sources has doubled since 2010 and now supplies over 15% of the UK’s electricity. We’re now a world leader in offshore wind – with more installed offshore wind capacity than the rest of the world combined, and supporting 18,300 jobs in the UK. It has required UK business and international investors to recognise the costs of failure and the benefits of change and it has been sustained by a strong, vocal and committed network of NGOs, pressure groups and activists who have been instrumental in sustaining political will and public acceptance. Last year, the world’s leading climate scientists, under the IPCC, reaffirmed that the Earth’s climate is indisputably changing, that human activity is the dominant cause – and the longer we leave action, the more difficult and costly it will be to avoid the worst effects. We now have the economics confirming that not only is climate action required to reduce climate risks, but that it is vital to building long-term, sustainable economic growth.  In the run up to the UN climate meeting in Paris next year I am determined that we continue to build on our success at home and expend every effort, and work with determination across government, across the parties, in partnership with business and civil society to reach a global, comprehensive, legally binding climate change deal."
"The progressive corporate sector plans to make a major push at next week’s climate change summit in New York for the introduction of a meaningful global price for carbon, believing it to be one of the most effective measures to keep temperature rises within 2C. The World Bank is also taking a lead on carbon pricing and will unveil a long list of states, regions and businesses announcing plans to factor in the costs of burning fossil fuels. It will essentially say that when carbon emissions carry a price, that cost creates an incentive for businesses to reduce waste and invest in energy efficiency and cleaner power sources.  But what are companies doing to lobby for change and how prepared are they for the introduction of a global carbon market? CDP, the sustainable-economy non-profit, has compiled the first global database which shows that the world’s largest corporations are outpacing their governments in responding to climate change and expect carbon to be priced. Its analysis shows that 150 major companies, including 29 in the US and 24 in the UK, already use an internal price on carbon and more than 200 businesses, or around 10% of the largest companies surveyed, are directly engaging policymakers in support of carbon-pricing legislation. The report concludes that “these companies want, and are calling for, clear pricing and regulatory certainty to help them plan their climate-related investments, and they want to see more certain, internationally linked carbon markets.” Of the 2,100 companies surveyed, 638 say they recognise that carbon regulation presents business opportunities while nearly 500 report that they are already regulated and price carbon through global carbon markets. Nearly a fifth of these are US companies. Global companies which have bases in China and Korea, including Alstom, Bayer and Canadian Tire Corporation, say they are closely monitoring the emerging Chinese emissions trading systems that will soon make carbon pricing mandatory. The report also shows that uncertainty about the future means companies are pricing carbon at very different levels. While Microsoft prices it at $6-$7 a tonne of carbon, UK utilities company Pennon Group gives a spread of $84.24- $324.00. Pennon says it uses the UK government’s carbon shadow pricing to monetise carbon emissions over the whole life of proposed projects. There is also a wide divergence between energy companies with the Cairn Energy using a figure of $30, while BP uses $40 and Exxon at the top end with $60-$80. Nigel Topping, CDP’s executive director, says the reason for the broad spectrum of prices is that policy uncertainty means companies are having to use scenario planning and guesswork. As a result, businesses are less prepared to invest in emissions reductions, especially when the payback is over the longer-term Topping says action is essential given that current initiatives such as the European trading scheme and California’s cap and trade programme price carbon so low, with EU permits currently trading at around €6.50 per tonne. A carbon pricing scheme in Australia, which was introduced in 2012 was repealed just two years later. Several European companies such as Lafarge and Rockwool International, which are covered by the European scheme told CDP they want to see the system stabilise and improve to help protect long-term investments and improve profitability. CDP found the greatest surprise from its study was how little policy makers were aware of the carbon pricing already taking place within corporations, and the relatively high price being used by oil companies such as Exxon Mobil. He said: “What this data shows policymakers is that there is a large groundswell of support from the business community to put a sensible price on carbon that will actually lead to significant emissions reductions. This hopefully will give them the confidence to act. “We also hope it will make it easier for other businesses to think about introducing their own carbon pricing as well as pushing for regulatory change so that we can create a level playing field across the world.” Topping says that businesses meeting in New York will not just be calling on governments to act but will also start getting into the detail of agreeing the type of policy changes they would like to see and a meaningful price for carbon.

"The UN’s climate change arm hired a public relations firm that has refused to rule out working for clients seeking to block regulations cutting carbon emissions, the Guardian has learned. The UN secretary general, Ban Ki-moon, plans to put corporate climate change policies at the heart of an unprecedented gathering of world leaders and business executives at the United Nations next week.  However, the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change, which has been working for more than 20 years to agree an international climate change treaty, last year hired a firm which says that although it would not work on campaigns promoting outright climate denial, it would not rule out working for clients seeking to block regulations cutting greenhouse gas emissions. Ogilvy Public Relations, which has offices in the US and UK, was hired in September 2013, in the run-up to climate change talks in Warsaw. “History has shown that not every regulation has had the impact it intended,” said Christopher Graves, Oglivy’s chief executive. “It is possible a client that believes in the threat of climate change may disagree with a specific approach to regulation. What if there were more than one approach to regulating actions and one is more effective than others?” The UNFCCC said it hired Ogilvy at competitive rates to promote initiatives showcasing “transformational” change, in an effort to build public support for a climate change deal. “We hired Ogilvy to assist us in promoting the initiative and the projects to the media in order to try and make the initiative, the projects and the issues more widely know – essentially they helped with getting media coverage and drafting and placing opinion pieces about ‘Momentum for Change’,” said Nicholas Nuttall, the UNFCCC communications chief. The contract with Ogilvy ran until the end of November. Nuttall said the UN had put out a tender for the same work in the run-up to the climate meeting in Lima later this year. “Those applications are now being assessed through our UN procurement process to see if they meet our standards,” he added. Climate change is big business for the global public relations industry, and top firms have earned millions crafting messages on the dangers, and possible solutions, that lie ahead. PR firms also undertake pro bono work for environmental causes to burnish their reputations, or boost staff morale.  “They motivate their employees, compared to a lot of the dreck they have to work on,” said David Fenton, who runs a PR firm with a strong liberal client base. “They sometimes will throw in some pro bono work as part of winning a contract, and sometimes it is legitimate and sincere.”  Ogilvy, and other international PR companies, also did pro bono work around the time of the 2009 Copenhagen climate summit – although that project reported into Ban’s office. The PR firms coined the “Hopenhagen” slogan – a framing that went askew when the summit collapsed.  UN contracting guidelines generally favour companies with strong environmental policies – and the agency is unlikely to hire climate change deniers, Nuttall said. “Vendors with demonstrable poor environmental standards are not invited to participate when the UNFCCC may be looking to hire a company,” he said. “The objective of both the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change and the Kyoto protocol is to stabilise greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere at a level that will prevent dangerous human interference with the climate system.” He went on: “Denying the existence of man-made climate change may be considered a demonstrated poor environmental standard.” The UN secretary general intends to shine a spotlight on corporate conduct on climate change at the climate summit in New York on 23 September. UN officials have drafted new guidelines that will push companies to live up to the ideals set out in their corporate responsibility policies.  Those new guidelines could force companies to review their membership in trade associations or lobby groups which oppose climate regulations or – in some cases – actively seek to spread disinformation about climate change. Industry leaders in public relations are also beginning to look more closely at their own policies regarding climate change. Last month, a number of the world’s top PR firms ruled out working for climate change deniers, in response to a survey by the Guardian.  Since then, Edelman public relations – the largest PR firm in America – has said it will not work for climate change deniers. Another leading firm, Ketchum Inc, this month also told the Guardian it would not work on campaigns promoting climate denial. “Ketchum does not take on clients or campaigns that deny the existence and the threat posed by man-made climate change,” spokesman Paul Middleton said. Ogilvy was not among the original groups taking a stand on climate change, although WPP, its parent company, was.  Ogilvy did recognise the threat of climate change, in a survey by the Climate Investigations Centre. The company noted that it had a long relationship with WWF and Greenpeace, and that its parent company, WPP, had internal carbon accounting measures.  However, Ogilvy initially refused to respond to repeated emails from the Guardian asking whether it would undertake campaigns for climate change deniers. But in an email to the Guardian this week, Graves said: “Ogilvy Public Relations would neither craft nor execute a campaign that seeks to misinform or lie.” Ogilvy was not prepared to commit to turning down clients that seek to obstruct regulations cutting greenhouse gas emissions and renewable energy standards. Graves, in his email, framed the policy as a philosophical question. “There is an inherent flaw in the wording of this question [of whether Ogilvy would take a client seeking to obstruct such regulations] that renders it difficult to answer simplistically. That is not a dodge or splitting hairs. It is not only possible, but likely that well-intentioned goals may be thwarted by ineffective executions or regulations that bring unintended consequences. In other words, not every suggested regulation is the right way to address a goal. We believe in a goal of responsible behavior and enforcing it, including related to the environment and climate change … History has shown that not every regulation has had the impact it intended,” he said. Graves added: “Ogilvy Public Relations, as part of WPP, believes that climate change is accelerated by human activities that produce increased greenhouse gases, and by activities that reduce the ability for the planet to absorb those greenhouse gases. We believe that climate change is a real threat. We believe the responsible approach to business and consumption is to be transparent about our own impact, and keep working to wring out waste in our own activities.” However, financial disclosure records for the US Senate indicate that Oglivy Government Relations – a standalone lobbying firm in the same Washington DC office building as Oglivy PR – represents some of the most ferocious opponents of Barack Obama’s efforts to act on climate change, including the American Petroleum Institute, the biggest oil industry lobby.   API is ambiguous about the causes of climate change. “Emissions may be helping to warm our planet by enhancing the natural greenhouse effect of our atmosphere,” a policy brief on the API website reads. “The contribution of possible man-made warming is uncertain as are the extent and timing of potential future impacts.”  Such associations could soon come under greater scrutiny – if Ban has his way. At the summit next week, the UN secretary general will push business leaders to cut their ties to lobby groups and trade associations that are seeking to block regulations on carbon pollution. “If you want to be seen as a responsible player on climate change you can no longer be part of associations that are not taking responsible positions on national policy,” Jennifer Morgan, the director of climate programmes at the World Resources Institute, told reporters in a conference call. She said Ban would press business leaders to live up to their corporate sustainability policies – which often have lofty goals on climate change that remain unmet. “Is the company associating itself with others that do not represent its views on climate, and is the company’s carbon reduction target at the scale that climate science says is required.Those are two key measures,” she said."
"Heavily-polluting industries are in line for a €5bn (£4bn) handout from Europe’s taxpayers because of the way the EU is measuring their exposure to unregulated competitors outside the bloc, according to an unpublished report prepared for the European commission. Steel-making, cement and power plants have their greenhouse gas emissions capped by the emissions trading system (ETS), putting a price on carbon to encourage companies to cut emissions by trading allowances.  The EU calculated the risk of such companies relocating to regions with laxer emissions limits – known as ‘carbon leakage’ – by assuming carbon allowances will be at €30 a tonne up to 2020. But carbon allowances have not touched that price since 2008, when the ETS was set up, and currently languish at around €6 a tonne, due to economic crisis and a market glut. Using a lower price of €16.50 a tonne – the working paper’s preferred option – would “increase the auctioning revenues for member states by about €5.01 bn”, the document predicts. The lower price would also cut the number of free pollution permits to industry by around a quarter, and address a carbon market already flooded with around a billion spare allowances. Some 640 million of these, with a value of almost €2bn, are owned by high-emitting sectors such as cement and steel. “The costs of too many sectors on the carbon leakage list and thus too high free allocation is that public resources are wasted,” says the report which will be published later this autumn, if the list is first approved in a European parliament vote on 24 September. “The commission has proposed another carte blanche to energy-intensive industry worth €5bn of taxpayers money,” said Eva Filzmoser, the director of Carbon Market Watch. “It is now up to the European parliament to reject the proposed carbon leakage list and make polluters pay, as recommended by the commission’s own scientific experts.” Isaac Valero, a spokesman for the outgoing climate action commissioner, Connie Hedegaard, told the Guardian that the €30 a tonne price had been chosen because the EU’s proposed 2030 climate and energy targets and market stability reserve for the ETS would give carbon prices a boost. “Under those circumstances, it is expected that the carbon price will in the future be more strongly driven by mid- and long-term emission reductions,” he said. “It is therefore considered justified to continue using an assumed carbon price of €30 per tonne of CO2 equivalent for the assessment underlying this decision.” But even factoring in 2030 targets and the proposed allowance reserve, market analysts Thomson Reuters Point Carbon told the Guardian they expected a carbon price of €10 a tonne by 2020. Marcus Ferdinand, Point Carbon’s head of EU carbon analysis viewed the €30 figure as “very much at the high end” of market forecasts. “I think it is more a means to reassure industrial participants in this market,” he said. Indeed, an alliance of energy intensive industries sent a letter to EU governments and institutions last week urging a rapid commitment to continue the policy of free allowances for heavy industry beyond 2020. “Energy intensive industries are all at risk of carbon and investment leakage and therefore must be safeguarded,” their missive said, calling for the guaranteed 100% free allocation of pollution permits with more business-friendly criteria in the decade ahead. Under the EU’s current proposals, 175 industry sectors out of 245 will receive their pollution permits for free to 2020, even though the ‘carbon leakage’ phenomena is still disputed, with one recent EU report questioning whether it even existed. “We found no evidence for any carbon leakage – according to the ETS directive, defined as production relocation due to the ETS – in the past two ETS periods,” they said. Some environmentalists argue that an approach to cutting emissions centred on the carbon market allows industry groups to block more easily verifiable CO2-cutting measures, like energy savings. “The biggest opponents to energy efficiency are the people in the commission who support an ETS-only policy for 2030,” said Brook Riley, a spokesman for Friends of the Earth. “They want to block ambitious 2030 targets for energy efficiency and renewables to protect their ailing brainchild [the ETS].” Riley cited an internal EU document, obtained by WWF and Friends of the Earth in an access to documents request, indicating that the costs of a higher energy efficiency target could be dramatically lower than those published in an efficiency review this summer. The price tag on a 30% energy efficiency target fell by €600bn when EU models included the climate, health and market benefits of using less energy, and assumed that the policy was actually implemented by EU states."

"Christine Milne has said the Greens will help put “spine and rigour” into the Coalition’s Direct Action climate plan and allow it to become law, in return for an assurance that the renewable energy target will not be wound back. Milne called Direct Action a “pathetic ill-defined excuse for climate action” but said the Greens would negotiate with the government to improve it on condition the RET remained unchanged. The Greens leader said the government had put jobs at risk by repealing carbon pricing, warning that further jobs and investment would be lost if the RET was scaled back or closed entirely. “The only way those jobs and ongoing climate emissions reductions can be rescued is for the government to negotiate on putting some spine or rigour into Direct Action,” Milne said in a speech to the National Press Club. “Consistent with our view that all tools in the toolbox must be used to genuinely reduce emissions, the Greens are prepared to negotiate with the government to knock Direct Action into shape, but only if it is not separated from the RET.” Direct Action has yet to be legislated by the government, so Australia has no primary policy to reduce carbon emissions. Labor, the Greens and the Palmer United party have all stated their opposition to the plan, calling it ineffective or a waste of money. The $2.5bn policy would provide grants to businesses that wish to voluntarily lower their emissions. There would be no cap on carbon pollution, and safeguards to ensure emissions do not rise elsewhere in the economy have yet to be worked out. The government has insisted that Direct Action will meet its target of a 5% reduction in emissions by 2020, based on 2000 levels. However, no official modelling has been done on this and independent analysis has found the policy would be insufficient to meet the target. Milne would not specify exactly how Direct Action could be improved to the satisfaction of the Greens, saying: “It’s such a bad policy that it’s an open book. There’s a long way to go on many, many issues, so there’s a lot to flesh out.” She did, however, reject the idea that the policy’s proposed emissions reduction fund could be used to pay heavily polluting power stations to close. The fund will be administered by altering the carbon farming initiative. The government estimates there is about nine power stations’ worth of excess capacity in Australia’s power grid but has said funding will be used to “clean up” power stations rather than shut them. “When former minister Greg Combet went to negotiate cash for closure with the coal stations they had the sniff of victory in their nostrils with an Abbott government coming and they decided to bank the money they got and wait to be able to pollute for free,” Milne said. “So they have blown their chance, in my view. It’s time to do what the United States has done, which is to regulate their emissions or come up with some other plan. But there is an opportunity now to phase them out.” Milne said the Greens would not accept any change, however minor, to the RET in its negotiations over Direct Action. The Coalition has called on Labor to come to an agreement over the RET, which requires that 41,000 gigawatt hours of Australia’s energy comes from renewable sources by 2020. A recent review recommended either a suspension of or end to new investment into the RET scheme, and a leading union has pushed for the aluminum industry to be exempt. A spokesman for Greg Hunt, the environment minister, said: “We welcome discussions with all crossbenchers to pass the carbon farming initiative amendment. “The government has received the RET review report and will announce its position in due course.” In her speech, Milne accused the government of “climate denialism and irresponsibility”, saying that it would be better if Australia did not send a representative to coming climate talks in New York and Lima if the government continued “obstructing progress and dissuading its trading partners to take tough action on climate”."

"Never before in history have human beings been called on to act collectively in defence of the Earth. As a species, we have endured world wars, epidemics, famine, slavery, apartheid and many other hideous consequences of religious, class, race, gender and ideological intolerance. People are extraordinarily resilient. The Earth has proven pretty resilient, too. It's managed to absorb most of what's been thrown at it since the industrial revolution and the invention of the internal combustion engine. Until now, that is. Because the science is clear: the sponge that cushions and sustains us, our environment, is already saturated with carbon. If we don't limit global warming to two degrees or less we are doomed to a period of unprecedented instability, insecurity and loss of species. Fossil fuels have powered human endeavour since our ancestors developed the skills to make and manage fire. Coal, gas and oil warm our homes, fuel our industries and enable our movements. We have allowed ourselves to become totally dependent, and are guilty of ignoring the warning signs of pending disaster. It is time to act.  As responsible citizens of the world – sisters and brothers of one family, the human family, God's family – we have a duty to persuade our leaders to lead us in a new direction: to help us abandon our collective addiction to fossil fuels, starting this week in New York at the United Nations Climate Summit. Reducing our carbon footprint is not just a technical scientific necessity; it has also emerged as the human rights challenge of our time. While global emissions have risen unchecked, real-world impacts have taken hold in earnest. The most devastating effects of climate change – deadly storms, heat waves, droughts, rising food prices and the advent of climate refugees – are being visited on the world's poor. Those who have no involvement in creating the problem are the most affected, while those with the capacity to arrest the slide dither. Africans, who emit far less carbon than the people of any other continent, will pay the steepest price. It is a deep injustice. The United Nations deserves kudos for its leadership on human rights issues. But on climate change, it has run up against governments and leaders of industry who have until now put short-term economic and political goals ahead of our collective long-term survival. We can no longer tinker about the edges. We can no longer continue feeding our addiction to fossil fuels as if there were no tomorrow. For there will be no tomorrow. As a matter of urgency we must begin a global transition to a new safe energy economy. This requires fundamentally rethinking our economic systems, to put them on a sustainable and more equitable footing. I am not without hope. When we, humans, walk together in pursuit of a righteous cause, we become an irresistible force. There are many ways that all of us can fight climate change: by not wasting energy, for instance. But these individual measures will not, the scientists assure us, make a big enough difference. And they may not be appropriate for the world's poor. We can boycott events, sports teams and media programming sponsored by fossil fuel companies; demand that their advertisements carry health warnings; organise car-free days and other platforms to build broader societal awareness; and ask our religious communities to speak out on the issue from their various pulpits. We can encourage energy companies to spend more of their resources on the development of sustainable energy products, and we can reward those companies that demonstrably do so by using their products to the exclusion of others. Just as we argued in the 1980s that those who conducted business with apartheid South Africa were aiding and abetting an immoral system, we can say that nobody should profit from the rising temperatures, seas and human suffering caused by the burning of fossil fuels. We can encourage more of our universities and municipalities, foundations, corporations, individuals and cultural institutions to cut their ties to the fossil fuel industry. To divest, and invest, instead, in renewable energy. To move their money out of the problem and into the solutions. We can urge our governments to invest in sustainable practices and stop subsidising fossil fuels; and to freeze further exploration for new fossil energy sources. The fossil reserves that have already been discovered exceed what can ever be safely used. Yet companies spend half a trillion dollars each year searching for more fuel. They should redirect this money toward developing clean energy solutions. We can support our leaders to make the correct moral choices and to avoid undue industry influence that blocks the political will to act on climate change. Through the power of our collective action we can hold those who rake in the profits accountable for cleaning up their mess. The good news is that we don't have to start from scratch. Young people across the world have identified climate change as the biggest challenge of our time, and already begun to do something about it. Over the last three or four years, we have seen the rise of a new civil society divestment movement to stand alongside the scientists, environmentalists and social activists who have been challenging the moral standing of the fossil fuel industry. Once again, it is a global movement led by students and faith groups, along with hospitals, cities, foundations, corporations and individuals. It is a moral movement to persuade fossil fuel companies away from a business model that threatens our very survival. My prayer is that humankind takes its first tangible steps in New York this week – as a collective – to move beyond the fossil fuel era. There is a word we use in South Africa that describes human relationships: Ubuntu. It says: I am because you are. My successes and my failures are bound up in yours. We are made for each other, for interdependence. Together, we can change the world for the better. Who can stop climate change? We can. You and you and you, and me. And it is not just that we can stop it, we have a responsibility to do so that began in the genesis of humanity, when God commanded the earliest human inhabitants of the Garden of Eden, ""to till it and keep it"". To ""keep"" it; not to abuse it, not to make as much money as possible from it, not to destroy it."
"Australia’s international greenhouse pledge is getting easier to reach, with new calculations obtained by Guardian Australia showing it may now require less than a third of the emissions reductions envisaged despite both major parties insisting it was a “substantial commitment”. The new figures may explain why the Abbott government remains confident it can meet the target even though it has repealed the carbon tax, has as yet no legislated alternative policy and is contemplating reducing or closing the renewable energy target. But they will also dramatically increase the already intense pressure on Australia at the special United Nations summit in New York next week to step up its efforts.  The easy ride to this initial target of a 5% reduction in emissions by 2020 compared with 2000 levels is in large part due to the closure of energy-hungry industries such as aluminium smelters, as well as a broader reduction in electricity demand.  In 2012 the promise to reduce emissions by 5% of 2000 levels by 2020 was calculated to require the cumulative reduction of 755m tonnes of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. Last year new government calculations reduced that figure to 431 million tonnes.  Now new calculations by Frontier Economics say the figure could be as low as 225m tonnes, if the renewable energy target (RET) stays in place to drive investment into clean generation, or somewhere around 300m tonnes if the government accepts advice to pare back the RET from its review panel, headed by prominent businessman and self-professed climate sceptic Dick Warburton. “Given the fall in electricity demand projections in the past year, we expect that Australia’s abatement task to 2020 will be considerably easier than expected in the most recent official projections, even if the review panel’s changes to the RET are implemented,” Frontier Economics reports in its September bulletin. “The most recent official forecasts project a cumulative abatement task of 421 (million tonnes of carbon dioxide) to 2020. We estimate that this is now closer to 225-279 (million tonnes) without any change to the RET, or 264-336 (million tonnes) if the panel recommendations are adopted.” The firm’s managing director, Danny Price, co-chairs an expert reference group on the Abbott government’s as yet-unlegislated emissions reduction fund. Australia is under pressure to commit to a “bold” new post-2020 greenhouse emissions reduction target at next week’s special UN summit, called by the UN secretary general, Ban Ki-Moon. The summit, designed to build momentum towards a successful post-2020 international climate deal at a conference in Paris next year, will be attended by more than 100 world leaders, including the US president, Barack Obama. The foreign minister, Julie Bishop, will represent Australia. The prime minister, Tony Abbott, will be in New York the next day for a summit on foreign fighters, but says he cannot arrive earlier because of commitments in parliament. The leaders of China, India and Russia are also not attending. “We absolutely need Australia to use the UN summit to commit to bringing forward a post- 2020 target well in advance of Paris,” said the deputy director of the Climate Institute, Erwin Jackson. On Sunday a “people’s climate march” in New York and around the globe – including in Melbourne, Sydney, Canberra and Darwin – will try to focus attention on the 23 September UN meeting, and has been billed as the largest climate action march in history. The Abbott government has pledged to review its 5% target next year, and Bishop’s office referred to this commitment when asked what Australia might say at the summit. The government has not said whether this review would extend to considering what deeper emission reduction targets Australia might commit to after 2020. The independent Climate Change Authority, which the government has not yet succeeded in abolishing, recommended in February that the pre-2020 target should be trebled to at least 15% and that Australia look to a longer term target of between 40% and 60% reductions in emissions by 2030. The authority said Australia’s 5% target was already much weaker than targets set by countries including the US, Britain and Norway, and points out that countries such as China are also stepping up emission reduction efforts. It says all the 2009 conditions for moving above a 5% target have been met, as have many of the conditions for a 15% target. In 2009, both Labor and the Coalition signed on to a clear set of conditions for moving above 5% and, according the the authority, many of these have been met, But Abbott now insists the government will not commit to anything beyond the minimum 5% target “in the absence of very serious like-binding commitments in other countries and there’s no evidence of that”. Price said: “There are two, not necessarily mutually exclusive, ways of viewing this more moderate emissions reduction task. “As a nation, Australia should be pleased with its progress towards achieving its reduction target and more confident that the target is achievable with the existing suite of policies. “The speed with which Australia has moved from an ambitious target (at the time it was set) to an eminently achievable target may ease community, business and political concerns about setting a tougher emissions abatement target post 2020. This is important as it is very likely that Australia will be subject over the next year or two to strong international pressure to cut emissions further.” The Abbott government is locked in negotiations with crossbenchers and the Greens over amendments to secure the passage of its “direct action” climate policy. The most contentious demands are that it impose onerous emissions “baselines” and financial penalties on high-emitting industry across the economy, to ensure that emission reductions “purchased” from a proposed new government fund aren’t overtaken by emissions increases in other industries. The government had intended to decide on these baselines and penalties – the so-called “safeguards mechanism” – next year, but the Greens and independent senator Nick Xenophon are demanding immediate assurances.

"The global economy is undergoing a remarkable transformation which is altering our ability to deal with climate change. The growth of emerging economies, rapid urbanisation and new technological advances are making possible a new path of low-carbon growth in ways that were not apparent even five years ago. We know that if left unchecked, greenhouse gas emissions will cause devastating climate change. What is now becoming clear is that reducing emissions is not only compatible with economic growth and development; if done well, it can actually generate better growth than the old high-carbon model.  Take cities. The evidence – from Bogota to Barcelona, Curitiba to Copenhagen – shows that better planned cities based on mass public transport systems tend to be economically more dynamic and have much higher quality of life than those based on urban sprawl. They also have much lower carbon emissions. As a billion more people join the world’s urban population over the next 15 years, building smarter cities creates a huge opportunity to reduce the path of emissions at the same time as improving economic performance and social conditions. The same is true in agriculture and land use. Agricultural productivity can now be transformed using new techniques which also cut emissions. Estimates suggest that restoring just 12% of the world’s degraded land could feed an extra 200 million people by 2030, helping to reduce deforestation, and therefore carbon emissions, while stimulating rural development and fighting poverty. In energy, we are on the verge of a revolution. The price of solar and wind power has fallen so far that in places as diverse as Brazil, South Africa and Chile, renewable energy can now compete with fossil fuels without requiring subsidies. At the same time, coal has become more costly and less secure. Many countries are now dependent on coal imports, while air pollution associated with coal and other fossil fuels has become one of the world’s biggest killers, causing seven million deaths a year. It is now likely that renewable energy could make up half of all new electricity generation over the period to 2030 – unthinkable just a few years ago. Meanwhile a new wave of technological innovation, including digitisation, the development of new materials and the electrification of transport, offers the potential to transform the demand for energy, both in industry and by consumers. All this is beginning to happen, with many examples from around the world of good policy, entrepreneurial businesses and competitive markets combining to generate low-carbon growth. And it is high-quality growth, too: measured not just by rising GDP, but in falling poverty, improved health and protected natural environments which are more resilient to the climate change now already occurring. The evidence that economic performance can be enhanced even as carbon emissions are cut has been powerfully brought together in the new report of the Global Commission on the Economy and Climate, Better Growth, Better Climate. The report builds on a growing consensus on the benefits of low-carbon growth among leading international economic institutions, such as the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), the World Bank and the UN Development Programme. But the report also shows that these developments are not happening fast enough. If the world is to limit global warming to no more than 2 degrees celsius above pre-industrial times, global emissions will have to peak and then begin to fall in the next 10-15 years. That requires a major shift towards low-carbon investment. Such a shift is now possible. Over the next 15 years around $90tn is likely to be invested in the world’s cities, land use and energy systems. If that is high-carbon investment, the world will “lock in” the risk of dangerous climate change. But if we build low-carbon infrastructure, we can achieve multiple economic, social and environmental benefits with vastly reduced emissions. We have a remarkable opportunity to shape the future of the global economy and the future of the climate system at the same time. But governments must choose. Over recent years many governments have vacillated over climate policy. They have introduced carbon prices but then let them fall until they are near-useless. They have backed renewables but also subsidised fossil fuels. These inconsistent signals have created uncertainty for investors, damaging growth and retarding innovation. Among the necessary policy shifts, two stand out. First, a strong and rising carbon price, implemented through tax or emissions trading schemes, is an essential foundation of a low-carbon economy. It ensures that polluters pay and efficiency is rewarded. The opportunity to use the revenues to consolidate public finances or to cut other taxes is a valuable bonus in difficult economic times. Second, governments should achieve a strong and equitable international climate agreement next year. Such an agreement would send a powerful market signal that the future of the global economy will be low-carbon. The prize before us is huge. We can build a strong, inclusive and resilient global economy which can also avoid dangerous climate change. But the time for decision is now."

"On Tuesday, a young woman from the Marshall Islands will stand before the leaders of the world.  Poet and performance artist Kathy Jetnil-Kijiner has one thing to say at the opening ceremony of the United Nations Climate Summit: “I want to bring my people’s message out to the world, that climate change is a threat we need to take more seriously.” Jetnil-Kijiner, 26, is one of just four people chosen to address the opening of Ban Ki-Moon’s global assembly in New York.  Unlike 125 other world leaders, Australian prime minister Tony Abbott has announced he won’t be attending the summit – a potent symbol of the lack of engagement that so worries Jetnil-Kijiner and other young Pacific islanders. Born in the Marshall Islands, a nation of 22 low-lying atolls in the northern Pacific, Jetnil-Kijiner studied in Hawaii and California before returning to teach at the College of the Marshall Islands in Majuro. Meeting her last year, she told me about local climate initiatives by the community group Jodrikdrik in Jipan ene eo e Kutok Maroro (Youth for a Greener Environment). “Together with my cousins, I’ve started this non-profit organisation for youth and the environment. We’re getting young people involved in the climate change movement and getting people aware of it,” she said. “We’re the ones who are getting affected, but sometimes it’s very frustrating, because it feels like no one is listening.” Chosen from 544 nominees to address the official summit opening, Jetnil-Kijiner will have a global showcase for her poetry, which highlights social and environmental issues. On her blog Iep Jeltok, she writes: “My poetry mainly focuses on raising awareness surrounding the issues and threats faced by my people. Nuclear testing conducted in our islands, militarism, the rising sea level as a result of climate change, forced migration, adaptation and racism in America.” Jetnil-Kijiner told me her love of poetry goes back many years: “I was writing poetry from third grade - my first poem was about an invisible elephant! But I didn’t take it seriously until my senior year, when we had two substitute teachers in my English class. They were spoken word artists and it was the first time that I’d heard that style. For some reason, it just clicked and I loved it straight away.”  Through the web, her spoken word performances have received international attention, despite their confronting themes: History Project reveals the anger of young Marshallese living with the radioactive legacy of 67 US nuclear weapons tests at Bikini and Enewetak atolls, while Lessons from Hawaii highlights her emotional scars from racism against Micronesians. This poetry reached a wider audience after Jetnil-Kijiner performed History Project at the 2012 Poetry Parnassus, the largest poetry festival ever staged in the UK. “Someone just emailed me to say they were looking for poets from Micronesia to represent at the Parnassus poetry festival, which was one of the events leading up to the London Olympics,” she recalls. “I had to push a bit to get onto the program, because all the poets there were Nobel Prize winners or well established poets. So they sort of took a gamble on me by inviting me to London and it was awesome!”   For many young people in the Pacific, there are cultural taboos about being too outspoken, but her generation of women are navigating the rocks and shoals of community or family disapproval.  “I remember one of my uncles telling my cousin that the History Project poem was too aggressive,” said Kathy. “I definitely feel pressure at home, where Marshallese girls are quiet and nice. However when you look at our past, when you look at our culture, it’s actually rooted in women who were really powerful, women who speak out.” Despite this, she believes that her slam poetry and spoken word performance is still connected to Marshallese traditions. “With my master’s thesis at the University of Hawaii, I’m studying Marshallese oral tradition and traditional chanting and storytelling,” she said. “I spent the summer in 2013 interviewing my elders and a lot of experts who know about these sorts of traditions. It was really interesting to get a sense of what our culture looked like before colonisation. “I’m hoping to sort out a way to incorporate spoken word with our traditional way of chanting and our traditional storytelling,” she added. “We’ve been expressing ourselves since the beginning of time, so we can do that now through different media, through spoken word or writing and storytelling.”  Other young Pacific women are also speaking out about climate change. The United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) was first adopted in 1992. At the Copenhagen climate summit in 2009, 17 year old Christina Ora of the Solomon Islands stood before the plenary to highlight the concerns of young people: “I was born in 1992. You have been negotiating all my life. You cannot tell us that you need more time.” Five years on, however, the UNFCCC negotiations are still deadlocked and there is little prospect of finalising an effective climate treaty in Paris next year. For this reason, Ora will again address a panel at Ban Ki-Moon’s climate summit, to repeat the same challenge to world leaders: “We wish for you to listen to the voice of Pacific Islanders, to listen to the vulnerable countries. Because in your hands, you hold our future, our life.” The UN secretary general hopes that the summit will catalyse action from key industrialised countries, which are resisting any legally binding commitment to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions.  Australia is one of the world’s major coal exporters, but the Abbott government is working hard to avoid any new commitments on climate change. Prime minister Abbott will not attend Ban Ki-Moon’s climate summit this week, unlike 125 other heads of government. He has also indicated that climate change will not be on the agenda of the G20 meeting, when Australia hosts global leaders in Brisbane this November.  Canberra is also reluctant to provide the necessary funds to assist developing countries to transition towards new energy systems. Last year, at the 2013 Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting, the Abbott government announced it would not contribute to the new Green Climate Fund, an innovative global mechanism to provide finance for developing countries to adapt to the adverse effects of climate change. If Abbott won’t go to New York to hear the concerns of young islanders, they’ll bring the message to him. For months, members of the Pacific Climate Warriors network – from Vanuatu, Tokelau, Kiribati, Tonga and the Federated States of Micronesia – have been building canoes. They’ll be arriving soon in Australia to highlight the role played by successive Australian governments in blocking stronger international action on greenhouse gas emissions. On 17 October, canoes crewed by the Climate Warriors will blockade the world’s largest coal port in Newcastle, to highlight the contribution of Australia’s fossil fuel industry to global warming. These young islanders have defiantly rejected the image of Pacific peoples as victims of sea level rise. In their own words: “We are not drowning. We are fighting.” That spirit will also be seen at this week’s climate summit. Kathy Jetnil-Kijiner, Christina Ora and other young Pacific islanders have one clear message for Australia and the world: the time for talk is over, the time for action is now. "
"This weekend marks a crucial turning point for climate change campaigning across the world. The People’s Climate March (expected to attract hundreds of thousands in New York, and smaller crowds in London and elsewhere) is the beginning of a journey that will end in Paris, December 2015, when UN negotiators have a chance to improve on the dismal outcomes of the now infamous Copenhagen talks five years ago. When, inevitably, the Copenhagen deal didn’t live up to expectations, and the real decisions were deferred for another few years, many people were left feeling crestfallen.  Without a doubt, politicians (and the lobbying of vested interests) are primarily to blame for the fact that ‘Hopenhagen’ crashed and burned. But looking back, campaigners might wonder whether the level of hyperbole that coated the otherwise sensible demands of civil society was really the most effective way of gaining and keeping the public’s trust. Over the next 15 months, campaigners face the formidable task of re-animating the shapeless spectre of climate change, coaxing it out of hiding and back into the public eye. There is another chance to build public support for a legally binding agreement between all of the world’s nations, to keep most of our remaining fossil fuels in the ground. But we have to learn from our mistakes, and ask what could be done differently this time. Here are three important ideas for re-inspiring public support – in the hope that the road to Paris has a happier ending than the long bus journey to Copenhagen: Scaring someone is certainly likely to attract their attention, but with an issue as intangible, distant and all-encompassing as climate change, it is also likely to leave them feeling unable or unwilling to take steps to reduce the threat they feel. It is much easier – as we can all attest – to ignore it. But the backlash against doom and gloom has gone too far. The trend towards ‘brightsiding’ (in effect, putting a positive spin on everything related to climate change) is no more helpful, and just as inaccurate. Not everything will be bigger and better in a climate-changed world. The challenge is to find a balance that minimises the hand wringing but acknowledges the enormous, unprecedented challenges that climate change poses. There are many constructive solutions to these challenges, which will bring some gains but will surely also involve weathering some losses. Being honest about these – and involving as many people as possible in a conversation about the implications for how future generations live – is the only approach that makes sense in the long term. We can’t be scared into caring, but we also can’t be soothed into accepting our fate. And when you put it like that, its clear that neither is a particularly democratic approach in any case. Like the NHS, or any other major, ongoing intervention by governments for the public good, regulating the world’s carbon emissions can only happen with support from across the political spectrum. But a fiery and deepening polarisation has gripped the Australian and American political systems on climate change. A recent poll of Westminster politicians found that among Conservatives – and only among Conservatives – sceptical views are still rife. Shouting at Conservatives that they are wrong, irrational, or misguided is not going to help. Climate change is still seen as toxic and left-wing to many on the centre-right. It is therefore incumbent on anyone who is serious about long-lasting political consensus on climate change to find ways of bringing moderate conservatives into the debate. A global agreement in Paris isn’t going to happen without them. In his new book, Don’t Even Think About It: Why Our Brains are Wired to Ignore Climate Change, my colleague George Marshall argues that our inability to grasp and respond to the issue of climate change is fundamentally related to the lack of social infrastructure for sharing, validating and strengthening our beliefs about this challenge. Climate change is a dealt with almost exclusively in private. With barely any public or political discourse against which to calibrate our own views, we can easily come to convince ourselves that hardly anyone shares our positive views about climate change solutions, when in fact a majority does. Marshall argues that by looking to other communities (such as trades unions, or even faith groups) which provide support for their members, allowing their personal beliefs to be validated by their peers, lessons can be learned for campaigning on climate change. Creating the space for a social consensus to be built – through physical or virtual communities of conviction – seems a better aim than trying to ‘nudge’ individuals into more environmentally virtuous behaviour, all the while ignoring the social nature of belief formation. As the window of opportunity to prevent the most dangerous effects of climate change grows ever smaller, campaigners can honestly claim that we are rapidly running out of time to ‘save the world’. But if no-one believes them, or only an isolated segment of the population is prepared to take it seriously, then the impassioned rhetoric has all been in vain. With a second chance to get a political agreement that could – just about – keep carbon emissions within manageable limits, now is the time for campaigners to adopt approaches that will build the deeper public support that is so desperately required.

"Welcome to tropical Sydney, where colourful surgeonfishes and parrotfishes are plentiful, corals have replaced kelp forests, and underwater life seems brighter, more colourful and all-round better. Or is it? While this vision of a future Sydney is just an embellished cartoon of what climate change would do off the city’s coastline, our recent research does point to a widespread “tropicalisation” of temperate coastlines such as Sydney within the next few decades. This may sound pleasant, but it can lead to unwanted consequences. Climate models suggest that ocean temperatures off Sydney are just decades away from becoming “tropical”. A “business as usual” scenario of increasing CO2 emissions suggests winter sea surface temperatures will consistently exceed 18C between 2020 and 2030. And summer sea surface temperatures will consistently exceed 25C between 2040 and 2060. Eastern Australian waters represent a climate change hotspot, with warming rates occurring twice as fast as the global average. A key reason for this is a strengthening of the East Australian current, which pushes warm tropical water southwards. Other oceanic hotspots around the world include southern Japan, south-east US, south-east Africa and eastern South America. All these regions have in common the influence of strong ocean currents running close to the shore bringing warm tropical water. So what will warmer ocean temperatures do to Sydney? Examining what’s happening within these other hotspots can help us to make some predictions. In our study, recently published in Proceedings of the Royal Society B, we show how tropical fishes are becoming increasingly abundant in many warming hotspots. Indeed, tropical fishes are already a common feature in Sydney during the late summer months, and some have even started to survive over winter. And fish are not the only organisms moving. Tropical corals have also started to make their way down the NSW coastline, and researchers are now on the look out for them in the waters off Sydney. Nobody would complain if the only consequence of climate change was more species of marine life — greater biodiversity. However with these gains also come substantial losses. And the biggest losers are underwater algal forests. Canopy algae, or seaweeds, are the linchpin of temperate coastlines. They provide food and shelter to hundreds of species, and fulfil a role similar to trees in terrestrial forests. However algal forests need relatively cool water to survive, and this is becoming increasingly elusive in these regions. A dramatic example of warmer water on algal forests occurred during the extreme ocean heat wave off Western Australia associated with the massive La Niña in early 2011. Extreme ocean warming lasted only a few weeks, caused an unprecedented decline of algal forests and the temperate marine life communities they support. So why is warm water damaging to algal forests? There are a few reasons. High temperatures can directly stress algae by damaging the machinery that supports their survival. Warmer tropical water also carries fewer nutrients, which the algae need to grow. And now our research is uncovering a new mechanism leading to the loss of algal forests: increased grazing by the very same tropical fishes that we were initially so happy to see along our coastlines. The harmful effect of warm-water fish on temperate reefs is most evident in southern Japan and the eastern Mediterranean, where algal forests have dramatically declined. In a paper published last week in the Journal of Ecology, we show how the invasion of tropical rabbitfish in the eastern Mediterranean has created eerie barren areas extending over hundreds of kilometres. These new habitats support less than half the species found in the nearest algal forests. Similarly, off southern Japan over 40% of algal forests have disappeared since the 1990s; a phenomenon known as isoyake. Increased annual grazing rates by tropical rabbitfish and parrotfish appear to be the primary culprit. Now corals dominate at many sites. Japanese people are famous for their love of algae — they have dedicated shrines and eat them with nearly every meal. Consequently there is considerable concern over their loss. It has also resulted in the complete collapse of abalone fisheries, and the cultivation of other commercially important species such as the Japanese amberjack is becoming increasingly difficult. So what can we do to stop temperate algal forests turning tropical? To prevent further dramatic changes we ultimately need to reduce our CO2 emissions. In the meantime, we could also encourage new fisheries in temperate reefs that target tropical fishes. Rabbitfish, for example, are considered a delicacy in many Indo-pacific countries and already make up a sizeable component of fisheries catches in the eastern Mediterranean.

"Thank you, Mr Secretary General, your excellencies, ladies and gentleman, and distinguished guests. I’m honored to be here today, I stand before you not as an expert but as a concerned citizen, one of the 400,000 people who marched in the streets of New York on Sunday, and the billions of others around the world who want to solve our climate crisis. As an actor I pretend for a living. I play fictitious characters often solving fictitious problems.  I believe humankind has looked at climate change in that same way: as if it were a fiction, happening to someone else’s planet, as if pretending that climate change wasn’t real would somehow make it go away. But I think we know better than that. Every week, we’re seeing new and undeniable climate events, evidence that accelerated climate change is here now. We know that droughts are intensifying, our oceans are warming and acidifying, with methane plumes rising up from beneath the ocean floor. We are seeing extreme weather events, increased temperatures, and the West Antarctic and Greenland ice-sheets melting at unprecedented rates, decades ahead of scientific projections.  None of this is rhetoric, and none of it is hysteria. It is fact. The scientific community knows it, Industry and governments know it, even the United States military knows it. The chief of the US navy’s Pacific command, admiral Samuel Locklear, recently said that climate change is our single greatest security threat.  My Friends, this body – perhaps more than any other gathering in human history – now faces that difficult task. You can make history ... or be vilified by it. To be clear, this is not about just telling people to change their light bulbs or to buy a hybrid car. This disaster has grown BEYOND the choices that individuals make. This is now about our industries, and governments around the world taking decisive, large-scale action.  I am not a scientist, but I don’t need to be. Because the world’s scientific community has spoken, and they have given us our prognosis, if we do not act together, we will surely perish. Now is our moment for action. We need to put a pricetag on carbon emissions, and eliminate government subsidies for coal, gas, and oil companies. We need to end the free ride that industrial polluters have been given in the name of a free-market economy, they don’t deserve our tax dollars, they deserve our scrutiny. For the economy itself will die if our ecosystems collapse.  The good news is that renewable energy is not only achievable but good economic policy. New research shows that by 2050 clean, renewable energy could supply 100% of the world’s energy needs using existing technologies, and it would create millions of jobs.  This is not a partisan debate; it is a human one. Clean air and water, and a livable climate are inalienable human rights. And solving this crisis is not a question of politics. It is our moral obligation – if, admittedly, a daunting one.  We only get one planet. Humankind must become accountable on a massive scale for the wanton destruction of our collective home. Protecting our future on this planet depends on the conscious evolution of our species. This is the most urgent of times, and the most urgent of messages.  Honoured delegates, leaders of the world, I pretend for a living. But you do not. The people made their voices heard on Sunday around the world and the momentum will not stop. And now it’s YOUR turn, the time to answer the greatest challenge of our existence on this planet ... is now. I beg you to face it with courage. And honesty. Thank you."
