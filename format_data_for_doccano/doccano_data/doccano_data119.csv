"A group of “source” reefs have been identified that could form the basis of a life support system for the Great Barrier Reef, helping repair damage by bleaching, starfish and other disturbances. Researchers from the University of Queensland, CSIRO, Australian Institute of Marine Science and the University of Sheffield searched the Great Barrier Reef for ideal areas that could potentially produce larvae and support the recovery of other damaged reefs.   The Great Barrier Reef is the world’s largest living structure and is made up of more than 3800 individual reefs, stretching 2300km down Australia’s eastern coastline. The study found 112 “robust source reefs” – just 3% of the entire system – which had “ideal properties to facilitate recovery” of others by spreading fertilised eggs to replenish other areas. “Finding these 100 reefs is a little like revealing the cardiovascular system of the Great Barrier Reef,” said Prof Peter Mumby, from the University of Queensland’s school of biological sciences and ARC Centre of Excellence in Coral Reef Studies. Researchers had strict criteria – the reefs must be consistently well connected to other reefs through the constantly shifting currents, be less likely to die in a coral bleaching event and be less susceptible to crown-of-thorn starfish outbreaks. These reefs were more likely to still be standing in the event of bleaching incidents, for example, and were in the right location to send fertilised eggs to the reefs that need them during the annual reproduction, Mumby said. “It gives us a bit more hope that the capacity for the barrier reef to heal itself is greater than we expected.” There have been four significant bleaching events on the Australian reef, including one this year. The longest and worst for the Great Barrier Reef was in 2016, when bleaching caused by climate change killed almost 25% of the reef.  Scientists have only recently been able to understand how connected the reefs are by ocean currents, Mumby said. “The Great Barrier Reef is about the size of Italy and at any given time there are patches that have been damaged and patches that are pretty good, so it has an ability to heal itself if you like.” The researchers used ocean circulation simulations to model the connectivity of the reef larvae across the Great Barrier Reef and generated 208 networks, through which the 112 strong reefs could reach almost half of all reefs through their “amazing capacity to connect the wider system”. “It’s not perfect,” Mumby said. “There are areas in the northern barrier reefs where there are relatively few of these reefs identified. “So some next steps are to relax the criteria and look at plan B and plan C.” Associate professor John Alroy, from Macquarie University’s department of biological sciences, also noted the lack of the robust reefs in the north, saying the research paper was “thorough and interesting” but optimistic. “That makes me wonder whether reefs in the far north can really be kept alive by being replenished from the south.” Alroy also suggested many of the Great Barrier Reef’s animals would be absent from those reefs and suggested the paper did not fully acknowledge the worsening nature of climate change, which would probably also kill the robust reefs anyway.  Dr Andrew Lenton, principal research scientist at CSIRO Oceans and Atmosphere, said the report identified what was needed to maximise the capacity of coral to recover, including the protection of the robust reefs. “It also recognises that this alone is not likely to be sufficient to ensure the longer-term viability of the Great Barrier as a whole and will need to be coupled with climate mitigation, local management and active management such as coral re-seeding.” Mumby said new information about the reef and the way it functioned and repaired itself was readily adopted by the marine park authorities into its management plans, and received support from the federal government. “This list of around 100 reefs is both a tangible and feasible set of intervention points to form part of a strategy for maintaining the systemic resilience of an ecosystem that is thousands of kilometres in scale,” the report said. Tourism generated by the 2 million annual visitors to the reef contributes almost $6bn to the Australian economy. The “life support” reefs identified in the study were good news, Mumby said, but more needed to be done to ensure the survival of the Great Barrier Reef. In May scientists warned that the central goal of the government’s protection plan was no longer feasible because of the dramatic impact of climate change. “It’s very clear that in order to maintain a beautiful reef into the future, we absolutely need to be much more aggressive in our response to climate change,” Mumby said. “We need coherent policies in government about what government is trying to achieve in our actions towards climate change and we need to continue to invigorate the local protections.”"
"Even though almost half a century has passed, I can still recall in vivid detail the events of a hot, sunny afternoon in August 1970. My mother and I were visiting Brownsea Island, off the Dorset coast. We entered a dark hide, opened the window and looked out across the lagoon. And there – shining like a beacon – was a Persil-white apparition: my first little egret. Back then, this ghostly member of the heron family was a very rare visitor to Britain. Nowadays, little egrets are so numerous that we hardly give them a second glance. On my local patch, the Avalon Marshes in the heart of Somerset, I have seen up to 60 in a single feeding flock. And, according to the magazine British Birds, there are now more than 1,000 breeding pairs, as far north as the Scottish border.  As it turned out, that little egret was a trailblazer for a host of other herons to cross the Channel and establish themselves as British breeding birds. Today, no fewer than seven species breed within a short cycle ride of my home. They include great white and cattle egrets (the ones we usually see in nature films in Africa, perched on the backs of buffaloes), little bittern, and the latest arrival, the nocturnal night heron, which nested in Britain for the first time in recorded history last year. I also regularly see glossy ibises, while the odd white stork has recently turned up. Both are, like the egrets, visitors from continental Europe. None of these species was here when we moved to Somerset a decade ago. To put this in perspective, when I saw my first little egret, there were only two species of heron breeding in Britain: the familiar grey heron and the impossibly elusive bittern. Now bitterns are so common that my son George has managed to video them on his smartphone. Part of their success is down to the creation of swaths of wetland habitat on the Avalon Marshes, which this year deservedly won the national lottery award for the best environment project. But the factor that brought most of these species here is undoubtedly climate change, which is altering our birdlife at a faster rate than at any time in recorded history. For along with those herons and egrets, we are also seeing black-winged stilts, hoopoes and even bee-eaters, a species usually associated with the Mediterranean, yet which has nested in Britain several times during the past decade. These new arrivals are one of the headline messages in the latest report from the RSPB, The State of the UK’s Birds 2017. And there’s no doubt that the colonisation of so many new species is good news – especially for the growing army of birders who flock to the Somerset Levels. Indeed they have proved such a big attraction that I am now running guided tours. It’s not just these newcomers that are benefiting from a warmer climate. Earlier springs have encouraged a host of resident species to begin nesting several weeks ahead of schedule. For birds such as the blackbird and robin, which can raise two or more broods of chicks in a good year, this early start can be a real advantage. But for migrant birds, many of which travel here each spring from sub-Saharan Africa to raise a family, the picture is a lot more complicated. Again, some appear to be responding to change: observations made by keen amateur birders for the British Trust for Ornithology show that swallows now arrive in spring roughly two weeks earlier than they used to in the 1960s – clearly in reaction to a warming world. Yet as the RSPB report notes, there are major downsides to climate change. Numbers of several species clinging on as British breeding birds are falling rapidly. These include the dotterel, a rare example of a bird where the female takes the upper hand in courtship; the whimbrel, a smaller cousin of the curlew; and the Slavonian grebe, now confined as a breeding bird to a handful of Scottish lochs. Even the chiffchaff and blackcap, whose numbers have more than doubled since 1970, may struggle to cope if predictions of more extreme warming come to pass. The eminent German scientist Peter Berthold, who has made a lifelong study of migrating birds, once suggested that the first stages of global warming would lead to a “honeymoon period”, during which migrants will benefit from earlier springs and the greater availability of insect food. But if temperatures continue to rise inexorably, Berthold has predicted that the resulting droughts, habitat changes and food shortages are likely to bring major population crashes. That is especially true if, as seems highly likely, the Sahara desert – the major obstacle all long-distance migrants need to overcome on their twice-annual journeys – continues to expand. One of the biggest issues facing both migrants and breeding birds is what scientists call “asynchronous response”. This occurs when different species react to the same change in conditions in different ways. For example, oak moth caterpillars, on which both resident great tits and migrant pied flycatchers feed their chicks, are appearing earlier and earlier each spring. Great tits are already responding to this change by shifting their own breeding cycle earlier too. But for pied flycatchers, which spend the winter in west Africa, deciding when to head north to breed is usually governed by subtle shifts in day length around the spring equinox. The likelihood that they will be able to bring forward their departure from Africa and arrival in Britain, so that the hatching of their chicks coincides with the earlier peak of caterpillar availability, is a long shot, to say the least. Meanwhile, while we may be excited by exotic new species in the south, the picture is a lot less rosy farther north. The RSPB report paints a bleak picture for Scotland, home to the southernmost breeding populations of species normally found in the Arctic. The snow buntings and ptarmigans nesting on the high tops of the Cairngorm plateau rely on regular snow to create the specialised ecosystem on which they depend. In a warming world, if that snow disappears, then so will they. I find this frustrating, because more than 20 years ago, in my first book Birds and Weather, I forecasted many of these changes. It seemed obvious to me that if temperatures rose as rapidly as was then being predicted (and has indeed come to pass), then the consequences for birdlife were going to be serious. Even so, I never imagined that the changes to both our climate and bird distribution would be so rapid, or so extreme. In only a couple of decades, we have seen new arrivals in the south and population declines in the north, together with the continued loss of many farmland birds, for which global warming may be the final factor that tips them over the edge. So given the speed of change in the past quarter century, what differences in our birdlife can we expect by 2040? Again, I think the story of new colonists in the south and departures in the north will continue. I would not be surprised if there were soon a dozen species of long-legged waterbird, including spoonbills, squacco and purple herons, strutting around the Avalon Marshes. But even in the south, we are likely to lose some familiar birds, as they move north. The latest BTO Atlas survey, from 2007-11, showed that birds such as the willow warbler – by far our commonest summer visitor – have shifted their ranges north and west, and may soon cease to breed in south-east England. And for my Scottish friends, the losses are likely to outweigh any gains. While nuthatches have now arrived in southern Scotland, and reed warblers are hot on their heels, this hardly compensates for the imminent loss of those specialist birds of the high tops. Nor does it make up for the potential disappearance of other classic Scottish species, such as the common scoter and black-throated diver. Most worryingly, if the sand eels on which many seabirds feed their chicks continue to shift northwards to cooler seas, then the spectacular seabird colonies of the Scottish islands – aptly described by veteran conservationist Roy Dennis as “our Serengeti” – may disappear too. That would be a tragedy. In the end, climate change does far more damage than simply shifting the timing of the seasons and making some locations suitable for new species or unsuitable for existing ones. Its most momentous consequence is the way it changes the very nature of delicately balanced ecosystems. As temperatures continue to rise, familiar habitats will be transformed out of recognition, so that specialist species, which have evolved to be perfectly suited to their particular home, will not be able to adapt rapidly enough to cope. Conversely, the species that will do well are generalists, able to adjust their feeding and breeding behaviour in response to higher temperatures. I admire gulls, crows and wood pigeons for their ability to live alongside us; but I don’t want to live in a world where they are the only birds I see. Back in 1995, I ended Birds and Weather with a sentiment that seems more apt than ever today. Ultimately, we may find that we are powerless against the combination of pressures we have set in motion. Like passengers on a rollercoaster, we can only hope that the ride will eventually come to an end, and that when it does, we and the birds will have survived. Stephen Moss leads tours for Somerset Birdwatching Holidays. His latest book is The Robin: A Biography (Square Peg) PTARMIGAN The toughest British bird, perfectly suited to living all year round on the high tops of the Scottish Highlands, could struggle if the frozen ecosystem on which it depends disappears. ▶ PUFFIN Warming seas around the British Isles are forcing sand eels, one of the puffin’s main sources of food, farther north and out of the reach of breeding colonies. Breeding productivity has plummeted and a population crash is predicted to follow. ▼ SPOTTED FLYCATCHER One of our latest migrants to arrive, in mid-May, this aerial acrobat may not be able to cope with earlier springs. By the time it has chicks in late June, the glut of insects that it must catch to feed them will have already gone.  ▲ SNOW BUNTING Another specialist of the high tops, it breeds in snow-filled corries, where no other small bird can survive. Warmer temperatures could allow lowland species to move up the mountain and compete for food.  ◀ SNOWY OWL In the late 1960s, a short spell of climatic cooling allowed a pair of snowy owls to colonise the Shetland island of Fetlar. Soon afterwards, the trend towards warmer summers forced this magnificent bird to retreat back north, almost certainly never to return. CUCKOO Already suffering a huge decline because of drought in its African winter quarters, and the loss of large moth caterpillars due to intensive farming, it is vulnerable to even greater shifts brought about by climate change."
"Australia’s financial regulator has stepped-up its warning to banks, lenders and insurers, saying climate change is already impacting the global economy, and flagged the possibility of “regulatory action”. Geoff Summerhayes from the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority (Apra) revealed it had begun quizzing companies about their actions to assess climate risks, noting it would be demanding more in the future.  Apra also revealed it has established an internal working group to assess the financial risk from climate change and was coordinating an interagency initiative with the corporate watchdog Asic, the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) and federal Treasury to examine what risks climate change was posing to Australia’s economy. In February, Summerhayes put banks, lenders and insurance companies on notice, urging them to start adapting to climate change and warning that the regulator would be “on the front foot on climate risk”. Now, in the first significant update to Apra’s thinking on the topic since that speech, Summerhayes said Apra’s view was that climate change and society’s response to it “are starting to affect the global economy”. In an extended version of a speech to the progressive Centre for Policy Development, and circulated to journalists ahead of its delivery, Summerhayes said a shift occurring in the global economy was increasingly being driven by commercial imperatives – investments, innovation and reputational factors – rather than what scientists or policymakers are saying or doing. “Apra is not a scientific body and I can’t say with 100% conviction to what extent scientists’ predictions of increasing temperatures, rising sea levels, more frequent droughts and more intense storms will impact the Australian economy,” Summerhayes said. “But what I can tell you with absolute certainty is that the transition to a low-carbon economy is underway and moving quickly.” Summerhayes reported that a Sustainable Insurance Forum meeting in December was told that “that keeping the planet on track to meet the Paris agreement’s two-degree target could reduce fossil fuel revenues globally by a cumulative $33 trillion by 2040”. “So while the debate continues about the physical risks, the transition to a low-carbon economy is underway and that means the so-called transition risks are unavoidable,” Summerhayes said. He noted that Apra would be conducting a survey of entities it regulated over the next few months, to find out what the emerging best practice was, and that there is a global trend towards a requirement for companies to disclose climate-related risks. Summerhayes said Apra had already begun scrutinising the financial sector in this regard and had begun coordinating with other agencies. He said the regulator had already been asking questions of companies about what they have done in relation to his comments in February and said over time they will expect “more sophisticated answers, especially from well-resourced and complex entities”. He said the inter-agency initiative created between Apra, Asic, the RBA and Treasury would investigate whether companies are taking steps to protect themselves and their customers from the physical, transitional and liability risks caused by climate change. The involvement of Asic in the initiative is interesting following advice from Noel Hutley SC last year finding company directors who do not properly consider the material impacts of climate change on their business risk personal liability for breach of duty. “So whether due to regulatory action or – more likely – pressure from investors and consumers, Australia’s financial sector can expect to see more emphasis on discourse around climate risk exposure and management,” Summerhayes said."
"The Arctic National Wildlife Refuge is one of the last intact wild landscapes on Earth – and the largest wilderness left in the US. The 19.6m-acre swath of mountains and tundra is publicly owned and ecologically unique. Now, thanks to the Republican tax bill making its way through Congress, a part of the refuge we’ve long fought to protect risks being transferred to the hands of the fossil fuel industry.  History will judge the decision as an egregious error.  The Arctic Refuge is long revered by writers and photographers, and iconic among the ecologically unique wildernesses that conservationists have sought to protect since the early 20th century. The Arctic Refuge can never be restored to its original majesty once roads and pipelines are built, wells and drilling pads are dug, and oil is pumped and spilled. Public research polling shows that a majority of Americans are strongly opposed to drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. Analysis also shows that the entire premise for opening the refuge to drilling – to raise revenue to help pay for tax breaks for corporations and the wealthiest Americans – is unrealistic and will do nothing to offset the projected budget deficit. Nevertheless, senator Lisa Murkowski and other drilling proponents forced this controversial measure through as part of the tax bill, which was approved by the US senate on Friday through a simple majority vote. The threats to America’s Arctic don’t stop with the refuge. Already, we are in court challenging Donald Trump’s effort to open the Arctic Ocean to drilling after it was protected by Barack Obama. Drilling is also proposed for sensitive wildlife habitat in publicly owned lands of the western Arctic, where Trump also plans to roll back essential safeguards. The stakes have never been higher. Long-term greenhouse gas emissions associated with extracting and burning estimated Refuge oil reserves would be staggering. Researchers have calculated that in order to successfully limit global average temperatures below a threshold widely regarded as extremely dangerous, all of the Arctic’s untapped oil must remain in the ground. What’s more is that if all the fossil fuels that have already been leased on public lands and waters were extracted and burned, it would be impossible to avoid these dangerous levels. Temperatures in the Arctic are increasing nearly twice as fast as the rest of the world, and the rapid changes are beginning to cause hardship for communities that live there. The indigenous Gwich’in people, who depend on the Arctic Refuge, call the area where drilling is proposed – the Coastal Plain – the “sacred place where life begins”. Their diet and culture are intrinsically tied to the porcupine caribou herd, which migrates to the Coastal Plain to give birth and raise its young. Drilling operations would harm the caribou herd, jeopardizing Gwich’in food, security and cultural identity. This attack on the refuge is nothing less than a sellout of one of our most cherished landscapes to the highest bidder, all for the short-sighted purpose of funding irresponsible tax breaks and subsidizing the oil and gas industry. We will fight hard to protect the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge and the other public lands and waters in America’s Arctic under threat from oil drilling. We urge Americans across the country to join us. • Trip Van Noppen is president of Earthjustice, a nonprofit environmental law organization"
"The Victorian humorist and poet Thomas Hood took a dim view of the penultimate month of the year: “No fruits, no flowers, no leaves, no birds! – November!” If he meant no bird song, then, when he was writing, during the cooler climatic interlude known as the Little Ice Age, he would have been spot-on.   Apart from the robin, which unusually among our songbirds holds an autumn territory and so sings throughout the season, the parks and gardens around Hood’s north London home would have been silent in these dark days of late autumn. But that certainly isn’t true now. Thanks to the effects of climate change, combined with the “urban-heat-island effect” – in which cities are several degrees warmer than the surrounding countryside – London is now a hotspot for unseasonal birdsong. Visit any of the capital’s parks, especially at dawn when the sound of commuter traffic has yet to reach its peak, and you’ll hear a wide range of songbirds.  Listen out for the impossibly loud song of the wren – with the trill my fellow writer Dominic Couzens calls “the twiddle in the middle” – as this tiny bird signals its presence from deep inside hedgerows and shrubberies. Joining the chorus are the great tit, which sings its “tea-cher, tea-cher” song from a prominent twig, the scolding, frantic sound of the blue tit, and the rather monotonous song of the dunnock. For something a little more exotic, pay a visit to the WWT’s London Wetland Centre or the RSPB’s Rainham Marshes reserve, where you can hear the explosive sound of a relatively recent colonist, Cetti’s warbler, more or less all year round.

"Australian companies need to start developing sophisticated scenario-based analyses of climate risks, and incorporating them into their business outlooks so shareholders know how climate change will affect profitability, a thinktank has said. However, the Centre for Policy Development (CPD) said companies needed to do so in a standardised way, so investors and regulators were able to easily understand economy-wide risks to whole industries. The progressive thinktank urged Australia’s biggest businesses to use the Paris climate agreement as the centrepiece for their scenario planning, saying it provided a credible, long-term anchor for policies that limit global warming to well below 2C. The group has released a discussion paper, called “Climate horizons: next steps for scenario analysis in Australia”, explaining the best way to do so. Australia’s financial regulator warned in February that climate change posed a material risk to the entire financial system and urged companies to start adapting. Geoff Summerhayes, from the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority (Apra), told the Insurance Council of Australia’s annual forum in Sydney in February that Apra wanted companies to start incorporating “scenario-based analysis” of climate risks into their business outlooks. He said Apra intended to start running stress tests of the financial system to see if it would survive various climate shocks, and all Apra-regulated entities would need to adapt to the coming regulatory changes. “I think the days of viewing climate change within a purely ethical, environmental or long-term frame have passed,” Summerhayes said. The CPD’s new discussion paper suggested how Australian businesses could be consistent with the country’s international climate commitments under the Paris agreement and with the leading international framework for robust climate disclosures, the Financial Stability Board’s taskforce on climate-related financial disclosures (TCFD). It said businesses ought to try to develop a standardised approach to scenario-based analysis, and that all scenario analyses should include: Sam Hurley, the CPD’s policy director, said shareholders, courts and regulators like Apra clearly expected businesses and investors to prepare for climate change and also for the major physical impacts that are likely even if severe global warming of 2C or more is avoided. CPD fellow Kate Mackenzie, a co-author of the paper, said many of the climate reference scenarios used by businesses only had a 50% chance of keeping global warming to 2C or less. “Business-as-usual approaches have us on track for warming of three degrees or more, which would be incredibly damaging both economically and environmentally,” she said. “Scenario analysis work that does not factor in robust Paris-consistent scenarios will mean companies and investors underestimate the scale of the risks present and transitions required to meet Paris targets – and the opportunities that this transition will also create.” The CPD discussion paper will be discussed at a public forum in Sydney on Wednesday. Summerhayes will be speaking at the event, along with Steven Skala, the chair of the Clean Energy Finance Corporation, Christina Tonkin, the managing director of specialised finance at ANZ, and new CPD board member Sam Mostyn."

"The US Global Change Research Program recently released a Climate Science Special Report. It is clearly written – an authoritative summary of the science, and easy to understand. The first main chapter deals with changes to the climate and focuses much attention on global temperatures. When most people think of climate change, they think of the global temperature – specifically the temperature of the air a few meters above the Earth surface. There are other (better) ways to measure climate change such as heat absorbed by the oceans, melting ice, sea level rise, or others. But the iconic measurement most people think of are these air temperatures, shown in the top frame of the figure below.  The top chart is shown as a temperature “anomaly,” which means a departure from normal. Right now the anomaly is nearly 2°F, meaning that we have warmed 2°F from what the normal temperature should be. The graph shows four datasets, so it doesn’t matter whose temperature data we use; the results are the same. Global land-air temperatures have been rising pretty steadily since approximately 1960. The next graph shows ocean surface temperatures. They too are rising and have been increasing for a number of decades. Sea surface temperatures are determined from satellites, from sensors on ships, and from floating instruments spread across the ocean. Over the decades, we have obtained better coverage of the ocean. Decisions are made from different research teams on how to combine measurements from different instruments and how to interpolate between measurement locations. But regardless of the decisions made, we see the temperatures rise. The third graph shows sea level. It has been rising for more than a century. Sea level rise is a favorite measurement for scientists because it integrates the heat added to the Earth’s climate. The heat ends up in the ocean waters and causes the waters to become less dense. The lower density of water causes much of the sea level rise in the graph. The center two images in the lower rows respectively show the amount of heat in the ocean and changes to Arctic ice. We see that ocean heat content is increasing and the amount of ice is decreasing. The lower right image represents the mass of the world’s glaciers. The decrease in glacier mass as glaciers warm, melt, and flow to the oceans is shockingly fast. Take some time to think about these climate signals. The figure shows nine different measurements, and all of them are consistent with a warming climate. So, next time someone tries to argue that we don’t really know if climate change is occurring, just remind them that all the signals show a global warming.  With all nine of these signals, we don’t really need to just focus on the surface temperatures in the top frame. I don’t prefer surface temperatures because is they’re noisy. Some years they go up, other years down. You can’t just use one hot year to prove the world is warming, or one cold year to prove that it is cooling. If you insist on using surface temperatures, it is better to look at long-term trends, or decadal temperature trends. There is a clear steady rise in the decade-by-decade trend. These data from the USGCRP report are roadmaps. They show where we have been. They only give a suggestion about what will come in the future. With this in mind, all we can say is the world is changing and all the changes we observe are consistent with a warming world. A common sense view would help us understand that if we don’t change course, these trends will continue. But just by looking backwards in time, it is hard to predict where we will be in five or ten decades."
"Climate change is radically reshuffling Britain’s birds, with some species disappearing while new migrants are settling. Timings are being reset too, with egg laying getting earlier in the year, while autumn departures for warmer climes are delayed by up to a month. The State of the UK’s Birds report for 2017, published on Tuesday, reveals the profound impact of global warming on Britain’s bird life, which is set to become even greater in the future.  Average temperatures in the UK have increased by almost 1C in recent decades and familiar birds like swallows, which migrate to Africa every autumn, have responded by leaving up to four weeks later. Others, such as garden warblers and whitethroats, are also enjoying warmer British weather for longer. The migratory birds are also arriving and breeding earlier in the spring than in the 1960s. The great tit is a fulltime resident but it is also laying its eggs 11 days earlier than 40 years ago. The UK’s increasingly warmer and wetter winters have induced some short-distance migratory birds to give up their journeys entirely and remain in the UK. The breeding numbers of blackcaps and chiffchaffs have both more than doubled since 1970. However, the warmer conditions are posing a serious risk of extinction in the UK for many of the nation’s rarer birds, particularly those found in the north. Among these the dotterel, whimbrel and common scoter have already seen significant population declines. But while cold-adapted birds suffer, those preferring warmth are taking advantage. Those currently limited to southernmost regions, such as the quail, little egret and hobby, have increased their numbers. Ornithologists expect other species, including the little bittern and zitting cisticola, may colonise the south in coming years as they escape the rising heat in continental Europe. The State of the UK’s Birds report is produced by the RSPB, British Trust for Ornithology and the Wildfowl & Wetlands Trust, together with the UK’s statutory nature conservation bodies including Natural England. Michael Morecroft, at Natural England, said: “Climate change is undoubtedly going to be one of the greatest influences, both positive and negative, on the future status of birds and other biodiversity in England and the UK.” Morecroft said it was therefore vital that wildlife habitats are both expanded and better protected to help species better survive extreme weather and help them spread to newly suitable areas. The RSPB’s Daniel Hayhow, the lead author of the report, said: “For some species climate change will provide opportunities to increase and expand provided the right habitat is there, while others will be vulnerable, increasing their risk of extinction as breeding species in the UK.”"
"The parallels between the Republican Party positions on taxes and climate change are striking. Both are morally appalling and reject the available evidence and expert opinion. The Initiative on Global Markets’ panel of economic experts was recently asked about the Republican tax plan. Among the experts who took a position either way, there was a 96% consensus that the plan would not substantially grow the economy more than the status quo, and a 100% consensus that it would substantially increase the national debt.  Economists aren't exactly big fans of current GOP tax plans https://t.co/B0jodtnv2v pic.twitter.com/4qqqzwsePd Those numbers are quite similar to the 97% consensus among climate scientists that humans are driving global warming and the 95% consensus among economists that the US should cut its carbon pollution.  The House and Senate Republicans have passed similar versions of their tax bill, and neither chamber is allowing any climate policy to move forward. So what’s making Republican Party leaders reject the expert consensus on these incredibly important issues? Sometimes tax cuts make sense; for example, when trying to stimulate a depressed economy, or when operating with a budget surplus. Neither is currently the case. This message from the president: Unemployment is down to 4.1%, lowest in 17 years. 1.5 million new jobs created since I took office. Highest stock Market ever, up $5.4 trill Is incompatible with Senator Lindsey Graham saying “the economy needs a tax cut.” The tax cut plan, which by design will increase the US national debt by $1.5tn, is also incompatible with Republican opposition to increased deficits. Just last year the Republican National Committee was warning of “an unsustainable path toward crippling debt.”  Economists also agree that we should be paying down the debt when the economy is going strong. When the next recession inevitably strikes, governments need monetary flexibility to respond. That’s when it makes sense to run a deficit (for example, see the 2009 stimulus package, which helped pull the US out of the Great Recession and cost less than the Republican tax plan). These Republican economic contradictions make no sense, but they’re familiar to those of us who follow climate change news. The only consistency in climate denial is in its contradictions – deniers claim global warming isn’t happening, but it’s a natural ocean cycle, and caused by the sun, and galactic cosmic rays, and Jupiter’s orbital cycles, and it’s really just a Chinese hoax, and in any case it’s not bad. On taxes, the Republican argument is that cuts pay for themselves by stimulating economic growth and creating jobs. “This is not going to be a deficit-producing effort,” McConnell says, believing economic growth will pay for bill. But the economic literature is far from clear about whether tax cuts necessarily spur economic growth at all, let alone enough to pay for themselves. Moreover, corporate CEOs have repeatedly said that the Republican tax plan won’t spur investment or job creation – instead they’ll mostly pass the gains to their wealthy shareholders. There was an embarrassing video clip when Trump economic adviser Gary Cohn was confronted with this inconvenient truth: VIDEO: CEOs asked if they plan to increase their company's capital investments if the GOP's tax bill passes. A few hands go up. ""Why aren't the other hands up?"" Gary Cohn asks.#WSJCEOCouncil pic.twitter.com/TD2oAlN27S When presented with the nonpartisan congressional Joint Committee on Taxation analysis concluding the bill would increase the national debt by over $1tn even when accounting for associated economic growth, Republicans immediately rejected the results.  In NPR interview, Paul Ryan said he “thinks” the tax cuts will pay for themselves despite analysis to the contrary. “I’m telling you that’s what I believe will happen. I’m not going to tell you I’m sure.” https://t.co/CdXtuJmf0P As Nobel-winning economist Joseph Stiglitz said, “Either it’s a religious belief, a belief where no amount of evidence would change that, or they are using the argument cynically and they just want more money for themselves.” He was talking about trickle-down economics, but just as easily could have been describing climate denial. I’m old enough to remember when the GOP considered itself the party of intellectuals, back in the days when Republicans invented the concept of pollution cap and trade systems, for example. It wasn’t long ago that party leaders like Newt Gingrich and 2008 GOP presidential candidate John McCain were calling for the party to support climate policies. Starting with the brief rise of the Tea Party in 2010, that all changed, and the intellectual rot of the GOP has accelerated under President Trump. In a July 2017 Pew poll, just 36% of Republicans said colleges and universities have a positive impact on America, and a stunning 58% said they have a negative effect. Similarly, in an August 2017 Gallup poll, just 33% of Republicans expressed confidence in higher education. Worst of all, the Republican tax bill even penalizes American graduate students. A 2012 survey found that Americans who only watch Fox News are less informed than Americans who watch no news at all. At the time, 55% of Americans including 75% of Republicans reported watching Fox News. The network is powerful – a recent study found that Fox News might have enough influence to tip American elections – and on the whole it prioritizes ideological messaging over factual accuracy. Trump’s attacks on the so-called “fake news” media have further eroded Republicans’ trust of news sources that lack a conservative bias. As David Roberts wrote for Vox: The US is experiencing a deep epistemic breach, a split not just in what we value or want, but in who we trust, how we come to know things, and what we believe we know — what we believe exists, is true, has happened and is happening … the right has created its own parallel set of institutions, most notably its own media ecosystem … “conservative media is more partisan and more insular than the left.” Because so many conservatives rely on right-wing media sources for their news, it’s easy to misinform them through a constant stream of lies.  For example, Trump’s Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin promised that his department would produce an analysis showing that the tax cuts will pay for themselves. One economist in the department leaked to the New York Times that such an analysis doesn’t exist and Treasury staffers weren’t even asked to study the issue. It was a lie. Mnuchin also claimed the plan would only raise taxes on Americans who earn more than $1 million a year – the exact opposite of reality and another blatant lie. In fact, the entire Republican case for their tax plan was based on lies.  Similarly, climate denial is based on endless myths and misinformation – Skeptical Science has catalogued and debunked about 200 of them. And recent research showed that these myths are quite effective at misinforming their audience. Republicans including Trump cited a list of 137 economists supporting tax reform, but further investigation showed the list is full of ghosts, office assistants, Koch employees, and many others who failed to mention they’re retired. The climate change equivalent is the Oregon Petition, whose signatories included Spice Girls and fictional characters among its fake experts. The Republican tax plan and the party’s obstruction of climate policies are nevertheless both unpopular positions. Just 25% of Americans support the tax plan, though that includes 60% of Republican voters.  Analysis: Deeply unpopular Congress aims to pass deeply unpopular bill for deeply unpopular president to sign https://t.co/3Bkhw6Pn5A Similarly, 80% of Americans - including 62% of Trump voters - agree that the US should regulate and/or tax carbon pollution. But public support often doesn’t translate into policy, and Republican policymakers have been surprisingly honest and forthright about why they support the tax plan despite opposition by a majority of voters and economic experts: .@RepChrisCollins (R-NY) on tax reform: ""My donors are basically saying, 'Get it done or don’t ever call me again.'"" Lindsey Graham says “the financial contributions will stop” if tax reform fails. The plan also raises taxes soonest and most on poorer Americans, slashes their health care coverage, and Republicans are already planning to pay for the plan by cutting social programs that low-income Americans rely on. While massive income inequality is one of the biggest problems in America, squashing the ‘American dream,’ Republicans voted to make the problem much worse. Similarly, poorer countries are the most vulnerable to the consequences of climate change. The Republican Party motto may as well be ‘benefits for the rich at the expense of the poor.’ Quite simply, Republican politicians need campaign donations from oil companies and other big corporations to win elections. To maintain their power they must keep the cash flowing. That means keeping rich donors happy by cutting corporate taxes and obstructing climate policies. To achieve that, Republican politicians reject scientific evidence and expert opinion, lie to their voters, and rely on right-wing media echo chamber propaganda and tribalism to keep their supporters voting against their own best interests. It’s all morally reprehensible, and so far, it’s working. At this point, the only way to fix the problem is to defeat the Republicans who have rotted their party to its core and are now spreading that rot throughout America and the rest of the world."
"Before anyone leaps with joy at the commercial prospects of the Oxford-Cambridge sprawl belt (Hammond urged to invest £7bn in transport links for new towns, 17 November), they should read Larry Elliott’s bleak exposition of the two nations we have become (No wonder the north is angry. Here’s a plan to bridge the bitter Brexit divide, 17 November). It’s curious how the greenfield sprawl lobby has always been obsessed with the northern home counties and south-east Midlands. Andrew Adonis’s enthusiasm for the Oxford-Cambridge axis is only the latest chapter in a saga stretching back to Letchworth Garden City in Edwardian times. Low-density greenfield development is highly profitable for developers and really good at increasing traffic and greenhouse gas emissions. It’s also proved good at dragging wealth out of places that desperately need it to regions which lack the housing to support population growth. Backing economic “winners” just perpetuates an endless spiral of housebuilding, roadbuilding and destruction of our precious farmland. It also exacerbates the dangerous divide between rich and poor regions.Jon ReedsSmart Growth UK  • John Hall, who thinks people use the benefit system to “stay where they were born, waiting for someone else to bring them a car factory, or reopen mines”, writes from Bristol (Letters, 14 November). I don’t know what new jobs there are in Bristol, but I do know that young people are moving there from London because of the capital’s house prices. As a result, Bristol house prices are now rising faster than London’s. Mr Hall may welcome that, until his own children have to move away – to where? We learned a few years ago that one of Margaret Thatcher’s cabinet ministers had suggested that troublesome Liverpool should just be cut off, possibly to float away into the Irish sea. At the same time, Norman Tebbit famously said people in need of work should get on their bike to go and look for work. That seems to have been government policy for far too long: ignore the areas where industry is dead (or has been killed); allow areas to be depopulated and services withdrawn, while the south becomes overheated and unaffordable. Better attention over many years to the regional divide would have spared us Brexit. Judith MartinWinchester • Now that research has been carried out on levels of productivity on a city-by-city basis and found, unsurprisingly, that the economy would be far larger “if all cities were as productive as those in the south-east”, is it not time to investigate earnings levels in a similar manner (Productivity study shows south-east miles ahead, 16 November)? The fact that “growth in earnings” nationally is lagging well behind the inflation rate is well documented, but it would be interesting to see the changes in pay levels on a regional basis, and whether the most recent 2.2% increase in the July-September quarter would be replicated in all areas. Presumably this percentage rise is positively affected by pay levels in the City, as it is difficult to see levels rising nationally, even at 2.2%, when a pay freeze for state sector workers is in operation. If as much had been invested by successive governments in education and infrastructure in all areas as it was in London, the UK’s productivity problem would be less significant. A sensible tax policy for the very rich would have prevented short-termism in business and encouraged CEOs to invest in technology and training, rather than to accumulate wealth for themselves and shareholders.Bernie EvansLiverpool • The north has no monopoly in broken Britain. Cornwall is below Larry Elliott’s north-south divide from the Severn to the Wash. It is the second poorest region in northern Europe. Lithuania and Hungary are better off. Indicators show Cornwall is as badly served by the London elite as the north. Rural isolation will remain a problem when the south-west gets a £212-a-person spend on transport infrastructure, compared with London’s £1,943. Penzance is 110 miles from Exeter, but the high-speed train takes three hours. The line is severed every winter by floods. A quarter of Cornish children are below the poverty line. Wages are low – 77% of the national median; in north Cornwall, 43% get less than the living wage. On average the Cornish just about manage on £14,300. House prices are 12 times the average wage. Homelessness and the rough sleeping count are both the third highest in the country; 22% have no formal qualifications. And it’s getting worse. There are 17 neighbourhoods among the 10% most deprived in the UK. That’s up from eight in 2010. Larry Elliott is right. The north does needs investment and infrastructure. But after Brexit, the lights will go out in Cornwall if agricultural subsidies and EU money aren’t covered. There are still no guarantees, despite Boris’s promises before the referendum. If anywhere is in need of a new deal, it’s Cornwall.Philip KerridgeBodmin, Cornwall • Dani Rodrik’s perceptive long read (The fatal flaw of neoliberalism: it’s bad economics, 14 November) reminds us that economics is always a half-truth, because the full subject is political-economy. Discussing economics without considering institutions, the natural environment and politics is like choosing a vehicle regardless of terrain or where you want to go. Economists need to be honest about the social purpose and political dimensions of their subject.Titus AlexanderDemocracy Matters • There is no mention by Dani Rodrik of growth being incompatible with climatic normalisation. The shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, promises to include the risks of climate change in future economic forecasting (Labour vows to factor climate change risk into economic forecasts, 13 November), saying there needs to be “a transformation of our institutions and how our economies are run”, but omits to mention that climatic stabilisation can only be achieved through economic sustainability. It seems economists and politicians have yet to accept that we must re-evaluate our “cherished ideals” if we are to survive climate collapse.Geoff NaylorWinchester • Didn’t people like Larry Elliott have this sort of vision of a northern rebirth soon after 15 September 2008? Oh, what a special time that was, sitting in the John Radcliffe hospital during my mum’s final week and reading how the financial crash would be a marvellous opportunity for the left.Andrew WilksLondon • Join the debate – email guardian.letters@theguardian.com • Read more Guardian letters – click here to visit gu.com/letters"

"A little over a year ago, four friends and I shut down all five pipelines carrying tar sands crude oil into the United States by using emergency shut-off valves. As recent months have made clear, climate change is not only an imminent threat; it is an existing catastrophe. It’s going to get worse, and tar sands oil—the dirtiest oil on Earth—is one of the reasons. We did this very, very carefully—after talking to pipeline engineers, and doing our own research. Before we touched a thing, we called the pipeline companies twice to warn them, and let them turn off the pipelines themselves if they thought that was better; all of them did so.  We knew we were at risk for years in prison. But the nation needs to wake up now to what’s coming our way if we don’t reduce emissions boldly and fast; business as usual is now genocidal.  In shutting off the pipelines, we hoped to be part of that wake-up, to put ourselves in legal jeopardy in order to state dramatically and unambiguously that normal methods of political action and protest are simply not working with anywhere near the speed that we need them to. One major hope of ours was to set legal precedent by using the “necessity defense” and bringing in expert witnesses to testify that because of the egregious nature of tar sands crude and the urgency of the climate crisis, we’d actually been acting in accordance with higher laws.  The classic example of a legitimate use of the necessity defense is when someone is arrested for breaking and entering after they hear a baby crying in a burning building, and rush in to save her.  Because it requires a high bar of proof—you must have tried everything else, the danger must be imminent, the action must be likely to be effective—courts seldom even allow this defense to be argued, or expert witnesses to be brought; their only concern, generally, is did you break and enter? Not why. Three of our trials (which are in four states) had already rejected the use of the necessity defense. In North Dakota, the judge said essentially “I’m not going to let you put US energy policy on trial”. But recently, I and the other Minnesota defendants were finally granted it.  I have little doubt that the awful weather events of the last couple of months played some role in this—it’s not just scientists seeing the truth anymore: the building is indeed burning, and all the world’s babies are in it.  I was struck by the North Dakota judge’s implicit understanding that letting science be spoken in her courtroom would have had the effect of putting energy policy on trial—of reversing, in effect, who was the defendant, and who the prosecutor.  We had no demagogues lined up; we had the nation’s pre-eminent climate scientist ready, as well as two people who were to speak on the effectiveness of actions such as ours (often referred to as nonviolent resistance). How far awry must a system go, before the laws of physics are forbidden in a court of law? Yet it is indeed a dangerous thing to speak the truth sometimes—dangerous in particular to those who have been lying to us for decades, and who have gotten very, very rich by doing so. Those who are also, at the moment, running our country. So I find myself feeling peculiarly exposed now. When I first heard the news, elated, I called and texted and emailed family and friends. I deeply regretted that my mother—who died in June—didn’t live long enough to see us do our best to change legal history.  I wish she had known that a judge had been persuaded by the legitimacy of our argument (if not yet of its rightness)—a judge, no less, in a county where the pipeline company, Enbridge, is the single largest property tax payer.  I’m heartened by the way the law can be supple—not a thing that, once set, holds that exact shape forever (or we’d still have slavery, and I couldn’t vote or marry), but a thing that responds—slowly—to our evolving understanding of what is just and true. When it comes to climate change, there’s little enough to feel heartened by, so I’ll take it. "
"Everyone wants everything – how is that going to work? The promise of economic growth is that the poor can live like the rich and the rich can live like the oligarchs. But already we are bursting through the physical limits of the planet that sustains us. Climate breakdown, soil loss, the collapse of habitats and species, the sea of plastic, insectageddon: all are driven by rising consumption. The promise of private luxury for everyone cannot be met: neither the physical nor the ecological space exists.  But growth must go on: this is everywhere the political imperative. And we must adjust our tastes accordingly. In the name of autonomy and choice, marketing uses the latest findings in neuroscience to break down our defences. Those who seek to resist must, like the Simple Lifers in Brave New World, be silenced – in this case by the media. With every generation, the baseline of normalised consumption shifts. Thirty years ago, it was ridiculous to buy bottled water, where tap water is clean and abundant. Today, worldwide, we use a million plastic bottles a minute. Every Friday is a Black Friday, every Christmas a more garish festival of destruction. Among the snow saunas, portable watermelon coolers and smartphones for dogs with which we are urged to fill our lives, my #extremecivilisation prize now goes to the PancakeBot: a 3D batter printer that allows you to eat the Mona Lisa, the Taj Mahal, or your dog’s bottom every morning. In practice, it will clog up your kitchen for a week until you decide you don’t have room for it. For junk like this, we’re trashing the living planet, and our own prospects of survival. Everything must go. The ancillary promise is that, through green consumerism, we can reconcile perpetual growth with planetary survival. But a series of research papers reveal there is no significant difference between the ecological footprints of people who care and people who don’t. One recent article, published in the journal Environment and Behaviour, says those who identify themselves as conscious consumers use more energy and carbon than those who do not. Why? Because environmental awareness tends to be higher among wealthy people. It is not attitudes that govern our impact on the planet but income. The richer we are, the bigger our footprint, regardless of our good intentions. Those who see themselves as green consumers, the research found, mainly focused on behaviours that had “relatively small benefits”. I know people who recycle meticulously, save their plastic bags, carefully measure the water in their kettles, then take their holidays in the Caribbean, cancelling any environmental savings a hundredfold. I’ve come to believe that the recycling licences their long-haul flights. It persuades people they’ve gone green, enabling them to overlook their greater impacts. None of this means that we should not try to reduce our footprint, but we should be aware of the limits of the exercise. Our behaviour within the system cannot change the outcomes of the system. It is the system itself that needs to change. Research by Oxfam suggests that the world’s richest 1% (if your household has an income of £70,000 or more, this means you) produce about 175 times as much carbon as the poorest 10%. How, in a world in which everyone is supposed to aspire to high incomes, can we avoid turning the Earth, on which all prosperity depends, into a dust ball? By decoupling, the economists tell us: detaching economic growth from our use of materials. So how well is this going? A paper in the journal Plos One finds that while, in some countries, relative decoupling has occurred, “no country has achieved absolute decoupling during the past 50 years”. What this means is that the amount of materials and energy associated with each increment of GDP might decline but, as growth outpaces efficiency, the total use of resources keeps rising. More important, the paper reveals that, in the long term, both absolute and relative decoupling from the use of essential resources is impossible, because of the physical limits of efficiency. A global growth rate of 3% means that the size of the world economy doubles every 24 years. This is why environmental crises are accelerating at such a rate. Yet the plan is to ensure that it doubles and doubles again, and keeps doubling in perpetuity. In seeking to defend the living world from the maelstrom of destruction, we might believe we are fighting corporations and governments and the general foolishness of humankind. But they are all proxies for the real issue: perpetual growth on a planet that is not growing. Those who justify this system insist that economic growth is essential for the relief of poverty. But a paper in the World Economic Review finds that the poorest 60% of the world’s people receive only 5% of the additional income generated by rising GDP. As a result, $111 (£84) of growth is required for every $1 reduction in poverty. This is why, on current trends, it would take 200 years to ensure that everyone receives $5 a day. By this point, average per capita income will have reached $1m a year, and the economy will be 175 times bigger than it is today. This is not a formula for poverty relief. It is a formula for the destruction of everything and everyone. When you hear that something makes economic sense, this means it makes the opposite of common sense. Those sensible men and women who run the world’s treasuries and central banks, who see an indefinite rise in consumption as normal and necessary, are beserkers: smashing through the wonders of the living world, destroying the prosperity of future generations to sustain a set of figures that bear ever less relation to general welfare. Green consumerism, material decoupling, sustainable growth: all are illusions, designed to justify an economic model that is driving us to catastrophe. The current system, based on private luxury and public squalor, will immiserate us all: under this model, luxury and deprivation are one beast with two heads. We need a different system, rooted not in economic abstractions but in physical realities, that establish the parameters by which we judge its health. We need to build a world in which growth is unnecessary, a world of private sufficiency and public luxury. And we must do it before catastrophe forces our hand. • George Monbiot is a Guardian columnist"
"It has been a grueling year for people who care about human rights, climate change, and whatever remains of value in federal institutions from the judiciary to the diplomatic corps. This is a terrible, terrible era, one in which tremendous harm is being done to many people, to the planet and to the federal government.  It is also a time in which, through the heroic work of people all over the country and the world, the regime has been exposed, thwarted and rebuked. That’s worth remembering as we face a horrific tax bill and the end of net neutrality. This year of conflicts demonstrates that sometimes when we fight we win, and we have enormous fights ahead of us. The Trump administration is unstable for many reasons, from the erratic behaviour of the president to the Mueller investigation. Civil society has tremendous influence over what becomes of it, and of us. It’s time to take stock of some of the encouraging phenomena that emerged from this grim year. So I made a list. Many people found new roles in resistance, and powerful ones, including Amy Siskind with her weekly list of signs of creeping authoritarianism, Sarah Kendzior with her expertise on authoritarianism, and organizers of more than 6,000 chapters of Indivisible and other grassroots groups focused on engaging voters and winning elections. Many others amplified their work on climate or racial justice or voting rights and connected it to the broad resistance. These times are useful in helping us see the common ground of all our ideals by seeing that the Trump administration, like its Republican predecessors and colleagues, opposes all of them. The same people who deny climate change promulgate racism, attack women’s rights, immigrant rights, etc. The Muslim ban was struck down by the courts, repeatedly. Trump’s own tweets helped make the case that they were motivated by unlawful discrimination, not public safety, and the passionate, spontaneous airport actions a week into the regime demonstrated that there would be resistance, and it would matter. Healthcare “reform” died on the vine, but terrified and infuriated a lot of people along the way, who got active on the issue and terrified their Republican representatives back. Significant attention was finally brought to the important issue of racist voter suppression, gerrymandering, and other violations of voter rights that have given the Republican minority an electoral advantage. Many lawsuits going after state laws and regulations are under way. This is a battle that matters immensely: it’s about the basic rights of people of color to participate in shaping the nation. It’s about race and racism. Too many liberal and left journalists spent the past year telling a story about the swing states focused on Clinton’s weaknesses. Too few told the story of how many people – particularly black people – in those states were prevented from voting. Until everyone knows it, it’s worth repeating that had everyone had equal voting rights, we would have had a dramatically different election.  We’ve seen numerous dramatic resignations/firings in the chaotic White House. Business Insider reports: “Since late July, senior level officials such as former communications director Anthony Scaramucci, chief strategist Steve Bannon, chief of staff Reince Priebus, and press secretary Sean Spicer departed the White House. Others have included Trump’s longtime body guard Keith Schiller, the director of Oval Office operations, and Sebastian Gorka, an adviser known for his cable news hits defending the administration.”  Tom Price, the health and human services secretary, stepped down after a scandal about his squandering a million dollars of government money on private jets. And, of course, Michael Flynn was fired earlier this year, too (more on him below). The administration is under investigation for some very serious crimes that may discredit the whole regime and incriminate, even incarcerate, some of them, including Trump family members and perhaps Trump himself. Mueller is doing a thorough but swift job. Flynn pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI on Friday; Paul Manafort and his right-hand man are wearing ankle bracelets; the collusion of Trump’s campaign adviser George Papadopoulos was revealed as he incriminated many others in the campaign, including several still in the administration; Carter Page sang like a (drunk) canary. There’s lots more to come.  Many analysts say that such investigations start with the small fry, working their way from the periphery toward the center. They’re coming for the Trump family. Stay tuned. And be prepared for an uprising if the Republicans try to stop it.  The Russia business that so many insisted on denying through last winter is undeniable – don’t buy the idea that it’s just intelligence agencies promulgating it. The depth of this story has been exposed by superb journalistic work by many news outlets, including the Guardian; by leaked documents, including the extraordinary stuff exposed by the NSA whistleblower Reality Winner last spring; by politicians across the spectrum, from Maxine Waters to Lindsey Graham; by congressional investigations, and now by Mueller’s work – the indictments he handed down told us a lot.  Russian interference in European votes, including the Brexit referendum, is now surfacing as well, thanks to journalists in many countries.  Julia Ioffe in the Atlantic recently broke a story about Julian Assange’s Twitter correspondence with Donald Trump Jr. Assange was doing his damnedest – as anyone who’s been paying attention the last 18 months already knew – to help Trump succeed, but now we get to read about it directly. With every revelation, the case for the president’s own complicity grows stronger. Ioffe reports that Assange told Trump Jr last fall: “Strongly suggest your dad tweets this link if he mentions us.” Then, 15 minutes later, Trump senior did: “Very little pick-up by the dishonest media of incredible information provided by WikiLeaks. So dishonest! Rigged system!” And let’s be clear: earlier this month, Trump didn’t say he supports Putin’s denials about infiltrating the election because he’s naive or gullible. He did so because if he acknowledges Putin is guilty, then he acknowledges he gained the presidency illegitimately. The enormous role of Silicon Valley in cooperating and creating the vulnerabilities and capacities to hack the election are now being exposed: the capacity for harm of Facebook, Twitter, Cambridge Analytica, etc is finally being reckoned with. The industry’s own spin about how lovely and high minded and inclusive it is: we’re done with that propaganda, and that’s a good thing. Remember that virtually everything the Putin regime is said to have done in the 2016 election was made possible by the internet: hacking voter rolls, pushing fake news, using armies of bots and trolls to shape opinion, hacking Democrats and offering the results to Trump team members. It’s not good to have powerful enemies; it’s good to know who and what they are. The global climate movement remains strong, technological innovations making renewables more effective and affordable continue, the low price of oil hamstrings some oil projects and expansions, campaigns targeting sites from German coal mines to Canadian pipelines continue to be strong, and most countries continue to respect the Paris climate agreement. Despite all those reports that Trump withdrew us, the United States cannot withdraw from Paris until the day after the next presidential election, in 2020, as Rebecca Leber reported in Mother Jones last week. The administration has not been able to redirect the world away from addressing climate (though it’s also true that we need far stronger measures and we need them soon). Though stories about the Democrats being in disarray are forever being recycled, it’s worth noting that the Republicans are in a slow boil. There are loud condemnations of Trump from Jeff Flake and John McCain, among other prominent party members, and a whole wing of old-school conservatives, including the pundits at places like Commentary and the National Review, routinely condemn the administration. There are lot of reports that privately, many elected Republicans are squirming about their miserable choice between going along with Trump versus the dangers of dissenting. They are constantly facing crises over whether to support or distance themselves from people like Roy Moore and policies that may make them unelectable next time around. The healthcare battle this spring was a great example of that. Angry constituencies greeted – and in many cases chased away or frightened from showing up – their Republican congressmen this spring. And healthcare “reform” (we have to stop letting them call this stuff reform) tanked. The elections last month in Virginia and across the country showed that there are real possibilities of a backlash against this rightwing extremism. Eight trans people, along with many women, people of color, members of the Democratic Socialists of America and other progressives who want a US for all of us won office.  Philadelphia elected as its new district attorney a Black Lives Matter supporter and death penalty opponent who has sued the city’s police department 75 times. A lot of people who were poised to explain why the Democrats were total losers had to eat their editorials, and though the Democrats aren’t the revolution, they are the currently available alternative to the Republicans.  The border wall is probably never ever going to happen (except that hundreds of miles of wall were built up already in recent decades). The idea Trump pushed during his campaign that Mexico was going to pay for it was something only suckers would believe, and it’s quietly taken a hike since the election.  No president has ever polled anywhere near as low as Trump at this point in his presidency. He has a diehard base that he caters to, and the more he does, the more he alienates the rest of the public. It’s as though he’s building up an army of support, but in doing so he also fortifies the army of resistance. To paraphrase George W Bush long ago, he’s a divider, not a uniter. After a long series of legislative defeats and stalemates, Trump is going after a radical transformation of the nation’s tax structure. It will take a lot to resist it, and the resistance should begin by noting that once again, this is the agenda of a party serving corporations and the super-rich and screwing the rest of us over in the process. This list of our successes and their defeats does not mean you can sit back in the sunshine and trust that it will all turn out in the end. It means that resistance – active, engaged, informed, creative, dedicated, energetic resistance – works, and we need lots more of it.  It’s too soon for despair, though not for grief. Grief and hope can coexist: grief for who and what has already been harmed, hope for preventing more harm. Remembering what we have accomplished and how ferociously engaged people are in this moment is knowing that the outcomes of many pending conflicts are entirely up in the air, and that we are powerful enough to determine some of them. That power of civil society has hardly yet been exercised. Engagement means understanding that you can work with some parts and campaigns of the Democratic party as it exists without sharing the limited vision of its leadership. From the newly elected Danica Roem to the longtime congresswoman Maxine Waters, the party contains people whose commitments are more radical than those leaders. For those of us in places where our representatives are not out to destroy everything we love and believe in, it means engagement beyond opposition. Work both inside and outside electoral politics matters, as do campaigns to transform the party into something more progressive and more accountable now being undertaken by many magnificent young organizers. Insiders and outsiders both have roles that matter. Independent activists on issues like abortion or immigrant rights can define the debate and raise the issues before decisions are made inside the political system. We are in the midst of a host of battles over the fate of the nation and the earth, and the outcome is in no small part up to us. The results over the past year show that sometimes we win, if we try."
"A German court has ruled that it will hear a Peruvian farmer’s case against energy giant RWE over climate change damage in the Andes, a decision labelled by campaigners as a “historic breakthrough”.  Farmer Saul Luciano Lliuya’s case against RWE was “well-founded,” the court in the north-western city of Hamm said on Thursday.   Lliuya argues that RWE, as one of the world’s top emitters of climate-altering carbon dioxide, must share in the cost of protecting his hometown Huaraz from a swollen glacier lake at risk of overflowing from melting snow and ice.  RWE’s power plants emitted carbon dioxide that contributed to global warming, increasing local temperatures in the Andes and putting property at risk from flooding or landslides, Lliuya argues.  “Even people who act according to the law must be held responsible for damage they cause to property,” the judges said.  Now the court must decide whether “the accused’s contribution to the chain of events depicted here is measurable and calculable,” they added.  “This is a major success not just for me, but for the people of Huaraz and everywhere in the world threatened by climate risks,” Lliuya said in a statement circulated by NGO Germanwatch.  He wants RWE to pay €17,000 ($20,000) towards flood defences for his community in Peru’s northern Ancash region.  The 37-year-old also wants the German company to reimburse him for the €6,384 he himself has spent on protective measures.  Lliuya bases his claims on a 2013 climate study which found that RWE was responsible for around 0.5% of global emissions “since the beginning of industrialisation”.  The court said in a statement that it will choose experts to evaluate the claim in cooperation with both plaintiff and defendant, with Lliuya paying about €20,000 in fees up front.  “It will be up to the experts to quantify [RWE’s] role, which could be different” from the amount he claims, the judges said.  After an initial hearing in mid-November, the court in the north-western city of Hamm gave both sides until Thursday to provide further arguments to help them decide whether the case should go ahead. The decision to hear the case is a “historic breakthrough with global relevance,” Germanwatch, which has backed Lliuya’s claim, said in a statement.  “Major emitters of greenhouse gases can be held responsible for protective measures against climate damage.”  RWE could not immediately be reached for comment.  But the firm has insisted that the complaint was “not admissible” and was even “unjustified”, arguing that a single company cannot be held liable for specific consequences of climate change.  A lower court in the German city of Essen, where RWE is based, initially found that the lawsuit against the energy giant was unfounded.  The company has in the past said it did not understand why it has been singled out for legal action, stressing the efforts it had made to become more environmentally friendly.  As well as modernising its coal-fired power plants to reduce CO2 emissions, RWE has invested billions in renewable energy as part of Germany’s move away from fossil fuels, it says.  Shares in RWE fell on the news, losing 0.31% in Frankfurt against a DAX index of blue-chip German shares up 0.52%.  The Peruvian’s case comes at a time when German politics is sharply divided over how to balance climate action against economic growth.  A government-directed “energy transition” to renewables, rather than nuclear power and fossil fuels, is making only halting progress, while environmentalists are pushing the country’s powerful auto industry to produce less polluting vehicles after a series of scandals.  Climate and energy policy was among the most bitterly disputed issues in three-way coalition talks between chancellor Angela Merkel’s conservatives, the pro-business Free Democrats and the ecologist Greens before they broke down this month.

"Electric cars have received a funding boost with the government earmarking £340m for a national charging network and subsidies for vehicle purchases. However, further budget backing for greener vehicles was limited to a small rise in vehicle excise duty for new diesel cars that fail to meet rigorous emissions standards – disappointing campaigners who had hoped for a rise in fuel duty or a diesel scrappage scheme. The government will contribute £200m to a £400m fund to upgrade the electric car-charging infrastructure, as well as setting aside a further £40m for research and development into charging technology. The chancellor committed a further £100m to maintain a car-buying subsidy until 2020, which contributes up to £4,500 towards the cost of buying an electric vehicle.  There are 115,000 electric cars in the UK and 13,000 charging points spread across 4,500 locations.  Announcing the electric car funding, Philip Hammond said: “Our future vehicles will be driverless, but they’ll be electric first. And that’s a change that needs to come as soon as possible.” Although moves on driverless cars had been widely trailed before the budget, the chancellor only made passing reference to the technology in his speech. However, the budget report confirms that the government will reform road laws to allow self-driving cars on UK roads by 2021. Other measures in the budget to increase the take-up of next generation vehicles will include a commitment to make 25% of cars in central government department fleets electric by 2022, and to remove any tax for employees who recharge their vehicles at work. An innovation prize will also be launched by the National Infrastructure Commission to determine how roads should be built to support self-driving cars. The Petrol Retailers Association – whose members may soon be forced by law to install charging points alongside pumps – said it hoped the £400m charging fund would be partly ringfenced for them, adding: “If the government insists on mandating EV charging equipment upon retailers, they must be prepared share some of the financial burden.” Meanwhile, Hammond made limited moves to tackle diesel, saying the “tax system can play an important role in protecting our environment”. Diesel cars that have yet to pass on-the-road emissions tests will move to a higher tax band for vehicle excise duty. Along with a 1% rise in company car tax for diesel vehicles, the move would fund a £220m clean air fund, Hammond said.  But documents published by the Treasury said carbuyers’ response to the policy change would be “negligible” – putting a one-off £20 on the cost of a new Ford Focus. Some campaigners said it remained an important symbolic move. Dr Penny Woods, of the British Lung Foundation, said: “Increasing tax on new diesel cars sends a clear message that diesel is toxic.” However, the mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, said: “The measures announced to clean up our polluted air are totally inadequate – and no action to introduce a desperately needed diesel scrappage fund.” Hammond admitted he was averting negative headlines by not bringing in wider moves on diesel and continuing to freeze fuel duty. He said: “No white van man (or woman) will be hit by these measures.”  •Follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk, or sign up to the daily Business Today email here."

"Shell has doubled its spending on clean power and bowed to shareholder pressure by promising to halve the carbon footprint of the energy it sells by 2050, as the oil giant said it was stepping up its ambitions on green energy. The Anglo Dutch firm is increasing capital expenditure for its new energies division, to $1bn-$2bn (£750m to £1.5bn) a year for 2018-2020, up from a previous plan of up to $1bn a year by 2020. But the spending on wind power, biofuels and electric car infrastructure will still account for a small fraction of the giant’s planned $25-30bn annual investment. Shell has $5bn-$6bn a year pegged for deepwater drilling and $2-3bn a year allocated for shale oil and gas. The company’s new climate change target aims to cut the net carbon footprint of its products in half by 2050, and around one-fifth by 2035.  “It is making sure that the products within society have an overall lower carbon footprint. That is the longterm way of making sure our business remains a relevant business in the face of the energy transition,” said Ben van Beurden, Shell’s chief executive. The carbon target is similar to one put forward by shareholder activists at the company’s AGM earlier this year, which the board opposed and defeated.  Shell said the goal addressed the spirit of the shareholders’ proposal but the company’s chosen methodology meant it did not have “negative side-effects” of the resolution. “We could see a kernel of truth and relevance in there,” said Van Beurden. The Dutch activist shareholder group behind the proposal, Follow This, welcomed the new target.  “We applaud Shell’s ambitious decision to take leadership in achieving the goals of the Paris climate agreement to limit global warming to well below 2C,” said the group’s founder, Mark van Baal. Shell said it would grow its new energies division through its existing businesses and by acquiring companies, as it has done recently by buying electric car charging firms Ionity and New Motion. Van Beurden defended the level of spending on green energy. “Is the investment we are going to put in new energies enough? Let’s see, we have to start somewhere,” he said. Wind and biofuels would have a key role, he said. “We will systematically improve, we will grow this business up to be a very significant part of the future of the company, otherwise you can’t even get to a 20% reduction of a carbon footprint.  “But we have to do it in a disciplined way. If we destroy value in this process, no one is going to be served.” However, the company said hydrocarbons would still be at the heart of its business and the global energy landscape over the next two decades.  “Oil and gas will remain an important part of the energy system [up to 2030], no credible forecast says otherwise,” said Van Beurden.  The 2015 Paris climate agreement is the first truly global deal to tackle climate change. It commits governments to limit temperature rises to no more than 2C (3.6F) – which scientists say is the threshold of safety, beyond which the effects of global warming are likely to become catastrophic and irreversible –  and to pursue efforts to limit the temperature increase to 1.5C. It has been signed by 197 countries. The US is on course to become the only country outside the agreement if it follows through on Donald Trump’s vow to leave. On the idea that some of its assets would be stranded by governments taking action on carbon emissions as part of the Paris climate deal, he said: “I think we will have very limited, if any, stranded assets [in the 2020s].” The chief executive said that the firm sees underlying reasons that the oil price could go even higher than where it stands now, at just over $60 per barrel, but in the meantime the price could be unpredictable. “I think we will see an era of volatility,” he said, adding: “You may argue the fundamentals point to a slightly higher oil price than we see at the moment.” As expected, Shell also announced it was would begin rewarding shareholders in cash rather than issuing more shares. “Ben van Beurden has delivered an early Christmas present for Shell shareholders,” said Nicholas Hyett, analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, of the scrapping of the scrip dividend which was introduced after Shell bought gas behemoth BG Group for £35bn in 2016. • Follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk, or sign up to the daily Business Today email here."

"It was 8 November, 2011 and I had just had one of the best days of my parliamentary career. We had made history when the Senate adopted legislation to implement an emissions trading scheme to address global warming. I was both exhausted and excited, having negotiated and shepherded the legislation through the senate for the Greens. It had been a long haul over many years.  Then an email landed in my inbox; after some preliminary congratulations, the writer and vice-chancellor of James Cook University, Sandra Harding, asked why I was wearing a polar bear badge in the newspaper photographs and not one representing an Australian animal.  I thought: “Oh for goodness’ sake, why can’t people just for once be pleased?” I decided to ignore it but then I checked out the sender and decided to reply. I wrote back pointing out that what I was wearing was an artwork, a brooch by Léa Stein, not a badge. I explained that I had deliberately chosen to wear the polar bear brooch for the debate because polar bears are the globally recognised symbol of global warming. They rely on the Arctic sea ice for hunting, breeding and travelling. With record temperatures in the Arctic, the ice is melting and retreating earlier in the spring and refreezing later in the autumn when eventually the temperatures drop. The changing pattern of ice habitat threatens their ability to feed, find a mate and raise cubs. There is nothing sadder than knowing that polar bears are drowning because of the loss of Arctic ice. However, the critic of the polar bear brooch was not deterred. She told me she could produce a badge featuring an Australian white lemuroid ringtail possum, and that I should wear it to highlight the plight of tropical species far more endangered by global warming in the short term than polar bears.   I agreed to wear it at the United Nations Climate Change Conference in Durban in 2011. The beautiful white lemuroid ringtail possum used to make up about 40% of the population of possums that live in the cool misty rainforest above 1100 metres on Mount Lewis in tropical north Queensland. It was featured in the campaigns to protect the Wet Tropics in the 1980s. Biologist William Laurance, distinguished research professor at James Cook University, wrote: Much has been written about how global warming will affect the colder parts of the planet – the polar and boreal regions, glaciers, and alpine mountains. In fact, some of the warmest places on Earth, especially tropical rainforests, could also be intensely vulnerable to climate change … many people are unaware that tropical species – particularly those specialised for cool, cloudy mountaintops – are often sensitive to hot weather … as temperatures rise mountaintop specialists have nowhere to go. Their populations will wither and shrink and potentially disappear altogether. While recognising the impacts of global warming on polar bears, he pointed out that creatures living near the poles have adapted to seasonal swings in temperature, whereas tropical zone species are thermal specialists adapted to a narrow stable temperature range. He added that tropical species endangered by global warming probably outnumber their polar counterparts by 1,000 to one. He illustrated the point by referring to the mass death of a colony of giant fruit bats in New South Wales on 12 January 2002 when the temperature soared to 42.9C, eight degrees higher than the average summer maximum:  The fruit bats normally just doze in the treetops through the day but on this afternoon they were fanning themselves, panting frantically, jostling for shady spots and licking their wrists in a desperate effort to cool down. Suddenly when the thermometer hit 42C the bats began falling from the trees. Most quickly died. The research team led by Justin Welbergen counted 1,453 dead from one colony alone. The same thing happened in February 2014 when 45,500 fruit bats died in a single day as temperatures in Queensland rose to 42–44C. In December 2016 young bats started dropping out of trees in large numbers. The mothers had flown off, and the babies were not attached. They gradually dropped lower down the trees as they starved to death until they fell out. The causes were thought to be the El Niño weather pattern and loss of food and habitats as more land is cleared.  Over the weekend of 14 February 2017 south-eastern Australia was the hottest place on the planet. The mercury hit 46C, and thousands of bats fell dead to the ground. Steve Williams and his team, also of James Cook University, specialise in the study of the impacts of global warming on tropical wildlife. They concluded in 2009 that species extinctions will increase dramatically if temperatures rise more than two or three degrees and that most of the wildlife found only in North Queensland will be wiped out entirely if temperatures rise the four to six degrees that is projected in the absence of a global concerted effort to restrict the rise to less than two degrees.  By 2016 Williams had observed that many endemic birds of the wet tropics are experiencing retracted ranges and have already moved uphill with only one degree of warming. He told me that the only other population of possums (Hemibelideus lemuroides) not on Mount Lewis has had to move higher up the Atherton Tablelands; at 1,000 metres you can find the animals but there are none in what used to be the lower part of its range below 700 metres. It is not a good sign for the diversity of life in the tropical forests. Once at the top of the mountain, there is nowhere else to go. The white lemuroid possum was thought likely to be the first mammal globally to be driven to extinction solely by global warming, but that sad place has now been taken by a small rodent, the Bramble Cay melomys (Melomys rubicola), which lived only on a single low-lying island off the eastern Torres Strait. It was last seen in 2009. It is likely to have been driven to extinction by sea-level rise and ocean inundation, destroying its habitat and killing many individual animals. The white lemuroid ringtail possum is not far behind. In late 2005 a severe heatwave hit the Mount Lewis region, coinciding with a failed wet season. Without misty cloud cover the possums could not withstand the heat and died. The survey conducted afterwards found only four possums, but since then there has been a very slow recovery. But with more extreme and more frequent heatwaves predicted as the world warms, it is only a matter of time before such an event coincides again with clear skies, and that will prove fatal for the white lemuroid possum on Mount Lewis. Having agreed to take the badges to Durban and feeling devastated by the realisation that the possums’ extinction was looking me in the face, I began wondering if Léa Stein would design a white lemuroid possum brooch, not just because it would be beautiful but for global distribution as a way of raising awareness of the fact that global warming combined with habitat loss from mining and logging, urban expansion, commercial agriculture and invasive species will send one-third of all species to extinction by 2050. Stop for a minute and take that in. Though Sandra Harding had delivered a badge to commemorate this magnificent creature, I put to her the idea of a Léa Stein brooch and asked for her assistance in having the university prepare and translate into French the work of their researchers and provide a high-quality image so I could send them to Stein. I talked to Léa Stein’s agent in Australia, Bruna Harrison of Harlequin Jewellers in Sydney, and put the idea to her; she was enthusiastic. Bruna told me that Léa, now in her eighties, is a recluse but still produces two designs a year. She does not use computers and has to be approached in person, so Bruna agreed that if information and a photo could be provided, together with a letter from me, she would give them to Lea on her next buying trip to Paris. Léa told Bruna that she would consider it. A year went by, and I had given up thinking that anything would come of the idea. Then I heard from Bruna, who had been in Paris and could report that Léa had been working on the design but was having trouble with the tail. Finally the brooch was completed, in six different variations of texture. Three hundred were made available for early release in Australia before the global release in 2015. We were all incredibly excited that our project was about to materialise, and were quite blown away when we saw the brooches for the first time – a badge had been transformed into a stylised and stylish artwork. The brooch was launched most appropriately at the Global Tropical Biodiversity Conference at James Cook University in Cairns in 2014. I had been invited to deliver a keynote address there, and it seemed appropriate to bring together the Australian team who had made the brooch happen and the scientists on whose work we relied, and to celebrate as a group. It is a modern example of the age-old ways women work, in families, communities and life in general. This was a tale of four women: a French artist, a university vice-chancellor, a small business proprietor and an Australian Greens party leader, working together and combining our ideas, our skills, our nous and our networks to produce something beautiful, meaningful and multilayered. When I wear that brooch, it is a statement that at the poles and in the tropics, our fellow species, which we have known and loved, are on their way to extinction.  I have a granddaughter who will be 35 in 2050. According to modelling of business as usual provided by Sophie Lewis at the Australian National University, the global land temperature will have increased by just over three degrees from my birth to when my granddaughter turns 35. I grieve that she will know silent and empty places where polar bears, white lemuroid possums, orang­utans, elephants, giraffes and a myriad other species on land and in the oceans once lived.  Although the Great Barrier Reef will already be dead, just how empty and silent the seas and those landscapes become depends on us. It is why I will never stop being a campaigner to address global warming, environmental degradation, overpopulation and over-consumption, and I will never stop standing up to the governments and corporations that continue to drive them. We are living in the Anthropocene, a period in the Earth’s history in which we humans have altered all the systems that support life on Earth. We are destroying the habitat that we and our fellow creatures need to survive. We live on a finite planet, yet we behave as if an increasing global population can continue to consume the Earth’s resources from forests and fisheries to fossil fuels at an accelerating rate and nothing will change. When I was born in 1953, the global population was 2.5 billion; it is now over 7 billion, and by 2050 it is projected to be more than 9 billion.  If everyone consumes at the current rate of those of us in the developed world, why would we think that anything other than a reduced number of humans will have a place to live? When you add to that the impact of invasive species and overlay it with global warming, changing the climate and threatening food and water security for everything from plankton, plants and insects to reptiles, birds, animals and humans, you cannot escape the fact that we are living in the sixth wave of extinction and destroying our own home. This is an edited extract from Christine Milne, An Activist’s Life (University of Queensland Press) in which she shares stories of her life through objects that have special meaning"
"The United States Global Change Research Program recently released a report on the science of climate change and its causes. The report is available for anyone to read; it was prepared by top scientists, and it gives an overview of the most up to date science.  If you want to understand climate change and a single document that summarizes what we know, this is your chance. This report is complete, readily understandable, and accessible. It discusses what we know, how we know it, how confident we are, and how likely certain events are to happen if we continue on our business-as-usual path.   To summarize, our Earth has warmed nearly 2°F (1°C) since the beginning of the 20th century. Today’s Earth is the warmest it has ever been in the history of modern civilization. While the planet has warmed, the climate and the Earth’s environment has responded. We are observing heating of the atmosphere, oceans, and the Earth’s surface. Glaciers are melting at an alarming rate. Snow cover is decreasing and we are experiencing increased water scarcity, particularly in parts of the world that rely on snowmelt for water.  The amount of ice is decreasing. In particular, the ice that floats atop waters in the Arctic have decreased significantly since measurements began. As a result of melting land ice and thermal expansion, sea levels are rising. Oceans have risen, on average, 7–8 inches. In some places, the rise has been much more. Astonishingly, half of the total rise has occurred in the last 30 years. Currently, oceans are rising faster than any point in time in the last ~3,000 years. Not only that, the ocean rise is causing city flooding to accelerate. According to the report, seal levels will likely rise somewhere between 1–4 feet by the end of the century, but increases up to 8 feet can’t be ruled out (~2.5 meters). For context, approximately 150 million people around the world live within one meter of current sea level.  If you live away from the shores, you are not immune to the impacts of climate change. The report delves into the increases in extreme weather. For instance, heavy rainfall is increasing across the United States as well as globally. These increases will continue into the future and they are already leading to more severe flooding. The prediction that scientists made that wet areas will become wetter is turning out to be true.  There are more extreme heatwaves as well. Not only are we seeing more heat waves (and severe droughts), but in the next few decades, the authors predict temperatures will rise by ~2.5°F (~1.5°C) in the United States. This is an enormous change in temperature that will reshape the country. Similar changes are occurring and will occur in other countries. What the report also shows is that the biggest uncertainty in future climate change is us. What will humans do about it? We have the choice of taking action now to reduce future climate change. Or, we can ignore the problem and face the consequences. That choice has tremendous implications. If we take strong actions to reduce greenhouse gases, we may be able to limit global warming by 2100 to 3.5°F (2°C) above pre-industrial temperatures. If we ignore the problem, we will face temperature increases as much as 9°F (5°C). The impact such a temperature change would have on agriculture, sea level, heat waves, droughts, and weather is almost unthinkable. There is some hope in this report. Even with recent economic growth, the rate at which we emit greenhouse gases has not risen as fast as the past. This means it is possible to have a healthy economy and a healthy environment. For those who say dealing with climate change is too expensive, they repeat a myth. In fact, ignoring climate change is much more expensive then dealing with it. Had we taken action years ago when scientists first warned us of the problem we would be well on our way to effective mitigation. We’ve lost valuable years to the denialists. The more time we waste, the more expensive this problem will be in both lives and dollars."

"An unbearable amount of Ventura county in southern California, where I was born and raised, is simply gone. And as I hear about site after site from my childhood simply disappearing into scorched earth, I am realizing that climate change is not only erasing the present, it is also destroying the physical touchstones to my own past. Victim to hot temperatures and high winds, some 90,000 acres have burned, hundreds of structures have been destroyed, and tens of thousands of people have been evacuated or lost power in Los Angeles, Ventura and Santa Barbara counties.  But it is coastal Ventura, where I was born, that has driven home so personally what climate change looks like.  I was, of course, relieved that my relatives were all accounted for, and that my brother, sister-in-law and nephew evacuated safely on Monday night. (Their house survived, though the fire came just a couple of blocks from it.) My sister, north of Santa Barbara, has been taking in friends and family who have evacuated.  But it is heartbreaking to see the photos of the aftermath and to take stock of all that has been lost – both the things that can be be replaced, and the things that can’t.  Hundreds of schools in Oxnard, Ventura, and Los Angeles have been closed all week. This massive loss of education time – not to mention the economic precariousness for families deprived of childcare – is yet another impact of climate change. When I was trying (in vain) to fall asleep on Wednesday night, I read journalist John Sepulvado’s tweets from Ojai, in which he said he was “able to separate my emotions from the story until I hear a coyote wail in pain or see cats scurry. Meanwhile, sirens ring and ash falls.”  I found myself thinking about the fire jumping rural Highway 33, where I learned to drive, and thought about the bird-filled cages of an old sanctuary I visited just off that road in my youth. And about those howling coyotes. And of all the horses stabled out that way.  I'm able to separate my emotions from the story until I hear a coyote wail in pain or see cats scurry. Meanwhile, sirens ring and ash falls I wondered if these animals were escaping, or if they were being cooked alive.  They, too, are the victims of climate change.  I am hearing from friends and family that the air is simply too bad to do much of anything physical outdoors. And yet, I saw that photo of farmworkers out in the fields, still doing the work while breathing air which will make them sick. Strawberry fields are toxic worksites filled with deadly chemicals even when they are not on fire.  I am terribly worried about the economic suffering these fires are causing. An entire apartment complex destroyed in Ventura contained some of the only affordable housing in the city: will what replaces it also be made affordable and available to the displaced, or will disaster capitalism replace it with multimillion-dollar condos?  I think people look at Ventura County – and, noting it sits on the Pacific Ocean between Malibu to the south and Santa Barbara County to the north – think it is a rich place. It is not. There are a lot of poor people in Ventura County, many of whom work at one of its two military bases, in agriculture, or in service jobs.  But while the wages for many of these jobs are low, housing is very expensive. Some of the apartments and homes lost were rental units occupied by poor people who likely didn’t have insurance and will have lost everything, and will have no other affordable housing options in the county. They, too, are victims of climate change. And while Ventura County residents are coming together to help each other, the increasingly cruel federal government is neither providing an adequate response to climate change nor an adequate social safety net even in the best of times. In 2012, I got to see what climate change looked like wet, when the city of my adult life, New York, was deluged by Hurricane Sandy. But at least I got to help a bit with recovery efforts.  Five years later, I am watching powerlessly from afar a very different manifestation of climate change – one that is made worse by a terrible lack of water in my hometown.  They’re two side of our climate crisis, and neither is pretty. "
"For an issue that often seems to lurch from crisis to catastrophe, the steady but vital progress at the UN’s global climate change talks in Bonn was reassuring. But there remains a very long way to go before the world gets on track to avoid catastrophic levels of global warming. There was little drama as the diplomatic sherpas trekked up the mountain of turning the political triumph of the 2015 Paris agreement into a technical reality, with a rulebook that would allow countries to start ramping up action. They got about as far as expected in turning the conceptual into the textual, but no further.  But that is not to say there were no star turns. Timoci Naulusala, a 12-year-old Fijian boy, gave a passionate yet nerveless account of the destruction of his village by Cyclone Winston in 2016 to the gathered heads of state and ministers. “Climate change is real, not a dream,” he said. The French president, Emmanuel Macron, turned on the charisma and heartened the gathered nations with a pledge to replace the US funding dumped by Donald Trump for the UN’s climate science body. The Trump administration, which wants the US to be the only country in the world not in the Paris deal, was the pantomime villain, but only succeeded in uniting the 195 other nations against it. The sole US event brought an executive from Peabody, the US coal company with a long history of funding climate denial, to argue for “clean coal”. A protest song and walkout from most of the audience followed and for the rest of the summit, the US delegation was irrelevant. But the large coalition of US cities and states backing climate action – which as a group represents the third-largest economy in the world – stole the American show, with the California governor, Jerry Brown, popping up everywhere, pumping up the crowds. The multi-nation pledge to phase out coal use was the political high point, but the dragging on of the coalition talks in Germany prevented Angela Merkel from potentially joining the party. The politics is key: UN climate talks run on consensus, with no votes, so trust and momentum are vital and were preserved in Bonn. But the summit was like a dress rehearsal for next year, when the Paris rulebook has to be finalised and poorer and vulnerable nations will demand much more action and funding from the rich countries they blame for climate change. Further gatherings in Paris in December and California next year will also help prepare the stage for the 2018 UN climate summit. That will be in Silesia, a heartland of Europe’s King Coal, Poland, which has already started feeling the international pressure to clean up its act. If that summit achieves its goals – accelerating carbon cuts – then the curtain will have been raised on the clean, green 21st century, against a backdrop of the mines and power plants of the 20th century."
"The head of Malcolm Turnbull’s department says he has no “personal animus” towards Tony Abbott, but he says the former prime minister damaged the public service when he sacked him for following the legally mandated directions of the Rudd and Gillard governments. Martin Parkinson was sacked by Abbott from the Treasury department after he came to power in 2013, alongside a handful of other departmental heads. He was brought back to the public service by Turnbull to be secretary of the department of prime minister and cabinet.   In a wide-ranging interview with the Policy Shop podcast, hosted by Glyn Davis, the vice-chancellor of the University of Melbourne, Parkinson says the brutal treatment he experienced had a broader impact. He says Abbott could have achieved the same outcome he wanted to achieve “far more subtly if people had stopped to think about it, and without the damage I think it did to the public service because there were instances after that happened of senior colleagues reporting their staff saying, well I’m not going to put my hand up for a controversial role because this is what happens”. “You follow on the democratically elected, legally mandated directions of the government of the day and you get sacked as a result.” From the tail end of the Howard government, through the Rudd and Gillard periods, Parkinson was prominent in bureaucratic efforts to implement an emissions trading scheme, setting up a climate change department, before returning to the Treasury. Abbott, who was part of the Howard government at the time the then prime minister supported emissions trading, later campaigned vociferously against the so-called carbon “tax”, which was not a tax but a carbon price with a fixed period. Abbott sacked Parkinson after winning the 2013 election, against the advice of senior Liberals, but Parkinson was asked to stay on in Treasury on an interim basis, serving for a further 15 months. He says in the interview he had a “perfectly professional” and “very open and honest” relationship with Abbott, who listened to his advice, sometimes agreeing and sometimes disagreeing. “You couldn’t ask for anything more.” Parkinson said the damage Abbott had caused by the sacking had been subsequently “ameliorated, but there’s no question that for the service as a whole, I think it came as quite a shock”. The departmental head also reflected in the conversation with Davis about the breakdown in consensus over carbon pricing which has plunged the Australian parliament into a decade-long deadlock over climate policy. Parkinson describes “almost a conspiracy of silence between the true believers of climate change and the true deniers of climate change”. “The true believers did not want to talk about adaptation because they felt that that would take away from a focus on mitigation, and the true deniers didn’t want to talk about adaptation because to do so you would have to talk about the fact that climate change was real,” he says. “So the debate became one around the merits of a particular approach to mitigation which was an emissions trading scheme.” Parkinson says the global financial crisis prompted a shift in the position of the business community to carbon pricing. “Suddenly a lot of people in the business community who had been supportive of action on climate change, found themselves in a much more existential situation of trying to save their businesses ... In that environment, they were much more focused on that than on supporting action around climate change. He also reflected on the disruption technology has caused to the media cycle, and how that has affected the public policy debate. Parkinson says in the 1980s journalists had more time to write longer, more analytical pieces about policy debates, which helped inform public debates but “if you look around now, the journalists don’t have the opportunity, they don’t have the time to do those thoughtful pieces”. He says the media cycle is focused on “gotcha” moments and sensationalising routine internal processes. “You begin to try and have a conversation with stakeholders about an issue and all of a sudden the social media campaigns are running either for or against the policy option.” Parkinson says stakeholders now take definitive positions on policy before it is finalised, and the tempo has increased as a consequence “and that makes it much, much harder to do this sort of thoughtful, careful analysis and policy design that in the past we were able to do”. “Now it doesn’t mean it can’t be done, but it means we have to do it in different ways,” he says. “We have to find different groups of trusted interlocutors. We have to find different vehicles in which we can engage. “I’m not sure that we’ve quite found our equilibrium yet. I think it’s still a work in progress.” "
"A large iceberg broke off the Grey glacier in southern Chile, authorities said on Tuesday, adding that the cause of the rupture was unclear.  Chile’s Conaf forestry service shared photos on social media of the enormous block of blue-white ice, which measured 350m (1,148ft) long by 380m (1,247ft) wide, as it floated free in waters of a glacial lagoon near the southern tip of the South American continent.  Park officials at Chile’s Torres del Paine National Park, home to the glacier, said such ruptures were rare and had not occurred since the early 1990s. Dr Ricardo Jaña, glaciologist from the Chilean Antarctic Institute, said the iceberg was bigger than expected. “This is a situation we had anticipated, but the most singular and anecdotal thing is that it is an iceberg of much larger dimensions, which is notable.”  Torres del Paine is one of Chile’s most popular tourist attractions, famous for its mountain views and visited by more than 115,000 tourists annually, according to Conaf. Grey glacier is located in the Southern Patagonian ice field, just west of the Cordillera del Paine. Before dividing in two at its front end, the glacier is 6km wide and more than 30m high.

"The car company BMW has been censured by the UK’s advertising watchdog for claiming an electric car equipped with a small petrol engine was “clean” and “zero emissions”, in a ruling that could have a knock-on effect on other electric car advertising. The advertising was published in the form of a Facebook post that used testimonials from real customers to extol the virtues of the BMW i3. That model is unusual among electric vehicles, as in addition to the electric drive, it also has a small petrol engine. However, unlike “hybrid” cars, which have a petrol-driven engine that can take over from the electric system when it runs out of charge, on longer journeys or at higher speeds, the i3’s petrol engine is only used to maintain the charge on the electric drive.  In the Facebook ad the car was described as “a clean car and helps to give back to the environment”. A complainant suggested that the presence of a petrol engine meant this statement was incorrect. BMW argued that the nature of the petrol engine, in maintaining charge for the electric engine rather than taking over from it when needed, meant its description – which came from a user – was accurate. The Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) took a different view, saying that the petrol engine had an emissions value that could be quantified, and has ordered the advertisement to be withdrawn. The ASA said: “We told BMW to ensure that in future they made clear their environmental claims related to the all-electric vehicles only and not to make environmental claims about their products unless they held sufficient substantiation.” BMW did not respond to the Guardian’s request for comment. The Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders said it did not comment on individual cases, and declined to comment on the broader issues of how “clean” cars can be defined. The question of what constitutes “clean” driving is a vexed one. Electric vehicles produce no emissions at the point of use, but the power they consume does produce greenhouse gases if it comes from fossil fuels, such as coal or gas-fired power stations. This means even the cleanest electric vehicle can only have as little impact on the environment as the electricity grid from which it is powered."

"Scientists have stepped in as environmental matchmakers by breeding baby coral on the Great Barrier Reef in a move that could have worldwide significance. Coral eggs and sperm were collected from Heron Island’s reef during last November’s coral spawning to produce more than a million larvae.  The larvae were returned to the wild and placed on to reef patches in underwater mesh tents, with 100 surviving and growing successfully. The lead project researcher and Southern Cross University professor Peter Harrison, who discovered mass coral spawning in the 1980s, says the “results are very promising”. “The success of this new research not only applies to the Great Barrier Reef, but has potential global significance,” Harrison said. “It may [also] be one of the answers to some of the problems in the Great Barrier Reef. It’s a glimmer of hope.” The project has the ability to restore damaged coral populations and has seen similar success in the Philippines where blast fishing using explosives to kill schools of fish has destroyed coral. The Great Barrier Reef Foundation managing director, Anna Marsden, said the research is an important step for the reef, but one that should not lessen the strong action needed against climate change. “There is much more to be done, but this is definitely a great leap forward for the reef, and for the restoration and repair of reefs worldwide,” she said. “It’s time to be bold and take some calculated risks because that’s the way we’ll make a change in how we can help restore our coral reefs.” The team returned to Heron Island in November to collect further coral eggs and sperm for the next step in the project."
"Matt Bowden, 34, works in the textiles industry. He is from Durham, UK and currently living in Taipei, Taiwan I came across Robert Macfarlane’s article Generation Anthropocene: how humans have altered the planet forever, as part of my MA course last year. It was recommended reading and ignited a deep interest in humans’ impact on the planet, and an impetus to reimagine my relationship with the environment.  Macfarlane explains the term “Anthropocene” as “the new epoch of geological time in which human activity is considered such a powerful influence on the environment, climate and ecology of the planet that it will leave a long-term signature in the strata record”. Many scientists argue that it began in 1950 and continues today. This concept really intrigued me and sparked a fascination that has grown and grown. I studied Chinese and politics for my first degree, having always had a passion for literature and linguistics, and I have been in Asia since I graduated in 2005. In 2012 I moved to Taiwan, where I work for a company that produces knitwear for the US market. I enjoy my work, but a few years into my career I decided I wanted to do something extracurricular that was stimulating and challenging.  So in 2015, I embarked on a distance programme with Nottingham University, studying towards an MA in English Studies with a special focus on ecocriticism – the examination of how nature is portrayed using the written word, and how this portrayal influences human behaviour. It’s a really fascinating area of study, and one about which Macfarlane is hugely knowledgeable. I was introduced to his work during my course, when we were asked to read his book The Wild Places. It had a big impact on me, and I started to read more of his work: Landmarks, an exploration of the language we use to describe nature; Mountains of the Mind, about humans’ fascination with mountains; and soon articles such as this one in the Guardian. This particular piece made a huge splash among environmental academics, but its appearance in a popular newspaper also brought it to the forefront of public consciousness. It struck a chord with me in a way that other literature on climate change had not.  We are living in an epoch defined by nuclear tests and plastic pollution, and having the right terminology to describe this unique, and uniquely horrifying, time feels important. Macfarlane reminds us in no uncertain terms that “among the future fossils of the Anthropocene might be … shampoo bottles and deodorant caps”, combining clear expertise and a rich array of cultural references with a style of writing that is detailed and extremely evocative. Once I had read this piece, it was impossible to unread. Almost like the Anthropocene age itself, it “administered – and will administer – a massive jolt to the imagination”. I immediately shared it with friends and family, made its theme the major focus of my thesis, and began to make changes to my life.  Taiwan has a very throwaway culture, so I began using my own flask when buying coffee, and using metal chopsticks in restaurants instead of disposable ones. I did make some bigger changes too – my family live in the UK and I would like to spend more time with them, but I’m acutely aware of the environmental impact of flying, so now try to do so as little as possible. I surf quite a bit in my spare time, so have helped out with beach cleanups – the beaches in this part of the world have a huge problem with litter.  But we are living through a cataclysmic environmental crisis, and these relatively small changes will not be sufficient to improve matters unless they occur on a global scale.  It can sometimes seem overwhelming to consider how to tackle the present situation but there is cause for optimism if we work together. In the time since completing my course I have got married and become a dad, and thinking about the planet we will bequeath to the next generation feels more pressing than ever."

"Clothes must be designed differently, worn for longer and recycled as much as possible to stop the global fashion industry consuming a quarter of the world’s annual carbon budget by 2050. Fashion designer Stella McCartney condemned her industry as “incredibly wasteful and harmful to the environment” as she joined forces with round-the-world sailor and environmental campaigner Dame Ellen MacArthur to call for a systemic change to the way clothing is produced and used.  In a report published on Tuesday, MacArthur’s foundation exposes the scale of the waste, and how the throwaway nature of fashion has created a business which creates greenhouse emissions of 1.2bn tonnes a year – larger than that of international flights and shipping combined. It warns that “if the industry continues on its current path, by 2050, it could use more than 26% of the carbon budget associated with a 2C pathway.” The report also reveals that:  MacArthur, who gained the support of industry leaders including the C&A Foundation, H&M, and Nike for her report, is calling for a circular textile economy to be created to make fashion more sustainable. The report calls for four actions to be taken: to phase out substances of concern and microfibre release; increase clothing utilisation, for example by the industry supporting and promoting short-term clothing rental businesses; to radically improve recycling; and to move to renewable materials. McCartney said the ideas in the report provided solutions for an industry that was incredibly wasteful and harmful to the environment. “The report … opens up the conversation that will allow us to find a way to work together to better our industry for the future of fashion and for the future of the planet,” she said. MacArthur acknowledged the scale of the challenge to turn around the $2.4tn industry.  “Today’s textile industry is built on an outdated linear, take-make-dispose model and is hugely wasteful and polluting,” said MacArthur. “We need a new textile economy in which clothes are designed differently, worn longer, and recycled and reused much more often.” Figures in the report reveal the throwaway nature of today’s fashion industry, which is based on a faster turnaround model, with more new collections released per year, at lower prices. The report said more than half of “fast” fashion produced is disposed of in less than a year. In the US, clothes are only worn for around a quarter of the global average. The same pattern is emerging in China, where clothing utilisation has decreased by 70% over the last 15 years. Sixty percent of German and Chinese citizens admit to owning more clothes than they need. Globally, customers miss out on $460bn of value each year by throwing away clothes that they could continue to wear. The report said: “The textiles industry relies mostly on non-renewable resources – 98m tonnes in total per year – including oil to produce synthetic fibres, fertilisers to grow cotton, and chemicals to produce, dye, and finish fibres and textiles. “Textiles production (including cotton farming) also uses around 93bn cubic metres of water annually, contributing to problems in some water-scarce regions. “With its low rates of utilisation … and low levels of recycling, the current wasteful, linear system is the root cause of this massive and ever expanding pressure on resources.” Clothing production has nearly doubled in the last 15 years, and the growth is not just confined to the west. “Demand for clothing is continuing to grow quickly, driven particularly by emerging markets, such as Asia and Africa,” the report said. “Should growth continue as expected, total clothing sales would reach 160m tonnes in 2050 – more than three times today’s amount.” Greg Stanton, the mayor of Phoenix, Arizona, who is endorsing the report, said his city was attempting to create a circular economy out of textile waste: “Each year more than 18,000 tonnes of textiles find their way into … waste and recycling streams. Our city is working on creative solutions to redirect textiles from the waste stream … as a valuable resource, to ultimately stimulate the local economy.” In east London, Cyndi Rhoades, founder of WornAgain, is working on the development of a new technology to separate and recapture polyester and cotton from textiles to be reintroduced back into the supply chain as new, raw materials.  She said: “We already have enough clothing and textiles in existence today to satisfy our annual demand of new raw materials for new clothing – all we have to do is make sure it doesn’t end up in the bin, and processes like ours are scaled as rapidly as possible.”"
"The climate change talks in Bonn have now wrapped up with little firm action. Next year they move to Poland. But whatever is discussed or agreed in European cities over the coming years, the answers to climate change will not come from the west (beyond a few technological tweaks), but Asia.  Climate change is the most striking example of the unintended consequences of an unsustainable economic model. It is predicted that some regions, such as Asia’s Indus valley, will be too hot to live in by 2100. Coastal megacities are threatened by rising sea levels. Common resources – land, food, water and forests, among others – are already strained. Climate change will upend agriculture, making food security a major issue for hundreds of millions at a time when arable land is in decline. But climate change is far from the only example of what is wrong with our model of development. Air pollution levels in Delhi were so high over the weekend that an international cricket match was halted, with players reported to be “continuously vomiting”. The west isn’t going to sort this out. Its democracies face huge difficulties when confronted by the need for unpopular decisions that dramatically shift lifestyles and mean people must give up privileges such as car and air travel that they have taken for granted. Perhaps inevitably, western politicians prefer to seek solutions through market mechanisms and technological “innovations”. When it comes to the future of the planet, decisions in Beijing, New Delhi, Jakarta and Lagos will be more important than those taken in Washington or Brussels. With the dual challenges of growth and sustainability, Asian governments face a unique challenge. They have large and increasing populations that are still poor, with a majority still lacking secure access to the basic rights of life: a minimum standard of living that includes a safe and secure food supply, clean water, permanent housing, adequate sanitation and access to energy. Yet they can’t improve their standards of living in the resource-intensive way western countries did. To do so would be to invite catastrophe. Their common resources are strained and the biosphere is stressed – a situation that, as science makes clear, will only get worse. It is true that Asia is very diverse. A solution in South Korea or Singapore will look very different to what is pursued in poorer Cambodia or Myanmar, or middle-income Malaysia. But all Asian governments must, in the coming decades, find ways to sustainably manage resources to ensure their populations – current and future – have access to them. They need to develop solutions that move away from what the west believes to be the standard. They need to put more focus on collective welfare over individual rights. They need to manage expectations so as to avoid overconsumption and waste. So how is Asia doing so far? October’s Chinese Communist party congress provided reason for cautious optimism. One thing in President Xi Jinping’s three-hour keynote speech stood out: his redefinition of China’s “principal contradiction”. For Deng Xiaoping, widely regarded as the father of modern China, this contradiction was between the nation’s needs and its overall lack of development. Xi now describes it as the tension between “unbalanced and inadequate development and the people’s ever growing needs for a better life”. In this, Xi signalled a move away from a policy of development at all costs towards something more balanced. This is an approach the other large nations of Asia, such as India and Indonesia, should take note of. Until now, the continent’s imbalanced model of development has been based on prioritising growth in the cities over development in the countryside. Many large Asian cities are becoming intolerable places to live because of congestion, density and heat. Inequality has also increased. And as Asia seeks to embrace modernity – which, in practice, means adopting many aspects of western lifestyles – it risks losing its own culture and traditions, which underpin age-old values and have helped maintain social cohesion over centuries. From massive solar schemes to decades-long reforestation projects designed to hold back the desert across the western part of China and inner Mongolia (the Great Green Wall of trees is aided by a solar power station), the Chinese government is leading the fight. Vietnam too has taken steps towards sustainability, investing in rural irrigation to increase rice yields. In the Philippines, President Duterte has taken a hard line against the excesses and poor regulatory oversight of the mining industry, despite resistance from powerful lobby groups. Singapore is a much smaller and wealthier example, yet despite its “free market” reputation it routinely takes wide-ranging action to ensure that housing, healthcare and other social services are provided universally. Nor is Singapore scared to make aggressive interventions that would be decried as socialist in parts of the west: the government announced in October that it would put a hard limit on the number of cars in the city. These countries need to go much further in developing new economic models if the world’s resources are to be sustained. But Asian governments must not act alone. The region has several international organisations and blocs that can encourage the sharing of ideas. Developing nations must be given room to find alternatives by the mainly western-led international rule-making organisations, and must not be lectured by western leaders who have no experience in dealing with these challenges. But most importantly, Asian policymakers and business leaders must start to take the lead, and stop being subservient to western ideas about progress. • Chandran Nair is the author of Consumptionomics: Asia’s Role in Reshaping Capitalism and Saving the Planet"
"The world’s nations were confident they were making important progress in turning continued political commitment into real world action, as the global climate change summit in Bonn was drawing to a close on Friday. The UN talks were tasked with the vital, if unglamorous, task of converting the unprecedented global agreement sealed in Paris in 2015 from a symbolic moment into a set of rules by which nations can combine to defeat global warming. Currently, the world is on track for at least 3C of global warming – a catastrophic outcome that would lead to severe impacts around the world.  The importance of the task was emphasised by Frank Bainimarama, Fiji’s prime minister and president of the summit: “We are not simply negotiating words on a page, but we are representing all our people and the places they call home.”  The Paris rulebook, which must be finalised by the end of 2018, now has a skeleton: a set of headings relating to how action on emissions is reported and monitored. Nations have also fleshed this out with suggested detailed texts, but these are often contradictory and will need to be resolved next year. “The worst outcome would have been to end up with empty pages, but that is not going to happen,” said a German negotiator. One issue that did flare up during talks was the action being taken by rich nations before the Paris deal kicks in in 2020. Developing nations argued not enough is being done and, with the UN climate negotiations running largely on trust, the issue became unexpectedly serious before being defused by commitments to a “stocktake” of action in 2018 and 2019.  The final hours of the negotiations were held up by a technical row over climate funding from rich nations, always a sensitive topic. Poorer and vulnerable nations want donor countries to set out in advance how much they will provide and when, so recipient nations can plan their climate action. Rich nations claim they are not unwilling, but that making promises on behalf of future governments is legally complex. Progress in raising the importance of gender, indigenous peoples and agriculture in tackling climate change was made. But NGOs criticised slow progress in delivering previous funding promises. Raijeli Nicole, from Oxfam, said: “For the most part, rich countries showed up to Bonn empty-handed.”  Coal – the dirtiest fossil fuel – has had a high profile at the summit, with the US administration’s only official side-event controversially promoting “clean coal”. But the overwhelming momentum has been against the fuel, with a new coalition of countries pledging a complete phaseout. This happened outside the negotiations, a significant move, according to Camilla Born at thinktank E3G: “We have had the Paris agreement living in the real world.” Poland, which is heavily dependent on coal, is hosting the next UN climate summit in a year’s time and has frequently held up climate action in the EU. But on Friday, apparently under heavy EU pressure, it ended its hold-out against passing a climate commitment called the Doha amendment which sets in law pre-2020 climate action.  Germany, however, has been unable to commit to phasing out its huge coal industry, because Angela Merkel’s talks to form a new coalition have run over time. Nonetheless, Barbara Hendricks, the out-going German environment minister, said on Friday: “The phasing out of coal makes sense environmentally and economically.” She was certain the new government would act, she said. US president Donald Trump’s decision to pull the US out of the Paris deal has had little impact at the talks, according to negotiators, who say US officials have been neutral and not blocked anything. Gebru Jember Endalew, the Ethiopian chair of the 47-strong Least Developed Countries negotiating bloc, said: “Unlike immigration, you cannot protect your country from climate change by building a wall.” Other big powers, such as China and India, have not used the US move to try to gain extra advantage but remain constructive players, insiders say. Last minute hitches in closing the Bonn summit remain possible but are not expected by the delegates. Instead the attention now moves to 2018 and the tougher, final decisions that need to be made then. Manuel Pulgar-Vidal, who as Peru’s environment minister ran the 2014 climate talks and is now at WWF, said: “The planet is at a crossroads. The decisions we make today set the foundation for 2018 and beyond. Countries must increase their ambition to put us on a path to a 1.5C future.” “The Poland summit [in 2018] will be tough,” he said. “We expect to make progress, but it is not going to be easy.”  Laurence Tubiana, France’s climate ambassador during the Paris deal and now at the European Climate Foundation, said: “There is no time to rest on our laurels, we are not on track. If we are serious about tackling climate change, everyone will need to step up and put forward ambitious climate commitments between now and 2020.”"
"Since taking office, Donald Trump has pulled the United States out of the Paris climate agreement, rolled back numerous protections against environmental pollution and espoused coal as the fuel of the future, all in the name of job creation and ending what he sees as the “theft of American prosperity”.  Yet the big businesses he claims to champion are increasingly choosing to ignore the US president’s sceptical stance on climate change and press ahead towards their own environmental goals without him. Several of the country’s corporate giants, including Walmart, General Motors, Ford and Mars, appeared this week at the second annual Companies v Climate Change conference in Miami to showcase their progress and reinforce their belief that sustainability and other green targets can be achieved irrespective of the policies and purpose of the White House.  “We were disappointed [the] US pulled out of Paris, but what’s so great is what companies can do to make a difference,” said Zach Freeze, senior director for strategic initiatives in sustainability at Walmart, the first retailer to announce science-based targets for emissions reductions and a key signatory to the We Are Still In declaration that followed Trump’s Paris withdrawal. “We all have a lot we can do and should do, it’s becoming more and more of an imperative. We’ve been working on this for a long time, prior to this administration [and] we’re thinking about 10 years from now where we’re going to be. Regardless of what’s happening, this is something we believe in. If we do it the right way we will see progress.” Walmart, which claims 260 million customers per week worldwide, and employs 1.4 million workers in the US alone, earlier this year announced its Project Gigaton initiative that aims to reduce CO2 emissions globally by one billion metric tons before 2050. Other companies at the conference in Miami – a poignant venue following flooding from Hurricane Irma in September and the threat of obliteration from sea-level rise within the next century – touted their own achievements in defiance of Trump’s climate stance. For example, General Motors’ purchase of 200 megawatts of wind energy for its Ohio and Illinois plants achieves 20% of its target to use only renewable energy sources by 2050. Confectionery giant Mars, meanwhile, has launched a $1bn sustainability plan, targeting a 70% reduction in greenhouse gases. For Jason Youner, chief executive and founder of Companies v Climate Change, it is further proof that green-thinking American businesses are filling the environmental void created by the Trump administration’s cynicism. “The corporate sector is not paying heed to the president’s agenda. They’re making all kinds of commitments and they’re putting all kinds of policies in place and changing the way they operate and do business and making a lot of improvements,” he said. “The message is one of optimism and hope. The president can only do so much, he’s full of bluster and likes to talk a lot and kind of exaggerates his influence. The companies are seeing they can take the lead and influence what happens on the ground, so there’s hope and optimism. Companies around the world are moving forward and not letting this one rogue administration hold them back.” Alana Libow, director of sustainable development for Danone, a signatory to We Are Still In and whose Evian bottled water brand business in North America has been certified carbon neutral by the Carbon Trust, believes companies can turn the political debate to their advantage as their customers and shareholders demand more environmentally friendly practices. “It’s an incredible opportunity in an ironic sense, because business always plays a tremendous role in the actions we all take in our social responsibility,” she said. “It only highlights the opportunity and importance for business. Danone was founded on a dual commitment to our shareholders and society, way before we got into the worlds of sustainable development, corporate responsibility, being green. It’s a moment of highlight, nothing has changed in our business and we continue moving along and being a leader in the space.” Still more can be done by the corporate world, some conference attendees believe. Nicole Labutong, technical manager at CDP, a disclosure and advisory group for businesses, pointed out that only 325 companies from tens of thousands with stated environmental goals had set science-based targets. “Science is true whether you believe it or not. It’s up to non-state actors to do their part, say you’re ‘still in’ and make up for governments that might not believe in science,” she said."
"Which story did you hear more about this year – how climate change makes disasters like hurricanes worse, or how Donald Trump threw paper towels at Puerto Ricans? If you answered the latter, you have plenty of company. Academic Jennifer Good analyzed two weeks of hurricane coverage during the height of hurricane season on eight major TV networks, and found that about 60% of the stories included the word Trump, and only about 5% mentioned climate change.  Trump doesn’t just suck the oxygen out of the room; he sucks the carbon dioxide out of the national dialogue. Even in a year when we’ve had string of hurricanes, heatwaves, and wildfires worthy of the Book of Revelation – just what climate scientists have told us to expect – the effect of climate change on extreme weather has been dramatically undercovered. Some of Trump’s tweets generate more national coverage than devastating disasters. Good’s analysis lines up with research done by my organization, Media Matters for America, which found that TV news outlets gave far too little coverage to the well-documented links between climate change and hurricanes. ABC and NBC both completely failed to bring up climate change during their news coverage of Harvey, a storm that caused the heaviest rainfall ever recorded in the continental US. When Irma hit soon after, breaking the record for hurricane intensity, ABC didn’t do much better. Coverage was even worse of Hurricane Maria, the third hurricane to make landfall in the US this year. Not only did media outlets largely fail to cover the climate connection; in many cases, they largely failed to cover the hurricane itself.  The weekend after Maria slammed into Puerto Rico, the five major Sunday political talkshows devoted less than one minute in total to the storm and the humanitarian emergency it triggered. And Maria got only about a third as many mentions in major print and online media outlets as did Harvey and Irma, researchers at the MIT Media Lab found. When Trump visited Puerto Rico on 3 October, almost two weeks after Maria assailed the island, he got wall-to-wall coverage as journalists reported on his paper-towel toss and other egregious missteps. But after that trip, prime-time cable news coverage of Puerto Rico’s recovery plummeted, Media Matters found, even though many residents to this day suffer from electricity outages and a lack of clean water, a dire situation that deserves serious and sustained coverage. Scientists have been telling us that climate change will make hurricanes more intense and dangerous, an unfortunate reality made all too clear by this year’s record-busting hurricane season. “These are precisely the sort of things we expect to happen as we continue to warm the planet,” climate scientist Michael Mann, a distinguished professor of atmospheric science at Penn State, told Huffington Post. But while nearly three-quarters of Americans know that most scientists are in agreement that climate change is happening, according to recent poll, only 42% of Americans believe climate change will pose a serious threat to them during their lifetimes. Too many still believe – wrongly – that climate disasters are just something that will happen in the future. They are happening now.  In the first nine months of 2017, the US was assailed by 15 weather and climate disasters that each did more than a billion dollars in damage – in the case of the hurricanes, much more. The combined economic hit from Harvey, Irma and Maria could end up being $200bn or more, according to Moody’s Analytics. And then in October, unprecedented wildfires in northern California did an estimated $3bn in damage.  Climate change can be hard to see and intuitively grasp. It’s a relatively slow-moving scientific phenomenon caused by pollution from all around the globe. It’s not usually dramatic to watch like a candidate debate or the fallout from a White House scandal.  But an extreme weather event is a moment when people can see and feel climate change – and if they’re unlucky, get seriously hurt by it. When those disasters happen, media outlets need to cover them as climate change stories. And when a number of them happen in quick succession, as they did this year, the media have an even greater responsibility to report the big-picture story about climate change and help the public understand the immediacy of the threat.  If we are to fend off the worst possible outcomes of climate change, we need to shift as quickly as possible to a cleaner energy system. We could expect more Americans to get on board with that solution if they more fully understood the problem – and that’s where the critical role of the media comes in. As the weather gets worse, we need our journalism to get better. "

"There are moments in history that come to define the world changing. After years or even decades of doing things a certain way, suddenly, everything changes. We look back, often in bemusement, shame or anger, and wonder how people accepted a certain way of doing things.  Changes once fiercely resisted become archaic: corporal punishment in schools, slavery, women and Aboriginal people denied the right to vote, the death penalty, LGBTIQ people denied the right to marry, the institutionalisation of people with disabilities … the list goes on.   Smart leaders who are at the right place at the right time, sense the zeitgeist, capture a nation’s hopes and dreams and catapult themselves into the history books as the personification of that change. Visionary leaders look to the future, wonder what we’ll reflect back on in 30 to 50 years and take the first steps on an alternative path. Our world is undergoing a once in a generation period of significant disruption to the status quo.  The “trickle down” neoliberal economy that replaced the welfare-state economy has the stench of decay. Wealth is not trickling down: the rich and powerful have structured our economy so that the fruits of our collective efforts are concentrated in the hands of fewer and fewer people. Extreme inequality is a major factor causing people to turn to the old gods of blood (race) and soil (nationalism). But a “wellbeing” state that puts people and planet at its heart could trump the nationalists. Public concern about the environment and climate damage, combined with technological progress, means the writing is on the wall for coal and big polluters.  The US dominance as a superpower is waning as China is becoming more powerful (economically, diplomatically and militarily). Global tension is rising and economic power is shifting to three of the four most populous countries on earth: China, India and Indonesia as well as Japan.  These are just a few of the major global challenges and opportunities confronting us. A smart government would grasp the future and get ahead of the curve. Yet on Thursday, the government released a foreign policy white paper that desperately clings to the past while the rest of the world moves on. Its primary focus is terrorism, trade and Trump (even if it doesn’t mention him by name).  Security gets 207 mentions, inequality gets 8. Trade gets 182 mentions, poverty 29. Terrorism gets 40 mentions, climate change 29.  It sidelines the almost 9,000 people who wrote individual submissions with consistent messages that climate change, inequality and poverty should be foreign policy priorities, and that Australian aid is a key tool to help deliver a fairer world.  The foreign policy white paper should encapsulate the kind of world we want to live in and the role Australia can play in helping to realise that vision. Instead, it paints a bleak picture for our future world and Australia’s part in it. The Campaign for Australian Aid has released its own “People’s White Paper” report called One Humanity, which is a starting point for a conversation about our changing world. A nation blessed with abundant sun, land, waves and wind and with Pacific neighbours facing raising oceans should be leading the world on renewables and action on climate damage.  A nation with the geographical advantage of China, India and Japan on our doorstep should be crafting a more independent foreign policy.  The nation of the “fair go” ought to be championing reducing economic and gender inequality, including domestic policies and global pressure to ensure corporations pay fair taxes and living wages, wherever they operate.  A nation with aspirations to have a meaningful role in shaping the world for the better ought to be significantly increasing aid and ensuring that aid is used to advance the global sustainable development goals and tackle poverty. Most Australians recognise the need for change and don’t like the way this country is headed. What we need now is a prime minister who’s ready to listen."
"That Charles and David Koch are putting $650m into Meredith Corp’s purchase of Time would ordinarily be cause for great soul-searching in media. But these are not ordinary times. Meredith’s Koch-backed deal with Time – which owns, in addition to Time magazine, titles including People, Fortune and Sports Illustrated – was sealed Sunday night. Meredith said in a statement announcing the deal that they are building “a premier media company serving nearly 200 million American consumers.” Observers of Koch Industries, a longtime supporter of libertarian and conservative causes, especially generous with funding for climate denial through thinktanks and research groups, say more than business is at stake. The Kochs are billionaire US brothers noted for their control of oil-and-gas giant Koch Industries, the second-largest privately owned US company – and for their anti-regulatory politics. Charles and David Koch (pronounced ""coke"") head up the $115bn company, and are well known for their quiet financial support of conservative causes, through such groups as Americans for Prosperity, a key player in the Tea Party movement. They share the No 8 spot in Forbes' list of the world's richest people. The brothers inherited the company from their father, Fred Koch – who made his fortune in the 1930s building oil refineries for the Soviet Union under Joseph Stalin – and grew it into a multinational giant that now includes a broad array of consumer products, such as paper towels. David Koch, New York City's richest resident (ahead of Rupert Murdoch and former mayor Michael Bloomberg), was the libertarian vice-presidential nominee in 1980. He has also been a major donor to the arts, giving $100m to a prominent New York ballet theater. The billionaire brothers have long sought to influence public opinion on energy and climate change, pouring hundreds of millionsinto universities, non-profits, thinktanks and political campaigns. But this week marked their first foray into publishing when, through their private equity arm, Koch Equity Development, they provided Meredith Corp with a $650m cash boost in its purchase of Time Inc. “It’s a very proper business decision – a cheap way to wield even more political influence,” said Bill McKibben, a former New Yorker writer and key figure in the environmental movement as founder of the group 350.org. “The return on investment on their political work is off the charts, I fear.” At first glance, the oil and gas giant’s reason for backing the bid by Meredith is not readily apparent. Sure, the Kochs have appeared on the Time 100 list – in 2011, 2014 and 2015 – and David Koch has lunched with the magazine’s former editor. But what kind of money-minded mogul would pivot to print in 2017 – and to Time, of all places? “Time magazine doesn’t move the needle on anything any more,” said Jay Rosen, a journalism professor at New York University. “It just doesn’t make a lot of sense to me. Unless they want to influence the Fortune 500 rankings or something.” As a spokesman put it to a media reporter recently, Koch Industries, the second-largest private company in the US, virtually all of which is co-owned by the brothers, “has a longstanding policy of not commenting on deals” — and this latest infusion of cash to Meredith from their private equity arm, Koch Equity Development, is no exception to that rule. But at least some of what the brothers have poured money into over the years is a matter of public record. The Kochs have, for instance, spent hundreds of millions on not-for-profit organizations, universities, advocacy groups and political campaigns. Though payback on donations is perceptible only through influence, in Time, they would also have an asset. Charles Alexander, whose decades-long career at Time magazine culminated in 13 years as its science editor, isn’t the least bit puzzled. He is, however, very afraid. What’s concerning about the Kochs’ interest, according to Alexander, is not that they are conservative. Time’s founder, Henry Luce, was conservative. What Alexander is worried about is a much more recent affliction of the Republican party: its systematic denial of the science underlying climate change and how that presaged a larger skepticism of science and facts in general. “For decades, the Kochs’ ‘dark money’, as the New Yorker’s Jane Mayer called it, has financed a campaign of disinformation designed to convince the public and politicians that climate change is nothing to worry about,” Alexander wrote in the Nation on Wednesday. Now, the Kochs may be poised to extend its reach directly into the editorial pages. Time in its heyday was a sort of canary in the coal mine on climate, devoting cover stories and special issues to the matter long before such coverage was considered standard fare. More recently, as Republican leaders have come to regard climate change as fake science, Time’s commitment has slipped. Under the Kochs’ influence, might it disappear completely – and what, exactly, is to be done about it anyway? “I confess I don’t know what the solution is,” Alexander concluded, “but it is perverse and dangerous for two billionaires with no commitment to factual truth to be permitted to buy a magazine that has been a voice for reason and use it to further their narrow business interests.” Like much of print news, Time’s decline is readily apparent. Yet it may be precisely that diminished status that makes it desirable to the media-shy Kochs. The last time the billionaire brothers weighed a foray into print was in 2013, through the potential purchase of the Tribune Company’s eight newspapers – including such flagships as the Los Angeles Times, the Chicago Tribune and the Baltimore Sun. Amid a wave of protests, the effort was scuttled. Scott Peterson of the watchdog group Checks and Balances Project said another reason the Kochs were able to keep a comparatively low profile in the Time bid was because they did not seek a complete takeover. Meredith said in its statement Sunday that Koch Equity Development would not have a seat on its board of directors and would “have no influence on Meredith’s editorial or managerial operations”. “If they tried a complete takeover, that might raise questions in Congress, but if they’re just making an investment, no matter how large, if it’s below 50%, then they’re just a passive investor and who’s going to stop that?” said Peterson. “That is, until they move for full control.” That was what happened in 2012 when Koch Industries bought a minority interest (around 45%) in Guardian Industries, a Michigan-based glass, automotive and building products company. Earlier this year, they completed the acquisition. Per Koch Industries policy, the terms were not discussed. The Kochs do not simply give money, Peterson noted. Even charitable donations often come with strings attached. “I would find it kind of surprising if the Kochs simply made a quiet investment and then went on their way and watched their stock,” he said. Koch’s role in the acquiring of Time comes amid the most aggressive environmental rollbacks since the Reagan presidency: business interests at a recent meeting put on by the Heartland Institute free-market thinktank were “giddy” and “thrilled”. This is also a time when the Trump administration seems intent on developing friendly media entities. This month, the Federal Communications Commission eliminated protections against monopolies in local broadcast news, a move widely seen as clearing the way for the expansion of a Trump-friendly local broadcasting network. Because the US does not regulate the printed press in the manner seen in the UK, for example, there were no such protections to be overridden with regard to the Time deal. The Center for Media and Democracy’s Mary Bottari told the Guardian she considered it “a smart move” on Koch’s part. “The only way they can convince the public not to worry their heads about climate change and to forget about regulating the fossil fuel industry is to create their own media megaphone,” said Bottari. The Trump administration has demonstrated something of a penchant for giving bigger megaphones to interests it deems its own. The man behind Sinclair Media Group, the local broadcaster for whose expansion Trump’s regulatory body recently cleared the way, is David Smith, a man whose history of donations and coverage would certainly pass a Trump loyalty test. Rupert Murdoch, whose long association with Trump was once thought to be chilly, has more recently kindled something of a bromance with him, a love affair apparent everywhere from Fox News to the Wall Street Journal. Now the Kochs may be poised to become the newest conservative media moguls. And though Trump has demonstrated something of a fixation with Time’s annual “person of the year” award, their coziness appears to be less with Trump than with his vice-president, Mike Pence. Pence has received more traceable campaign donations from David Koch than any other candidate, including $200,000 to Pence and a running mate when Pence ran for governor of Indiana in 2012 and $100,000 to Pence individually in 2016, before he was plucked for the vice-presidency. That doesn’t include funding from other sources, such as the Republican Gubernatorial Campaign Committee, which can legally be hidden. Their relationship, as chronicled in a recent piece by Mayer – whose writing in the New Yorker helped make the Koch brothers a household name – runs deep. Pence did the Kochs a valuable political favor in the spring of 2009 when, in light of a congressional push to curb carbon emissions, he signed on to help push the Koch-backed “no climate tax pledge”. Congress’s bill on “cap and trade”, a concept dreamed up by conservative Reagan-era economists, would have incurred catastrophic costs to Koch Industries.  Since then, they have grown closer still. By 2011, Pence was said to lead Charles Koch’s shortlist of potential presidential candidates. And though the elder Koch presumably had to settle for second best with Pence as VP, it hasn’t worked out so badly so far. Whatever happens with the Time deal, the Kochs’ optimism appears warranted. Pence is the one White House official whom a drama-loving president can’t fire.  “They definitely play the long game and I don’t think that their game is the Trump administration,” Peterson said. “While people watch the Trump circus, the Koch brothers just get stronger.” In the end, the Kochs’ return on any move into media will not be measured by Time’s bottom line. It will be measured by that of their own company – and by the progress of their ideological agenda."
"Video footage captured in Canada’s Arctic has offered a devastating look at the impact climate change is having on polar bears in the region, showing an emaciated bear clinging to life as it scrounged for food on iceless land. The scene was recorded by the conservation group Sea Legacy during a late summer expedition in Baffin Island. “My entire Sea Legacy team was pushing through their tears and emotions while documenting this dying polar bear,” photographer Paul Nicklen wrote on social media after publishing the footage this week.  The video shows the bear struggling to walk as it searches for food. The bear eventually comes across a trashcan used by Inuit fishermen, rummaging through it with little luck. The bear, which was not old, probably died within hours of being captured on video, said Nicklen. “This is what starvation looks like. The muscles atrophy. No energy. It’s a slow, painful death.”  The film-makers drew a direct line between the bear’s state and climate change. “As temperatures rise and sea ice melts, polar bears lose access to the main staple of their diets – seals,” the video noted. “Starving, and running out of energy, they are forced to wander into human settlements for any source of food.” The association echoed a 2015 study from the International Union for the Conservation of Nature that ranked climate change as the single most important threat to the world’s 26,000 polar bears. Researchers – who described the bears as the canary in the coal mine – found a high probability that the population would decrease 30% by 2050 due to the changes in their sea ice habitat.  As climate change boosts Arctic temperatures, sea ice – crucial to the bears for hunting, resting and breeding – is melting earlier in spring and refreezing later in autumn. The growing number of ice-free days could push the species past a tipping point with widespread reproductive failure and starvation in some areas, the report noted. Satellite data published last year revealed that the number of ice-covered days across the 19 Arctic regions inhabited by polar bears declined at a rate of seven to 19 days per decade between 1979 to 2014.  Since posting the footage, Nicklen has been asked why he and his team did not help the bear. “Of course, that crossed my mind,” he told National Geographic. “But it’s not like I walk around with a tranquilizer gun or 400 pounds of seal meat.” Feeding polar bears is also illegal in Canada.  “There was no saving this individual bear,” he noted on social media. Instead he highlighted the threat facing the species as a whole, which has become emblematic of the ravages of climate change. “The simple truth is this – if the Earth continues to warm, we will lose bears and entire polar ecosystems.”"
"I’ve been gripped by the story of Antarctic ‘ice cliff instability’ ever since Rob DeConto and Dave Pollard published their controversial predictions last year. They suggested disintegration of ice shelves caused by global warming could leave behind coastal ice cliffs so tall they would be unstable, crumbling endlessly into the ocean and causing rapid, sustained sea level rise.  I’m glad Eric Holthaus is writing about an impact of climate change that is both certain (seas will rise around the world, no matter what we do) and incredibly important (we must adapt). I’m sympathetic to his concerns about the future. But I think his article is too pessimistic: that it overstates the possibility of disaster. Too soon, too certain.  I’ll admit my fascination is personal. In late 2015, Catherine Ritz and I co-led a study about the future of Antarctica, and our predictions – though definitely bad news – were far less dire. So what evidence do we have that the Antarctic ice sheet could, or would, collapse this century?  First, it’s important to map out what is known. Yes, the Antarctic ice sheet is vulnerable to global warming. Not because it will melt in the warm air like an ice cube, but because the ice shelves around the coastlines act as bracing for the glaciers. When the surface of an ice shelf melts it can disintegrate, and the flow of ice into the oceans can speed up: we saw this for Larsen B in 2002. Our greenhouse gas emissions make this more likely.  Yes, scientists have proposed that disintegration of ice shelves could trigger two types of ‘instability’ that may have caused the ‘marine’ parts of the Antarctic ice sheet (lying on bedrock below sea level) to drastically reduce in the past, raising sea levels by several metres. Confusingly, these are named ‘marine ice sheet instability’ and ‘marine ice cliff instability’. Broadly speaking, both are based around the idea that the thicker the edge of the ice sheet, the faster ice can be lost into the oceans. Both may be ‘positive feedbacks’: in other words, self-sustaining. The marine parts of the ice sheet are thicker in the middle than at the edges, so once these proposed instabilities started, they would keep going until they ran out of ice. As Eric says, this would be over three metres worth of sea level rise. Yes, one instability may already be happening. In 2014, new evidence suggested marine ice sheet instability may be underway in the Amundsen Sea area, forty years after it was first predicted. But Eric is wrong to say Antarctica’s ‘ice budget’ has tipped out of balance due to our burning of fossil fuels. Not only has it been out of balance before – such as the ancient West Antarctic collapse that causes concern – but the reason for the Amundsen Sea changes, where most ice is being lost, is that the ring of deep warm water around Antarctica has welled up onto the continental shelf and is melting the ice from underneath. We don’t know if human activities made this more likely. As far as I know, scientists agree the basic theory of marine ice cliff instability by Jeremy Bassis and Catherine Walker is sound (it’s a shame Catherine’s joint contribution to that key 2011 paper wasn’t mentioned). Ice is not strong enough to form a sheer cliff taller than about 100 m above the water line. And indeed, we don’t see any ice cliffs taller than this, which gives us indirect evidence their calculations are correct. We also have the recent study led by Matthew Wise of marks left by the keels of ancient icebergs, scraping along the bedrock like heavy ships, which point towards this kind of cliff collapse in the distant past. But there is little consensus in the scientific community about how this ice cliff instability could behave. That’s because there is a big leap from identifying a potential problem and predicting the real world consequences. Iceberg scrape marks, though important, can’t tell us how soon, how fast, or for how long. Rob DeConto and Dave Pollard have been the first to put their heads above the parapet, but others may come to different conclusions. Ted Scambos mentioned ‘piles of icebergs’ acting as new ice shelves. Could cold freshwater from melted icebergs also slow things down? Could cliffs partially, instead of catastrophically, crumble? Would a model with finer detail predict fewer tall cliffs? Eric describes the collapse rate as conservative compared with Jakobshavn in Greenland, but this compares apples with oranges: the rapid ice losses from that great glacier are mostly due to its unusually fast speed, rather than the rate of retreat of the ice edge.  Just as important is the initial trigger: how sensitive are the ice shelves to global warming? In Rob and Dave’s study, they disintegrated fast and early: predictions by others are less pessimistic. Eric compounds this by describing their highest scenario as ‘business as usual’, but it’s really business-worse-than-usual. Under current policies we’re headed for less warming than this scenario, and if national pledges under the Paris agreement are carried out this would decrease the warming more (though not meeting the two degree target). Even Rob and Dave had a huge range of predictions for that very high scenario – anything from 30 cm sea level fall to nearly two metres rise – and they originally described their model as ‘speculative’. So it’s not justified to use such strong, certain phrases as ‘the destruction would be unstoppable’. I was particularly concerned about some of the implied time scales and impacts. That ‘slowly burying every shoreline…creating hundreds of millions of climate refugees…could play out in a mere 20 to 50 years’ (it could begin then, but would take far longer). That ‘the full 11 feet’ could be unlocked by 2100 (Rob and Dave predicted the middle of next century). That cities will be ‘wiped off the map’ (we will adapt, because the costs of protecting coastlines are predicted to be far less than those of flooding). We absolutely should be concerned about climate risks, and reduce them. But black-and-white thinking and over-simplification don’t help with risk management, they hinder.  Is “the entire scientific community [in] emergency mode”? We are cautious, and trying to learn more. Climate prediction is a strange game. It takes decades to test our predictions, so society must make decisions with the best evidence but always under uncertainty. I understand why a US-based climate scientist would feel particularly pessimistic. But we have to take care not to talk about the apocalypse as if it were inevitable. "
"Climate change is creating a disaster on Australia’s doorstep, with environmental degradation and the demand for sustainable sources of food undermining stability in some countries, especially “fragile states”, according to the Australian government’s first foreign policy white paper in more than a decade. The new white paper, released on Thursday, contains warnings over the disruptive effects of climate change in Australia’s immediate region, noting that many small island states will be “severely affected in the long term”, and the coming decade will see increased need for disaster relief.  The white paper notes the demand for water and food will rise, with the world’s oceans and forests under intense pressure. It notes climate change and pressure on the environment could contribute to conflict and irregular migration, impacting specifically on Australia’s economic interests. Despite the obvious challenges for Australia and the world posed by Donald Trump’s presidency, and a live debate in this country about whether Australia needs to rethink the American alliance, the white paper makes a strong case for the United States to remain engaged in the region to counterbalance China’s increasingly assertive posture. It notes that the postwar alliance with the US “is central to Australia’s security and sits at the core of our strategic and defence planning”. While the white paper makes the case that it is in Australia’s interests to pursue a cooperative relationship with China, it contains language critical of China’s military posturing. It characterises the disputes that have emerged in the South China Sea as “a major fault line in the regional order”. “Australia is particularly concerned by the unprecedented pace and scale of China’s activities,” the paper says. “Australia opposes the use of disputed features and artificial structures in the South China Sea for military purposes. “Elsewhere in the region, Australia is concerned about the potential for the use of force or coercion in the East China Sea and Taiwan Strait.” With strategic tensions in the region on the rise, the white paper foreshadows a more activist Australian engagement with the democracies of the Indo-Pacific, meaning Japan, India, Indonesia and Korea – and more active support for the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (Asean) countries, where China is attempting to assert diplomatic dominance. It also underscores the “grave and growing” threat posed by North Korea, characterising the behaviour of the Pyongyang regime as the most immediate security challenge for the region – while referencing the ongoing global threat from terrorism and insurgencies. Australia has been active in countering Isis-linked militants in the southern Philippines. The white paper also references the political challenges of the age, charting rising anti-globalisation and populist sentiment. “Doubts about openness has grown, as have concerns about the effect of globalisation, mainly immigration, on cultural identity and social cohesion”. It notes that politics in some countries has become more fragmented and “volatile”, with nationalism and protectionist sentiment on the rise, with global governance and the rules-based order now contested. It notes that a more inward-looking world is a world less likely to rise collectively to meet collective security challenges. “We will be living in a more contested and competitive world,” the foreign affairs minister, Julie Bishop, said Thursday. “Technological advances will disrupt the way we live and work and interact. There will be shifts in relative power between nations and the international rules-based order will continue to be challenged by some nations seeking short-term gain.” She said Australia would step up support for “our neighbourhood, where we have distinct responsibilities” and resist the “false hope of protectionism and isolationism”. In signalling a more activist role for Australia in the Indo-Pacific, the prime minister said that, in the past, “we could safely assume that the world worked in a way that suited Australia”. “Now power is shifting and the rules and institutions are under challenge.” Malcolm Turnbull said the world was experiencing unprecedented prosperity and opportunity “but the liberal, rules-based order that underpins it all is under greater stress than at any time since its creation in the 1940s”. He noted that Australia had entered a period where its dominant security partner, the United States, was not its dominant trading partner, China. “We must see this as an opportunity, not as a risk,” he said. The prime minister said the white paper provided “a framework for securing our own future, while sharing the burden of collective leadership with trusted partners and friends”. Turnbull said Australia had no intention of degrading the postwar alliance with the US but the contemporary climate meant “pursuing our interests as much in San Francisco as in Shanghai, and always on our own terms”. “Our alliance with the United States reflects a deep alignment of interests and values, while never being a straitjacket for Australian policymaking,” the prime minister said. “Our friendship and partnership with China enriches our economy and society, while not preventing us from vigorously advancing our own interests.” Turnbull said the US would remain a significant presence in the region, “leaving aside one administration or one president”, because it was “manifestly in America’s long-term national interest today, tomorrow and as it has always been”."
"Our collective minds are stuck on this idea that talking about food’s environmental impact risks taking something very intimate away from us. In fact it’s just the opposite. Reconsidering how we eat offers us hope, and empowers us with choice over what our future planet will look like. And we can ask our local leaders – from city mayors to school district boards to hospital management – to help, by widening our food options.   On Monday and Tuesday, the city of Chicago is hosting a summit for the Global Covenant of Mayors for Climate and Energy to discuss climate solutions cities can undertake. Strategies to address and lower food’s impact should be front and center.   Animal agriculture is choking the Earth, and the longer we turn a blind eye, the more we limit our ability to nourish ourselves, protect waterways and habitats, and pursue other uses of our precious natural resources. Raising livestock for meat, eggs and milk generates 14.5% of global greenhouse gas emissions, the second highest source of emissions and greater than all transportation combined. It also uses about 70% of agricultural land, and is one of the leading causes of deforestation, biodiversity loss, and water pollution.   On top of this, eating too much meat and dairy is making us sick, greatly increasing our risk of heart disease, type 2 diabetes, several major cancers (including breast, liver and prostate) and obesity. Diets optimal for human health vary, according to David Katz, of the Yale University Prevention Research Center, “but all of them are made up mostly of whole, wholesome plant foods”. So what gives? Why can’t we see the forest for the bacon? The truth can be hard to swallow: that we simply need less meat and dairy and more plant-based options in our food system if we’re to reach our climate goals. This can start with individual action. Five years ago, our family felt hopeless about climate change, and helpless to make meaningful change. But when we connected the dots on animal agriculture’s impact on the environment, coupled with the truth about nutrition, we took heart because it gave us something we could actually do. To create change at the scale needed, this will take more than individual choice – we need to get climate leaders on board about the impact of food. Cities and counties have used their buying power to transition fleets from diesel to electric, and we need to do the same with how we purchase food. We have done this in our own community, moving the lunch program of Muse School, in Calabasas, California, and the Avatar movie set to plant-based menus. Scaling up initiatives like these can make a big difference: if the US reduced meat consumption by 50%, it’s the equivalent of taking 26 million cars off the road. We think that’s damn hopeful.  Decision-makers on all levels can make it easier for us to eat better, by expanding access to food options that are good for our health, affordable, and climate-friendly. Nationwide, cities and school districts have adopted food purchasing policies that include environment, health and fair labor standards. The city of Chicago is a recent adopter of this Good Food Purchasing Program, and so the solutions-focus of the summit is the perfect place to discuss how food can move us toward climate goals. In the same breath that we discuss fossil fuels, we should be talking animal ag, or we’re missing a big part of the problem – and a big part of the solution.  Yes, food is inherently personal. It’s the cornerstone of holidays, it fuels high school athletes and long workdays, and it nourishes nursing mothers and growing children. And yes, Americans love meat and cheese. But more than that, we love our majestic national parks, family beach vacations and clean air and water for our children and grandchildren.  As individuals, we can make choices on how to better nourish our families, and as citizens, we can encourage local leaders to make choices that will allow us to enjoy our land and natural resources now and in the future.  • James Cameron is a film-maker and deep-sea explorer.

"The world’s oceans are under the greatest threat in history, according to Sir David Attenborough. The seas are a vital part of the global ecosystem, leaving the future of all life on Earth dependent on humanity’s actions, he says. Attenborough will issue the warning in the final episode of the Blue Planet 2 series, which details the damage being wreaked in seas around the globe by climate change, plastic pollution, overfishing and even noise.   Previous BBC nature series presented by Attenborough have sometimes been criticised for treading too lightly around humanity’s damage to the planet. But the final episode of the latest series is entirely dedicated to the issue. “For years we thought the oceans were so vast and the inhabitants so infinitely numerous that nothing we could do could have an effect upon them. But now we know that was wrong,” says Attenborough. “It is now clear our actions are having a significant impact on the world’s oceans. [They] are under threat now as never before in human history. Many people believe the oceans have reached a crisis point.” Attenborough says: “Surely we have a responsibility to care for our blue planet. The future of humanity, and indeed all life on Earth, now depends on us.” BBC executives were reportedly concerned about the series appearing to become politicised and ordered a fact-check, which it passed. The series producer, Mark Brownlow, said it was impossible to overlook the harm being caused in the oceans: “We just couldn’t ignore it – it wouldn’t be a truthful portrayal of the world’s oceans. We are not out there to campaign. We are just showing it as it is and it is quite shocking.” Brownlow said much of the footage shot of albatross chicks being killed by the plastic they mistake for food were too upsetting to broadcast. The programme also filmed on the Great Barrier Reef in 2016, witnessing the worst bleaching event in its history.  Climate change is causing ocean temperatures to rise, bleaching the corals vital as nurseries for ocean life, and waters are warming rapidly in Antarctica too. Jon Copley, from the University of Southampton and one of many scientists appearing in the final episode, says. “What shocks me about what all the data shows is how fast things are changing here [in Antarctica]. We’re headed into uncharted territory” Carbon dioxide from fossil fuel burning also dissolves in seawater, making it more acidic. Prof Chris Langdon, at the University of Miami, says it is “beyond question” that the problem is manmade. “The shells and the reefs really, truly are dissolving. The reefs could be gone by the end of the century.” The noise from shipping, tourism, and fossil fuel exploration is also revealed as harming sea life. Steve Simpson, at the University of Exeter, who works on coral reefs in southeast Asia, says: “There is a whole language underwater that we are only just getting a handle on. They use sound to attract a mate, to scare away a predator. You hear pops and grunts and gurgles and snaps.” He shows the noise of motorboats distracting saddleback clownfishes from warning against a predator attack. The Blue Planet 2 team found plastic everywhere they filmed, even in the most remote locations such as South Georgia island, an important breeding site for wandering albatrosses. There, Lucy Quinn from the British Antarctic Survey says many chicks are killed by plastic fed to them by their parents, including one young bird whose stomach was punctured by a plastic toothpick.  Overfishing, which remains prevalent around the world, is also addressed. “Every night thousands of miles of fishing lines laden with hooks are set – there is enough, it is said, to wrap twice around the world,” says Attenborough. But the programme also highlights some success stories, such as the revival of sperm whales off Sri Lanka and herring stocks off Norway after bans or restrictions were put in place.  Attenborough also visits Trinidad, where the conservationist Len Peters has transformed the prospects of the giant leatherback turtles who come to the island to lay their eggs and whose numbers have fallen catastrophically in recent decades. “I grew up in a house where turtle meat was normal,” says Peters. But his work to end turtle hunting and encourage tourism has seen numbers rise from 30-40 to more than 500. Quinn says the oceans are of vital importance for the whole world: “The oceans provide us with oxygen, they regulate temperature, they provide us with food and energy supplies. It is unthinkable to have a world without a healthy ocean.”  Daniel Pauly, who leads the Sea Around Us programme at the University of British Columbia in Canada, and was not involved in Blue Planet 2, endorsed its stark conclusion. He said vast, subsidised fishing fleets were scraping the bottom of the barrel and that ocean acidification could be terminal for many species. Pauly also warned of the dangers of plastic attracting toxic chemicals and then being eaten: “They become poison pills.” Pauly said the question facing humanity now was simple: “Are we going to fight for the oceans or not?” The final episode of Blue Planet 2 is at 8pm on BBC1 on 10 December in the UK. The full series will then be available online via the iPlayer, including in ultra HD and high dynamic range, the first time the BBC has provided such content. "
"Companies hoping to build new windfarms, solar plants and tidal lagoons, have been dealt a blow after the government said there would be no new subsidies for clean power projects until 2025 at the earliest. The Treasury said it had taken the decision to “protect” consumers, because households and businesses were facing an annual cost of about £9bn on their energy bills to pay for wind, solar and nuclear subsidies to which it had already committed.  The revelation that there will be no more money for projects before 2025 could dash hopes for pioneering projects such as the proposed £1.3bn tidal lagoon in Swansea, which has a mooted launch date of 2022. In a Treasury document on carbon levies published on Wednesday, officials said: “On the basis of the current forecast, there will be no new low-carbon electricity levies until 2025.” Environmental groups criticised the Treasury move. The WWF said it was a huge disappointment, while Greenpeace claimed Wednesday’s budget was one of the least green ever. Business groups also reacted with dismay. The pro-environment Aldersgate Group, whose members include BT, Ikea and Marks & Spencer, said the lack of clarity on low-carbon power investments was disappointing.  James Court, head of policy at the Renewable Energy Association, said: “The UK government seem to be turning their back on renewables by announcing no new support for projects post-2020 and a freeze on carbon taxes.” It is understood the policy will only affect projects generating electricity before 2025, so would not stop firms signing contracts for power stations coming online after 2025. That means the backers of new nuclear power stations are unlikely to be affected by the decision, because none was expected to be built by then. But it could be a blow for the companies wanting to build solar farms, onshore windfarms and other clean power plants at an earlier date. Some industry figures took comfort from Treasury language suggesting that some contracts might be allowed for renewables if the price were so low as to be effectively subsidy-free.  The government confirmed that it would honour an existing pledge to auction £557m of renewable energy subsidies, beginning next year. But most of that pot is expected to be taken by giant offshore windfarms, likely crowding out other technologies such as tidal. John Sauven, chief executive of Greenpeace, said: “Despite the chancellor’s pride in the UK’s climate leadership, hidden away in the unannounced text of the budget, he quietly revealed this was one of the least green budgets ever because there will be no new money for renewables until at least 2025.” Gareth Redmond-King, head of energy and climate at WWF, said: “It is a huge disappointment that there will be no new investment in UK renewables.” The government also announced that until 2025 it was freezing a carbon tax on dirty energy generators. Big energy firms, including SSE, have been calling for the tax, the carbon price floor, to be strengthened to encourage new investment in greener energy. Recent research by energy analysts suggested that without an increase in the tax, coal power plant owners would enjoy a last hurrah in the early 2020s before they hit a government deadline for the closure of all coal-fired stations by 2025. One expert said the decision to freeze rather than increase the tax meant the UK’s climate change target for 2030 was being put at risk. “It is disappointing that the Treasury is continuing its indefinite freeze of the carbon price support rate, a move that could endanger the achievement of the UK’s emissions target for 2030,” said Bob Ward, policy and communications director at the Grantham Research Institute on Climate Change and the Environment.  He added that the current price of around £24.50 a tonne of CO2 was likely to be too weak to drive the energy market to shift from gas power stations to renewables and nuclear."
