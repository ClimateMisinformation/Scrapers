"Concerns are mounting that Donald Trump’s victory could embolden some fossil fuel-rich countries to try unpicking the historic Paris climate agreement, which came into force last week. Saudi Arabia has tried to obstruct informal meetings at the UN climate summit in Marrakech this week, and worries are rife that states which have not yet ratified the agreement could seek to slow action on carbon emissions. Trump has called global warming a hoax and promised to withdraw the US from the Paris accord.   An EU source, speaking on condition of anonymity, said: “Of course this is a factor if not a fear – that where climate policies are concerned, Trump’s victory will probably make some parties feel empowered to start trying to reopen what has been agreed. If the US withdraws or starts demanding renegotiations, it is a possibility that some of the other parties will wake up and say ‘We have some pieces that we want to renegotiate as well’.”  Officials in Brussels and Washington stress that the Paris agreement’s entry into force in 2016 – four years earlier than required under the treaty – shows a rapid and ongoing momentum.  It's a climate change accord agreed by nearly 200 countries in December 2015, which came into force on 4 November 2016. The agreement commits world leaders to keeping global warming below 2C, seen as the threshold for safety by scientists, and pursuing a tougher target of 1.5C. The carbon emission curbs put forward by countries under Paris are not legally-binding but the framework of the accord, which includes a mechanism for periodically cranking those pledges up, is binding. The agreement also has a long-term goal for net zero emissions which would effectively phase out fossil fuels.   The vast majority of the 105 states that have ratified the Paris accord remain firmly committed to the legal framework and certainty it gives clean energy investors.  But Trump’s win spurred the EU president Jean-Claude Juncker to call for an urgent clarification by the president elect of the new US climate position.  “We must know what climate policies he intends to pursue,” Juncker said in a speech in Berlin on Thursday. “This must be cleared up in the next few months.”  Some NGOs said that the potential ending of the US-China alliance that pushed through a deal in Paris has already spurred Saudi Arabia to step up disruptive efforts in talks.  Safa al-Jayoussi, Climate Action Network’s Arab world co-coordinator, said that officials from Saudi Arabia, Qatar and other states had expressed relief at Trump’s victory because of his support for fossil fuels in his 100 days plan.  “Those countries trying to put obstacles in the way of Paris can now take advantage of the political instability caused by Trump’s election,” she said. “I think that some states which signed the Paris agreement because of all the international pressure will now use the US election as an excuse to put obstacles in the way of a transparent agreement. They are doing that in informal meetings.”  In one working group on the Paris agreement the day that Trump was elected, Saudi Arabia’s capital, Riyadh, tried to block plans for a review towards mid-century of climate goals.  The Saudi delegation also reportedly objected to language about the gender dimension of climate change and the integration of the UN’s human rights convention into the Paris text. Saudi Arabia is one of the 100-plus countries that has ratified the agreement.  “They are using all the tools at their disposal just to try to seed a bit of discontent everywhere, which is frankly a bit pathetic,” said Liz Gallagher, a senior associate at the environmental thinktank E3G. “They can use procedures as much as they like, but the parties will still talk about it, just not with the Saudis.”  While Russia is also a part of the “awkward squad” on climate issues – frequently raising unpredictable last-minute demands – these were usually more manageable within the UN talks process, Gallagher added. Signals from Beijing suggest no lessening of resolve from a country wildly accused by Trump of inventing the climate change concept to make US manufacturing industry uncompetitive. “There will be a distinction between campaign policies and real policies,” Chinese negotiator Gu Zihua told the Associated Press. “We should still wait and see what kind of measures the US will take on climate change.” Energy experts in the UK said Trump’s win would likely be damaging for international efforts to reduce carbon emissions from energy, unless he changed direction. Sir Edward Davey, who was the UK’s energy and climate secretary from 2012-15, told the Guardian: “The signal of Trump for climate and energy policy internationally is about as bad as it could get. But we will need to wait to see what the reality is. The fact the Paris agreement has come into force does constrain what Trump can actually do. “Markets and technologies are also going far faster than governments and international agreements, and the states across the US will be able to take advantage of the cheap clean energy. So the size of the disaster is at least contained but there’s no getting away from it, it’s pretty awful.” Davey, who is now chairman of green power firm Mongoose Energy, called on Theresa May to urge Trump to consult with allies before the US pulls out of any UN agreements. Lawrence Slade, chief executive of Energy UK which represents the UK’s Big Six energy companies, said: “The Marrakech climate talks are going on right now. A Trump administration can fly in the face of the whole world or they can sit down and work with us. It makes good plain logic sense to decarbonise.”"
"Imagine the world was facing upheaval on a scale not seen during modern civilization, a change that would imperil the world’s great cities by the rising seas and snuff out species at at the fastest rate since the dinosaurs disappeared. Then imagine you were a journalist, had repeated chances to ask the next president of the United States about this and decided to not do so. The apparent failure of the media during the presidential election has been multifaceted and fiercely debated. But the absence of climate change as a leading topic in the election of Donald Trump is perhaps the single greatest rebuke to the idea that power should be held to account for the benefit of this and future generations.  This failure was most apparent during the presidential debates, where four-and-a-half hours of television saw not one moderator question pitched to Trump or Hillary Clinton on climate change. It was left to Ken Bone, he of the red sweater and brief internet fame, to come closest with a question about coal mining. The mind-boggling consequences of unchecked climate change, which is essentially what Trump proposes by denying the problem exists, dwarfed every other issue – yes, including emails – discussed during the debates. And yet it wasn’t raised. It was the equivalent of getting an exclusive interview with Churchill and Roosevelt in 1942 and not asking them about the war. Climate change was also missing in broader coverage of the election, especially on cable TV, where slow-moving scientific emergencies don’t make good fodder for breathless horse-race journalism. The public were periodically warned that the seas are eating away America’s east coast and that no it’s not just you, it really is warm this year, but climate change was treated as a side issue rather than being central to every economic, energy and foreign policy question the country is grappling with.   Kerry Emanuel, a leading climate scientist, said: “This is the great issue of our time and we are skirting around it. I’m just baffled by it.”  To be fair, many Americans also skirt around climate change too, even if they are concerned about it. Nearly two-thirds of Americans say that climate change is at least somewhat important to them personally, according to the Yale Program on Climate Communication, although few people talk about the issue with family or friends.  Americans are broadly in favor of developing clean sources of energy but there’s a clear political divide about how to approach climate change. Polling by the Pew Research Center shows half of Clinton’s supporters cared about climate change a great deal, compared with 15% of Trump supporters.  Maybe now that the reality of the next four years of president Trump is sinking in, a more considered view of the problems America faces will take hold. Maybe people will realize it’s important that we’ve left it to the very last minute to cut greenhouse gas emissions and that failure to do this will probably risk their property, prosperity and national security.  Maybe the spread of disease and the rising seas will be grasped as something to be urgently remedied before tropical mosquitos advance further and south Florida is inundated.  There is much detail to work out, both on the impacts of climate change and how Trump’s policies will influence them. The president-elect has promised to withdraw the US from the Paris climate deal, to scrap the Clean Power Plan, slash funding for renewable energy and somehow attempt to reboot the ailing coal industry.  How far he will go with this agenda, and indeed how invested he personally is in it beyond outlandish tweeted conspiracies, is still unclear. Exiting the Paris accord will require a three-year notice period but as the agreement is non-binding beyond its over-arching goal of avoiding dangerous global warming, Trump could simply drop any attempt to cut emissions and sit it out as other countries try to suppress their panic as to what to do now that the US isn’t a climate leader anymore.  Trump wants to accelerate domestic oil, coal and gas production to achieve “complete American energy independence” but this goal is contradictory and barely feasible given the unfavorable economics facing coal and oil in particular.   The new president also wants to roll back the Environmental Protection Agency while having “crystal clear” water and clean air. He has spoken admiringly of America’s natural beauty but has surrounded himself with fossil fuel billionaires and lobbyists who want to split open public lands for their enrichment. Republicans largely support this stance but at the same time they don’t want a public enraged by degraded national parks or another Flint water crisis, for example.   Untangling these contradictions and what they mean for the US, and the planet, will arguably form the most important legacy left by a Trump presidency. It’s up to the media to start helping do this."
"We asked a panel of experts how a Donald Trump presidency could affect Australia, on everything from climate change policy to trade and regional security.  Michael Fullilove (Lowy Institute executive director): “The big picture move would be that Donald Trump is in favour of retreating from the world, retreating from Asia.  “Once the US steps back from Asia, it becomes a much harder environment for Australia to operate and to have a rules-based order ... All we know is he has certain long-term views: that he’s allergic to alliances, he’s sympathetic to strong men like Vladimir Putin. His views have echoes of isolationism.” Kim Beazley (former defence minister and Australian ambassador to US): “If he were to pursue his objectives internationally ... it will effectively suspend American leadership in global free trade and in the global order. “Taken at face value, Donald Trump’s policies could induce crises in the US’s military relationship with two of Australia’s most important trading partners – Korea and Japan. He will discombobulate the pivot to Asia that has a south-east Asian focus that was Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama’s speciality.” Fullilove: “A Trump presidency would be a sobering result for many Australians - according to Lowy Institute polling Australians favoured Hillary Clinton over Trump by 7-1, 77% favoured Clinton 11% favoured Trump. Half of Australians wanted us to distance the country from the US if someone like Trump were elected. “I don’t think it would affect the [Australian-New Zealand-US] alliance, the alliance has existed for 70 years and goes beyond personality of those at the summit, but a President Trump would stretch that.” Peter Jennings (Australian Strategic Policy Institute executive director): “We’re going to have to do a lot more hard thinking than we have in recent years about how to sustain the effectiveness of the alliance.  “We’ve got a selling job to persuade him we’re paying our dues in terms of defence spending and militarily in the Middle East.” Beazley: “[Trump’s election] is an enormous challenge, we are deeply embedded in the military intelligence side of the relationship [with the US].  “Our capacity to defend ourselves is attached to that, particularly the military equipment we buy from the US.” Beazley told Sky News Australia does have one advantage under a Trump presidency: “We are a member of the only American alliance that the Trump people unreservedly approve of. So at least we’ve got a basis of a discussion with them.” Gorana Grgic (lecturer at United States Studies Centre): “From what we’ve heard in Trump’s speeches so far, Australia has been conspicuously missing from all his discussions of allies that are asymmetrically benefiting from its US alliance. “[Australian ambassador to the US] Joe Hockey has said he is reassured by people near Trump that Australia is in the good books, and I don’t think in terms of Anzus that we’re likely to see much change.” Jennings: “Trump has said some very concerning things about lifting tariffs on Chinese goods.” Beazley: “If Trump imposes the tariff he’s talking about with respect to China, it will cause close to an economic crisis. It’s no wonder the stock market has fallen [as Trump looks likely to win the electoral college].” Professor John Langmore (assistant director research, security and political engagement in the Melbourne School of Government): “[Trump] is very sceptical of free trade, that’s not automatically a bad thing, but he may be much less open to trade with other countries, and that could well be challenging to exporting countries.” Grgic: “If you go down the path of trade wars, it has huge implications for the foreign exchange and the stability of the currency”. Grgic suggested it might be harder to export to the US and cause an increase in consumer prices for imports if there is retaliation from China. Jennings: “So much is unknown but Trump has said the Japanese and South Koreans should do considerably more for their own defence, and he’s not concerned about whether that includes gaining nuclear weapons.  “I think a lot of that is pre-election campaign talk. We have to see how he will proceed in office but he is probably one of the least experienced American presidents in decades when it comes to foreign policy. Any perceived reduction of US interest in the region could lead to strategic situations including rapid nuclear arms proliferation.” With respect to the South China Sea, Jennings said it wasn’t clear whether the US under Trump would push back more or less against China’s militarisation. “Australia can’t afford to be sitting on the sidelines, secure in the knowledge the US will undertake freedom of navigation exercises ... We’re going to have to be much more engaged ourselves.” Langmore: “As Hillary repeatedly said, it’s pretty hard to imagine a man who can’t be trusted with Twitter in charge of the biggest store of nuclear weapons in the world.  “He doesn’t begin the task of being president with the capacity to be a peaceable leader of the most powerful country in the world in ways that would contribute to prosperity or security.” Grgirc: “The US has been in the region since WWII, it has been insurer of stability by providing troops and guaranteeing it would step in should some key allies be attacked. “If these sort of guarantees are withdrawn ... the logic of security dilemma comes into play. One country starts arming, it decreases the security of others and makes them more compelled to arm themselves. It’s a very perilous spiral which obviously subtracts from security in the region.” John Connor (Climate Institute chief executive): “There’s no doubt this will be an extremely serious blow, but not devastating. “The Paris agreement is structured in such a way, now it is in force and with US ratification, so that Trump can’t technically remove the US from the agreement [immediately], so it won’t actually devastate the structure of the agreement. “The checks and balances in the agreement, which may allow any country to go off on a bit of a frolic, has capacity to bring them back into the fold. That’s my most optimistic take on it.” Langmore: “Trump is a climate change sceptic ... Australia will have to be a stronger advocate for responsible environmental policies. Of course there’ll be a large body of opinion supporting that in the US, many states will have responsible climate policies, but you can’t expect the US administration to lead on this issue.” Grgic: “It hasn’t been mentioned once in presidential debates – that sends a signal about its priority or lack of priority, in both campaigns. If Trump does what he announced to China [on tariffs], a climate agreement enabled by cooperation with China will basically also fall down the drain. We would not be likely to see movement on this issue.” Beazley: “There will be an expectation that we use the fact that we are the only alliance that the US [under Trump] unreservedly approves of ... to mitigate the worst effects of the directions Trump is prepared to head down.” Jennings: “As a smaller ally we have to sell the alliance in Washington ... the prime minister should make an early effort to meet Trump. “The responsibility is ours, the US will not be making Australia a high priority as an incoming [Trump] administration.” Langmore: “Australia should both use its leverage to change US policies [on climate change] and also to reach out to other countries to improve multilateralism.”"
"Operators of private prisons are soaring on the stock market because analysts expect Donald Trump to row back on the Department of Justice’s ruling this summer to phase out privately run institutions’ housing of federal inmates.   Sally Yates, the deputy attorney general, said independent inspectors had found that private prisons “compare poorly to our own bureau facilities” and did not save substantially on costs. The companies are also likely to benefit from Trump’s plan for the mass deportation of immigrants. Analysts at Height Securities said: “Private prisons would likely be a clear winner under Trump, as his administration will probably rescind the DoJ’s contract phase-out and ICE [Immigration and Customs Enforcement] capacity to house detainees will come under further stress.” Shares in Corrections of America, the biggest private prison operator, surged by 60% in early trading on Wednesday before ending the day 40% higher. The shares were down 2% on Thursday. Shares in Geo Group, the second biggest private prison company, jumped 16% on Wednesday and were flat on Thursday.  During her campaign, Hillary Clinton repeatedly attacked drug companies for “outrageous price gouging”, in which companies buy old drugs and ramp up the price, and pledged to take on the industry if elected. She promised her crackdown during the furore surrounding Martin Shkreli, the pharmaceutical boss described as “the world’s most hated man”, who raised the price of a life-saving Aids drug from $13.50 to $750 per pill. She also attacked the EpiPen company, Mylan, which increased the price of the life-saving allergy treatment by sixfold, as the “latest troubling example of a company taking advantage of its consumers”.  Clinton’s policy on drug pricing was mostly a reaction to the success of rival Bernie Sanders’ popular message. Shares in Pfizer, the world’s biggest drugmaker, have risen by 10% since the result of the election became clear. The SPDR S&P Biotech exchange-traded fund jumped 10.4%. But hospital stocks were hit by Trump’s vow to repeal the Affordable Care Act, which has given healthcare access to America’s poorest and previously uninsured people. Shares in hospital groups Centene, HCA Holdings and Universal Health Services were some of the biggest losers on the stock market, as they could once again face treating millions of uninsured patients. Trump has pledged to make America energy independent, tear up red tape and allow oil and gas exploration in new areas of the country. Oil and gas company shares were among the biggest risers on Wall Street on Wednesday and Thursday. The president-elect has also pledged to allow a fresh application for the Keystone XL oil pipeline. President Barack Obama rejected the Canada-US pipeline in 2015, but Trump has said he would invite a fresh proposal from TransCanada, the company behind the plan.  Trump has also vowed to withdraw the US from the Paris climate accord, and wants to halt the “billions and billion and billions” given to UN climate programmes and clean energy development. This caused shares in Vestas, the Danish wind turbine company, to fall by 14% on Wednesday before recovering to 6.6% lower. Solar power companies also tumbled.  Trump has vowed to kickstart a massive infrastructure spending programme, designed to fix the country’s crumbling roads and buildings and also increase jobs and spending. “We are going to fix our inner cities and rebuild our highways, bridges, tunnels, airports, schools, hospitals,” he said in his acceptance speech. The prospect of all that work has helped shares in companies supplying the construction sector with materials and kit. Caterpillar, the construction equipment company, rose 7% on Wednesday and the shares were trading higher on Thursday. Shares in the mining and commodities trading company Glencore rose 6% and BHP Billiton jumped more than 4% on Wednesday as Trump’s poll victory was confirmed. Shares in US Steel Corp soared 17% on Wednesday and were up again on Thursday. Trump has pledged to increase US defence spending, and he plans to force other Nato countries to spend more on it too. During his campaign for the White House, he threatened to abandon US allies in Europe if they did not spend enough on defence.  Now Trump has won the election, investors expect more spending on defence and so shares in arms makers and other defence-related stocks have benefited.  London-listed BAE Systems gained almost 7% on Wednesday and a further 4.6% on Thursday. On Wall Street, shares in Lockheed Martin rose 6% on Wednesday and were up again on Thursday."
"Reaching a global agreement on climate change took more than 20 years of tortuous negotiations. Signed just under a year ago, the insufficient but workable Paris agreement at last constructed a legally binding framework for the principle of cutting carbon emissions. It was to be the foundation of a sustained ratcheting up of ambition that would hold global warming below 2C. Last Tuesday night, as one by one from east coast to west the United States went Republican red, that progress was wiped out. Donald Trump is the first self-declared climate denier to lead of one of the world’s biggest emitters. Even President George W Bush, though he surrounded himself with sceptics, did not publicly disavow climate science. He even managed a few helpful moves. But Mr Trump has pledged to unpick the Paris agreement. In Marrakech, where delegates are meeting for the first time since Paris, they are putting a brave face on proceedings. But they know the outlook is bleaker than it has been since the collapse of the Copenhagen talks in 2009.  Mr Trump cannot instantly extricate the US from the Paris accord: legal technicalities means withdrawal would take four years, although he may try to speed up the process. That, though, is just legal stuff. His chilling effect on climate negotiations has already begun. That is because these talks rely as much – if not more – on trust, good faith and political will as they do on law and legal process. Remember, for instance, that only the framework of the Paris pact is legally binding, not each country’s commitments on greenhouse gas emissions. Trust and goodwill can go a long way: the personal charm offensive that President Obama launched on Beijing when he made climate change a legacy issue led to the historic joint statement without which the Paris deal could never have been made. The prospect of its success drew the presence of almost all major world leaders to Paris for the launch of the talks last December, sending an unmistakable signal to their negotiating teams. Now, even if the US remains technically a signatory for a while longer, all this is lost from inauguration day in January. With a hostile US, China may cool on its commitments, or at least take a tougher stance, as it has done before. India was already a reluctant participant and the change in the US position is likely only to make its grumbles louder. Games of “what if” are irresistible at this stage. As delegates started to gather in Marrakech, the world appeared on the brink of an unprecedented phase of stability. The Paris agreement had come into force within a year of its agreement, an astonishing achievement after the discord and mistrust that had threatened all the preceding meetings and even the whole UN climate process. But now that huge achievement may be shattered. Diplomats are working furiously to reassure countries that the departure of the US would not mean the end of the road and the process can continue. And it is not only the global talks. In the US, too, more climate-unfriendly actions from a Republican-dominated Congress, like changes to clean energy subsidies, are on the cards, while President Obama’s clean power plan to regulate power stations is under grave threat. Mr Trump’s proposed leader of the Environmental Protection Agency is a prominent climate sceptic, Myron Ebell, a man once described by a senior George W Bush aide as “crazy Myron”. Finally, a right-leaning supreme court may put a brake on future legal challenges from environmental groups. Taken with Mr Trump’s support for coal, US emissions may soon be back firmly on their upward track. And if he really wants to “cancel” Paris, Trump could even pull the US out of the UN framework convention on climate change, the foundation treaty under which Paris was signed. If he did, the world would lose its global forum for taking fair and effective action on greenhouse gases and adapting to climate change. Withdrawal may be a step too far even for Trump, for the treaty gives the US a seat at the table that pragmatists would rather retain, even if they try to saw the legs off. For delegates in Marrakech, the only source of optimism may be their years of experience in holding the talks together. But they cannot do it on their own. In the end, it may all come down to scientifically literate Republicans in Congress. They must be the voice of the two-thirds of Americans who understand the link between human activity and global warming – and want to break it."
"“People were walking around looking pretty shellshocked,” says Dr Bill Hare, perched on a chair in the cavernous media tent at the United Nations climate talks in Morocco. “If you hugged an American there was a good chance they’d burst into tears.” Donald Trump’s triumph in the US elections cast a shadow over the first week of the 22nd round of talks here in Marrakech. The president-elect has pledged to pull the US out of the global climate agreement – signed by all countries in Paris last year to keep global warming “well below 2C”.  Trump thinks the whole climate change issue is little more than a hoax. Hare, an Australian climate scientist, is ever-present at these talks. He hugged a few Americans last week. He has advised governments and ministers around the world, most recently through his Berlin-based not-for-profit policy institute, Climate Analytics. But beyond the shock of electing a climate science denier for president, Hare says the material impact on the talks has been minor. “Has [Trump’s victory] visibly affected the negotiations? Not really, no, it hasn’t. Momentum has continued.” At Paris, the task on hand was clear. Get all the countries around the world – from the poorest to the richest, the cleanest to the dirtiest – to agree on a plan to keep global warming well below 2C.  But in Marrakech the objectives for the two-week talks are far more opaque. They involve agreeing the “rulebook” to turn the Paris deal from a set of inadequate national targets to a tool to increase ambition over the coming years.  Hare says one impact of a pending Trump administration could be to speed things up, rather than slow them down. Instead of pushing some agenda items on to next year, there was “some manoeuvring” to get as much done as possible before Trump takes over. There has been a flurry of activity at the start of the second week, with major reports released as political leaders begin to arrive for the “high-level segment” of the talks. There has been much number crunching. The Global Carbon Project unveiled its annual detailed look at the global emissions of greenhouse gases. Emissions in 2015 from burning fossil fuels and making cement were 36.3bn tonnes, the same as 2014. This “plateau” was mostly down to a slowdown in China.  Hare’s Climate Analytics also released a report looking at what the Paris agreement means for the coal power industry. The report says practically every coal power plant in the world will need to be switched off by 2050 to avoid global warming of 1.5C. Add only 10 years for a target of 2C. The report says there are about 1,082 coal power plants being planned around the world, effectively locking in dirty energy production for at least 40 more years. Hare told a press conference: “It’s pretty clear that the coal plans that some countries have are quite inconsistent with the Paris agreement.”  There is “no rationale” for building any new coal plants, the report says. Even some new plants, only just built, would need to be turned off early. The World Meteorological Organization released a provisional statement on global temperatures, declaring that 2016 was “very likely” to beat 2015 as the hottest on record.  Omar Baddour, senior scientific coordinator at WMO, was in meetings with delegates last week outlining the impacts of greenhouse gas emissions on the climate.  From increasing levels of drought and heatwaves to rising sea levels and Arctic ice melt, Baddour has been telling negotiators that “all the indicators are red”. “The message to them is that there’s no time for reflection,” he tells me. “The facts are there. Now it’s time for action. You can’t negotiate with the laws of physics.” You can bet, though, that while negotiating with physics can’t be done, Trump would give it a go."

"Traditional owners fighting to stop Australia’s largest proposed coalmine are at the centre of a new University of Queensland project exploring worldwide Indigenous rights movements in the era of climate upheaval. Leaders from the Wangan and Jagalingou traditional owners council, who are enmeshed in a legal and lobbying effort to head off Adani’s Carmichael mine, will collaborate with academics and human rights lawyers for the first “flagship” project chosen by UQ’s Global Change Institute.  The prominent Canadian activist and journalist Naomi Klein said the W&J traditional owners were “at the forefront of fossil fuel resistance and protecting their land, water and culture”. UQ said the project would “explore the international Indigenous movement that is reimagining human rights and social and economic development in the global era of scarce water resources, climate change and energy transition”. The project – We Are The People From That Land: Centring Indigenous Peoples’ Rights in the Transition to a Sustainable, Low-Carbon Future – will involve work by three UQ “investigators” across different disciplines. The academics will work with W&J leaders including Murrawah Johnson, who Klein said was “a powerful spokesperson and organiser who is on the front line of holding back one of the largest proposed coal mines in the world”.  “With her elders and council, she is shining a light on the urgent need for a justice-based transition in the face of the climate crisis,” Klein said. The W&J at large are divided over the question of allowing Adani to exploit their Galilee basin homelands for the open-cut Carmichael coalmine. Questions about discrete payments by Adani to some W&J representatives who support the mine were this year a flashpoint in an ongoing dispute over who legitimately speaks for traditional owners. The UQ project researchers are the economist John Quiggin, the social science researcher Kristen Lyons, who has worked in development and environmental sociology, and the political scientist Morgan Briggs. UQ said the GCI “flagship projects cut across disciplinary and thematic boundaries, demanding new ways of thinking”. Human rights lawyer Benedict Coyne, who has acted in some of the W&J challenges around the mining proposal, will provide legal analysis. Johnson said the project was “a great opportunity for the Wangan and Jagalingou people to chart a new path to justice and sustainability, and to social and economic opportunities in the transition to a low-carbon world”. “The project will help shape a shared understanding of how to sustain our lands and waters and enrich our culture, and build our futures on this,” she said. Adrian Burragubba, the senior W&J traditional owner who is spearheading legal challenges around the mining proposal, said: “We want to share our knowledge and give the world an appreciation of the significance of our culture and the way in which the protection of lands and waters is a matter of Indigenous law and environmental sustainability”. Coyne said the project would “greatly enhance our understanding of the intersection of the important issues at play in contemporary Australia and internationally regarding climate change, natural resource conservation and human rights – particularly the rights of Indigenous peoples”. The project will be funded to the value of up to $120,000 over two years. It is backed by a longtime GCI supporter, the multimillionaire Wotif founder turned philanthropist Graeme Wood, who is also a financial backer of Guardian Australia. Wood said W&J council leaders were “forging new ground in our understanding of Indigenous rights in Australia in the transition to a low carbon and just future”.  • This story was amended on 14 November 2016 to clarify that Benedict Coyne is not acting in his capacity as president of Australian Lawyers for Human Rights."
"Greece appears on track to win access to a controversial EU programme that could earmark up to €1.75bn (£1.56bn) in free carbon allowances for the building of two massive coal-fired power plants. The 1100MW coal stations will cost an estimated €2.4bn, and emit around 7m tonnes of CO2 a year, casting doubt on their viability without a cash injection from an exemption under Europe’s carbon trading market. The European parliament’s industry committee last month approved a rule change allowing Greece to join the scheme, the ‘10c derogation’ of the emissions trading system (ETS). Now, positive votes in the environment committee next month and at a plenary in February could set wheels in motion for the coal plants.  Gerben-Jan Gerbrandy, a Dutch Liberal MEP on the environment committee, said: “Lignite [coal] has no future and should not be stimulated in any way. Greece’s intention of using public funds to revive its lignite-based model should not be allowed. Article 10C is there to help poor countries towards a sustainable energy future. Lignite does not fit these criteria.” “You couldn’t make this up,” added Imke Lübbeke, WWF Europe’s head climate and energy policy. “The ETS was intended to reduce greenhouse gas emissions but it now risks being abused to facilitate investments in the new coal plants, which would operate well within the 2060s.  “This would violate climate targets and is in no way compatible with the leadership role the EU aspires to play in global climate policy and carbon markets.” Greece depends on 16 ageing lignite coal units for around half of its electricity production and its energy establishment sees two new lignite plants in western Macedonia as a cost-effective way of modernising and securing energy supplies. Emmanuel Panagiotakis, the president of the Greek public power corporation (GPPC), told MEPs last year that without access to free emissions allowances, Greek lignite production would be discredited, causing electricity costs to skyrocket and jeapordising energy security. One of the two new plants, Ptolemaida V, is already under construction, with its €1.4bn price tag underwritten by a €739m loan from a consortium led by the German export bank, KfW-Ipex. As well as CO2, the plant would annually emit significant air pollution: 2,100 tonnes of sulphur dioxide (SO2), 2,800 tonnes of nitrogen oxides (NOx) and 140 tonnes of particulates, studies say. A memorandum of understanding for the other plant, Meliti II, was signed in September between the Greek government and CMEC, a Chinese construction company. Greece has the lowest quality lignite in Europe and plants such as these would not be viable without access to free carbon allowances, according to Panagiotakis. Studies paid for by WWF have found that clean energy alternatives would make more environmental and financial sense, but they cut against the grain in Greece. “The GPPC has always worked with coal,” one well-informed industry source told the Guardian. “They have grown up with lignite. It is what they know, what the state requires of them, and what they will do. It would be easier to change your grandmother’s mind about something.” The original 10c derogation was a classic Brussels fudge that allowed east European members to sign up to the EU’s 2020 climate package. Between 2013 and 2019, it allocated 673m free emissions allowances to coal-dependent countries whose GDP per capita was 50% below the EU average. An equivalent value is supposed to be spent by these countries on retrofitting and upgrading energy infrastructure, diversifying energy sources, and on clean energy. In practice though, the derogation has been controversial, with Poland – by far the system’s biggest beneficiary – claiming hundreds of millions of euros for ghost coal plants which did not exist. Gerbrandy said: “10c is a very important instrument that unfortunately can too easily be abused. We have seen this happen in the past. Strong governance and a clear focus on a true transition towards sustainable energy infrastructure are crucial.” WWF calculates that under the commission’s proposal for revising the ETS and 10c rules, Greece would receive 7m free allowances every year between 2021-2030. The commission’s estimated ‘shadow’ allowance price of €25 per tonne of CO2 over this period, would set the total handout at approximately €175m a year, or €1.75bn for the decade.  Giannis Tsipouridis, the president of the Greek wind energy association, Eletaen, said: “Building two new coal plants in this day and age is not only environmentally wrong, but financially wrong. These investments will never pay off. Renewables are the only way out of Greece’s energy mess.” Before it took power in Greece, the leftwing Syriza movement pledged itself to environmentally safe growth and “the ecological transformation of the economy”. But the party was also committed to building new coal plants and, under pressure from an EU refusal to write down its debts, focused on coal as an energy safeguard. Speaking to the Guardian last year, a senior Syriza source said that continued fiscal problems would make it wiser to burn lignite than to import it. “One way or another Greek lignite will be exploited,” he said. Environmentalists say that under Syriza, forest protections have been weakened, energy efficiency policies undermined, environmental permitting systems deregulated, and renewable projects damaged by changes to support schemes. “We had high hopes when Syriza was elected because of their programme,” said Nikos Mantzaris, a spokesman for WWF Greece. “We thought they would be friendlier to the environment but in fact their choices have been even worse than the previous government. Syriza came to power promising to get rid of fossil fuels in the next 20 years and instead, they’re investing in lignite.”"
"  The former governor general Quentin Bryce is part of a high-powered group of academics, business leaders, financiers and energy providers urging the Turnbull government to extend and expand the national renewable energy target and create a market mechanism to govern an orderly phase out of coal-fired power in Australia.  Representatives of the group came to Canberra on Monday to meet the energy minister, Josh Frydenberg, armed with an eight-point plan to drive a sequenced decarbonisation of the national energy market. The intervention follows weeks of political attacks by the Turnbull government on state-based renewable energy schemes and the government’s continuing refusal to say whether it will use a planned review of its Direct Action policy next year to overhaul an emissions reduction framework experts say is woefully inadequate. The leadership forum on energy transition, led by the Australian Conservation Foundation and hosted by the University of New South Wales, has used the resumption of parliament to call on the Turnbull government to establish national rules, policies, regulations, markets and a basis for investment to drive an orderly transition away from coal-fired power. As a first step, the group says the government needs to update Australia’s national electricity objective “to include a clear goal to accelerate Australia’s energy transition towards net zero emissions before 2050, to fulfil our domestic policy objectives and international commitments”. It says the government should consider creating an emissions intensity standard to govern the regulated closure of highly emissions intensive power stations and legislate a market mechanism that would allow a rational sequence of closures, where the dirtiest power stations close first. It says an alternative to a market mechanism would be an age-based regulation that tightens over time, ensuring the oldest coal-fired power stations closed first. The group is also calling on the government to extend and expand the large-scale element of the renewable energy target scheme beyond 2020 and introduce economy-wide complementary laws, such as a carbon price, to make companies pay for their pollution. As well as calling for a rational policy framework to ensure Australia complies with its Paris emissions reduction targets, and investors are given the policy certainty they need to bring on low-emissions technologies, the eight-point plan also emphasises the importance of transitional assistance for coal communities and help for low-income earners by way of compensation for higher power prices. The group is chaired by Ian Jacobs, the vice chancellor of UNSW, and includes Geoff Cousins, the president of the ACF, Bryce, Jillian Broadbent, the chairwoman of the Clean Energy Finance Corporation, David Thodey, the chairman of the CSIRO, financier Mark Burrows, company director and sustainability adviser Sam Mostyn and Martijn Wilder, lawyer and the chairman of the Australian renewable energy agency. The intervention is part of positioning by a number of stakeholders ahead of the Direct Action review in 2017, and it runs in parallel to a review being led by the chief scientist, Alan Finkel, of the national energy market, for state and federal energy ministers. It also follows confirmation last Thursday that the Hazelwood coal-fired power station in Victoria’s Latrobe valley will close next March. The Finkel review was preceded by a pitched political battle between the Turnbull government, which launched a rhetorical assault on state-based renewable energy targets after a statewide power blackout in South Australia in September, and state governments, who argue the commonwealth will not be able to meet its international emissions reduction targets without the state RETs. The South Australian government has signalled it will use the framework of the Finkel review to argue for an emissions intensity scheme for the electricity sector – a form of carbon trading. A coalition of major business and energy users have already urged federal and state governments to work cooperatively to map out a strategic response to the decarbonisation challenge and have warned investment is at risk."
"The short film I’ve made with the Guardian stars my son, Toma, aged four years and five months. That’s a little scary for me to write, since, up until this moment, my husband, Avi, and I have been pretty careful about protecting him from public exposure. No matter how damn cute we think he’s being, absolutely no tweeting is allowed. So I want to explain how I decided to introduce him to you in this very public way.  For the past eight years, I have been writing and speaking about climate change pretty much around the clock. I use all the communication tools I can — books, articles, feature documentary, photographs, lectures. Yet I still struggle with a nagging feeling that I’m not doing justice to the enormous stakes of this threat. The safety and habitability of our shared home is intensely emotional terrain, triggering perfectly rational feelings of loss, fear and grief. Yet climate discourse is usually pretty clinical, weighed down with statistics and policy jargon. All that information is important, of course. But I have started to worry that, by being so calm and clinical, we may be tacitly sending the message that this isn’t really an existential emergency after all. If it were, wouldn’t the people raising the alarm sound more … alarmed? Wouldn’t we share more of our own emotions? I was thinking a lot about these questions when the Guardian approached me about making a short film at the Great Barrier Reef while I visited Australia to receive the Sydney peace prize. I initially refused. I had already decided to travel to Queensland and see the bleaching and die-off for myself. But I was planning to go with my family and saw our visit as a very personal experience. Precisely because I knew I would be overwhelmed by seeing this tragedy through my son’s eyes, I didn’t want cameras around. A few days later, the Guardian asked again. And I started thinking: maybe this was a chance to get at aspects of climate disruption that scientific reports and political arguments just can’t convey. Perhaps it could communicate, in a visceral way, the intergenerational theft at the heart of this crisis. There is no question that the strongest emotions I have about the climate crisis have to do with Toma and his peers. I have flashes of sheer panic about the extreme weather we have already locked in for them. But even more intense than this fear is the sadness about what they won’t ever know. These kids are growing up in a mass extinction, robbed of the cacophonous company of being surrounded by so many fast-disappearing life forms.  According to a new WWF report, since I was born in 1970 the number of wild animals on the planet has dropped by more than half – and by 2020 it is expected to drop by two-thirds. What a lonely world we are creating for these kids. And what more powerful place to illustrate that absence than the Great Barrier Reef, on the knife-edge of survival?  So this film shows the reef through Toma’s eyes. He’s too young to understand concepts like coral bleaching and dying – it’s tough enough for him to understand that coral was ever alive in the first place.  It also shows the Great Barrier Reef through the eyes of his mother: moved by the beauty that remains, heartbroken and infuriated by what has been lost. Because what has happened to this wondrous part of the world is not just a tragedy, it’s a crime. And the crime is still very much in progress, with our respective governments busily clearing the way for new coalmines and new oil pipelines.  In a way, that’s the good news: we still have both the time and power to force our politicians to change course. It’s too late for most of the world’s coral reefs but it’s not too late for all of them. And it’s not too late to keep temperatures below levels that would save millions of lives and livelihoods. For that kind of rapid change to happen, however, we are all going to have to stop being so impeccably calm and reasonable. We’re going to have to find that part of ourselves that feels this threat in our hearts, as well as our heads. So meet Toma, who just discovered that there is a magical world beneath the waves. • Naomi Klein will accept the 2016 Sydney Peace Prize later this week. Details of the event are here."
"Australia has been singled out again as a climate laggard, being ranked fifth-worst for emissions and policies among developed countries and among the six worst countries in the G20 when it comes to climate action. In the climate change performance index, released overnight at the UN climate talks in Marrakech, Australia comes ahead of only Kazakhstan, South Korea, Japan and Saudi Arabia.  The 58 countries assessed by Climate Action Network Europe and Germanwatch are responsible for 90% of global energy-related carbon pollution. They are then ranked according to their emissions level, the trend in emissions, the deployment of renewable energy, the energy intensity of the economy and climate policies. Australia is near the bottom of the countries, labelled as having “very poor performance”. Australia’s hostile relationship between federal and state climate policies was noted in the report, which said: “While the former were rather unambitious and uninspired, the latter managed to some extent to take independent action.” The finding came following comments from the prime minister and federal ministers, criticising state-based renewable energy and emissions targets. Since previous rankings, Australia improved slightly with its emissions trend but dropped in energy efficiency. The Australian Conservation Foundation’s chief executive, Kelly O’Shanassy, said: “The government spruiks its climate credentials but Australia remains a laggard on cutting climate pollution. “The world is watching as our pollution rises and governments support new mega-polluting coalmines.”  O’Shanassy said Australia must not proceed with Adani’s Carmichael coalmine. Meanwhile, the federal minister for energy and the environment, Josh Frydenberg, used his time in Marrakech to lobby the US in favour of Adani’s Carmichael coalmine, complaining about US activists funding a campaign to stop the huge project from proceeding. In a separate study from the London School of Economics, researchers examined the consistency of actions of G20 countries, compared with the goals of the Paris agreement. It found Australia – as well as Argentina, Canada, Saudi Arabia, Turkey and the US – were “falling behind with their national climate mitigation action”. “These countries lack overall framework legislation or regulation on climate change, need to move from sectoral to economy-wide targets and extend the timeframe of their targets to 2030,” the report said."
"Australia has signed an international agreement committing to reducing methane emissions from the oil and gas industry, and calling for other countries to do the same, sparking claims it is being hypocritical and could “seriously damage our reputation in climate talks”. The Marrakech communique, signed this week at the first meeting of parties to the Paris agreement in Morocco, commits a coalition of countries including Australia to take measures to reduce methane emissions in the oil and gas industry. Methane is a short-lived but highly potent greenhouse gas, exerting a warming influence 84 times that of carbon dioxide over a 20-year time frame. The communique, signed by 38 countries, acknowledges that: “The oil and gas sector is the largest industrial source of methane globally and the next big opportunity for climate reductions as cost-effective measures can be taken to significantly reduce these emissions.” The signatories said they will reduce leaks from the gas industry, known as “fugitive emissions”, by “developing and implementing national methane reduction strategies, regulations, policies, or enhanced actions including those which encourage energy efficiency and fuel shifts”. But, in recent years, Australia has massively expanded its coal seam gas industry and is set to become the world’s largest exporter of liquefied natural gas (LNG). In addition, Australia has not been rigorously measuring fugitive emissions from the gas industry in Australia and reporting to the UNFCCC a figure that is much smaller than that found in similar operations in other countries. A recent report by the Melbourne Energy Institute, commissioned by the Australia Institute, showed Australia claimed that only 0.5% of gas produced in Australia is released into the atmosphere in fugitive emissions. But studies in the US have found those emissions are always higher than that – often 150 times as high and sometimes 300 times as high. While there have been no proper studies measuring fugitive emissions in Australia, the studies that have been done found evidence of significant emissions from sources that Australia claims to have zero emissions from. Mark Ogge, principal adviser at the the Australia Institute, said he welcomed the fact the country that was set to become the world’s biggest methane exporter was concerned about methane emissions. But Ogge said: “This commitment, if it is to be taken seriously, must come with a recognition that international standards for measuring fugitive emission, which are funded independently, should be supported. “If Australia wants to sign an international agreement to do something we don’t do ourselves … it will seriously damage our reputation in climate talks.” He said the situation was particularly serious in Australia’s coal seam gas industry. “Australia uses an outdated and very low assumption supplied by the US gas industry that was developed for conventional oil extraction in the US in the 1990s,” Ogge said. “The assumption only covers well pads, which make up a tiny fraction of CSG infrastructure. It doesn’t count intentional and unintentional methane release from multiple known major sources of emissions including huge water treatment plants, water and gas pipelines (with vents directly to the atmosphere) and migratory emissions caused by depressurising vast areas of coal seams.” A spokesman for Australia’s federal minister for the environment and energy, Josh Frydenberg, said that all emissions from the CSG industry are included in an accounting inventory and insisted that, while those are made up of estimations, those estimations are in compliance with IPCC guidelines. When asked what measures Australia would take to reduce fugitive emissions, the spokesman referred to Australia’s Emissions Reduction Fund, which pays polluters to reduce emissions. “For example, the Emissions Reduction Fund enables businesses to earn carbon credits by undertaking projects to reduce emissions such as reducing fugitive emissions in the oil and gas sector,” he said."
"A $1bn fund for cutting the climate change impact of oil and gas has been announced by 10 of the world’s biggest oil companies, aimed at keeping the firms in business and cutting the burning of coal.  Global action to cut carbon emissions threaten the future of the oil industry and the fund was revealed on the day the global Paris climate change agreement came into force. But analysts called the sum a “drop in the ocean” which showed the companies were not serious in tackling global warming.  The new fund will focus on reducing leaks of natural gas – a powerful greenhouse agent – and technology to capture and store carbon emissions when gas is burned to produce electricity, as well as increasing the fuel efficiency of vehicles. But it will not support the renewable energy, smart grid and storage technologies which are revolutionising the electricity industry.  It's a climate change accord agreed by nearly 200 countries in December 2015, which came into force on 4 November 2016. The agreement commits world leaders to keeping global warming below 2C, seen as the threshold for safety by scientists, and pursuing a tougher target of 1.5C. The carbon emission curbs put forward by countries under Paris are not legally-binding but the framework of the accord, which includes a mechanism for periodically cranking those pledges up, is binding. The agreement also has a long-term goal for net zero emissions which would effectively phase out fossil fuels.   Sustainable investment and climate change campaigners dismissed the initiative as ‘greenwash’, noting that, with the fund to be deployed over the next decade, the $100m annual investment represents just 0.1% of the companies’ current level of yearly capital expenditure. Scientists have calculated that half of all known gas reserves and a third of oil reserves cannot be burned if the world is to meet the Paris limit of 2C of warming. This makes the oil companies’ current business model of continuing exploration for new reserves nonsensical, say the campaigners. The 10 companies that comprise the Oil and Gas Climate Initiative (OGCI) produce 20% of the world’s oil and gas. Bob Dudley, chief executive of BP and OGCI chairman, said: “We all absolutely realise the world will move to a low-carbon world. Don’t worry, we got it. The technology to monitor and reduce fugitive methane [gas] emissions, that is an essential licence for us to advocate for natural gas.”  Dudley, whose own pay is higher than BP’s contributions to the fund, said gas produced half the emissions of coal, the use of which is increasing in Asia. “The price of coal is low and people are choosing affordable energy not clean energy. It’s going to make gas miss the opportunity.” Patrick Pouyanné, CEO of Total, said the technologies the new fund would back were vital: “It is a matter for us of being able to maintain our business in the future.” The OGCI see carbon capture and storage (CCS) technology as a way to prolong the continued use of fossil fuels. Scientists agree CCS is vital as without it the cost of tackling climate change will hugely increase, according to the the UN’s climate science panel. But developing commercial scale CCS is likely to require many billions of dollars. Oil and gas contribute about 37% of global carbon emissions, with transport a major user of oil. The OGCI said it will work with auto manufacturers to develop more efficient vehicles but this will compete with the fast growth of electric cars. Defending the relatively small size of the fund, Josu Jon Imaz, CEO of Repsol, said: “The target of this fund is to be a seed, a catalyst.” The new fund was not investing in renewable energy as it wanted to focus on where oil companies could have the most impact, he said. But Danni Paffard, at climate campaign group 350.org said: ‘This announcement is outrageous filibustering from an industry with no future. Forget their smoke and mirrors offerings, the fossil fuel industry’s basic business plan doesn’t stack up with global climate goals. Real climate action means leaving oil, coal and gas reserves in the ground, and until they do that nobody will be falling for this cynical PR spin.” Jonathan Marshall, energy analyst at the Energy and Climate Intelligence Unit, a UK-based thinktank, said: “Investing $1bn over 10 years averages to just $10m per year per company involved. This figure is a drop in the ocean,” he said. Bill Gates alone is contributing $1bn to the Breakthrough Energy Coalition, Marshall noted. “The business models of these companies are fundamentally incompatible with the Paris climate commitments,” he said. “This announcement shows that oil and gas companies are contemplating no real deviation from their traditional business models.” Juliet Philips, at sustainable investment NGO ShareAction, said: “Until initiatives like those announced by the OGCI are backed up by long-term corporate strategies that are consistent with achieving the Paris treaty, scepticism of their sincerity is inevitable.” Managers of investments totalling more than $2.6tn have already committed to pulling out of fossil fuel companies. Shell CEO, Ben van Beurden, said: “We cannot burn all the hydrocarbons on the planet in an unmitigated way but there is also another truism that there is no alternative to using some hydrocarbons for a very long time to come.”  He said economics would determine which fossil fuels are left in the ground. Amin Nasser, chief executive of Saudi Aramco, said: “Oil will continue to be part of the energy mix for decades to come.” Oil companies are under increasing pressure from both climate change policy and the rise of renewable energy. In October, the International Energy Agency said the rollout of renewables was accelerating and predicted capacity from renewable sources will grow faster than oil, gas, coal or nuclear power in the next five years. On Wednesday, OGCI-member Shell, said oil demand could peak as soon as five years from now, a moment that would herald the end of oil production growth. The OGCI members are BP, CNPC, Eni, Pemex, Reliance Industries, Repsol, Saudi Aramco, Shell, Statoil and Total, but no US oil companies have joined."
"Almost as staggering as the current enormous influx into cities across the globe is the dramatic slowdown in urbanisation that will follow it. The world is literally going to town on urbanisation – but it is a project that is both immense and historically fleeting.  In less than 100 years, the world’s urban population is expected to double to 8 or 9 billion – accounting for the bulk of a projected global population of around 11 billion. Yet in all the centuries that follow this one, cities may add, at most, another billion to their ranks. So if this century is the most urbanising in history, it will also mark the end of humankind’s “great urbanisation” era.  Thus the next few decades will be hugely influential in determining the patterns of production, behaviour and governance that humanity locks into, and the innovative efficiency with which it utilises the earth’s resources. The future of the world’s urban population will mostly be built in our lifetimes.  The consequences of bad government and inaction over planning and urban design will last decades or centuries. Once the urban population is stable, and road, rail and utility networks have been laid down, it will be much harder to undertake reform or retrofit urban infrastructure. This is why the subject deserves the urgent attention of policymakers, academics and business entrepreneurs worldwide. This week, global leaders are meeting in Marrakech for the 22nd UN climate summit (Cop22). They are discussing how to limit greenhouse gas emissions sufficiently to hold global warming well below 2°C, as was agreed a year ago in Paris. If new cities are built on a carbon-intensive, resource-hungry model, then all hope of meeting these ambitious targets will be lost. The good news, however, is that it is possible to meet these targets in a way that improves wellbeing and stimulates global productivity and wealth. Innovative, well-run cities are uniquely placed to solve these major global challenges, in conjunction with national governments. Humans work best in cities, that’s why we’re moving there. The clustering of people generates higher productivity and higher wages. A mix of specialisation and diversity generates a fertile environment for innovation in ideas, technologies and processes. But urbanisation also creates its own problems, in the form of pollution, congestion, poor health, crime and waste. Unregulated, unplanned urban sprawl is often the cheapest option in the short run – but the long-run costs to society, the economy and the environment can be dire. At the UN’s Habitat III conference in Ecuador last month, global leaders and urban experts signed into force the New Urban Agenda, a blueprint for the next 20 years of urban transformation. It set out an ambitious and laudable vision of more compact cities and public transport-based development – but the real test will be in the implementation. Turning words into action requires overcoming domestic opposition and providing finance to the cities most in need. This means recognising that climate action can deliver local benefits to citizens, even in the short term – and it’s why the Paris Agreement, which came into effect last week, set out to bring city actors together with national players through the Global Covenant of Mayors. Already, 7,100 cities from 119 countries have committed to the associated Compact of Mayors for Climate and Energy, pledging to support meeting national targets. With the cost of renewable and energy efficiency technologies having fallen to levels competitive with conventional fuels (even before accounting for the unpriced costs associated with the latter’s use), the opportunities from urban action to reduce emissions becomes plain to see. Be it through investing in electric vehicles, building smart grids, constructing energy-efficient homes, planning limits on urban sprawl, investing in renewable power or providing integrated public transport, such action generates a number of important benefits – not least, tackling the growing and deadly problem of air pollution all over the world. Air pollution costs millions of lives every year. The European Environment Agency estimates that premature deaths resulting from a single particulate pollutant (PM2.5) totalled approximately 432,000 in 2012 in Europe alone, while around 75,000 people die each year as a result of prolonged exposure to NO2 air pollution. A recent study by the World Resources Institute put the health impacts in China of PM2.5 exposure (including premature deaths) at a shocking 10-13% of the country’s annual GDP. Thus, air pollution is one key reason why the Global Commission on the Economy and Climate found that more than half of the reduction in global emissions required to meet an ambitious climate target could generate net benefits to the economy. Implementing policy action to reduce emissions is often easiest at the city level. This means increased effort is required to devolve administration to the urban level and empower cities through greater fiscal autonomy. Things like recycling schemes, energy from waste, broadband networks, integrated public transport systems, “smart” buildings and biking networks are easy to appreciate and can come with popular local support. Local accountability is also a vital part of good governance. In large parts of the world, this means fighting urban corruption and supporting institutional capacity. Corruption stifles incentives to work and innovate, undermining property rights and threatening to usurp the returns to productive activities. This offsets many of the benefits of urban clustering, and risks rendering cities dysfunctional. The tragedy is that some of the poorest cities in the world are also the fastest growing – and they lack the resources and capacity to prevent locking into structures that are inefficient, unreliable and polluting. New mechanisms to finance investments in urban infrastructure and smart technology need to be developed. These may include: greater use of land-value capture mechanisms, where the construction of new transit infrastructure is financed with the profits generated by the increase in land value stimulated by the presence of that infrastructure; municipal bonds such as Johannesburg’s recently issued $136m (£110m) green bond; and the creation of dedicated national, regional or city-level investment platforms as mechanisms for aggregating smaller infrastructure projects and attracting private investment at scale. But successful urbanisation is not just about infrastructure; it’s also about skills. Mexico and Rwanda have invested heavily in urban vocational and technical training. Investment in talent and skills (from jobs training programmes to secondary education) helps raise wages, attract talent and promote urban growth. It also improves the flow of information vital to civic inclusion and effective governance.  In other words, there must be continued innovation in governance and learning from best practice. To learn from each other and demonstrate the benefits of sustainable planning and decarbonisation, urban policymakers should develop and utilise city networks such as C40, the International Council for Local Environmental Initiatives (ICLEI), the Compact of Mayors and United Cities and Local Governments (UCLG), which all facilitate the sharing of experience. Cities are at the heart of the process of human development, innovation and productivity growth. The world is moving to cities, and those we build over the next few decades will broadly define the urban centres we are stuck with for generations to come. Cities that are poorly planned risk leaving humanity with a hostile and potentially deadly climate. The clock is ticking. Humanity has a narrow window of time in which to plan and design its future. That opportunity must not – and need not – be squandered.

"Carnegie Wave Energy’s offshore energy-generating infrastructure is purposefully inconspicuous. Its patented CETO buoys, which resemble large circular tanks, are tethered to an anchor in the seafloor and remain fully submerged, out of sight. It’s a design feature that prioritises long-term survival in the ocean over  efficiency in converting energy, says Michael Ottaviano, Carnegie’s managing director.  “You could have the most efficient technology, but if it dies after the first big storm then it’s worth nothing,” he says. “We never breach the surface. We can simply ride under a large wave as it comes through, and we follow the peak and the trough up and down.” This rise and fall movement is the basis of Carnegie’s world-leading wave energy technology. The movement, in harmony with ocean swells, drives a pump attached to the tether. In its next-generation CETO 6 buoys, a system contained inside the tank will convert that pressurised fluid into clean electricity, which is carried onshore by a cable. Formed in 2006, the Australian-listed company has just launched its $90m (£60m) commercial wave energy project in Cornwall in the United Kingdom, after receiving $15.5m (£9.5m) from the European Regional Development Fund for the first phase.  Cornwall’s wave hub is billed as “the world’s largest and most technologically advanced site for the testing and development of offshore renewable energy technology”, and the funding is a significant boost for Carnegie’s global expansion plans. The project is to begin immediately, with commissioning set for 2018, followed by 12 months of operations. It all began off the West Australian coast. After developing the technology, Carnegie deployed the world’s first grid-connected wave energy array on Garden Island in 2015, with $13m in support from the Australian Renewable Energy Agency (Arena). Three CETO 5 buoys, each seven metres in diameter, generated clean power and desalinated drinking water for the country’s largest naval base. The array, which has since been decommissioned, operated over 12 months for a cumulative 14,000 hours. It set a world record for a grid-connected wave energy system. Carnegie’s next objective is to build the world’s first wave-solar-battery microgrid on Garden Island. Stage one will feature a 2 MW solar PV array and a 2 MW/0.5 MWh battery storage system. The $7.5m microgrid is expected to be operational by mid 2017, and recently received $2.5m in support from Arena. Carnegie hopes to plug into the system between one and three of its new CETO 6 buoys by the end of 2017. Larger than their predecessors, each CETO 6 unit has diameter of 20 metres, a generating capacity of 1MW, and has been designed to last for 12 months. The cost of the whole demonstration will be between A$35 and $40m, says Ottaviano. The microgrid is designed to operate “on-grid” and in “island mode”. Ottaviano says it will be “critical” for showcasing Carnegie’s technology and capability to potential buyers, including foreign governments and utility operators, and fringe-of-grid communities in Australia. The company sees islands as a major prospective market, as they tend to have good wave resources but expensive power, due to heavy reliance on imported fossil fuels. They have high CO2 emissions and can be exposed to energy security and price volatility risks. Ottaviano says wave energy can complement solar and wind on islands as it’s predictable, fairly consistent around the clock and doesn’t require precious land. But after detailed investigation of some island markets, Carnegie decided it wasn’t enough to simply sell clients a wave energy system without a game plan for integrating it and scaling up renewable energy penetration more broadly. So the company made a strategic decision to expand into microgrids – a market estimated to be worth up to $40bn by 2020. Earlier this year, Carnegie paid $17.5m for Energy Made Clean, an Australian microgrid company with a track record of delivering clean energy projects. Along with the Cornwall project, Carnegie has been working with the government in Mauritius – an island nation of about 1.3 million people in the Indian Ocean – using funding from Australia’s Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade. Ottaviano says this work has involved assessing the country’s wave resources, designing a roadmap for transitioning to greater than 60% clean energy, and designing a microgrid. In September, Carnegie signalled its intention to expand its wave and microgrid operations into Sri Lanka, signing a memorandum of understanding with Lanka Energy Conservation based in Colombo. Ottaviano says the objective is to build microgrids initially focused on solar, wind and battery technologies, but in locations with good wave resources, which will allow CETO systems to be integrated once they become more cost competitive in a “three-to-five-year horizon”.  He says Carnegie would design and finance these microgrid systems and sell power over the system’s 20-year lifespan: “It’s a true win-win. They get something that’s cleaner, cheaper, more secure and costs them less than what they’re currently getting [in diesel] and costs them nothing up front.” Stephen Doig is a managing director at the US-based Rocky Mountain Institute, where he is helping island economies transition to renewable energy. He says renewables offer a number of advantages over diesel for islands, including “lower costs, lower volatility of costs, reduced CO2 emissions, greater energy security and equal or improved reliability”.  Wind and solar are the “frontrunners in many regions” and further cost reductions will keep them competitive into the future, Doig says.  He says wave energy can be “a fairly low energy density resource in many places so can require a fair amount of infrastructure”.   “The question is whether there is a realistic roadmap to get to low costs.”  Ivor Frischknecht, CEO of Arena, says if wave, solar and wind can all be generated in one place, there’s a good chance the network would have a higher level of reliability and a “much lower level of required storage”.  Prospective customers “might actually think about having a network with three or four or even more forms of renewable generation, even if one or two of them are much more expensive than the others”.  “Really, all it needs to be is cheaper than diesel,” he says. “I think [Carnegie] have a pretty good chance of getting to that point.”"
"On 28 April 1975, Newsweek ran a story on page 64 that became one of its most popular. Under the headline, “The Cooling World”, the story ran for just nine paragraphs but suggested the world could be heading for a major cooling phase, putting food production at risk.  The story is one of Newsweek’s most cited not because it was right, nor because it was a glowing example of great science journalism, but because it has been used so often by climate science deniers.  In short, their argument goes: “Hey, look … experts were wrong before and they might be wrong now about all this global warming alarmism.”  Queensland’s One Nation senator Malcolm Roberts quoted the Newsweek story in his 42-page climate science denial tome launched at Parliament House this week. The journalist who wrote the article, Peter Gwynne, reflected a couple of years ago on how climate science deniers had used his story. He wrote: I accept that I didn’t tell the full story back then. Indeed, the issue raises questions about the relationship between science writers and scientists as well as the attitudes toward science of individuals with political agendas. Roberts’ press conference sparked a discussion on social media that raised just the sort of questions Gwynne has talked about. Should people like Roberts be ignored? Even if they are a senator, does that mean journalists have a duty to report what they say? If they do cover the story, how should it be done? Journalists have a tendency to look for stories that are out of the ordinary and search out views that are different. This is exactly what happened in the 1970s. But even then, most scientists publishing research on the future of the climate thought it was going to get warmer.  Researchers looked at scientific papers published between 1965 and 1979. Across all the relevant papers, only seven predicted global cooling. Some 20 papers took a neutral stance on future temperatures, with 44 predicting temperatures would rise. This research is well known. It was published in 2008. Anyone seeking an honest conversation would refer to it. The document Roberts brought to parliament was well stocked with his usual claims and covered much of the ground he previously trampled in his maiden speech. Roberts was flanked by the Canadian geology professor Tim Ball, who also rejects the thesis that humans cause climate change, and the US-based blogger Tony Heller. Both helped him write the report. The report cites a 2009 study by three contrarian scientists that claimed most of the recent warming (which elsewhere the report argues isn’t real) was down to natural fluctuations of the El Niño/La Niña climate phenomenon. But Roberts does not mention the follow-up research by a more experienced team of scientists which found that the original study’s conclusion was “not supported by their analysis or any physical theory presented in their paper, especially as the analysis method itself eliminates the influence of trends on the purported correlations”. Why cite one study but not the other? Roberts claims the UN’s intergovernmental panel on climate change specifically “ignore[s] natural drivers” of the climate system. This is entirely false. The IPCC collates scientific research that looks at human drivers of climate change (the release of greenhouse gases from fossil fuel burning being a main one) in the context of natural fluctuations.  Roberts’ report says the natural and seasonal fluctuations in the levels of CO2 recorded in the atmosphere “clearly overrides human production”.  Yet his chart shows CO2 peaking higher each year. What is causing the rapidly rising background trend?  Why only show four years of data when there are more than 50 years of data available? 50+ years data show CO2 steadily rising due to human emissions, so Malcolm Roberts uses just 4 years to bogusly claim opposite. #auspol pic.twitter.com/0EuB7d0Hqg Roberts claims the natural fluctuation in the atmospheric levels of CO2 shows that “carbon dioxide cannot drive temperature”.  But the reason that CO2 levels in the atmosphere change seasonally is mostly down to the photosynthesis of plants (uptake and respiration). The variations also depend on where you take your measurements. Roberts’s report implies the rise in CO2 in the atmosphere might not be from fossil fuels but instead could be from volcanoes because they carry the same chemical signature.  But various studies have shown that humans emit about 50 or 60 times more CO2 annually than volcanoes.  Roberts’ arguments are all over the place. At times the report argues against itself. The Queensland senator has said he has asked the government’s scientific agencies for “empirical evidence” that CO2 is causing climate change – evidence he claims does not exist. When he has been shown the real-world evidence, he either ignores it, constructs faulty arguments to discount it or comes up with a one-size-fits-all conspiracy theory to explain why we’re all being conned. Roberts tends to attack journalists he doesn’t like.  In his report he list journalists he says “show the courage to research the evidence”, naming the likes of Alan Jones, News Corp and Sky News commentator Andrew Bolt, and Graham Lloyd and Chris Kenny of the Australian. In the US, where much of the climate science denial machinery has its base, the same groups who have funded organisations pushing climate science denial have started to pour money into journalism. There is now a network of outlets stridently pro-climate science denial. So how should we all deal with this?  The Guardian writer George Monbiot has written that if “humanity fails to prevent climate breakdown” then much fault should lie at the feet of the media. If journalists aspire to protect the public, then producing stories that allow debunked climate science denial talking points to hang in the air like a bad smell is not going to cut it. What happens if journalists fail to give context, fail to expose potential vested interests or fail to distinguish between genuine expertise and fringe beliefs? The impact is not benign. Instead of protecting the public interest, we can end up doing harm."
"“Last December we had temperatures of 25C. Normally it is 1 or 2C at that time of year,” says Mohammed Ibrahimi, a farmer with one hectare of apple trees in Boumia, a village near Midelt in Morocco. “These trees need at least 1,200 hours of near-freezing temperatures in the winter to help them to regenerate. This year they flowered very late; the harvest was a month late and I harvested just 20 tonnes when I’d expected 40 tonnes.”  The town of Midelt sits 1,600m above sea level on a vast barren plain sandwiched between the Middle Atlas mountain range to the north and the High Atlas to the south. One of the highest mountains in north Africa, Jbel Ayachi, looms snow-clad over the town. Due to its altitude, Midelt is well-suited to apples, and plantations are scattered all over the plains. But farmers are already abandoning their orchards. “When we were kids the mountains had snow on them until at least June, sometimes even all year. We had ample underground water sources. We used to have to dig about 4m down to find water – now it can be [many times deeper]. How can we irrigate our crops with that?” says Ibrahimi. Like most African countries, Morocco – where 40% of the population still works the land – is already feeling the impacts of climate change on its agricultural production. Last year, during the exceptional season Ibrahimi describes – caused in large part by the regular El Niño weather pattern – Morocco went without rain for more than two months. Overall it received 42.7% less rain during its main planting season than in an average year. The impact on the harvest was catastrophic, particularly on the “zone bour” (dry zone) areas where crops such as wheat, barley and maize are planted. Ministry of Agriculture estimates predicted total output falling 70% on the 2015 season. “Starting from the early 1990s, we’ve seen on average 15% to 20% less rain annually than previously,” says Mohamed Ait Kadi, president of Morocco’s General Council of Agricultural Development. “The rain now comes in showers instead of sustained downpours, and we see arid areas spreading.” As the host country for the COP22 climate change talks, which open in Marrakech on Monday, Morocco is determined to make this meeting the “African COP”. Explaining its own experience and acting as an advocate for other African countries, Morocco wants to put the impacts of erratic weather patterns on agriculture at the heart of the discussions. No-one is underestimating the challenges. Water stress, land degradation, rising temperatures and deforestation are all playing a role. Areas such as the Sahel – including Chad, Niger and Mali – have experienced recurring droughts every few years since the 1980s, devastating harvests, economies and traditional farming ecosystems. In 2010 at least 7 million people across the Sahel were threatened with severe hunger and needed emergency food aid from humanitarian organisations. According to the journal Nature, the viability of all crops in the Sahel belt will become questionable, with maize being the worst affected. By 2090 some 60% of land available for bean production will become unsuitable. Southern and eastern Africa have all suffered catastrophic droughts over the last few years.  Morocco is using the COP22 conference to formally launch its “Adaptation of African Agriculture” (AAA) initiative. As food security becomes increasingly challenged by erratic weather patterns, the initiative proposes measures such as improved soil management, water and irrigation management and better weather forecasting and insurance programmes for farmers affected by drought.  Although the initiative has received some criticism as some of its focus appears to replicate the work already being done by other pan-African agriculture programmes, Morocco believes its main contribution can be to persuade world leaders to sign up to a concrete plan of how to divide up the $100bn (£81bn) promised to support adaptation and mitigation projects in developing countries.  “We have to translate the big ideas written in western offices about responses to climate change into something that actually changes the lives of small farmers,” said Morocco’s minister of Agriculture and Fisheries, Aziz Akannouch, at a recent conference launching the AAA. “It’s about pragmatic responses – things like irrigation projects, developing oases, improving access to fertilisers and credit.” For Bruce Campbell, director of the global programme on climate change, agriculture and food security, better management of water sources will be crucial. Just 3.3% of arable land (approx 6 million hectares) in sub-Saharan Africa is irrigated, compared to 37% in Asia. In Morocco too, despite huge gains in increasing commercial agricultural outputs through mechanisation and improved use of fertilisers, an estimated 85% of agricultural land is still dependent on the skies. “One of the things which could really make a difference for small-scale farmers is better weather forecasting information in local languages,” says Campbell. “All farmers should have known that an El Niño event was expected in 2015-16, and they could have saved their seeds and inputs for a better year.”  Back in Boumia, as we warm up with a mint tea and msmen – a traditional Moroccan flatbread served with honey – after a bracing walk in the fields, the apple farmers chew over what all this can mean for them. “I don’t think we’ll ever return to how it was before,” says Ibrahimi, “but it’s not too late. The most important thing is to stop any further damage immediately. And then we need developed countries to take responsibility for the damage they have done.” "
"   In the displacement camps of north-east Nigeria, most residents have the same answer for why 2.6 million people have been forced from their homes in this region. They are running from Boko Haram, the jihadist militants who still control significant parts of the Lake Chad basin.  But ask about how Boko Haram gained momentum in the first place, and a more complex narrative emerges. The extremists capitalised on high levels of local poverty, alienation and unemployment in north-east Nigeria. And that in turn, many local residents argue, was fuelled – in part – by the shrinking of Lake Chad, and the desertification of the surrounding area. With global temperatures soaring ever higher, it’s a trend unlikely to be reversed any time soon. “It’s affected our livelihood, it’s affected farming and fishing,” says Mustapha Ali, a 50-year-old who grew up close to the lake’s former shores, and who is now living in a camp for internally displaced people. “We used to farm watermelon here, wheat, and rice – but because of the shrinkage of the lake, we can’t any more. Little by little it became harder and harder to [irrigate the] farm.” Since the 1970s, global warming has caused the lake to shrink by around 90%. Once one of the world’s biggest lakes, at 25,000 sq km, it is now less than 2,500 sq km. Towns that Ali remembers reaching by boat can now be reached by car. At least one settlement has even been built on land that used to be underwater, Ali says. For residents like Ali, the desperation caused by the shrinking of the lake was clearly a contributing factor to the rise of extremism. “It’s helped the rise of Boko Haram,” Ali adds. “A lot of the youth there were unemployed, and when they have nothing to do, Boko Haram becomes an option. If you’re wealthy and you have things to do, you don’t want things like [Boko Haram] to happen.” Patrick Kingsley at Lake Chad The Iditarod Trail Sled dog race is a fabled 1,000-mile-long trek through Alaska’s frozen wilderness, held annually since 1967. Unusually warm weather prompted a change in the starting location for last year’s race, while 7,000 gallons of snow was shipped in ahead of this year’s event in case of a lack of powder. The race, held in March, followed Alaska’s second warmest winter on record – the latest in a string of warm winters. Chas St George, chief operations officer at the Iditarod trail committee, said: “You have ups and downs in terms of snow but this year and the year before were very mild in terms of weather and snowfall. Our creeks are flowing earlier and we are also getting more sun, which provides its own challenge for the people racing. “Last year we staged the race out of Fairbanks because of a lack of snow, which is quite a distance further north. It’s cooler there, there’s more snow. We’ve only been forced to do that kind of thing in the last few years. There are times when these teams run on no snow at all. The question is whether you have enough snow at the start, until you get to the interior. “This year for the ceremonial start, where people come out to watch the teams through Anchorage, we had to shorten the course from 11 miles to three miles. That was for safety reasons because there was only enough snow to get to a certain point. We haven’t had to shorten the course like that before. “When it thaws and then freezes, all what’s left is ground that is still frozen, it’s very slick ice. It becomes a safety issue. People want to go as far as they can, that’s what they do this for, but they were very understanding. I’m sure the dogs were disappointed. “We did have a contingency to get more snow in by rail this past year. It wasn’t needed though, we had enough snow, thank goodness. In parts of the course there was very little snow and then suddenly a huge amount of it hit. “In Alaska there’s a ton of research that shows we are sort of at ground zero here [for climate change]. There’s been a clear warming trend. I don’t see significant changes to the race in the next couple of years but over the next 20 to 30 years we might have to look at it through a different lens. We may have to do things differently. But we want to keep this tradition going.” Oliver Milman in New York Rodion Sulyandziga, who runs the Moscow-based Center for Support of Indigenous Peoples of the North, says climate change is now one of the key challenges facing Siberia’s numerous indigenous communities. Many ordinary Russians laugh at the idea of global warming as a threat, pointing out that much of the country would benefit from warmer temperatures. But melting permafrost could create real problems for communities in the far north of the country. “Climate change is already here and is already affecting the lives of most of the indigenous community populations in the far north and Siberia, in various different ways,” said Sulyandziga. The dangers were brought into sharp focus earlier this year when an anthrax outbreak hit the Yamal peninsula which killed a child, left 23 people dead and also killed more than 2,000 reindeer. The Arctic region is mainly populated by nomadic reindeer herders. There have been discussions about reducing the reindeer population to insure against future outbreaks, with radical suggestions including culling 200,000 animals. The working hypothesis for the deaths is that the infection was started when the corpses of reindeer that died many years ago were uncovered due to melting permafrost. This summer was abnormally warm in Yamal. “At a governmental level, it’s really important that Russia ratifies the Paris agreement and gets to work on developing a national strategy,” said Sulyandziga. “But we are also trying to work on strategies in each region, and make sure local indigenous communities are involved, to help protect these traditional ways of life.”  Sulyandziga’s centre works to ensure representatives of the communities themselves also have a say in discussions with authorities on how to mitigate the consequences of climate change. Fighting for indigenous rights is not always easy in Russia: Sulyandziga has been, on various occasions, fined, banned from leaving the country, and forced to declare his organisation a “foreign agent”. Shaun Walker in Moscow In the town of Phalodi, surrounded by the Rajasthani deserts of western India, the mercury hit 51C in May, the highest recorded temperature in Asia since 1956. As a result, people generally stopped working during the main heat of the day. Firoz Khan, a nurse in the local hospital recalls that life in the village came to a standstill. “It was difficult even to leave the house,” he said. “Everyone was fretting.” The 100,000 residents of Phalodi are used to extreme heat in the summers, but this year was exceptionally bad, and the normal working routine was disrupted. “It was very, very hot. You’d start sweating if you stepped out of your house,” Khan recalled.  “In fact, most people only worked in the mornings, from dawn until 10-11am, and then they’d have to stay in all day because of the heat. Then around 5-6pm, people would leave home again and do a few more hours of work. Farmers lost around half their crop because of the heat this year. But at the time, they didn’t care. They just wanted to sit indoors, under the fan or air conditioner.” At the hospital where he works, Khan saw dozens of people coming in with heatstroke. “They just couldn’t take it. People were vomiting, they were suffering from diarrhoea or dysentery, and they were finding it difficult to urinate. A handful of people from the town died because of the heat. They were older people, including a couple of women. For others, it was too hot, even to leave home to come to the hospital.” Schools were forced to close down, or send children home after a few hours of study, at 11am.  In the surrounding villages water shortages devastated crops. “There was enough water to drink from the rainwater harvesting tanks, but those who rear animals really suffered because there wasn’t enough water for them,” said Khan. Vidhi Doshi in Mumbai French winemakers joke about harvesting grapes on skis. But Fredrik Slotte, 36, who has 850 vines on his farm in Finland, has the last laugh. Last autumn at a festival in the US his sparkling wines won a gold medal, beating competition from 2,000 wines from 12 countries, including French champagne.  “It is great to see that Finland can compete in blind tastings with France,” Slotte said.  This summer has been a particularly good one for grapes on the Baltic island of Åland, where Slotte has his vineyard. The spring came early, and there was no frost. May was very warm, so the flowering started quickly in June. “We got a long period from the flowering to the harvest, and it was very dry,” Slotte said. “During the maturing process I want the grapes to be as concentrated as possible, and every drop of rain dilutes my wine and risks mould.” Slotte has been growing grapes in Finland since 1998, when everyone thought he was “crazy”. But with an embryonic commercial wine industry in neighbouring Sweden and Denmark, no one thinks that any more. Swedish winegrowers say that, thanks to climate change, they now have an extra month in the growing season each summer compared to 40 years ago, when the Septembers were not as warm as they are today. Some growers can even harvest their grapes at the end of August.  Ironically, while his grapes did well this year, Slotte was hit because he also grows wheat, which suffered from the heat and dryness. But he is expecting a good vintage from 2016.  “There are a lot of factors in making good wine, not just climate change,” he said. “But if you want a deep style with a lot of body, you want a good year like this.” David Crouch in Gothenburg Thailand suffered its worst drought in two decades this year, focused in the country’s arid north-east where reservoirs are at record low levels. Arkom Kammag, 37, grows figs and raspberries for a family business in Nakhon Ratchasima, one of the worst-hit provinces. The rainy season brought some relief this year but just ended, he said, and it started late. During the toughest months, mud – not water – was coming out of the taps. “Trees were drying up and some grew really, really slowly,” he said. “It’s difficult to live in this kind of hot and dry weather.” Kammag and his family used to stock up on fresh rainwater to drink but for the first time they’ve had to buy it. Resorting to underground wells after surface water dried up, he also ran an expensive pump for eight hours a day. Many farmers have been pushed into debt. The world’s second-largest sugar and rice exporter, Thailand saw a cut in production for both crops after four consecutive years of below-average rainfall. The government has spent more than £500m to help farmers. It has imposed water rationing in some provinces and hotels have been told to minimise their laundry loads. And China, which dammed much of the upper Mekong river, agreed to release torrents of water to help Thai farmers downstream. Thailand’s “Royal Rainmakers”, pilots who spray clouds with salt and chemicals to encourage them to rain, were deployed – but many reported the clouds were too thin to work with. At the annual Songkran festival in April, which transforms the streets of Bangkok into a giant water fight during the peak of the dry season, city officials tried to convince revellers to save water. They shortened the festival from four to three days. “This is partly symbolic, but we hope to save water too because our lakes have become deserts,” deputy Bangkok governor, Amorn Kijchawengjul, said at the time. “We don’t want city folk splashing water around carelessly while farmers struggle.” Oliver Holmes in Bangkok Vivien Thomson, 51, is a wool, lamb, cattle and hay farmer in central New South Wales in Australia, and an experienced firefighter. She lives there with her husband Robert Flint, 55, and her youngest son Shaun Flint, who is just finishing school this year. The hottest year on record hit them hard, Thompson says. But it’s just another step in a scorching trend that she’s been dealing with for years. “You expect to get one, two, maybe three days above 40C,” she said. “But this year the heat was relentless. There never seemed to be a break. And then it all stopped – bang – and you go from one extreme to another.” Thompson said it makes life on the farm hard for everyone – and everything. “It affects your capacity to do so much. And for me, more importantly, it affects the welfare of the animals on my farm,” she said. Like people, they don’t like to move around during the hottest times. And as the hot periods extend, she said the periods of the day when she can move the animals for a feed becomes shorter and shorter, making their management harder and harder. But even more worryingly, dealing with water through such hot and variable weather becomes a nightmare. Thompson said a cow might normally drink 20 litres of water a day. But on an extremely hot day it can be as much as 100 litres. “So you have 100 cows, each drinking between 40 and 80 litres extra each day – those dams are going to to drop pretty quickly,” she said. To cope with that, she had to move all the cattle to the paddocks where the dams still had some water. At one point, of her 35 paddocks, only two of them had dams with any water left in them. But then the weather went from one extreme to another. She was moving her stock to paddocks that had access to bore water when suddenly a storm rolled in. “It only lasted for 15 minutes, my vehicle was aquaplaning across the paddocks, and by the time it was finished, every dam was full. I’d ridden the whole farm that morning and literally two of the 35 paddocks had water.” Moving the stock from one paddock to another to follow remaining water is what she describes as “reactive” managing of the extreme heat. But she’s also planning on longer timescales. Because the seasons aren’t predictable anymore, they are planting their hay crops in three batches, hedging their bets. “So at least one will probably be productive,” she said. Hovering over all of the animal and crop management issues is a big worry for Thompson: fire. She used to be a professional firefighter and still has a foot in the industry. She said she’s always had a plan to fight fire when it approached her property, but the fire-weather has become so bad recently, that she no longer thinks she can always do that. “My husband is also a very experienced firefighter and we always believe we stand a reasonable chance. But there was one day a couple of years ago where the conditions were such that, we looked at each other and said for the first time in our lives: if there’s a fire, we walk. We’re not going to even try to fight it.” “We had never felt like that before,” she said. Michael Slezak Peter Phiri, a businessman in Lilongwe, Malawi, said: “It is always hot here but this year El Niño has made it worse. Last year we had floods and we lost crops. This year we had no rain. Two years’ harvests have been hit hard and it has been disastrous for many people. Because 90% of Malawians are farmers, nearly half the country will need help with food.  “The lack of rain means we have water shortages and the rivers and lakes are low and the hydroelectric power does not work. There are long power cuts. People in rural areas do not have electricity, but in the cities this means homes and offices do not have air conditioning and people have no way to keep cool. “Old people say it is hotter now than years ago but it is hard for me to tell. The rains are about to come and the temperature reaches 38, 40C or more. Then it cools. “One reason for the heat could be that people have cut down trees to make charcoal to earn money to eat, or to cure tobacco. Another could be climate change. The cities may be getting hotter because they are growing in size and people live in concrete houses. “Over the last 10 years people have noticed that the seasons are changing. In the past the rains would come in October. Now it is November. The ‘lean’ season when people have less food to eat used to last three months. Now it starts early and lasts longer.” John Vidal For five years, the farmers of Poço Redondo have suffered from a drought that has devastated the crops of corn and beans on which they depend. But in 2016 the situation deteriorated, according to Sival Lima de Jesus. The smallholder in this poor north-west corner of Brazil says his fields have had fewer than 10 days rain since January, which has made the earth so dry it is impossible to plough.  “This year was much worse than last,” he said. “We plant everything and harvest nothing. We now just try to plant hay for the livestock, but even that hasn’t been possible for many people this year. There is a huge lack of water and food for the animals.” He said his small community of about 280 families now depends almost entirely on the milk from their cows, though even that has reduced dramatically - from 230 litres a day eight years ago to 30 litres a day now - as a result of the harsh climate.  “Economically it is terrible,” he laments. “At least 30% of the livestock have gone, either starved or died.”  He and his neighbours rely more heavily than ever on bolsa familia poverty relief payments from the government, though he said these have been cut for many families. Making matters worse, young people, who used to travel to the cities for work, are starting to return because there are so many lay-offs in the midst of Brazil’s recession.  “People are starting to go hungry,” the farmer said. “It’s been years since we have seen people begging around here, but we have started to see this again.” Jonathan Watts"
"There has arguably not been a US presidential election with so much at stake for the rest of the world since the second world war.   One candidate stands largely for continuity, signalling she would do slightly more than her predecessor to shore up the existing liberal world order.  Her opponent is vowing to turn that order on its head, jettisoning alliances and free trade agreements, while seeking to cut deals with the world’s authoritarian powers. If Donald Trump is elected on Tuesday, it is likely to trigger a foreign policy crisis inside Washington, as the diplomatic and security establishments scramble to discover whether he meant what he said on the campaign trail. Those who believe that the election talk was all bluster and that Trump will tack back to a more traditional Republican foreign policy once elected are likely to be disappointed, according to Thomas Wright, an analyst at the Brookings Institution in Washington.   “My view is he is a more ideological candidate than we often appreciate and while there is a lot of bluster and a lot of ignorance on a wide number of issues, there are certain things that he has been pretty consistent on,” Wright said. “I think he is opposed to US alliances ... and I think he would try to withdraw the US from security commitments around the world. He is anti-trade and he would veer towards a more mercantilist system, and he is pro-Russian – he is pro-authoritarian.”   Some believe that Trump would be confronted with a series of resignations by diplomats and generals if he tried to turn these campaign platforms into administration policy.   If, on the other hand, Hillary Clinton wins the electoral college vote, she will face the opposite dilemma: how to distinguish her foreign policy from Barack Obama’s. She has expressed an inclination toward a tougher stance in Syria and in Europe, for example, but the wiggle-room for a change of policy has shrunk with every passing week as Vladimir Putin has sought to create new facts on the ground in the last stages of the Obama era. More weeks would go by while a new Clinton administration dives into an inevitable policy review.   However, events around the globe may not wait that long. Whoever sits down at the desk in the Oval Office on 20 January next year may be forced to take some of the toughest decisions any US president has taken, much sooner than he or she would want. US power and influence is being challenged around the world at an accelerating rate, and nowhere more so than on the Korean peninsula. The North Korean leader, Kim Jong-un, has sped up tests of nuclear weapons and the missiles to deliver them. Expert opinion varies on whether his technicians have succeeded in making a nuclear warhead small enough to put atop a missile, and there is a general consensus that if they have not done so yet, they will soon. It is also widely anticipated that in the next few years, North Korea will perfect an intercontinental ballistic missile capable of reaching the US west coast. Former and current US administrations have taken the strategic decision that Pyongyang should be prevented from reaching that point, by force if necessary. But the ultimate decision will most likely be taken by the next president. Clinton’s foreign policy advisers have signalled that she would focus on the looming Korean crisis early in her term in office, reassuring Japan and South Korea that the US will not abandon them, and seeking to put pressure on China to enforce UN-mandated trade sanctions more effectively. That may well not succeed, leaving a Clinton administration with the choice of agreeing to a resumption of dialogue with Pyongyang and accepting its nuclear weapons status, as long as it restricts missile development. If that were possible, it would alarm US allies who are already within North Korean missile range. American allies are likely to reach that point of alarm far more quickly if Trump reaches the Oval Office. He has questioned the value of US alliances in the region, and he has floated the possibility that countries like Japan or South Korea should develop their own nuclear weapons rather than rely on the US strategic umbrella. If he sticks to that policy in office, there could be a sudden nuclear arms race in north-east Asia and possibly beyond. Ultimately, a Trump administration would have to face the direct threat of a North Korean long-range missile. He has said he would put more pressure on China to get tough with its neighbour, and he has said he is willing to meet Kim in the US, on the grounds “there’s a 10% or a 20% chance that I can talk him out of those damn nukes”. Failing that, he has signalled he is quite willing to contemplate using the US nuclear arsenal. If the weapons cannot be used, he asked: “Then why are we making them? Why do we make them?”  Within his or her first year in office, a new US president would also face a direct challenge to US power in the western Pacific. The Chinese programme of laying claim to reefs and rocks in the South China Sea and turning them into naval and air bases gives Beijing potential control over some the busiest shipping lanes in the world. US influence is under further threat by the rise of Rodrigo Duterte in the Philippines, who has threatened to eject US troops, casting doubt on his predecessor’s agreement to allow new permanent American presence.  Clinton’s likely policy will be to continue Obama’s faltering “pivot to Asia”, and to prioritise restoring the faith of US allies in the region that Washington will help them resist Chinese attempts to dominate the South China Sea. It is a policy that is held hostage to some extent by Duterte’s ultimate intentions, and it could lead to a rapid escalation of tension in the region.  Trump has pointed to the Chinese reef-building programme as a reflection of US weakness but has not said what he would do about it. He has focused more on the threat posed to the US by its trade relations with China. In the transactional model of foreign relations Trump favours, he could agree to turn a blind eye to creeping Chinese takeover in the South China Sea in exchange for a bilateral trade deal with Beijing on better terms.  A new US president will arrive in office at a time of significant military advances against Islamic State in Syria and neighbouring Iraq, but diminishing options when it comes to helping shape the opposition battle against the Assad regime and its Russian and Iranian backers. It is possible that the rebel stand in Aleppo will have fallen by then, giving the regime the upper hand and postponing yet again any hopes of a political transition. In the presidential debates, Clinton talked of establishing a “no-fly zone” or a “safe zone” inside Syria. However, it is hard to see how that would be done without risking a direct clash with Russia, with all the risks that entails. The generals at the Pentagon, who have long argued against the feasibility of establishing such a zone, would work hard to block such a scheme. A Clinton White House is also likely to explore ways of increasing the flow of arms to moderate opposition groups. Trump has indicated that he would seek to work with Assad and Putin in a combined fight against Isis, and has not voiced criticism of the bombardment of rebel-held areas such as eastern Aleppo. That policy would also have heavy costs. The Syrian opposition and the Gulf states would see it as a betrayal, and the new administration would have to deal with the reality that neither the regime nor Russia has much immediate interest in fighting Isis. A Clinton administration is expected to take a tougher line with Moscow than the Obama White House, all the more so because of the substantial evidence of the Kremlin’s efforts to try to intervene in the US presidential election in her opponent’s favour. Clinton could well seek to take a leadership role in negotiations with Moscow over Ukraine and the stalled Minsk peace process, which have hitherto been left to Germany and France. She could also opt to send lethal aid to Ukraine as a way of increasing US leverage. Trump is likely to take the opposite approach. He avoided criticism of Russia for its actions in Ukraine, hinted he might accept the annexation of Crimea, and ignored US intelligence findings that Moscow was behind the hacking of Democratic party’s email. A Trump administration is unlikely to contest Russian enforcement of its influence in eastern Ukraine. Clinton aides have signalled consistently that one of her priorities would be to show US willingness to shore up EU and Nato cohesion, and will attend summits of both organisations in February. Trump has suggested, by contrast, that Nato is obsolete and questioned whether its security commitments in Europe are worth what the US is currently spending on them. He said he would check whether US allies “fulfilled their obligation to us” before coming to their defence, calling into question the purpose of the defence pact. Later in the campaign, he changed tack, saying he would seek to strengthen the alliance, but a win for Trump on Tuesday would nonetheless deepen anxiety in eastern European countries, such as the Baltic states, that a US-led Nato would come to their defence in the face of Russian encroachment.  The two major free trade projects of the Obama administration, the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership with Europe (TTIP) and the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) with the countries on the Pacific rim, will probably still be under negotiation when the new president comes into office, giving him or her the option of killing or completing them. Clinton first supported the TPP and then criticised it in the face of the primary challenge from Bernie Sanders. Her reservations may prolong the negotiations, but she is ultimately expected to pursue and seek completion of the ambitious multilateral trade deals. Trump built his campaign on opposition to all such deals, which he has characterised as inherently unfavourable to the US. He has promised to seek bilateral trade deals on better terms and to punish other countries deemed to be trading unfairly with sanctions, ignoring the threat of retaliation.  Trump has promised to withdraw the US from the Paris climate accord, which comes into force on Friday, and to “stop all payments of US tax dollars to UN global warming programs”. The Republican presidential nominee has said he’s “not a believer in climate change”, describing it as a Chinese-created hoax, and has castigated efforts to reduce greenhouse gases as a risk to American jobs. The prospect of Trump in the Oval Office poses a unique challenge to the Paris deal, which was struck last year and ratified in speedy fashion in October. A total of 94 nations have fully signed up to a commitment to keep global temperatures below a 2C increase on pre-industrial times, in the hope of staving off catastrophic sea level rises, heatwaves and extreme weather. The emissions cuts pledged by countries currently aren’t enough to avoid climate calamity, meaning that recalcitrance from the US, the world’s second-largest emitter and the “global leader” in fighting climate change, according to Barack Obama, would risk ossifying a process that needs a further hefty shove. American involvement in the Paris deal – which has the support of nearly 200 other countries – is based upon the presidential scrawl of Obama. The accord wasn’t presented to Congress as a formal treaty, meaning that Trump could undo it himself. Extricating the US from the deal, along with its financial support of countries particularly vulnerable to climate change, would take some time, however. Now the agreement is in force, any signatory nation faces a three-year delay before it could opt out, with a further one-year wait as the process plays out. “That means,” said Robert Stavins, an expert at environmental law at Harvard University, “it would be impossible for a President Trump to remove the United States during what would be his first term.” But the uncertainty would undoubtably spook countries that rushed to embrace the Paris deal after the US and China, the world’s two greenhouse gas superpowers, jointly announced they were committed to the process last year. Some countries, aware of the dangers of climate change, may redouble their efforts to slash emissions but others may use it as a convenient excuse to slack off. Trump’s antipathy to climate action is underscored by fierce support for fossil fuels, telling coal miners that he will “put you back to work” and that “gas will be a beautiful thing” in his administration. It’s also likely that he would scrap Obama’s Clean Power Plan, the centerpiece policy to curb emissions from power plants, and allow projects such as the controversial Dakota Access pipeline, in which he is indirectly invested. US emissions, which have begun to level off in recent years, could start climbing again.  "
"When it looked like the news couldn’t get any worse, it did: worse in a way that dwarfed our petty elections and clueless, pendulum analyses, worse in a way that dusted the present with the irrelevance of history. In the journal Science Advances, five of the world’s most eminent climatologists warned of the possibility that warming may be significantly worse than we thought. Previous consensus was that the Earth’s average temperature would go up by between 2.6C - life-altering but manageable - and 4.8C - cataclysmic. Now, the range suggested by one projection goes up to 7.4C, which is “game over” by the 22nd century. It relates to the US because their incoming president has promised actively, determinedly to bring about the worst-case scenario, acting on the now familiar, pre-enlightenment logic that because it’s beyond the limits of his intellect to comprehend it, climate change doesn’t exist. But it relates to, or rather clarifies, things on a deeper level.  Rational American citizens are, post-Trump, going through the same grief trajectory as many of us did after Brexit: the debate is all fierce conjecture about how they lost, whom they failed to listen to, whose anger had been ignored and by which people for how many decades. But underneath that is a profound crisis of civic engagement – a deep, agonising question: what is the point? If reason doesn’t matter, if truth doesn’t, if solidarity is for wimps, if experts are charlatans, what’s the point of getting involved in this circus? Paul Krugman identifies it as a creed of quietism, conceding: “It’s definitely tempting to conclude that the world is going to hell, but that there’s nothing you can do about it, so why not just make your own garden grow?” Ultimately, he chooses engagement to save the soul: “I don’t see how you can hang on to your own self-respect unless you’re willing to stand up for the truth.” The American journalist Nancy LeTourneau took it one step further and tried to find a positive in the powerlessness, via Gandhi: “Whatever you do in life will be insignificant, but it’s very important that you do it.” Patriotism, self-respect, for the sake of your neighbours, for the good of your children: these are all credible and decent reasons to carry on fighting the hard right even when it knocks over your strongest arguments with a casual breath. But the urgency of the climate crisis is a better one. Authoritarians, “strongmen”, fascists: whatever you call the figureheads of the new right, you know one thing; they are never good stewards of the Earth. To accept this political order as a desperately sad but immovable new normal means accepting that the Earth will burn and there’s nothing we can do. This cannot be borne. In practical terms, this means picking winnable fights, showing solidarity, and being visible. I can’t do very much about a country not my own and its adherence to the Paris treaty, but I can join a 10:10 action on the UK government’s stance on wind energy. You can’t do very much about oil exploration in Alaska, but you possibly can do something about keeping the gas in the rocks of the Ribble Valley. Capitalise on victory: there is no more buoying story I can think of than that the Balcolmbe fracking protest turned into a green-lit solar farm. When the world gets its first solar-powered transport network (Santiago), when a country runs for four days entirely on renewables (Portugal), celebrate. If there’s a synchronised global march for the climate, go to it: there has always been a tendency to write mass environmental protests off as self-indulgence, pointless by definition because their participants will go back the very next day to their fossil-fuelled lives. Intolerance of imperfection is fatally corrosive to any movement, but to environmentalism most of all. It is not possible to be perfectly green, yet you can be a vivid green by turning up. This has been the year the liberals lost every argument. Explanations range from “they lost because they were wrong all along” to “the right always prospers from economic hardship”, but there is a growing consensus around one thing. We remain quite good at interpreting data, pointing out incoherence, making sarcastic remarks. But we lost the ability to make a bold, ambitious, sincere and plausible case for a better future, settling instead for a future that wasn’t worse. This has been the case across Europe and the US. It cannot be blamed on British politicians, singly or en masse. Its global scope has led many to look for the cause in global trends: financialisation, corporate greed – things that, for brevity, we class as neoliberalism. I wonder whether the answer is something much simpler: we stopped making the case for hope when we stopped feeling hopeful. The spectre of climate change, much more influential on the left than on even the sensible right, loomed so large that we - reasonably enough - began to fear the future, at the same time losing confidence in our collective ability to do anything but mess stuff up. The pessimism infected our political language, left it pale and limp. But it didn’t actually halt progress: discoveries were made and solutions found. We have, in likelihood, the technical expertise to halt emissions forever. Between electric cars and solar glass, between wind power and cross-continental supergrids, we have amassed enough sheer ingenuity to fix the unfixable. The only obstacle – granted, it’s a significant one – is a post-truth politics that would prefer to pretend there’s nothing to fix. Optimism is not something you can decide to rediscover; nor can you fake it with rhetoric. It’s not something one really good leader can bestow. It accrues around each hopeful action, each small victory, until it becomes obvious that it is the driving force. Many of us frame our interest in the environment as a care for our children or grandchildren, as if a visceral love of nature had to have a self-interested root to make sense. It doesn’t. Senselessness would be to try to live and find meaning elsewhere, having put the preciousness of our habitat to one side."
"The world is shocked that America elected Donald Trump as its 45th president. Exit polls show that the country is sharply divided on Trump along the same lines as its sharp divisions on climate change. Political ideology was the single strongest determining factor in the election. 90% of Republicans voted for Trump, while 89% of Democrats voted for Clinton. Ideology is also the primary factor associated with acceptance or denial of human-caused global warming, as climate scientist Katharine Hayhoe explained eloquently in this video: Race was the second-clearest determining factor in the presidential election. Trump won white voters by 21 percentage points; Clinton won minorities by 53 points. Minorities are also far more likely to accept and be concerned about climate change than white Americans. As Samantha Bee explained, white Americans bear responsibility for electing Donald Trump: The urban/rural divide was the third-strongest determining factor in the presidential election. Clinton won urban voters by 24 points; Trump won rural voters by 28 points. In many cases, cities are leading the way in taking action to curb global warming. Fourth, voters younger than 45 went for Clinton by a 12-point margin, while older voters preferred Trump by 11 points. Voters under the age of 30 voted for Clinton by an 18-point margin. Similarly, young Americans are far more likely to be concerned about climate change than older Americans. Finally, there is a gender gap, though it’s smaller than many expected. Despite accusations from 15 women that Trump groped, kissed, or assaulted them, and a recording of Trump bragging about sexually assaulting women, he only lost the female vote by 12 points – the same margin by which he won the male vote, and approximately the same margin by which Obama beat Romney and McCain among women. White women even favored Trump by 10 points, and white women without a college degree by an astonishing 28 points.  Basically, Trump’s misogyny didn’t dissuade women from voting for him. They normally favor Democratic presidential candidates by a margin of about 20 points more than men. That’s also the margin by which American women are more concerned about climate change than men. It’s important to remember that as with Al Gore in 2000, more Americans voted for Hillary Clinton than her victorious opponent. Al Gore received about a half million more votes than George W. Bush. Hillary Clinton will likely receive over a million more votes than Donald Trump. Bush and Trump were elected because of the antiquated electoral college system. Nevertheless, the popular vote was closer in 2016 than in 2012 or 2008. Republican voters were willing to forgive Trump’s many disqualifying flaws. They didn’t care about his constant lies. Eighty-one per cent of evangelicals voted for Trump despite his long history of immoral behavior. But many voters weren’t willing to overlook the media-generated, Russian hacker-assisted, FBI director-amplified, faux scandal of Clinton’s emails.  And much of Clinton’s support was concentrated in areas like my home state of California, where she won by over 28 points, while enough rural white Trump voters were distributed across swing states to give him narrow victories and winner-take-all electoral college votes. Trump won four states with a total of 75 electoral college votes (Florida, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, and Michigan) by margins of 1.3 points or less. It’s the same reason why Republicans control a large majority in the House of Representatives despite receiving more than a million fewer total votes than their Democratic opponents: rural, white, Republican voters are more widely geographically distributed than urban Democratic voters. America has become a minority-ruled country, that minority being rural white Republicans. Ultimately, explaining the election result is simple – Republicans voted for Trump and Democrats voted for Clinton. Clinton received more votes, but Trump won most of the states in which the vote was close. Trump won in areas with less educated, older, whiter populations with fewer immigrants. In these isolated, insulated regions, people fear their way of life is vanishing, and they’re largely right.  The US isn’t a coal burning, manufacturing country anymore. Trump promised to change that, but he can’t, and his policies will hurt his voters. America is changing and it’s not the fault of Democrats or immigrants, but Trump made them scapegoats and made empty promises to turn back the clock. Democrats need to find a way to connect with and help these groups who feel the government isn’t on their side. As John Abraham wrote last week, now that the Republican Party controls the US government, they own climate change.  For years, America was the country most to blame for obstructing international efforts to curb climate change. Our senate refused to ratify the Kyoto Protocol. President George W Bush refused to take any action to cut US carbon pollution. Senate Republicans blocked the cap and trade legislation passed by the House of Representatives in 2009.  Finally, over the past four years, the US has taken action and shown leadership in tackling climate change. As a result, humans had a slim chance of keeping global warming below the dangerous 2C limit.  Trump and congressional Republicans have vowed to reverse that progress. The energy page of Trump’s official presidential transition website focuses on extracting and burning lots and lots of fossil fuels and scrapping Obama’s climate plans: We will end the war on coal, and rescind the coal mining lease moratorium, the excessive Interior Department stream rule, and conduct a top-down review of all anti-coal regulations issued by the Obama Administration. We will … scrap the $5 trillion dollar Obama-Clinton Climate Action Plan and the Clean Power Plan Trump has already appointed a climate denier who wants to dismantle the Clean Power Plan to lead the EPA’s transition. If the Republican party continues on this path, the costs and suffering from intensified heat waves, floods, droughts, and hurricanes, sea levels engulfing coastal cities, etc – it will be on the GOP. In the meantime, we must continue trying to break through Republican politicians’ science denial. Many Republican policymakers are rumored to accept human-caused global warming in private; we have to change the political climate so that this isn’t a disqualifying position for a party leader to take in public.  There is no reason that Republicans have to deny climate science and reality; in fact, they’re the only major political party in the world that does, and most of their voters support climate action. We can donate to and volunteer to help bipartisan climate groups like Citizens’ Climate Lobby, which is working with policymakers from both parties to build the political will to solve the climate problem. These groups are now more important than ever. We probably won’t be able to limit global warming to 2C, but 2.5C is less damaging than 3C, and 3C less than 3.5 or 4C. As the renowned climate scientist Lonnie Thompson once said, climate change will be a combination of mitigation, adaptation, and suffering. It’s never too late to take action to limit the amount of suffering our children and grandchildren will face due to climate change. American cities and states will have to keep leading the way in cutting carbon pollution. Americans will have to keep fighting to rid the GOP of the intellectual rot that currently plagues the party. And while Americans fight to right the ship, the rest of the world will have to pick up the slack and fight even harder against climate change. As Hillary Clinton said in her gracious concession speech: ""This loss hurts. But please never stop believing that fighting for what’s right is worth it."" —Hillary And let’s get to work on Neil deGrasse Tyson’s suggestion: Let’s Make America Smart Again"

"An awful lot of people would really like it if Benjamin Sporton went home and never came back.  Sporton is the boss of the World Coal Association and he’s walking the halls of the United Nations climate change talks.  If they were electing public enemy number one here at the Marrakech climate negotiations, he’d be leading many people’s polls.  “It’s a challenging thing,” he admits, smiling. “I’m not a coal person – my background isn’t even in coal. But when the opportunity came up to work at the World Coal Association I had to sit down and look at the rational approach on how do we deal with climate change. I have always been someone who wants to address climate change.” At the 2016 climate talks in Paris, he became a literal poster boy for “climate criminals” when a campaign group slapped “wanted” signs for Sporton on lampposts around the city.  This week, Sporton’s association is again being targeted. Campaigners on Wednesday delivered a 550,000-name petition to the US delegation asking it to back calls for conflict of interest policies to be enshrined in the UN process. In short, they want groups like the World Coal Association to be excluded from the negotiations. US Secretary of State John Kerry delivered an impassioned speech to the talks, saying massive investments in expanding coal power “just doesn’t make sense.”  “That’s suicide,” he said. But just like at previous United Nation’s climate talks, Sporton is unapologetically here to defend his industry from a process that could put him out of a job.  So what’s his rationale for wanting to “address climate change” by working for the industry that’s doing more to contribute to the problem than any other?  “When I came to look at it and saw that today 40% of the world’s electricity, 90% of the world’s cement and 70% of the world’s steel all comes from coal… well, then you can’t address the challenge of climate change without looking at the role of coal in that context.  “So, my view is and the view of the association is that coal has to be part of the solution. Otherwise, you are not going to have a solution.”  Specifically, Sporton offers a list of 22 countries that have improvements in coal power efficiency as part of their plans submitted to the UN to tackle climate change.  Those include some of the world’s biggest emitters, such as China, India and Indonesia and this, Sporton says, gives him a legitimate role. These are the people he spends most time with.  He says he has two key interests in Marrakech.  One is to talk about newer coal plants that he says create 30% lower emissions than older ones. He says this is a “saving” on emissions. Another way to look at these “savings” are to compare it to the close-to-zero emissions from renewables. Slightly less dirty coal is still coal. One recent report has suggested that adding any new fossil fuel energy to the world’s economy would blow global warming targets already agreed. Sporton’s second key talking point is the role of Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS), for so long now touted as the coal industry’s get out of jail free card.  The concept is that carbon dioxide from burning coal in power plants is captured and then stored indefinitely underground. He mentions an International Energy Agency report on CCS just released.  “Nowhere near enough action is taking place on CCS to meet the 2C target never mind a 1.5C target,” he says. “Our role is to talk about what we think can be done to help drive more CCS.” The coal industry has been claiming that large scale CCS is viable for a decade or more, but rather than galloping like a saviour over the horizon, CCS is barely in view. According to the IEA, there are just 16 large-scale CCS project currently in operation around the world. Only one is attached to a coal power plant (the rest are attached to natural gas processing and other industrial processes). Some 12 of those 16 projects don’t simply store the carbon dioxide, but instead use it in the oil industry to push harder-to-get crude out of the ground.  “At the moment, these plants do use the CO2 for enhanced oil recovery,” accepts Sporton. “Ultimately that’s not the climate answer – you can’t do that.”  The four large scale projects that do store the CO2 are able to lock away 2.6 million tonnes per year. To put that into perspective, some of the world’s biggest coal plants would emit that amount in less than three weeks.  Next year, two more CCS projects will be launched attached to coal power plants, but these will also rely on the oil industry using the gas to extract more fossil fuels. Sporton says he wants CCS to get more support from governments and insists the technology is “valid and viable”.  But for an idea of just how long the coal industry has been asking, and receiving public funding to support CCS as a solution, consider this. According to the IEA, up to the year 2010 CCS had been given about $30bn of public funding commitments. Some 22 “large scale” CCS projects have been cancelled since 2010.  But as progress has been slow, governments have scaled back. In 2015, the UK government cancelled its £1bn programme. Australia’s CCS programme was once worth A$1.9bn, but is now at just $300m. A recent report from the Canadian government’s budget office suggested that the regional government-owned SaskPower CCS coal plant could end up costing the taxpayer about three quarters of a billion Canadian dollars over its 30-year life span.  Critics of CCS, of which there are many (including me) point to a legion of problems, one of which is the increase in the cost of power at a time when renewables are getting cheaper all the time.  Sporten says it’s not fair to make comparisons between the SaskPower plant and the cost of renewables, because the coal plant is using “first of its kind technology.” He says the operators think they could build a second plant 30% cheaper after learning a few lessons. “There will be two more coal-fired CCS plants coming on line in the US next year. They will continue to give us understanding of the technology,” he says.  “We are not where we need to be in terms of the plants, but there are more coming on line. We just had the world’s first steel plant with CCS come on line.”  This is when we should remind ourselves that there are currently more than 7,000 coal plants operating worldwide, with about 700 more under construction.  Sporton is always ready with an answer, as you’d expect from a professional lobbyist for one of the world’s most powerful industries. He accepts the science in the IPCC report and will sometimes refer to it.  But there was one issue he would not speak about.  Earlier this year, one of his associations key members, Peabody Energy, filed for protective bankruptcy. The court papers revealed the company had been funding a wide network of groups who push climate science denial. Another group affiliated with WCA is Euracoal, the “voice of coal” in Europe. In March, Euracoal paid Canadian climate science denier Patrick Moore to deliver a speech to EU members and officials. Moore does not accept that greenhouse gas emissions from burning coal cause climate change. He says CO2 emissions should instead be “celebrated”. Does Sporton think this funding of climate science denial from groups associated with his own, is helpful? Perhaps not surprisingly, he would not criticise Peabody or Euracoal in any way. Another argument that’s put by many coal industry advocates, particularly in Australia and the United States, is that coal is the only way to lift billions of people around the world out of poverty.  It’s a nifty and pernicious argument that turns coal advocates into poverty campaigners and environmentalists into the bad guys.  But in October, a dozen development groups published a report saying that rather than pulling people out of poverty, a strategy based on coal would make things even worse.  Sporton is willing to concede one point on this. With hundreds of millions of people without electricity access in rural areas, the quickest way to get power to them isn’t through coal.  He says: “One of the easiest ways to deliver energy poverty to the rural poor is to build wind turbines and solar panels because that’s the easiest way to get electricity to them, there and then. But ultimately I do think they need to be connected to the grid.” As we wrap up our interview, a protest is kicking off down the walkway at the talks. It’s to call for fossil fuel lobbyists to be kicked out.  Sporton adds: “To say we can’t be in the room and talk about the role of the industry and the product in reducing emissions is... well… trying to wish away coal is not going to be productive.”"
"Two developments this week should bring climate and sustainability-related issues to the top of company board agendas.  The first was the release by the Centre for Policy Development and Future Business Council of a legal opinion by Sydney silk Noel Hutley SC that found that directors who don’t properly consider the material impacts of climate change on their business risk personal liability for breach of duty. This analysis builds on earlier work, most notably by instructing solicitor Sarah Barker at MinterEllison, highlighting that courts will take a dim view of directors who fail to perceive or respond adequately to foreseeable climate-related risks.   The second significant development is the entry into force of the historic Paris agreement on climate change (in about one eighth of the time it took the Kyoto protocol to achieve the same milestone). Although Australia is yet to ratify the agreement, it is already law in many of our largest trading partners, committing them and much of the globe to ambitious carbon reduction targets and eventually a net zero carbon economy.  The mindset of business leaders and regulators around the world has shifted – the business and financial risks climate change poses are not only real and significant but they are here now. As the Bank of England governor, Mark Carney, said in September, if climate change is a “tragedy of the horizons” then the Paris agreement – and the markets that are already pricing in major changes in business as usual – bring that horizon forward. These two developments were front of mind at a business roundtable I helped to moderate last month to discuss Hutley’s opinion.  I was struck there by how clearly directors now see this challenge. Hutley’s opinion confirms we now have little choice but to understand how important climate change and sustainability risks are for us personally and for our companies, and act accordingly. The question directors should be, and now are, asking themselves is not “should we be considering this at all” but “how do we make sure we’re doing this well enough?”  One positive to come out of Hutley’s opinion and the Paris agreement is that there is only an upside for companies and directors that do it best. They will be well placed to benefit from, or even influence, rising expectations of shareholders, customers and regulators. The premium that market participants are placing on constructive approaches to sustainability issues is rising. This is especially striking in the case of the large institutional investors with long-term mandates (including in Australia’s superannuation industry) who see effective board-level management of environment and sustainability-related issues as a key proxy for governance, risk management and good long-term strategy.  The roundtable has propelled a critical conversation about how those in leadership positions – on boards, regulators, director associations and peak bodies – can ensure directors have the targets, tools, skills and processes in place to meet higher internal and external governance expectations. We have become accustomed to seeing climate and sustainability issues as far off challenges but we only need to take our cues from the market (as well as meteorologists) to see that these shifts are already happening under our feet. Companies that aren’t preparing for physical, transition and liability risks now are simply ensuring more destabilising, risky and abrupt changes later. The same goes for entire economies. Business leaders should support constructive changes at the level of board governance and government policy to make sure that does not happen.  The director community is justifiably wary of more obligations being foisted on directors without the capabilities or guidance needed to prioritise and meet them. This is why the discussion about directors’ duties is not about overburdening directors with additional requirements or regulation. It is about asking what the content of these fundamental duties will be in the 21st century governance environment – and about ensuring directors are in position to discharge them.  Boards must educate themselves on the best way to identify, disclose and respond to climate and sustainability risks, not just for legal or environmental reasons but because the market demands we do so. There is still time to improve but, as this week shows, it is running short.  Together, we must strengthen risk analysis and integrated reporting, build technical proficiency around measuring sustainability trends and risks, ensure effective communication with institutional investors and diversify the voices around the boardroom table to ensure the right set of skills, experiences and perspectives.  These steps can ensure directors can ask better questions and get better answers on climate and sustainability risks and opportunities as we embrace the post-Paris horizon."
"The ripples from a new American president are far-reaching, but never before has the arrival of a White House administration placed the livability of Earth at stake. Beyond his bluster and crude taunts, Donald Trump’s climate denialism could prove to be the lasting imprint of his unexpected presidency. “A Trump presidency might be game over for the climate,” said Michael Mann, a prominent climate researcher. “It might make it impossible to stabilize planetary warming below dangerous levels.”   Kevin Trenberth, senior scientist at the US National Center for Atmospheric Research, added: “This is an unmitigated disaster for the planet.” Trump has vowed to sweep away the climate framework painstakingly built over Barack Obama’s two terms. At risk is the Paris climate accord, which only came into force last week, and Obama’s linchpin emissions reduction policy, the Clean Power Plan.  It's a climate change accord agreed by nearly 200 countries in December 2015, which came into force on 4 November 2016. The agreement commits world leaders to keeping global warming below 2C, seen as the threshold for safety by scientists, and pursuing a tougher target of 1.5C. The carbon emission curbs put forward by countries under Paris are not legally-binding but the framework of the accord, which includes a mechanism for periodically cranking those pledges up, is binding. The agreement also has a long-term goal for net zero emissions which would effectively phase out fossil fuels.   At a pivotal moment when the planet’s nations have belatedly banded together to confront an existential threat, a political novice who calls global warming a “bullshit” Chinese-invented hoax is taking the helm at the world’s foremost superpower.  “Millions of Americans voted for a coal-loving climate denier willing to condemn people around the globe to poverty, famine and death from climate change,” said Benjamin Schreiber, climate director at Friends of the Earth US. “It seems undeniable that the United States will become a rogue state on climate change.”  US conservatives are already rubbing their hands in glee at the prospect of a bonfire of regulation. Trump wants the US to exit the Paris deal, which commits nations to keeping the global temperature rise below a 2C threshold, potentially setting off a cataclysmic domino effect where other countries also drop out or ease off efforts to decarbonize. The 2C limit, which was already a stern challenge, now appears perilous.   The Clean Power Plan, the main tool to cut American emissions, is also targeted for elimination, along with billions of dollars in clean energy funding. Republicans will also turn off the tap of aid flowing to developing nations already struggling with climate change-driven sea level rise, heatwaves and drought.  Bitterly contested fossil fuel projects such as the Keystone development and the Dakota Access pipeline, which has caused unprecedented uproar among native American tribes, would likely be waved through, with Trump promising to “lift the Obama-Clinton roadblocks to allow these vital energy infrastructure projects to go ahead”. Environmentalists are already aghast at Trump’s presidential preparations. He has appointed Myron Ebell, director at a conservative thinktank, to oversee transition plans for the Environmental Protection Agency, which Trump has casually earmarked for abolition. Ebell has said global warming is “nothing to worry about” and that the Clean Power Plan is “illegal”. Shortlists drawn up for key Trump administration posts have also raised alarm. Oil billionaire Harold Hamm is being touted as energy secretary, while former vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin could make a stunning comeback as interior secretary, putting her in charge of US public lands, including treasures such as Yellowstone and Yosemite national parks. Palin is an enthusiastic proponent of oil and gas drilling, describing the fossil fuels as “things that God has dumped on this part of the Earth for mankind’s use”. Republicans have already used Congressional committees to hound climate scientists and green groups and this badgering may escalate once climate denial is official White House doctrine. It’s understood that scientists at Nasa are already bracing themselves for cuts to climate research programs. Predicting Trump’s plans, however, largely relies upon reading the runes from his discursive policy speeches, which regularly dissolved into vituperative diatribes while on the campaign trail.  At the heart of his energy and climate thinking is an “America first” policy where “draconian climate rules” are repealed and the US escalates its production of coal, oil and natural gas. In May, Trump sported a coal miner’s helmet at a rally in West Virginia, a state with a long history of mining, to underscore his message that the “war on coal” is over and that jobs will flow back to the stricken industry. “Under my administration,” Trump said, “we’ll accomplish complete American energy independence. Complete. Imagine a world in which our foes, and the oil cartels, can no longer use energy as a weapon. It will happen. We’re going to win.” These bromides to American industrial strength helped propel Trump to the White House but aren’t tethered to reality. US coal production slumped 10% last year, with mining jobs shrinking by 12%. Over the same 12-month period, the US oil industry lost $67bn. These woes have been caused by market forces, rather than onerous regulation, and even Trump’s authoritarianism doesn’t extend far enough to change that. “As president, Donald Trump will pretend climate change does not exist,” said Prof Tom Lyon of the University of Michigan’s business school. “This is an increasingly untenable position, even for committed climate skeptics.  “His energy policy will encourage investment in high-carbon energy sources that will look foolish in retrospect. And he will anger much of the rest of the world by reneging on policies designed to address global challenges.” US greenhouse gas emissions have started to taper off in recent years but a Trump presidency would see a resurgence, with an analysis by Lux Research finding that carbon dioxide output would be 16% higher than the current trajectory should the real estate magnate complete a second term. This would give the world a hefty shove towards climate disaster and fatally wound the US’s reputation as a global leader. Should other major emitters such as China, India and the European Union fail to make compensatory emissions cuts the planet will likely spiral into runaway climate change where tens of millions of people are displaced by rising seas, food insecurity and conflict, leading to an unprecedented international humanitarian disaster.  Major US cities including New York, Miami and Boston would face inundation. California, already suffering its worst dry spell in 1,200 years, may stage ‘megadroughts’ that last 20 or even 30 years. The Pentagon has warned climate change poses a “threat multiplier” to US national security, to hoots of derision from Republicans. The shift to a low-carbon economy already has its own momentum, however, with the cost of solar and wind power tumbling in recent years. Nearly 100 coal power plants were retired in 2015, with renewables accounting for two-thirds of all new electricity generation.  New York and California both have their own ambitious emission reduction plans, conservative states such as Iowa are embracing wind energy, and innovations from companies such as Tesla, in solar panels and battery storage, are being snapped up by homeowners.  Trumpian interference can only do so much to slow this trend, although plodding progress isn’t enough to stave off climate catastrophe. The UN has warned that global emissions must peak by 2020 and then be sharply reduced in order to avoid the worst. This shrinking window risks being clouded entirely if the US is to choke itself, and the rest of the world, on its fumes. Stunned environment groups, faced with triumphant climate denialism in all branches of government, are trying to muster defiance. “This could be devastating for our climate and our future,” admitted Michael Brune, executive director of the Sierra Club. “But Trump must choose wisely or we guarantee him the hardest fight of his political life. We won’t be in a defensive crouch for the next four years, licking our wounds.  “If he tries to go backwards on climate change he’ll run headlong into an organized mass of people who will fight him in the courts, in Congress and on the streets.” Others are more conciliatory, with former vice president Al Gore proffering an olive branch along with an enormous dollop of optimism. “Last night President-elect Trump said he wanted to be a president for all Americans,” Gore said on Wednesday. “In that spirit, I hope that he will work with the overwhelming majority of us who believe that the climate crisis is the greatest threat we face as a nation.” Whether or not Trump becomes a belated convert to the reality of climate change, the physics of global warming remain unchanged.  2016 will be the warmest year on record, beating a mark set only last year. These extremes, where India experiences a temperature of 51C (123F) and the Arctic is robbed of almost all of its winter snowfall, are set to become the norm within a decade. American citizens, from Alaska to Louisiana, are already being uprooted due to the rising seas, a situation that will become commonplace. Trump knows enough of the gargantuan shifts underway to build a seawall for his golf course in County Clare, Ireland. His Mar-a-Lago club in Florida may have to be next. Whether he extends his concern from beyond his own business interests to the rest of the world remains to be seen."
"The children in the villages around the Indian city of Nabha in Punjab state all know what Horlicks is, although few have tasted it. The malted milk drink, manufactured by GlaxoSmithKline (GSK), is produced at the Horlicks plant in Nabha, which sources from around 1,500 dairy farmers in the surrounding area. But after several years of severe drought in a region already heavily reliant on groundwater, water reserves are in decline and fodder for cows is becoming more expensive. This is making dairy production increasingly difficult in one of the highest milk-producing states in the country – itself the world’s largest national producer of dairy.  GSK is not the only big business facing drought-related problems in Punjab. Danone buys 50,000 – 80,000 litres of milk from 5,000 farmers in 100 villages in the state, and Nestlé sources more than 300m litres of milk from 100,000 farmers in three Indian states, including Punjab. To ensure a steady supply of milk, these companies have set up long-term sustainability projects in Punjab’s villages. But, as water shortages worsen, can they protect dairy farmers from the potentially devastating effects of continuous droughts? In 2012, Punjab’s chief minister Parkash Singh Badal called for a “white revolution”, encouraging the state’s farmers to take up dairy since, he said, most were too reliant on wheat-paddy rotation crops with slim profit margins. This revolution requires water. One cow consumes approximately 150 litres of drinking water a day. Water is also needed to produce fodder for cows. Fertile lands and good infrastructure in the state such as dams and irrigation systems have helped stave off the kind of acute water shortages witnessed in other parts of India over the last few decades. But the severity of the latest El Niño weather cycle has led to unprecedented temperatures, causing rivers, lakes and dams to dry up in many parts of northern India. In Punjab, low rainfall has decreased crop yields and put a huge strain on the state’s diminishing groundwater resources.  “In the winter, cows can graze in the fields. But in the summer when there’s no rain we have to buy fodder,” says Harpreet Singh, a dairy farmer from the village of Issi who supplies milk to Horlicks. “It’s a big problem for us ... The cost of fodder keeps increasing but the price of milk stays fixed, so the entire business is in decline.” Harpreet Singh makes approximately 50,000 rupees (£570) profit a month in the winter, but says his losses in the summer leave him without savings. Horlicks’ farmers aren’t the only ones facing this crisis. On its website, Nestlé says: “Largely due to local over-exploitation by agriculture, industry and domestic use, the local water table is dropping by up to a metre a year and could affect the supply of milk in our Moga milk district [in Punjab].” To help farmers like Harpreet Singh cut down costs, GSK has set up education camps where farmers learn how to make their own silage from surplus grass, which can be used as cow feed in the dry season. Even though he’s feeling the pressure, Harpreet Singh says this is helping: “It’s a lot of effort, but in the summer it means we spend much less on buying fodder.”  GSK also produces a magazine offering dairy farmers advice on topics such as water reuse. The initiatives are an effort to keep the dairy business booming: “Our hope is that, through working together, we can help local farmers remain in business, assuring our supply of milk for Horlicks,” says a company spokesperson. Danone, which makes Activia yoghurt, started sourcing milk from Punjab in 2012. Last year, the company set up Punjab 2020, an initiative which educates farmers in ways to improve soil quality by reducing fertiliser use so it retains more water, and maximise milk production in the context of drought. About 7,000 farmers have already gone through the company’s Academilk training programme and it has invested €570,000 (£508,000) to expand the programmes to 60 more villages.  As part of Danone’s programme, the company provides communal chilling facilities, enabling those with even one or two cows to earn an income without having to invest in expensive coolers. “It is a win-win situation as it ensures a sustainable livelihood for the farmer while securing the milk supplies for Danone,” said a company spokesperson. Vibha Dhawan, senior director at the Energy Resources Institute, says that while companies are helping provide short-term solutions to prevent the dairy industry’s collapse, the urgent problem of groundwater over-extraction still needs to be addressed.  Jaskaran Singh, who supplies milk to Nestlé, says that, without rainfall, farmers in his village rely on groundwater to irrigate their fields and maintain their cows. Groundwater has to be extracted using a diesel-fuelled pump. As water levels drop and farmers have to dig deeper, fuel costs increase. “We’re already drilling 10, 20, 30 feet into the ground,” he explains. “Now the water is very low. In 30 years, we may have to go much deeper, say 100 feet. That’s expensive.” Cost isn’t the only problem for those relying on groundwater. “As groundwater levels go down,” explains Dhawan, “the risk of arsenic or lead poisoning in the water increases because heavy metals settle lower down. If farmers keep extracting as they have ... the quality of the water, which ultimately goes into our milk, will also reduce.” While the companies have not yet found solutions to this, Nestlé has started funding research with the International Water Management Institute to understand the causes of groundwater depletion in the area surrounding its factory, in the Moga district. The research – which the company runs alongside wider farmer support programmes, such as cattle feeding, breeding, and veterinary support – includes a six-month pilot project investigating the company’s water footprint from milk. Dhawan believes the Punjab government is partly to blame for the groundwater crisis as it subsidises electricity for water extraction. Big companies and the government need to start investing in water-wise technology, she says, such as sub-soil irrigation, where pipes supply the soil at root level so less water is lost through evaporation, or precision agriculture methods, where farms are monitored by computer so exact amounts of inputs can be applied. “These are already technologies that exist, but they need to be made available to farmers,” says Dhawan.

"Australia’s chief scientist has challenged the resurgent political alarmism about renewable energy, saying energy security isn’t about locking in the status quo, it’s about ensuring the successful decarbonisation of electricity generation. In his first public comments since being asked to lead an energy security review for federal and state governments, Alan Finkel delivered an upbeat assessment of renewable energy technologies, saying they provide “many viable technology paths to cutting emissions”. The Finkel review was preceded by a pitched political battle between the Turnbull government, which launched a rhetorical assault on state-based renewable energy targets in the wake of a statewide power blackout in South Australia in September, and state governments, who argue the commonwealth will not be able to meet its international emissions reduction targets without the state RETs. Malcolm Turnbull and his energy minister, Josh Frydenberg, have declared energy security their No 1 priority, and have created the impression that the state RET schemes are prompting too rapid a transition from fossil fuels to low emissions sources. On Thursday, Frydenberg said state governments needed to wind back their renewable energy schemes to match the federal target of 23% by 2020. He contended a lack of harmonisation was leading to “imperfect investment decisions”, and wasn’t doing anything positive for the environment. But Finkel said in a speech delivered on Thursday evening that securing Australia’s energy supply did not mean “locking in the status quo – on the contrary, it means being able to navigate change”. “Looking to the future also brings awareness of the global challenge of climate change, and being mindful of the international commitments that our government has made to lower carbon dioxide emissions,” he said. The chief scientist said fossil fuels had delivered tremendous advantages, and coal, oil and gas remained “a reliable source of energy to feed into the electricity grid”. “Coal, contrary to the common assumption, continues to rise as a percentage of the global energy mix,” Finkel said. “But human progress has come at a price, in the form of climate change.” While Turnbull and Frydenberg have made much of the intermittency problems created by technologies such as wind, Finkel delivered a more measured assessment of the challenges associated with decarbonising the electricity grid. “Electricity has been made safe, it is versatile, and it is easy to distribute,” he said. “The regulatory structures and the physical bones of the grid are already in place. We don’t need to reinvent them to make use of them. “And, with goodwill and time on our side, electricity generation can be decarbonised. Whether it’s hydroelectric dams, or solar and wind, there are many viable technology paths to cutting emissions.” The chief scientist acknowledges there are “challenges” with bringing low-emissions technologies online “but over time, the solutions will come – just as we have learned to harness new technologies before”. Finkel said the required transition would ultimately be led by the market and the science, “not by the chief scientist”. His speech ​follows confirmation on Thursday that the Hazelwood coal-fired power station in Victoria’s Latrobe valley will close next March. Both the federal and Victorian governments announced transitional assistance packages for the workers affected by the closure. The Australian Energy Market Operator issued advice saying it expected there would be sufficient capacity available to continue to operate the national electricity market reliably after Hazelwood’s retirement ​– although it warned the supply/demand balance would be tighter during times of peak demand. It said unusually hot weather conditions could require an additional supply or demand response to meet all projected demand in Victoria and South Australia, “particularly if these conditions coincide with low wind availability, or generation or transmission outages”. Finkel ​was also upbeat about the prospects of battery storage, and other new forms of storing energy, as a means of dealing with intermittency problems from technologies including wind power. “It’s one of the big opportunities I see on the horizon for Australia; and one of the questions that the … review will have to consider,” Finkel said on Thursday night. “First, because it is one way we can deal with the problem of intermittency whilst harnessing renewable energy across the grid; and second, because it is a field in which we are starting to play particularly well.” But he said Australia shouldn’t limit itself to storage solutions. “Let’s think about other fields for Australian firms that could flow from our success in managing our grid. “In particular, let’s think about something that Sydney and Melbourne do particularly well – build platforms to grapple with complex systems.”"
"The land rights of indigenous people in the Amazon must be recognised if their countries’ commitments on reducing deforestation and lowering or capping carbon emissions are to be realised, according to native leaders from the nine South American countries across which the rainforest spreads. Nearly 300 representatives of the forest’s several million inhabitants gathered in Lima last week to demand that their governments heed evidence of their ability to conserve the forest and thus protect their way of life. “We are the ones who are protecting the forest from being destroyed, so if the government doesn’t respect our rights we’re going to see huge levels of deforestation,” said Maximiliano Correa, from the Coordination of the Indigenous Organisations of the Brazilian Amazon (COIAB). At the gathering, which was held a week before the Paris climate agreement came into force on Friday, indigenous leaders from Ecuador, Brazil and Venezuela said their governments were ignoring their land rights, which are legally enshrined in the Consultation with Indigenous Peoples Law (guaranteed in the International Labour Organisation’s Convention 169). Correa, an indigenous Tucano from Brazil’s northern Amazonas state, said: “The irony for us is that the [Michel] Temer government, which has just ratified the Paris agreement, is entirely against recognition of the rights of indigenous peoples to their lands.” He added that congressional amendments in Brazil were reversing 20 years of progress on indigenous rights.  Of the nine countries that are home to part of the Amazon rainforest, five have ratified the Paris climate change agreement. Colombia, Ecuador, Suriname and Venezuela have not.  Tuntiak Katan, of the confederation of indigenous nationalities of Ecuador (Confeniae), said the state “legally steals and usurps our territory declaring resource extraction a national priority”.  In 2008, Ecuador became the first country in the world to legally recognise the rights of nature. Yet it has just begun drilling in Yasuní national park, a UN Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organisation biosphere reserve that houses two semi-nomadic groups of Waorani indigenous people. In Venezuela, indigenous people make up 2% of the population, said José Díaz Mirabal of the Organización Regional de Pueblos Indígenas de Amazonas. He said land titling was “paralysed” due to state interest in mineral deposits in their territory. Unchecked alluvial gold mining was also destroying parts of their ancestral land he added. A report by the World Resources Institute (pdf) provides evidence that investing in secure land rights for indigenous peoples in the Amazon is one of the most cost-effective ways of tackling climate change. Helen Ding, an environmental economist and lead author of the report, said: “Securing land rights for indigenous communities in the Amazon truly would have a global impact.  “In terms of global carbon mitigation, there are billions of dollars to be gained from slowing deforestation and sequestering carbon in indigenous forests.”  Analysing Bolivia, Brazil and Colombia between 2000 and 2012, the report found average deforestation rates inside tenured indigenous forest were two to three times lower than outside. Yet globally indigenous communities only have secure tenure for 10% of their lands. Despite this evidence, the report points out only 21 of 197 national emissions reduction commitments included indigenous rights and community-based land tenure. Of those countries, just one – Bolivia – belongs to the nine-strong Amazon group.  “There’s a missed opportunity. By protecting existing indigenous lands [countries] are actually contributing to those commitments,” said Ding. During the drafting of the Paris accord, recognition of indigenous rights was relegated from the text – where it would have been legally binding and enforceable – to a non-binding preamble that was merely aspirational.  As negotiations took place in December, native groups from across the world staged a paddle down the Seine to highlight their call for indigenous rights to be included in the UN climate pact.  Victoria Tauli-Corpuz, the UN special rapporteur for indigenous peoples, called for the text to be changed. “What indigenous peoples want from this agreement is to be included in efforts to combat climate change,” she said. “To many indigenous peoples, the forests are the basis for their subsistence, culture, and livelihoods.  “As they implement the Paris agreement, countries should consider and respect our contributions to protecting the planet, rather than use it as yet another excuse to trample over our rights.”  Despite the shortfalls in the Paris accord, most indigenous leaders back its ratification. Roberto Espinoza, a lawyer for Aidesep, Peru’s inter-ethnic association for the development of the Peruvian Rainforest, believes it has raised the international profile of native Amazonians as climate defenders.  “Until a few years ago, nobody wanted to know about land titling for indigenous peoples in Peru. Now they do. That’s because the indigenous struggle has been linked to the climate issue,” he said. Peru, home to the second largest area of Amazon rainforest after Brazil, pledged to reduce its deforestation to zero by 2021 prior to the COP 20, which was hosted in Lima in 2014.  That international commitment put pressure on the Peruvian state to title indigenous land, Espinoza said. About 2,000 indigenous communities now have land titles, with a further 1,377 awaiting formal recognition, he added. "
"The shock may have started to subside, but the despair is just beginning. For non-Americans, the aftermath of the US election feels like being in mourning, but perhaps in that detached way we feel when a beloved musician or actor dies (and goodness knows we’ve had enough of that this wretched year) – it was not our election; Donald Trump is not our president. And yet it does affect us, not just in whatever economic impact is to come, or because the president-elect couldn’t care less about climate change. The seeding of fear and hate, the misogyny that has been condoned, the attacks on our most vulnerable: this affects us all. It is time, therefore, to get to work – even from over here. You could retreat to a bunker, but fighting back will probably make you feel better, as long-time activists confirm.  “I’ve learned that when society and politics disappoints, I can’t spend too long grieving about the dying of the light,” argues the 93-year-old social justice activist Harry Leslie Smith. “The only way I feel injustice can be defeated is by staring evil or indifference in the face and shouting: ‘You won’t have me, I’ll come back tomorrow and have another go at you.’ Nobody can live as long as I have and not have faced much disappointment and loss. So when I encounter things like the madness of Brexit or the election of Donald Trump, I mourn for a short while and get back on my bike and figure out how I can lay seeds in the imagination of people for them to harvest a better world.” In many ways, he says, “activism allows me to give purpose to the suffering I endured along with my parents and my siblings. Fighting for social justice allows me to connect with younger people, people who are vulnerable, and people who are hurting, and that allows me, at 93, to feel I am still part of the human race.” Volunteering and activism can bring personal benefits. There are four areas the Institute for Volunteering Research looks at, says its research manager Jurgen Grotz: human, economic, social and cultural capital. “In human capital, the ones we describe are personal development, such as growth in confidence and self-esteem. Young people [might experience] leadership roles. It can also result in transferable skills – public speaking, how to work in a team. If we look at social capital, especially if people become more engaged and active, we look for new networks and friendships, which sometimes leads to greater involvement in the local community.” Under the cultural capital category, “we’d be looking for a better understanding of identity, and an increased expression of values, a greater appreciation of other cultures and interests. With economic capital, depending on the activity, it can be linked to better employability.” Older volunteers are more likely to see health effects. “Some studies have suggested that especially older people who volunteer live longer than those who don’t, but the question is do they do so because of things like getting out of the house and having more physical activity? But certainly wellbeing – the sort of outcomes like self-esteem – are reasonably well-documented.” “Being part of a movement for social change is an idealistic, altruistic act,” says activist Peter Tatchell, who has been campaigning for 50 years. “You do get an emotional uplift to participate in a campaign that changes your life, and the lives of others, for the better. But it can be very frustrating and dispiriting when change takes a long time to happen. You need to be psychologically ready for the long haul.” There will be aggressive opponents, and pedantic critics. “That can get very demoralising unless you steel yourself to be ready for those brickbats,” Tatchell says. What’s kept me going for the last 50 years has been a vision of what society could be, and a series of successes along the way. I’ve always taken the long view. When you’re up against great historical inequalities, they’re very unlikely to be remedied overnight. We need to be prepared to think in terms of months, years and in extreme cases, decades. Working together with others in a campaign is mutually reassuring and empowering – knowing you’re not alone will give you the strength to carry on despite delays and setbacks.” What has kept Smith going is firm belief. “I am six-and-a-half years short of 100 years old, so I don’t know how long I’ve got, but as long as there is breath in my body and memory in my head, I will always stand for social justice, because one day we will get it right. And even I am not there to see, it will still be worth it.” So what can we do? You may not be able to join or donate to the Democrats, but there are other practical steps you can take. Some are extreme – you could consider boycotting the US. Some are not so extreme – you could certainly boycott Trump’s businesses, such as his golf courses in Scotland and Ireland, without experiencing any sacrifice. You could turn your attention to the US supreme court and send vitamin supplements and encouraging words to insist the ageing liberal judges Ruth Bader Ginsburg (83) and Stephen Breyer (78), and the moderate Republican Anthony Kennedy (80), carry on. There is already one open slot, and allowing Trump the opportunity to appoint (rightwing) replacements could have terrifying consequences. Here are some marginally better ideas: Grabbing ’em by the pussy is only the start of Trump’s assault on women’s bodies. Repealing the Affordable Healthcare Act, which Trump wants to do, will end free contraception. He has said women who have abortions should receive “some form of punishment”, and is against late-term abortions (which are usually performed when the woman’s life is in danger). He has said he will appoint anti-abortion judges to the supreme court. Mike Pence, who will be vice-president, is fiercely anti-abortion, and has said he would like the Roe v Wade ruling, which legalised abortion, to be “sent to the ash heap of history”. Congressional Republicans have repeatedly tried to strip Planned Parenthood, the family-planning and education organisation, which also provides terminations, of $500m of federal funds – which accounts for nearly half its revenue. With a Trump government, they are seriously under threat. If you can afford it, donate to PP, to the National Abortion Federation, or to any number of local organisations that help women access abortion services – the National Network of Abortion Funds has a list online. The ACLU describes Trump as “a one-man constitutional crisis”. It was founded in 1920 to defend rights supposedly guaranteed in the US constitution. Trump’s proposals, says the group, violate several amendments, and if he attempts to see them through, it promises to unleash the “full firepower of the ACLU at every step”. Non-US residents can become members and donate. There are a huge number of organisations stepping up their work to protest Trump’s presidency and protect vulnerable people. The websites Jezebel and The Cut have good lists, but you could consider donating to the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, the Council on American-Islamic Relations, progressive Jewish group Bend the Arc and The Trevor Project, which supports young LGBTQ people. Of course, there’s a limit to what people outside the US can do for these organisations. You can’t go on protests or host events, but you can join in virtually – share their information, news and events. Again, if it’s possible, what really helps is cash. Protests have been held in cities in the US, including Chicago, Minneapolis, Baltimore and New York, but also outside the US. There will be a rally in Berlin on Saturday , and on Wednesday, a protest was held outside the US embassy in London by the organisation Stand Up to Racism. There will be more. Look out for events, especially to mark Trump’s first state visit to the UK, whenever that is. Or create your own. In February, Trump, singling out the New York Times and Washington Post, said that if he won he would declare war on the press: “We’re going to open up libel laws, and we’re going to have people sue you like you’ve never got sued before.” As with other Trump threats, he will come to realise that a president can’t do everything he wants (it would be a supreme court decision – another reason to be worried about ageing justices). Still, if you believe a robust press is going to be vital in the years ahead, it has to be paid for. Otherwise, one day, all we’ll end up with is the Trump Times, the Peter Thiel Gazette and fake “news” reports on Facebook. Trump does not believe humans are responsible for climate change and has promised to “cancel” the Paris agreement on climate change and Obama’s Clean Power Plan. He has also said he will withdraw all funding from the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change. The US is the second-biggest emissions producer after China, and if it withdraws from the landmark agreement to reduce emissions, it could derail the whole thing. Why should the 192 other countries stick to their promises if the US doesn’t? Well, not to be dramatic, but because the future of life on Earth is at stake. It might seem futile to forgo that car journey or do a bit more recycling when it is predicted that a two-term Trump presidency would actually increase US carbon emissions by 16%, but we all need to do our bit – and more. If Brexit wasn’t enough of a wake-up call that the left is in serious trouble, maybe the US election will be. Now is the time to get involved in politics – join a political party, participate in meetings, recruit supporters. Insist progressive parties work together and do something to connect with people who believe them to be the preserve of out-of-touch, liberal elites. Donate to and volunteer with organisations such as Refugee Action, Calais Action, and Women for Refugee Women. Become a foster carer for unaccompanied minors. Stand up to rape culture. Support groups such as Hope Not Hate. True, not everyone who voted for Brexit or Trump is a rabid misogynist racist, but these wins allow rabid misogynist racists to believe people are behind them. It doesn’t have to be like that."
"Australia has used a summit on reducing greenhouse gas emissions to lobby the US energy minister in support of the development of one of the world’s largest coalmines. The move, by the Australian environment and energy minister, Josh Frydenberg, at the Marrekech meeting, won Australia the “fossil of the day” award, announced daily by the Climate Action Network to the countries that perform the worst at UN climate talks.   Awarding the fossil of the day award, the activists said: “Australia ratified the Paris agreement last Friday, so lobbying for coal expansion at the United Nations climate negotiations is an ugly, ugly thing to be doing. Shape up, Australia.”  Frydenberg said he raised concerns with the US energy secretary, Ernest Moniz, that Moniz’s Democratic party colleagues were associated with US activists who were trying to stop Adani’s Carmichael coalmine in Australia. If the Carmichael mine goes ahead, it would be the biggest coalmine in Australia and one of the biggest in the world. The annual emissions from burning the coal it produces would be similar to that of the whole of Malaysia or Austria and more than New York City. In October it was revealed that among the funders of one low-profile Australian activist group, the Sunrise Project, was the US-based charitable trust, the Sandler Foundation. The Sunrise Project had been involved in campaigns to try to stop Adani’s Carmichael coalmine and port expansions going ahead. The revelations came from hacked emails of Hillary Clinton’s campaign chairman, John Podesta, released by Wikileaks. They show Podesta was made aware of some of the Sunrise Project’s activities. The leaked emails reignited a campaign against the charitable status of environment groups. A report in the Australian newspaper said: “Australia is a key target in a global, no-holds-barred war against coal which has set a priority of shutting Adani out of Queensland.” The paper said in an editorial: “We should decide what mining projects are opened up in this country and the circumstances in which they open. “Such authority rests with Australia’s democratically elected representatives and established government processes. It does not belong with overseas governments (including prospective US presidents or their staff), self-appointed meddling international activists or local vigilante ‘lawfare’ litigants funded by activists.” Frydenberg took up this issue directly with Moniz, the Australian reported.  A spokesperson for Frydenberg told Guardian Australia: “The issue was raised by Mr Frydenberg with Mr Moniz. Mr Frydenberg noted the issue raised concerns in Australia and reiterated that Australia had a very effective environmental approvals process and that a large amount of conditions we’re attached to the Adani mine approval.” After the email leaks in October, head of the Sunrise Project, John Hepburn told Guardian Australia he was surprised the emails were considered newsworthy and said the Australian and the Minerals Council of Australia were acting hypocritically. “They’re saying that we need to guard our sovereignty from environmental organisations when the mining in Australia is 80% foreign-owned,” he said. “They put tens, if not hundreds, of millions of dollars into a massive public relations machine that is sustained and ongoing over time. They have incredible influence and revolving doors between the highest levels of politics and their lobby groups. “And international foreign-owned mining companies dropped $20m into a campaign to prevent a new tax on their industry and, in doing so, destabilised a prime minister. And that is the big issue in terms of national sovereignty.”"
"“Speaking of shills, if she teaches in Texas she probably gets grants from the oil industry.” This is one of the more polite social media missiles Katharine Hayhoe has had fired at her this week. But it’s hopelessly misguided.  Hayhoe is a climate scientist. And she’s on a mission to persuade skeptics that humans are frying the planet and time is running out to stop it. The last people she would take money from is Big Oil. While most US climate scientists live amid constant controversy, Hayhoe believes she is enduring an acute level of abuse because she reaches parts of the population many of her peers cannot reach. She’s an evangelical Christian. Her husband is an evangelical pastor, even, in a faith whose followers are largely skeptical of climate science. But stating the obvious doesn’t stop the hate mail. It’s stepped up a notch since the academic launched a new web series in recent weeks, Global Weirding – a twist on the term global warming – to explain to doubters why climate change is causing ever more peculiar, dangerous weather and it’s our fault. “Oh, I’ve been called the C-word, I’ve been called an ‘eff-wit’, some really disgusting stuff. Most of it is just hateful, hateful language, a lot of it anonymous – and when it’s not nameless, 99% of the time it’s from a white man. Facebook and Twitter’s systems for reporting abuse are garbage, by the way,” she said. Hayhoe is the director of the Climate Science Center at Texas Tech University in Lubbock, where she teaches and conducts research as an atmospheric scientist and an associate professor of political science. As a Texas-dwelling, evangelical Christian, atmospheric scientist, Hayhoe can often win the ears of many religious communities, receive invitations to address students at Christian colleges, or have conversations with mega-church-going Republican climate cynics she otherwise mightn’t meet or who wouldn’t listen. Her faith and, now, her web series, has led many people to tell her they had believed or suspected that human-influenced climate change was a liberal hoax but that she has changed their minds, she said. But Global Weirding has also brought increased hate mail. “I did have, a few years ago, a death threat, which I reported to the police,” she said. Now new floods of insults are pouring in since she launched the web series last month. She’s coping partly by seeing it as a “sort of encouraging, in a strange way” sign that she’s hitting new audiences, drawing contrarians and environmental converts alike. Hayhoe has made Global Weirding in conjunction with her local PBS TV station, KTTZ, and it’s released via YouTube. The short installments are released every other Wednesday, with the fourth one of the inaugural season due the day after the 8 November presidential election.  The series delivers a carefully calibrated, humorous, light-hearted lecture underpinned with serious science, featuring cartoons and Hayhoe talking on screen. The first episode sought to “bust the myth” of stereotypical “green liberals” having a monopoly on environmentalism. The second explained the history of climate science and why global warming isn’t a blip, a natural cycle or a leftwing conspiracy. And the third pointed out that while Texas emits more carbon than Germany, it’s also the US’s leading producer of wind energy and “has the potential to lead the nation in solar energy”. Forthcoming episodes explore themes such as “it’s not just polar bears”, “what happened in Paris?” and “religion in relation to climate change”. Evangelical Christians in the US are split on whether climate change is real and whether it’s mankind’s fault. The National Association of Evangelicals (NAE) supports the science but that body only represents a portion of the born-again faithful in America. “We have to draw a very clear line between US evangelicals and those in the rest of the world,” said Hayhoe. “I went to the Paris climate talks last December and the head of the World Evangelical Alliance, Efraim Tendero, was an official delegate. It doesn’t get more serious than that,” she said, referring to the talks that led to a historic deal in which, after years of conflict, almost 200 countries, including the US, signed an agreement to curb greenhouse gas emissions. That deal came into force on Friday after the US, China and the European Union agreed to ratify it in recent weeks. “In the US, the NAE supports the science but evangelicals are not a coherent denomination here. It’s extremely fragmented, there are no bishops or hierarchy, most churches have one overworked pastor and there’s a leadership vacuum on climate that’s being filled by conservative politicians and media,” Hayhoe said. She added that while evangelicals in other countries typically believe humans are changing the climate, only about 30 or 40% of US evangelicals agree. However, she said the skepticism is more linked to conservatism than religion per se. When Hayhoe encounters those insisting that what happens in the world is controlled by God, she explains the climate science – but can also reference the Bible. She quotes the book of Genesis to illustrate that “God gave us the planet and says we are responsible for it” and then Revelation, warning: “God will destroy those who destroy the Earth.” Hayhoe is Canadian, so won’t be voting on Tuesday. But she’s dismayed that “the US is the only country in the entire world where one major political party [the GOP] explicitly denies the reality of climate change,” she said. Based on what the rivals for the White House have said on the campaign trail, if Hillary Clinton wins on Tuesday Hayhoe will be “cautiously hopeful” about action to slow global warming. How will she feel if Donald Trump wins? “Alarmed,” she said."
"Delhi was this week blanketed with toxic fog after hundreds of thousands of people set off fireworks to mark Diwali (Report, 1 November). The pollution levels were up to 42 times the safe limit and even exceeded the normal harmful air in the city from traffic. In Britain, firework night and the following day are the peak days for hospital admissions for asthma and other breathing problems. Fireworks pollute the air with toxic heavy metals such as lead, mercury, aluminium, cadmium and radioactive barium, etc. Some of these are used to give fireworks their colours. Smoke from fireworks consists of fine toxic dusts that can enter the lungs. Work should be done to produce fireworks that are less harmful to health and the environment.Ann WillsRuislip, Middlesex • A couple of days before bonfire night and I’ve just picked a small but choice bowl of raspberries and eaten them outside in pleasant sunshine.

"As the world struggles to absorb the implications of Donald Trump’s unexpected victory in the US general election, no one is facing the future with more trepidation than those working on clean energy, clean transportation, climate and the environment. Hillary Clinton had promised to build on Obama’s substantial progress in this area; now they worry that it may be reversed, and then some. What does the future hold, under a Trump government, and how worried should we be?  The first thing to note is that Trump’s comments on energy during his campaign do not add up to a coherent policy. He promised that if he were elected, “the shale energy revolution will unleash massive wealth for America, and we will end the war on coal and the war on miners” – even though the two energy sources are in fact in competition. He dismissed wind and solar as expensive, ignoring all evidence that this is no longer the case. He is pro-nuclear. And, like almost every president since Richard Nixon, he promised US energy independence. On climate change, Trump famously claimed that “the concept of global warming was created by and for the Chinese in order to make US manufacturing non-competitive”. He pledged to “cancel” the Paris climate agreement and to rescind Obama’s Clean Power Plan. Trump resolutely opposed the wind farms that can be seen from his golf courses (though he has also acknowledged the threat of rising sea levels to those same golf courses). During his campaign, he promised to abolish the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), whose responsibility for regulating CO2 emissions was confirmed by the US Supreme Court a decade ago. Overall, on the environment, he said: “We’ll be fine, we can leave a little bit, but you can’t destroy businesses.” There is no question, then, that we are entering a time of potentially grave peril for the planet and for many of the industries that promise a sustainable long term future. But, just as the election of Obama did not mark “the moment when the rise of the oceans began to slow and our planet began to heal”, as he claimed when he was first elected president, nor will Trump’s election mark the opposite. For all the “war on coal” rhetoric, US coal’s biggest problem was never Obama, nor would it have been Hillary Clinton. It is cheap natural gas first, cheap renewable power second and flat electricity demand third. With endless shale gas and aging plants, the economics of US coal will continue to worsen, and individual states will continue to pursue action on reducing emissions. In oil and gas, removing regulations on fracking and opening up US national parks and federal lands to exploration might reduce costs, but not by much. The real threat to US domestic production is low global oil and gas prices, which look like they will be with us for some extended time. Although he portrays himself as a master dealmaker, Trump is a political novice and a divisive one. To abolish the EPA he would need the support of Congress. While both houses are controlled by Republicans, they do not have the 60 votes in the Senate needed to avoid a Democrat filibuster and act unilaterally. When it comes to the trillion dollars Trump promised to spend on roads and other infrastructure, he will face stiff opposition from fiscally conservative Republicans. Trump claims the Paris climate agreement will “give foreign bureaucrats control over how much energy [is used] right here in America”. That’s simply not true. Retreating from it would not result in a US energy or industrial renaissance – in fact, the opposite: the agreement is set to create global markets for exactly those clean energy and transportation technologies in which the US leads the world. Whatever happens in the US over the next four years, technologies such as wind and solar will continue getting cheaper until they beat out fossil fuels; battery and fuel-cell electric vehicles will keep getting better until they render internal combustion engines old fashioned. So the world will continue its inevitable transition to clean energy and transportation, just at a slower rate than if the US were fully committed to leading the process. Does that matter? I’ll leave the last words to President-elect Trump. In 2009, ahead of the Copenhagen Climate Summit, he was a co-signatory to a letter to Obama which pointed out that clean energy technologies would “spur economic growth, create new energy jobs and increase our energy security”. The letter concluded by saying: “If we fail to act now, it is scientifically irrefutable that there will be catastrophic and irreversible consequences for humanity and our planet.” A lot of people will be hoping he remembers those words when he takes office on 20 January next year."
"Cato Institute executive vice-president and author of The Libertarian Mind: A Manifesto for Freedom  In 2014, people were talking about a “libertarian moment” in US politics. An election in which the leading candidates have been a protectionist nationalist, an avowed socialist and a Democrat who can’t explain how she is not a socialist has put an end to such talk. Still, Gallup finds rising numbers of libertarian-leaning voters in the electorate, which should put some constraints on the next president’s agenda.  Eight years after the financial crisis, Barack Obama’s policies of more taxes, debt, and regulation have understandably kept GDP growth very slow. Neither Donald Trump’s promise of trade war and immigration cutoffs nor Hillary Clinton’s doubling down on Obama’s policies will help. Meanwhile, Washington hawks think that Obama, who has bombed seven countries, hasn’t been aggressive enough. They’re looking forward to a more assertive Clinton foreign policy. But Trump proved that you can get the Republican nomination by opposing the Iraq war and global interventionism, and that may lead to more resistance to endless war and more congressional constraints on presidential war powers. Director, Center for Legal and Judicial Studies at the Heritage Foundation There is no question that the future of the supreme court is on the ballot. In recent years, the court has been closely divided on a number of contentious issues: the first and second amendments (Citizens United, Heller); religious liberty (Hobby Lobby); voting rights (Crawford); racial preferences (Fisher I); same-sex marriage (Obergefell); and the death penalty (Glossip), among others.  With the exception of Obergefell, the late justice Antonin Scalia cast a pivotal vote with the majority in each of these cases. The stakes are therefore quite high in terms of who will fill his seat. Beyond that, three other justices – Ginsburg, Kennedy and Breyer – have already surpassed the average life expectancy for men and women in this country. Additional vacancies are thus likely to occur over the next four to eight years. And who sits in the Oval Office makes a big difference. Ronald Reagan looked for judges who would “protect the integrity of the constitution, not … add to it or subtract from it – certainly not … rewrite it”. Barack Obama views the “quality of empathy, of understanding and identifying with people’s hopes and struggles as an essential ingredient for arriving at just decisions and outcomes”. As the former attorney general Ed Meese stated: “No president exercises any power more far-reaching, more likely to influence his legacy, than the selection of federal judges.” President and founder, Progressive Policy Institute  Despite Donald Trump’s description of the American economy as a “disaster”, the evidence shows that it is finally starting to pick up steam and spread its rewards to working-class people. Median incomes have gone up and the poverty rate is falling. People are not wrong that there has been a long period of economic stagnation and increasing inequality, but we seem to be turning a corner. This is exactly the wrong time to adopt policies that are going to throw the economy into a tailspin. Threatening to shut down trade negotiations or promising to renegotiate settled trade agreements, for example the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP), makes no sense if the imperative is to build on the gathering momentum of the US economy. The case for the TPP has as much to do with America’s political influence and interest in Asia as it does with economics. Abandoning the TPP would be a huge gift to China. The other Asian countries will make accommodations to China, and America’s influence will plummet. That is the situation Hillary Clinton will inherit if she wins. The question, then, is how to reconcile the need to tap into those growing Asian markets with her shift on trade during the campaign. Arleigh Burke chair in strategy, Center for Strategic and International Studies The next administration will confront serious security challenges across the Middle East. Some are obvious and longstanding: the rise of Islamic State, the impact of the US invasion of Iraq, the fighting and instability in Iraq, Syria, Libya and Yemen. It is also true that by the time the next president takes office, the game will probably have a changed. If Isis is defeated in Iraq, which it may well be by the time the next administration is in place, that immediately means he or she will have to decide how to secure Iraq and how to proceed in Syria.  Isis has never been the only – or even the dominant – terrorist threat in the region. In 2015, estimates indicate that Isis accounted for about 20% of the terrorist incidents in the region. So when Isis is defeated as a proto-state, we will have to consider new threats. Do people migrate to other extremist movements? Do we see al-Qaida, which has made serious gains in Yemen and has a strong affiliate in Syria, grow? Does this expose new sectarian, ethnic or tribal tensions? There is a need to restructure US-Arab cooperation, with a consideration toward creating lasting civil stability. The Arab spring showed how civil forces – poor governance, lagging economic development, high youth unemployment – exacerbated regional upheaval and violence. There will not be security in the Middle East without stability. Vice-president for European Union and special initiatives, Atlantic Council This election will mark a shift from Europe being a partner in US foreign policy to it instead becoming itself a focus of foreign policy. This shift has been under way for some time but will be more marked in the coming years. The No 1 challenge a President Trump or a President Clinton will face is Russia. Mr Trump thinks he can get a “deal” but there is reason to believe that will prove far more challenging that he anticipates, and in the process he could upend a lot of relationships with US allies. For Secretary Clinton, given the series of hacks on the Democratic party and her campaign, she will probably take a very different position. The question then is: how much tougher will she get and how specifically she will engage with Russia? This will probably result in much more of an emphasis on countering disinformation and lead to much more intelligence gathering in collaboration with Europeans. Another major challenge for the US will be to get Europe to focus on something other than its own internal affairs: Brexit, slow economic growth and domestic politics, which have taken a sharp turn to the right. Next year, the Netherlands, France and Germany hold elections. If Mr Trump is elected, I believe there is more of a chance that rightwing parties will come to power. In a sense, his election gives permission to these movements to become more anti-American, creating a political dynamic in Europe that is more rightwing and more hostile to the US. Brexit has put the US in a position of trying to remain friends with both parties in a messy divorce. The US will have to build new relationships with Europe and with the UK, and this will take effort. Director of public policy, Guttmacher Institute Abortion has been legal throughout the US for more than 40 years, but it remains one of the country’s hottest political flashpoints. Donald Trump certainly has stumbled on the issue, especially when he said in a TV interview that if abortion were made illegal, women seeking one should be criminally punished – a statement that he later tried to reframe as “pro-life with exceptions”.  The Republican platform, however, is quite clear: it affirms “that the unborn child has a fundamental right to life which cannot be infringed” and it supports a human life amendment to the constitution. The Democratic platform supports a woman’s ability to obtain an abortion “regardless of where she lives, how much money she makes, or how she is insured”. In addition to abortion, access to contraceptive services and reproductive healthcare generally is also at stake. The Republicans have called for the repeal of the Affordable Care Act and have also targeted the Title X national family planning program and Planned Parenthood health clinics. Hillary Clinton is a lifelong champion for the reproductive health and rights of women. We should recall that she coined a now famous phrase “women’s rights are human rights”. Senior fellow and economist, Center on Labor, Human Services and Population at the Urban Institute Almost 14% of all Americans, and nearly 20% of American children, are poor. Child poverty can have lifelong consequences for health, education, earnings and more. Addressing the needs of poor young children and their parents is key. Hillary Clinton’s proposal to double the investment in Early Head Start would expand the reach of educational and other supports for younger children and their families, such as home-visiting programs for new mothers. Increased investment in childcare subsidies would make work pay for mothers of young children and ease the financial burden. And expanding the child tax credit and making it refundable would help struggling families. Donald Trump has spoken about improving childcare subsidies, but the benefits would tend to flow to higher-income families. Child poverty costs the US an estimated $500bn annually in lost productivity, crime, and poor health – substantially more than the estimated $77bn annually it would take to lift 60% of the country’s poor children out of poverty. Investing in poor children and families can deliver high returns to the US public. Senior fellow, Energy and Environment team, Center for American Progress There is a lot at stake in this election for climate change policy, for the health and safety of our planet, and for the wellbeing of people around the globe. The next president will face a pressing to-do list and we are sadly running out time to prevent unmanageable climate change. Whoever wins the election will need to move quickly to meet the US commitment under the Paris agreement on climate change to reduce emissions by 26-28% from 2005 levels by 2020. He or she will also need to put forward an even more ambitious national climate goal. The next president will also have to set a foreign policy agenda that will reduce the risk of conflict and migration in a warming world. The question before us this election is: who is the most fit to take these crucial domestic and international steps? Hillary Clinton understands the very real and costly threat of climate change. She has committed to implement an “aggressive response” that will support clean energy innovation and jobs in the US. Donald Trump, on the other hand, believes extreme weather does not hurt people and that climate change is a “hoax” created by the Chinese. He has also said he would “cancel” the Paris agreement and aggressively pursue fossil fuel extraction. The US and the world need an American president who will continue to lead domestic and international efforts to prevent dangerous climate changes. Clinton plans to do this and is the best candidate to curb the high risks of a warming planet."

"Randy Voepel is a big fan of climate change because America’s “enemies are on the equator” and a warmer climate will make their lives worse.  Voepel, a Republican running unopposed to be a California assemblyman, told a reporter in 2007 that he likes global warming because of the harm it will bring to certain nations and because “warmer weather gives the region warm days in November”, the Voice of San Diego reported at the time.  Nine years later, as he prepares to become a state legislator in the liberal Golden State, Voepel’s unusual stance hasn’t shifted. “Most of our enemies live in hot climates, desert climates,” he told the Guardian on Friday, saying he stands by his remarks. “It will probably have a negative effect on their environment.” Voepel, currently the mayor of Santee, a San Diego suburb, has a history of making bizarre statements about communism, homelessness and the environment, among other things, according to the Los Angeles Times, which rounded up his most memorable comments over the years. Asked about his earlier remarks touting the benefits of climate change, Voepel told the Times: “Most of the Muslim nations are in the hot areas of the world.” When the Guardian asked for clarification, the mayor said: “I’m not at all against Muslims, but I reject sharia law. The Muslims that practice sharia law do not recognize the United States Constitution, and they do not recognize our laws or the European Union laws.” The threats of sharia law are largely rooted in myths, and in recent years Republican politicians in the US have increasingly made inflammatory statements about supposed the dangers sharia law could bring to America. Many in the Republican party, including at times presidential candidate Donald Trump, have continued to reject the science of climate change. In the phone interview Friday, Voepel said: “I believe only about 1% of climate change is impacted by human beings. The rest of the 99% is solar cycles, the natural wobbling of the earth and volcanic activities.” A bulk of evidence shows that humans are responsible for about 100% of the warming since 1950. California has been a leader in the US with some of the most ambitious climate change policies, and Voepel said he would do his best to fight back. “The way California goes is the way the United States goes,” he said on Friday. “I would vote no no no no no.”  The Times also found a television interview in which the mayor blamed homeless residents for stripping copper out of a park in Santee. “I’m getting attacked here by the Viet Cong, stealing my copper, and I don’t like it,” Voepel said at the time.  He told the Guardian, “It isn’t like I have a war going on against the homeless.” On communism, the Times reported that Voepel once reportedly refused to give his autograph to someone claiming to be a Chinese national, saying, “I respectfully decline to cooperate in any way with what I consider to be an enemy of the United States.” “Chi-Coms are Chi-Coms,” he told the reporter last week, referring to communists in China. Voepel is on track to represent a heavily Republican district, replacing a termed-out assemblyman. An earlier opponent dropped out in April and endorsed Voepel. There are 80 members of California’s assembly who propose and vote on state policy. The mayor of 16 years told the Guardian that his positions match the conservative values of his constituents, adding: “I’m just a little more gutsy and flamboyant than most conservatives.”"
"Many of us in the United States are in deep shock and despair. The election of Donald Trump speaks of a country and a world that represents so many things that go against our deepest grains. However, as I told my children this morning, the Earth will still turn, the sun will still rise. In fact, a Trump presidency will not have the dire consequences that many of us fear – especially for people like me who will be insulated from his policies. Surely it will change the economics and courts in the US, among other things. But really, all of these are transient. The one thing that isn’t transient is the impact this will have on climate change. It is now virtually certain the world will not meet any of its climate targets. If Trump (and the Republican-controlled Congress) stand by their pledges, we will see a major rollback of the tremendous progress that has been made on reducing emissions. A Trump presidency will likely set us back at least a decade, perhaps longer. And that is a decade we can’t afford.  The world will blow past the 2C (3.6F) target set in Paris. This means it will be difficult to avoid the worst consequences of climate change.  The election also affects how we should talk about climate change. In the US, and in many other countries, opposing steps to cut carbon pollution has become a litmus test for conservative politicians. So, in this sense, conservatives now own climate change. I can just imagine the slogans, “Climate change, brought to you by your neighborhood conservatives.” George W Bush was the worst president ever on climate change. Back then, with the reality of climate change not as widely known, it is conceivable to give voters a pass. But not now. Anyone who voted for Trump shares the responsibility for what is now inevitable.  It’s really too bad because many conservatives certainly don’t want to destroy the Earth’s climate. Furthermore, there are some conservatives who do take climate change seriously. However, when a central belief to conservatism results in decades of inaction, it makes it impossible to avoid staring facts in the face. Conservatives own climate change. Conservatives own the consequences of climate change. They own the increased droughts, more severe storms, sea level rise, and floods. They own the heat waves, the loss of habitat and the shifting climate zones. They own the climate refugees, the resulting political strive, and climate conflicts.  They own it all. Liberals, both in the US and around the world, have tried to work with conservatives to devise practical plans that will reduce the threats of climate change. In the past few years there was real progress.  We had hope. Now, we can look forward to the US going backwards. Becoming the world’s laggard on climate change (again). Once again, America’s leaders will describe climate change as a hoax or as a non-threat.  So, I’d like to rename climate change to “Climate Change, brought to you by Conservatives”. I will spend the next four years reminding people that the climate change we are seeing, and the climate change which is now unavoidable could have been stopped. I will count up the economic and social consequences of climate change which could have been stopped. These are now the liability of conservatives. The financial costs of adapting will also be owned by conservatives. They asked for it, they got it. Our job is to never let them forget it."

"Donald Trump has been short on policy details during his campaign. But already, the president-elect has hinted at an agenda that is as ambitious as it is disturbing on key policy issues. Here’s what he will inherit and how he might respond, from the Guardian’s specialists.   Trump will enter the White House riding a wave of xenophobia and fear driven in no small part by his plans to drastically overhaul America’s immigration system. The president-elect has pledged to implement many tenets of his controversial reform package from day one and will now be emboldened by a Republican majority in both houses of Congress. Meanwhile, countless immigrant communities across America will no doubt be terrified about just how far he might go.  Trump’s promise to build an “impenetrable physical wall” across the US southern border will supposedly commence on his first day in office. But the kicker to his now infamous campaign slogan – making “Mexico pay for it” – will prove a near impossible deal to broker as experts predict the cost of such a construction could be four times higher ($40bn) than Trump estimated during the campaign. Aside from the economics, the humanitarian consequences of increasing border security as hundreds of thousands of Central American migrants continue to flee violence at home and seek refuge in the US are near unfathomable.  Trump’s administration has pledged to pursue a temporary ban on migration from regions he deems exporters of terrorism and where even his “extreme vetting” will not be sufficient. Although this policy has gone through many iterations, the legality of such a program will almost certainly be challenged in the courts by those who argue it will simply act as a smokescreen to allow discrimination against Muslims seeking to enter America. Nonetheless, Trump is likely to be buoyed by the assistance of Congress.  For the 11 million undocumented immigrants living in the US, Trump’s presidency will usher in an era of heightened uncertainty and paranoia, as the president-elect has pledged to ramp up deportations. Trump will triple the number of Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents and seek to create a “special deportation taskforce”. Although the president-elect has claimed this taskforce will first focus on “the most dangerous criminal illegal immigrants”, Trump has made clear that any undocumented migrants could be affected. Up to 6.5 million people could be at risk of swift deportation.  The key question for the new administration will be at what point, if any, can it satisfy the demands of its white, conservative base, whipped up by the rhetoric of the campaign.  Oliver Laughland Trump now has control over the vast US security apparatus, with all its power to kill, surveil and influence. Trump, whose command of policy specifics is minimal, has made no secret of his inclination to unleash it. Now he faces early tests of how far he will go. Barack Obama will leave office with Guantánamo Bay still in operation as a detention facility. Trump’s election ensures the infamous wartime prison escapes closure, but it will probably cross a constitutional Rubicon. The president-elect has pledged to increase the Guantánamo population, a reversal of Obama’s approach, “with some bad dudes”. Among those “bad dudes”, Trump told the Miami Herald, could be American citizens. His pledge to bring back “worse than waterboarding” threatens to undo the shaky coalition against torture, especially in a GOP Congress, of the late Bush and Obama administrations.  The move would be illegal if Trump meant to try Americans in military commissions, and almost sure to be found unconstitutional if Trump meant holding Americans in indefinite detention. In the same interview, Trump also signaled a departure from both Obama and George W Bush in expressing opposition to using the criminal justice system for terrorism cases. Since Trump’s definition of the domestic threat has centered on what he has called “radical Islamic terror”, US Muslim communities, already the target of widespread law-enforcement suspicion since 9/11, would probably find themselves subject to a separate system of wartime justice in which they would enjoy fewer rights. Trump has unapologetically embraced “profiling” as a “commonsense” approach to predicting terrorist threats, by which he means increasing police and intelligence scrutiny of Muslim communities. Trump has endorsed surveillance in mosques and even a database of American Muslims, incendiary proposals that threaten traditional American liberties. The response of the FBI’s leadership – which already has a strong base of support for Trump and a history of teaching its agents to consider Islam itself a danger – will be a pivotal test for justice in the Trump era. So will his choice of intelligence agency leaders, as Trump has attracted little support among experienced intelligence officials outside of the far-right fringe.  Another immediate test Trump faces will be a military challenge. Obama will leave 8,400 US troops in Afghanistan. The fortunes of America’s longest war are on a downward trajectory as the Taliban reconquers lost terrain. Trump, who has criticized a withdrawal in Iraq he once supported as a gift to Islamic State, must now choose departure, failure or escalation. Spencer Ackerman Trump spent the campaign threatening to upend what has been called the liberal international order, the network of treaties and multilateral institutions that govern global relations. He has said he would tear up and renegotiate trade treaties, and has even called into question US commitment to the Nato alliance, the linchpin of western cohesion. With a completely new kind of leader preparing to enter the Oval Office, it is already looking like a world turned upside down. The long-negotiated multilateral trade deals the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) and the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership with Europe (TTIP) will be the first to be halted. Opposition to those accords was a cornerstone of the Trump campaign. Trump has also said he would take apart the 1994 North American Free Trade Agreement (Nafta) that binds the US economically it to its neighbors, Canada and Mexico. In place of such treaties, he has said he would negotiate bilateral deals that would be more favorable for US manufacturing. But he would face hostile trading partners, irritated at the dumping of major agreements. Trump’s America could easily face a trade backlash and a downward economic spiral. The other consistent theme of the Trump campaign was a foreign policy that revolved around his personality. He would bring his self-vaunted skills as a businessman to cut bilateral deals with other world leaders, particularly the autocrats.  Trump said he would even talk to Kim Jong-un if the North Korean dictator would travel to the US for the conversation. That is unlikely, but the prospect of an unconditional dialogue between leaders would throw a wild card into a deadlocked and extremely dangerous situation in which Pyongyang is well on the way to developing a nuclear warhead small enough to put on a missile, and a missile able to reach the west coast of the United States.  The relationship that will define the Trump presidency, however, will be with Vladimir Putin. Each of them has showered the other with praise. At every turn in the campaign, Trump refused to criticize Russian expansionist foreign policy in Ukraine and Syria. His aides specifically removed language from the Republican party platform about sending lethal aid to Ukraine, and Trump himself has echoed Putin’s denials of Russian military presence in the country’s east. In Syria, he has characterised the Russian and Assad regime bombardment of the opposition as a war on Islamic extremism, again emulating Moscow’s line.  Trump’s twin policies on the Islamic State (Isis) were to “take their oil” and “bomb the shit out of them”. The first is impractical without a vast military occupation and the second is illegal if it was suggesting indiscriminate bombing. A dual offensive against Isis is under way aimed at its twin strongholds of Raqqa and Mosul led by US allies, and a President Trump would face serious resistance from the Pentagon if he wanted to put US boots on the ground or carry out joint operations with the Russians. Early on in a Trump presidency, expect a summit with Putin in which US-Russian relations will be reworked along lines the Russian leader has been pushing for, ceding Moscow areas of influence in the Middle East and on Russian borderlands. Such a discussion will shock major US allies in Nato, an alliance Trump has described as “obsolete”. He has questioned whether it would be worthwhile for the US to provide a security umbrella to allies who are not deemed to have contributed enough, in financial terms, to collective security. Turmoil within Nato could meanwhile tempt Putin to make encroachments on its eastern flank. Few are more worried about the global consequences of a Trump win than the residents of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania. Julian Borger The one constant in Trump’s scattershot health policy is his promise to immediately repeal Obamacare. Just last week, Trump said that if elected he would convene a special congressional session to destroy the 2009 healthcare reform.  If he successfully repeals the law, which is unlikely, it would disproportionately affect low-income people, according to multiple analyses. The number of uninsured individuals would increase by 16m to 25m, according to the Commonwealth Fund, a research group. It would also increase the federal deficit, according to the same analysis, because the end of Obamacare means the end of taxes the health reform law brings in – adding about $33bn more to the deficit in the first year. There is also the question of what replaces Obamacare. The closest thing the Republicans have to a substitute is a blueprint created by the House speaker, Paul Ryan, who has a rocky relationship with the president-elect.  For these reasons and more, it is unlikely Trump would get the congressional approval needed to actually repeal the law, though he and the Republican-dominated Congress could tear away at some of its key provisions. The rest of his health proposals are similarly chaotic. Trump’s seven-point plan for healthcare includes allowing people to purchase insurance across state lines (allowing for greater variation in insurance regulations), deduct health insurance premiums from their tax returns and use health savings accounts. He also aims to require price transparency from healthcare providers, allow more drugs to be imported from overseas and give block grants for Medicaid to states. And his plan would reduce access to abortion, contraception and preventative care.  Trump’s ideas “bewilder” establishment GOP health experts such as Robert Laszewski, who told the New York Times in April that the proposals were “a jumbled hodgepodge of old Republican ideas, randomly selected, that don’t fit together”. Amanda Holpuch Trump enters office with a lot of question marks hanging over his proposals on issues of gender. Will he support a childcare policy that doesn’t leave low-income families out in the cold? Would he continue to enforce the Obama administration’s executive actions on campus sexual assault? Would he preserve executive orders that protect transgender individuals from discrimination? Trump hasn’t answered these questions, but if he follows the lead of the rest of the Republican party, the answer is probably a big “no”. Throughout the election, on issues of major cultural significance, Trump has tacked further and further to the right. After starting his campaign by suggesting that he was open to funding Planned Parenthood, for instance, and that Roe v Wade was settled law, he has come to fully embrace the Republican party line. Supreme court justices? They should be pro-life. Planned Parenthood? He’ll defund it. Trump also opposes the use of Medicaid to cover abortions for low-income women, and with a Republican Congress, he is willing to make that a matter of law. Trump’s journey to the right is by no means limited to abortion rights. Earlier this year, Trump said he had no problem with trans people using the bathroom that corresponds with their gender identity. Later, he backtracked, saying states such as North Carolina should have the ability to dictate which facilities a trans person can use.  There is one big exception to Trump’s rightward tilt. For the first time in recent memory, Trump, as the Republican nominee for president, proposed a national plan to guarantee paid family leave. (“Wow!” he said when he announced his plan at rallies.)  But the plan doesn’t get you very far if you’re not wealthy, or, in the case of parental leave, if you’re not a woman who has given birth. Trump has proposed giving women six weeks of leave at the same rate as their state’s unemployment benefits. The plan only covers women who have given birth and does not cover fathers at all, nor women who become mothers through adoption or surrogacy. Trump also proposes allowing families to deduct the cost of childcare from their taxes, but economists have criticized the plan as both expensive to taxpayers and of marginal benefit for low-income families.  Molly Redden Trump has a difficult and confusing relationship with Wall Street and it’s not likely to get any better now that he is in the White House. Stock markets soared the day before the election when the FBI announced it was not going to reopen its investigation into Hillary Clinton’s emails, a move investors bet would boost her chances of election. On Wednesday global markets crashed and the US looked set to follow in the wake of his surprise victory but soon recovered on the back of a conciliatory victory speech from Trump. Trump has been seen as bad for business. Big banks don’t like his anti-trade policies and the instability his foreign policies might bring. But in some ways Wall Street could find they have a new friend in the White House, as long as they are prepared to suck up to him.  On the campaign trail Trump has consistently railed against Dodd-Frank, the financial rules brought in after the last financial crisis in an attempt to curb Wall Street’s excessive appetite for risk. “We have to get rid of Dodd-Frank. The banks aren’t loaning money to people that need it … The regulators are running the banks,” he told Fox News last October. Wall Street would be happy with less regulation but it might not be so happy with Trump’s tax plans. “The hedge fund guys are getting away with murder … They’re paying nothing, and it’s ridiculous,” he told CBS’s Face The Nation last August. He is proposing to end a tax loophole that allows billionaire hedge fund managers to pay the 20% capital gains tax rate rather than the 39.6% top rate of income tax. He’s also promised to get tough on Wall Street (although confusingly not with regulation). “I know the people on Wall Street. We’re going to have the greatest negotiators of the world, but at the same time I’m not going to let Wall Street get away with murder. Wall Street has caused tremendous problems for us. We’re going to tax Wall Street,” Trump said at a rally in January. But his first test may well be the mega-merger of AT&T and Time Warner. Trump has already called the $85bn deal a threat to democracy. If his first move is to signal that the deal is off, Wall Street may worry that businesses will put future deals on hold as long as he’s in the White House. Dominic Rushe At a pivotal time when greenhouse gas emissions must be drastically shrunk in order to prevent climate breakdown, the world’s largest economy is now headed by a man who believes climate change is a hoax, perhaps perpetrated by the Chinese. The doomsday moment for a livable climate could well be a step closer with the election of Trump, environmentalists fear.  One of Trump’s first tasks is likely to be withdrawing the US from the Paris climate deal, making it an outlier among the planet’s functioning governments, which have all signed up to the accord. The exit process will take around four years, so the US would be on its own in time for Trump’s second term or a new president’s first. The US quitting the Paris deal could bring the whole edifice down, making the steep challenge of keeping the global temperature increase to 2C close to impossible. This would result in a sea level rise that would inundate millions of Americans’ homes, cause punishing heatwaves, trigger the spread of disease and disastrous extreme weather events, and threaten America’s national security. But the worst of these consequences would unfold after Trump’s presidency, so he could concentrate on his other environmental policies. He’s hinted at scrapping the Environmental Protection Agency, tasking Myron Ebell, a leading climate change denier, to head his EPA transition team.  Trump has also promised to cut all federal climate spending, which would encompass billions of dollars spent on clean energy development and hundreds of millions of dollars in aid to countries at greatest risk from climate change. Trump has said he will “end the war on coal and the war on miners” in order to reboot the industry, while also expanding drilling for natural gas. He has not explained how these contradictory policies will be achieved, given that the advance of gas has caused the decline in coal, but has insisted upon an “America first” stance on energy. He might also want to start building a sea wall for his Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida, as he is doing at his Irish golf course. Oliver Milman Trump’s win is a tremendous victory for the National Rifle Association, which endorsed him early and has been one of his staunchest allies.  Trump has pledged to roll back gun restrictions to make gun-carrying legal in more places, including on military bases and perhaps in schools. He said he supports a new federal law that would make concealed carry permits issued in one state valid across the country. This legislation, long a policy priority for gun owners, could undermine the current strict local gun restrictions in states like California and New York.  In what was the NRA’s central priority this election, Trump also promised to nominate a staunchly pro-gun supreme court justice to replace Antonin Scalia, which would protect and perhaps even broaden the court’s landmark 2008 Heller decision protecting Americans’ right to own guns for self-defense.  To reduce the toll of gun violence, Trump has argued that law enforcement should be “tougher” and has dubbed himself the “law and order candidate”, a stance that cuts against what had been a growing bipartisan consensus that America’s criminal justice system is too expensive and too punitive.  “We need to get serious about prosecuting violent criminals,” Trump’s second amendment policy briefing reads. “Violent crime in cities like Baltimore, Chicago and many others is out of control. Drug dealers and gang members are given a slap on the wrist and turned loose on the street. This needs to stop.” Trump has suggested resurrecting a controversial Bush-era federal program, Project Exile, which encouraged US attorneys to use the threat of tougher federal prosecutions for gun crimes to attempt to deter gun violence.  He said in August that he believed Chicago police could put a stop to the city’s spiraling gun violence epidemic “in one week” by “being very much tougher”. The key, he said, was “using tough police tactics, which is OK when people are being killed”. Trump has also argued that laws that “empower law-abiding gun owners to defend themselves” are “another way to fight crime”. Lois Beckett Trump comes into office having mostly either antagonized or ignored the growing and vocal number of Americans demanding criminal justice reform. Instead, most of Trump’s campaign promises around criminal justice focused on restoring “law and order”. Trump also frequently made factually unsupported statements about about violent crime rates nationwide and their historical context. Trump has been characteristically vague on justice reform. But he has repeatedly pledged support for police officers and law enforcement in the face of public criticism. Candidate Trump has expressed an interest in the continued privatization of prisons, and has criticized President Obama for cutting short the sentences of long-serving nonviolent drug offenders, calling grantees “bad dudes”. He proposed a law mandating the death penalty for anyone convicted of killing a police officer. Among Trump’s first targets may be rolling back the Obama administration’s unilateral efforts to address mass incarceration. Trump plans to immediately halt the president’s Clemency 2014 initiative, which in 2016 cut short a record number of federal prison sentences. Trump is also likely to undo the executive order signed by the president in May 2015 to curb the transfer of military equipment to police departments.  A veto threat from Trump could thwart any potential for passage of the bipartisan Sentencing Reform and Corrections Act introduced to Congress last year by the Republican senator Chuck Grassley. The bill proposes to reduce mandatory minimum sentencing for non-violent crimes. His election, along with the Republican sweep of both chambers of Congress, seems to squelch any hope of more progressive reform from lawmakers. A Trump-led Department of Justice and FBI could also spell doom for federal efforts to track police use of force and killings by the police, as Trump has not identified the current lack of data as a priority at any point during the presidential campaign. Trump could also instruct his justice department to change course on its move away from private prisons announced in August. A Trump presidency surely means the end of any collaboration or mutual understanding between the White House and Black Lives Matter activists and reformers. Trump has repeatedly declared that police ought to be granted more power, rather than less, which runs counter to many reform goals. Various White House initiatives aimed at promoting collaborative reform between police and communities, and finding less punitive solutions to criminal justice challenges are also likely to come to a crashing halt. Jamiles Lartey"
"John Kerry has signalled that the outgoing Obama administration is preparing a fight to ensure that Donald Trump does not withdraw the US from the landmark Paris agreement, to prevent catastrophic climate change. “This is bigger than one person, one president,” the US secretary of state said in Marrakech, before his last address to the UN climate summit being held there. “We have to figure out how we’re going to stop this.” President Obama is walking a fine line before leaving office, between an imperative to staunch the threat that climate change poses to US and global interests, and the need to respect the results of last week’s US election.  In a speech that pulled few punches, Kerry made a detailed and often emotional plea to the incoming US president to listen to faith leaders, military chiefs, businessmen, activists and – above all – climate scientists, before abandoning future generations to the ravages of climate change. “I ask you on behalf of billions of people around the world,” he said. “Do your own due diligence before making irrevocable choices. “No-one has the right to make decisions that affect billions of people based solely on ideology or without proper input.” Minutes before he spoke, the US released the first long-term climate strategy under the Paris agreement, offering a blueprint for reducing national emissions by 80% by 2050, measured against 2005 levels. That presentation, like Kerry’s words, was given added urgency by the UN forecasting that 2016 will very likely be the hottest year on record, setting a new high for the third year running. Kerry said: “This year will contribute to the hottest decade in human history, which was preceded by the second hottest decade, which was preceded by the third-hottest decade. At some point even the strongest climate sceptic has to acknowledge that something is happening.” In a meeting across from the room that Kerry spoke in, business leaders added their weight to the calls for the Paris agreement to be protected.  It's a climate change accord agreed by nearly 200 countries in December 2015, which came into force on 4 November 2016. The agreement commits world leaders to keeping global warming below 2C, seen as the threshold for safety by scientists, and pursuing a tougher target of 1.5C. The carbon emission curbs put forward by countries under Paris are not legally-binding but the framework of the accord, which includes a mechanism for periodically cranking those pledges up, is binding. The agreement also has a long-term goal for net zero emissions which would effectively phase out fossil fuels.   Kevin Rabinovitch, the global sustainability director for Mars Inc, said: “We are a food business. We have supply chains all over the world and at the base of every business is a farm, which is exposed to the climate. Since climate change affects the raw materials we buy, we are affected by it and if we don’t prevent the consequences that have been predicted, they will have a real impact for our business.” Kerry held out some hope of continued progress to slow climate change, outlining the unparalleled growth of the US renewable energy industry since Obama’s 2008 poll victory, citing a tripling of wind power since 2008, and a 30-fold increase in solar capacity.  But he stressed that with new coal plants coming online in Asia and other parts of the world, the impressive gains made by renewables – starting from a low baseline – would not be enough to prevent a climatic disaster.  “The question now is not whether we will transition to a clean energy economy. That, we are already beginning to do,” Kerry told the packed hall. “But whether we will have the will to get this job done – whether we will make the transition in time ... to prevent catastrophic damage.” “I’m not a Cassandra, but I am a realist,” he added. “Time is not on our side.”  Coal is still responsible for 30% of the world’s energy production, and 50% of its emissions, while renewables still only provide just over a tenth of the world’s power, Kerry noted.  His address was peppered with implicit and explicit references to the climate sceptic Trump. He said that government leadership was “absolutely essential” to the clean power transformation, and hinted that Trump’s promise to withdraw from the Paris climate pact might be tempered with the realities of office.  “I have learned that some issues look a bit different when you are in office, compared to when you’re on the campaign trail,” he said. “The truth is that climate change should not be a partisan issue in the first place.”  With a flourish, Kerry finished his address with a reference to his decision to carry his two-year-old granddaughter on to the stage to sign the Paris agreement. “Let us make clear to the world we will always remember the stakes. Let us stay clear to the goals made in Paris and redouble our efforts to meet them,” he said. Delegates jumped to their feet for a spontaneous two minute standing ovation, in a collective release of emotion by delegates who remain uncertain and fearful at the prospect of a Trump presidency.  In London, the world’s leading energy watchdog warned that promises by Trump to revive the fortunes of the US coal industry may be doomed to failure. The International Energy Agency (IEA), in its annual World Energy Outlook, found that coal was “at an inflexion point” with a marked decline in consumption in the biggest market, China.  Fatih Birol, executive director of the IEA, told the Guardian in an interview: “Coal is losing ground because it is losing competitiveness. In the US gas is cheaper than coal.” It would take major policy shifts to change these economics, he said. “Gas will be a very economic option [for decades] unless there are new government policies and new fiscal measures to change the balance.” Birol issued a veiled warning to Trump that policy should be based on the realities of the energy sector: “We give the same advice to all leaders across the world: making decisions about the energy sector needs good information and an overview of developments, including technological improvements. Any decision making, in my view, needs to look at the latest data across the sector very carefully.” He added: “Decisions taken [by governments] about the energy sector have very long lasting implications, and not just for this sector, but across the whole economy, and they have environmental and social impacts.”"
"On Sunday, the capital city of one of the world’s fastest growing economies was effectively shut down in an emergency act. The reason was not terrorism, but air pollution. The threat to citizens from smog in Delhi was judged so great that traffic was ratioined, coal-fired power stations closed and diesel generators suspended. This was a brave and sane decision in the world’s largest democracy. Right now Delhi is the world’s most polluted city. But air quality is at crisis levels in cities around the world. More than 300 million children live at the severest risk, Unicef declared last week, and 2 billion in areas where outdoor pollution exceeds health guidelines. Half of Delhi’s schoolchildren have permanently impaired lung capacity, thanks to the air they breathe.  India’s capital city is telling people to stay away or work from home, but offering no compensation to those who cannot, or whose livelihood suffers. This can only be a short-term solution; it hurts those who can least bear it. Although the prime minister Theresa May will have been sheltered from the worst of the choking smog during her trip to India, arriving in Delhi should have been a powerful warning about the effects of privileging growth over environmental concerns. Citizens of rich countries are sometimes too relaxed about such things when air pollution afflicts the richest cities as well as the poorest. That London has not yet been closed down in similar fashion to Delhi is only through lack of courage on the part of the government. Air quality in London has hit levels worse than those in Delhi and Beijing. Earlier this year, annual air pollution limits were breached in just a week. Earlier this month, in what may be one of the last chances to bring EU law to bear on the issue, the high court ruled that the government had knowingly failed to draw up plans to bring it within legal limits and there must be immediate action, even if that means drastic measures to curtail traffic. The causes of air pollution differ around the world, from coal-fired power plants to agricultural burning. One constant is traffic. Older cars and diesel engines produce particulates that clog up the lungs and may enter brain tissue, and nitrogen oxides that affect breathing. Car manufacturers were forced to admit last year that they had flouted tests on their diesel emissions. But the bigger question is why in a shortsighted attempt to reduce greenhouse gases by a tiny amount (diesel cars do more miles to the gallon) the risks were ignored, and customers persuaded that diesel cars were actually greener. Now that the consequences for air quality are clear, it is time to rebalance taxation and regulation in favour of petrol, which is cleaner though producing more carbon, and urgently incentivise electric cars. In London Sadiq Khan, the new mayor, to his credit has taken a strong line on air pollution, in contrast to Boris Johnson’s tactics which amounted to unconvincing denial and attempts to silence scientists. Mr Khan should move faster still on banning the most polluting vehicles – he would find public support in inner London. Air pollution shames us all. From Beijing to Los Angeles, Marseille to Manila, the air we breathe in cities has deteriorated so much that it is no longer safe for children. Adults who grew up breathing cleaner air are more resilient in the face of polution. But when a child’s lungs are damaged, they are damaged for life. The next generation already carries the burden of our inaction. This is a problem we know how to solve. Cut down coal-fired power, cut out diesel in cities, encourage electric cars and public transport. India should follow the declaration of emergency with long-term action, not just this short-term fix. Richer cities, London foremost among them, should be ashamed that they, with all their resources, have failed their children for so long. The high court judges were right. The government can and must act now."
"Herbivorous tropical fish have destroyed kelp forests in northern New South Wales, showing that even small increases in ocean temperature can lead to kelp deforestation, an Australian study has found. The University of NSW study, published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences on Tuesday, found that the disappearance of kelp from waters near Coffs Harbour coincided with a threefold increase in the number of tropical fish in the region. The deforestation coincided with an 0.6 degree temperature rise. While that was not enough to directly impact the kelp, lead author Dr Adriana Vergés said it had the “truly catastrophic” effect of attracting hungry fish. The study examined video footage of 12 sites between 2002 and 2011. In 2002, six of the sites contained kelp. By 2010, all the kelp was gone. The proportion of kelp showing signs of bite marks increased from less than 10% in 2002 to more than 70% in 2008, before there was no kelp to measure. At the same time the proportion of tropical fish in the ecosystem increased from less than 10% to more than 30%. Most prolific were surgeonfish, which increased from 9% of the local fish population in 2002 to 33% at the end of the study period in 2011. Once the kelp had been removed, the ecosystem changed “quite dramatically” to become more tropical, in a trend Vergés said could potentially be seen globally. “We call it a homogenisation of community,” she said. “It’s a bit like globalisation – everything starts to become the same everywhere.”  Researchers used video originally filmed to catalogue fish populations to track the decline of the kelp forests and also conducted experiments in kelp-free areas to see what fish would appear to snack on a spring of transplanted kelp. In one of the videos, a school of rabbitfish crowded around a scrap of kelp briefly lifts to let a shark glide past, before descending again. In another a lamington urchin, a creature that looks like a bald tennis ball that has been cut in half and covered in white spikes, can be seen motoring towards the kelp from some distance away before crawling on to the frond. Urchins are traditional kelp grazers but this species is tropical. Vergés said the decision to examine the impact of fish stemmed from a similar study into mass kelp death off the Western Australian coast, where a 100km stretch of kelp forests died in a marine heatwave in 2011.  That study found the kelp was prevented from regenerating by rabbitfish and parrotfish, which ate any regrowth. The director of the Sydney Institute of Marine Science, Prof Peter Steinberg, who contributed to the UNSW study, said the findings increased the range of temperatures that could be considered to have a catastrophic impact because the tropical fish were triggered by a much smaller increase in temperature. “It may be in Western Australia the heatwave simply beat the fish to it,” he said."
"As the world gathers in Morocco for the historic first meeting under the Paris agreement – called “COP22” but now also “CMA1” – it does so with the unprecedented involvement of corporate interests who have fought climate action around the world, funded climate change denial and whose fundamental interest is in extracting and burning as much fossil fuel as possible. Earlier this year, desperate moves from countries representing the majority of the world’s population to examine how the UN might identify and minimise conflicts of interest were swept under the carpet by rich countries – especially the US, EU and Australia – who argued they wanted to be as “inclusive” as possible and that the concept of “conflict of interest” was too hard to define.  As a result, representatives of companies such as ExxonMobil, Chevron, Peabody, BP, Shell and RioTinto will have unquestioned access to most discussions in Marrakech, will be called upon for advice and will be walking the corridors and holding private discussions with countries that are trying to move the world to stop consuming the products those companies have based their businesses on. The bodies through which those companies access the COP22 meetings have been detailed in a chart created by Corporate Accountability International. Groups such as the World Coal Association, the Business Council of Australia, Business Europe and Business Roundtable will represent the world’s biggest fossil fuel companies in the meetings through their “observer status”. Jesse Bragg from Corporate Accountability International says it is clear those groups are driven by a profit motive and not by the desire to curb carbon emissions, and so have a conflict of interest. “It’s hard to believe the World Coal Association is having conversations with delegates, encouraging them to more strictly regulate the coal industry,” Bragg says. “That’s completely against their interests. So what is their purpose in that space other than to continue to extract and burn coal?” Bragg says those groups have a role to play in the implementation of the rules set by nations but no legitimate role to play in the setting of the rules themselves. The role many fossil fuel companies play in policy debates as the world attempts to curb carbon emissions has been clear: In a striking irony, the climate change COP at which these corporate interests will be welcome will happen at exactly the same time as another UN COP, where the exclusion of corporate interests has been hailed as a fundamental ingredient to its success: COP7 of the Framework Convention on Tobacco Control, starting today in Delhi, India. At that meeting, a report will be presented analysing the impact of the tobacco control treaty. It concludes the FCTC “has contributed to significant and rapid progress” in tobacco control action. Part of the FCTC – article 5.3 – says that “parties shall act to protect these policies from commercial and other vested interests of the tobacco industry in accordance with national law”. The treaty recognises that “there is a fundamental and irreconcilable conflict between the tobacco industry’s interests and public health policy interests.” It then goes on to recommend almost no contact with the tobacco industry, except when necessary to implement regulation of their products. “It’s pretty much the most important aspect of implementation,” says Mike Daube from Curtin University in Australia, of article 5.3. Daube was the deputy chairman of the committee that wrote the report on the impact of the tobacco control treaty. “It essentially says that governments should only speak with the tobacco industry when they absolutely have to and do so holding their nose and washing their hands afterwards,” Daube says. Despite the strong acknowledgement of corporate conflicts of interest in that UN treaty, rich countries have argued strongly against any measure to limit corporate involvement in the implementation of the Paris agreement. In May, the Like Minded Group of Developing Countries (LMDC) – a collection of more than 20 countries representing most of the world’s population – pushed for an report to be prepared examining how “the United Nations system and other intergovernmental forums … identify and minimise the risk of conflicts of interest”. Far from a radical call for governments to distance themselves from the fossil fuel lobby, it merely asked for a report on how conflicts of interest have been dealt with in other forums. But that request was deleted from the final report from the meeting and a “technical glitch” meant an objection raised by Ecuador on behalf of the majority of the world’s population was ignored. The Venezuelan delegation spoke strongly about the issue: The convention and the Paris agreement is an instrument between states. And the inclusion of non-state actors must go through a revision of conflict of interest. This is a standard request, a legal request and a moral request. It is unacceptable for our delegation that the concept of conflict of interest was not even considered as the fundamental basis for the ethical integrity and the effective implementation of the Paris agreement … It is a concern for the majority of the world represented here at this conference and the discussions in the contact room. We are astonished that this issue was completely overturned in the conclusions. But the EU, Australia and the US rose to speak against any exclusion of fossil fuel lobbyists. The Australian delegation framed the issue as one where developing countries were trying to make the process less “open”, despite supporting measures in the tobacco control treaty to lock out the tobacco industry: Parties are merely the custodians of this issue. Australia cannot and will not support an approach under the UNFCCC that will lead to us trying to block people from having access to what we do here. We operate under the basis … of openness and inclusiveness and transparency. Australia also argued the concept of “conflict of interest” itself was too hard to define, despite the issue being grappled with in many other forums: There is no clear understanding of what a conflict of interest is and it means different things to different people. The US delegation also framed the issue as one where they were trying to be as inclusive as possible. “We oppose constraining NGO participation in the UNFCCC process,” the US delegation said. Besides having access to meetings as observers, with no conflict of interest screening, the unprecedented level of corporate influence on the implementation of the Paris agreement was formalised in the global climate action agenda, through which corporations who make carbon-cutting pledges get high-level access to the meetings, can organise side events in the “civil society village”, promote their products in a “gallery” and sponsor the conference. Kingsley Faulkner is the deputy president of the Australian Council of Smoking and Health as well as the national chair of Doctors for the Environment Australia. Faulkner says the exclusion of the smoking lobby from tobacco control forums was essential and that there are clear parallels to the fossil fuel lobby. “Bodies that make these decisions should be looking very seriously at who they allow into the policy-making groups and see in whose interests they are talking,” Faulkner says. “And if you do that, of course, you clamp down on the fossil fuel lobby. “There are a number of real examples where industries have huge influence on public policy, to the detriment of the health of the community. “If politicians are serious about saying their first priority is the security and the wellbeing of the community then they’re going about it in a bad way if they allow the fossil fuel lobby to put that at risk.”"
"En mi natal Colombia, los nublados bosques de la Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta han sido descritos como el almacén de la concentración más importante de fauna del planeta en peligro de extinción. Estos bosques son también la tierra ancestral de los Koguis, una comunidad indígena que comprende hoy alrededor de 10,000 personas. En su cosmología, los Koguis se describen como los “hermanos mayores” de la humanidad, que habitan en el corazón del mundo, mientras los que habitan fuera de su comunidad son los “hermanos menores”, que fueron expulsados por la forma en que abusaron de la tierra en el pasado – una descripción acertada para un planeta en donde cada día 65,000 hectáreas de bosque tropical son destruídas o dañadas.   Durante siglos, los Koguis se han esforzado por cuidar de sus tierras para preservarlas para las generaciones futuras. Si les prestamos atención a ellos y a otros pueblos indígenas, si respetamos sus derechos y honramos sus tradiciones, creo que nosotros los “hermanos menores” aún tendremos oportunidad de acertar.  Durante la semana presente y la anterior, en la conferencia COP 22 en Marrakech sobre el cambio climático, los gobiernos están presentando sus planes para cumplir sus metas de reducción de emisiones – incluyendo el cambio a energía y transporte con menos emisiones de carbono. Pero es imperativo que estos planes también incluyan las zonas escasamente pobladas que constituyen el hogar de los pueblos indígenas. En Latinoamérica, por ejemplo, hay alrededor de 40 millones de personas indígenas. En conjunto, las tierras que son propiedad de indígenas y comunidades representan alrededor del 23% de la masa terrestre total de la región. Este es un territorio inmenso, aproximadamente el equivalente a la suma de las superficies de India, Paquistán y Afganistán. Gran parte de estas tierras aún se encuentran cubiertas de bosques y praderas cuya preservación es una manera comprobada y costo-efectiva de reducir las emisiones. En mi experiencia, no existe mejor manera de asegurar la cuidadosa administración de estos bienes – ya sea en la cuenca del Amazonas, las tierras altas de los Andes o las junglas de Centroamérica – que concederle a las comunidades indígenas completo control sobre sus tierras. Los indígenas tienen un conocimiento enciclopédico sobre los paisajes en los que habitan. También tienen el incentivo más fuerte posible para asegurar la sostenibilidad de esos ecosistemas. El Instituto de Recursos Mundiales (World Resources Institute) condujo un estudio sobre 80 zonas boscosas en 10 países en el sur de Asia, África del este, y Latinoamérica, el cual concluyó que los bosques administrados por las comunidades propietarias resultaron en un mayor almacenamiento de carbono, en comparación con situaciones en que las comunidades cuentan con nulos o escasos derechos legales, cuyos bosques resultan ser más vulnerables a la deforestación. De hecho, la evidencia sugiere que el fortalecimiento de los derechos forestales de los indígenas está asociado tanto con mejores comunidades como con bosques más saludables. Anteriormente, los gobiernos y legisladores tendían a despreciar el valor del vínculo entre la mitigación del cambio climático y los derechos de la tierra de los indígenas. Pero el Acuerdo de París reconoció esto explícitamente, y algunos gobiernos – incluyendo Bolivia y Guatemala – incorporaron explícitamente tales consideraciones en sus Contribuciones Nacionalmente Determinadas Previstas (NDCs, por sus siglas en inglés). Por supuesto, los derechos de la tierra no son la panacea. Incluso cuando tienen el control, las comunidades requieren de apoyo al decidir cómo utilizar, de la manera más efectiva posible, los recursos locales, cómo procurar un medio de subsistencia decente a los suyos, y cómo lidiar con actividades ilegales como la minería y cacería clandestina. Las naciones donadoras y bancos de desarrollo deben también ayudar a fortalecer a las instituciones responsables de la tenencia de la tierra y expandir las opciones de financiamiento climático para inversiones que promuevan paisajes sostenibles. En el Banco Interamericano de Desarrollo estamos viendo un gran incremento del interés por parte de los países en priorizar los programas de infraestructura y uso de tierras que contribuyan a sus NDCs. Por lo tanto, estamos lanzando una nueva iniciativa, NDC Invest, para ofrecer diversos tipos de apoyo a los países. Hoy por hoy, espero que nuestro mayor conocimiento del impacto potencial de la administración indígena de la tierra lleve a una inclusión ambiciosa de estas comunidades en los debates nacionales y globales sobre mitigación y adaptación climática.

"The Paris agreement on climate change risks failure unless countries come forward with more ambitious and detailed plans to cut greenhouse gas emissions, the world’s energy watchdog has warned. The agreement, reached almost a year ago, is only a “framework”, said the International Energy Agency on Wednesday, and requires sweeping policy changes among governments around the world to put its aims into force.  “Government policies will determine where we go from here,” said Fatih Birol, the executive director of the agency. Current national pledges on greenhouse gas emissions, though “an achievement”, are inadequate and most governments have yet to indicate what further reductions they could make. Governments are meeting this week in Marrakech to flesh out some of the legal and technical details of the Paris accord. But their talks have been overshadowed by the election of Donald Trump as US president because he has vowed repeatedly to cancel the agreement, or at least the US’s participation in it. This risks returning the world to the stalemate that characterised the decade of climate talks from the 1997 Kyoto protocol to the 2008 accession of Barack Obama, during which the US barely took part in the negotiations or, in some cases, actively obstructed them. It's a climate change accord agreed by nearly 200 countries in December 2015, which came into force on 4 November 2016. The agreement commits world leaders to keeping global warming below 2C, seen as the threshold for safety by scientists, and pursuing a tougher target of 1.5C. The carbon emission curbs put forward by countries under Paris are not legally-binding but the framework of the accord, which includes a mechanism for periodically cranking those pledges up, is binding. The agreement also has a long-term goal for net zero emissions which would effectively phase out fossil fuels.   Birol urged caution: “Governments come and go around the world. This is a perfectly normal thing, and energy policies change with changes in administration. We may well see a change in US policy and, given the size of the US economy, these changes may have global implications. If there are such changes, we will include them in our analysis. But for now, it would be premature to speculate on what these policies might be.” Under the Paris agreement, which came into force this month, nations have pledged to hold global warming to no more than 2C above pre-industrial levels, with an “aspiration” not to exceed 1.5C. However, the accompanying national pledges made by each government on curbs to their emissions are not legally binding. Although those national pledges are likely to be met, according to the IEA’s World Energy Outlook, widely regarded as the gold standard on energy research, this will only slow down the projected rise in carbon emissions from energy from an annual average of about 650m tonnes a year since 2000 to about 150m tonnes in 2040. While a significant change, that would still leave the world exceeding the 2C goal by about 0.7C by the end of the century. Policies to bring the world on to a 2C trajectory must be implemented as a matter of urgency if the Paris pledge is to be fulfilled, the IEA said, as emissions must peak in the next few years to avoid adding too much to the stock of carbon in the atmosphere. Once carbon dioxide is in the atmosphere, it tends to stay there for at least a century, unless absorbed by the planet’s “carbon sinks”, such as forests and oceans. However, our emissions have long outstripped the ability of the world’s carbon sinks to absorb them. It is the carbon in the atmosphere that determines what happens to climate change, and as yet there is no viable technology – and no realistic prospect of it – to suck carbon from the air. These physical realities make early action on reducing emissions vital, because actions taken later will be less effective. The IEA highlighted the growing role of renewable energy, predicting that nearly 60% of all new power generation capacity by 2040 would be from renewable sources. The pace of growth has outstripped previous forecasts, as costs have come down faster than expected and governments have shifted policies. China’s reliance on coal – it is the largest consumer and producer – peaked in 2013, according to the data, and its falling coal consumption and increasing renewable generation capacity will “transform the global outlook”. Even as more of global generation comes from renewable sources, demand will rise by about 30% by 2040, according to the projections, with all of the increase coming from developing countries. But even as they develop, hundreds of millions of their populations will be left behind.  More than half a billion people are forecast to still be without electricity in 2040. While this is less than half of current levels, it represents a failure to meet global pledges to rescue the poorest from their lack of access to modern energy, which results in millions of deaths from indoor air pollution as they use other sources of fuel, and limits development and education. Separately, in the UK, ministers were warned that without urgent action during the current parliament, the UK would fail to meet its emissions targets, and investor confidence in the energy sector would plunge. The UK Energy Research Centre (UKERC) urged the chancellor, Philip Hammond, to include commitments on reforming energy policy in his autumn statement next week. In a review of the UK’s energy policy, published on Wednesday, leading academics called for a clearer focus on energy in the government’s forthcoming industrial strategy, as well as new strategies on heat and energy efficiency, progress on which has been stalled by the scrapping of the “green deal” on home improvements. They also called for “a new approach” to carbon capture and storage, in response to a recent report by Lord Oxburgh, which criticised the abandonment of taxpayer support for the fledgling technology. Jim Watson, UKERC’s director, said: “There are problems with the government’s approach [to energy]. The cheaper options for renewable energy [in the form of onshore wind and solar, support for which has been slashed] have been taken off the agenda. And Hinkley Point [nuclear power station] is likely to be very expensive.” He also pointed to energy efficiency as a problem area, as “retrofitting buildings has really slowed down because of the policy environment”. The UK could still meet its carbon targets, he concluded, but it would require action now, because current policies were inadequate and the progress on emissions reductions made in the past few years had been the result of policy decisions taken well over a decade ago."
"The last coal power station in Britain will be forced to close in 2025, the government said as it laid out its plan to phase-out the polluting fossil fuel. Ministers promised last year that the UK would close coal power within a decade and replace it with gas and other sources to meet its climate change commitments. But in a delayed consultation on the phase-out, published on Wednesday, officials admitted that the last coal power station was likely to shutter in 2022 even without government intervention, prompting calls from campaigners to bring forward the cut-off year. Greg Clark, the energy secretary, said the move sent a clear signal to the world that the UK was a good place to invest in clean energy. “Taking unabated coal power out of our energy mix and replacing it with cleaner technology, such as gas, will significantly reduce emissions from the UK’s energy use,” he said. The government also confirmed renewable energy would receive £730m in support this parliament, and that bids for £290m of support annually would be opened from next April. Most of that is likely to be taken by offshore windfarm developers, which will receive at least £105 per megawatt hour of electricity generated if built in 2021, considerably lower than the £135 for ones deployed in 2018. While admitting that recent history has shown coal power plants can close at short notice, the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy said its analysis suggested taking action on coal posed no risks to electricity supplies. The department is consulting on two options for effectively forcing the UK’s last eight coal power stations to close by 2025 at the very latest. Both involve changes to the Emissions Power Standard, which sets a limit on new coal power plants’ annual carbon emissions based on their capacity, and which the UK’s ageing fleet would be unable to meet. Officials expect that because air pollution and climate change measures are making coal uneconomic, the most likely scenario is that all coal power plants will close by 2022. But they also said that if the price of coal was low it was conceivable they would not close until 2030. They said this uncertainty showed the need for intervention.  Ben Caldecott, associate fellow of the thinktank Bright Blue, called for the end date to be brought forward. “There are significant benefits of phasing coal out sooner, rather than later. We believe that the 2025 target should be brought forward by at least two years to give investors greater certainty to invest, which will improve security of supply.” Most green groups and climate change commentators welcomed the move and commended the government. WWF said ministers should strongly resist any attempts to water down the phase-out. Friends of the Earth applauded the government and said it should now block a proposed opencast coal mine in Northumberland, given the UK was no longer planning to burn the fuel. Christiana Figueres, the former UN climate chief, said: “Congratulations to UK government for the consultation on coal phase-out. Coal needs to take its rightful place in history of yesterday. Coal workers need to be given a fresh chance at the jobs of tomorrow.” The government acknowledges the potential human cost of coal power stations shuttering, saying plant closures could have a “significant impact on communities” as they employed around 100-500 people directly. The only way the coal plants could stay open would be if they fitted technology to capture and store the carbon emissions, though officials said that was “considered unlikely”. The other option is that they convert to burning another fuel, such as biomass, a process which is complete at two of the six units at Drax, the UK’s biggest power station, and is nearly finished on a third. “We recognise coal is a fuel of the past and using the latest technology we have already upgraded half the power station to run on sustainable biomass,” said a spokesman for Drax, which welcomed the consultation. “The majority of electricity we now produce is renewable, providing UK homes and businesses with low carbon, affordable and reliable power.” Electricity generation from the UK’s coal plants has already declined steeply, and is expected to have fallen 66% by the year’s end, compared to 2015. There are no coal plants left in Scotland after the last one, at Longannet, closed in the spring. Gas has taken up most of the slack this year, and is expected to replace most of the capacity provided as coal plants close in coming years. Michael Grubb, professor of International Energy and Climate Change Policy at UCL, said: “Outlining how and when coal plants will cease to operate will pave the way for new investment, including gas. Coal is already struggling economically and removing coal clarifies the market space for gas during the 2020s.” ClientEarth, an environmental NGO that successfully won a legal case against the government on air pollution plans, cautioned that while a coal phase-out was welcome, the UK should focus on clean energy to replace it, rather than gas.  “The UK government must make sure it isn’t problem-shifting. Putting a sell-by date on coal is logical, but the UK must be bolder and the deadline should be sooner,” said Susan Shaw, a lawyer at the organisation."
"The company responsible for Australia’s biggest CBD solar installation has invited public investment, making it the first community renewables project in Australia with a public share offering. Sydney Renewable Power Company’s 520kW solar installation on top of the new International Convention Centre in Darling Harbour is the size of 12 tennis courts and will generate enough electricity to power about 100 homes each year.  Andy Cavanagh-Downs, the founding director of the project – which was set up and is run by a volunteer board – said he believed it was the first volunteer-run, for-profit company in Australia. Cavanagh-Downs said the company’s founders wanted to find a way to involve the public directly in transitioning the economy away from fossil fuels. “We’re clearly going to undergo a change as we move from a high-carbon to a low-carbon economy,” Cavanagh-Downs said. “Change can be awkward to deal with and the more you involve people in that process, the more that they’re part of it, the quicker and easier that change can come about. “The other bit that we thought was attractive was – not everyone can put solar on their roofs.  “This is a really good way for renters and apartment-dwellers to invest in solar.” The group will sell 519 shares in the unlisted public company, raising almost $1.5m to repay the loan that was used to finance the project. Most of the company’s revenue comes from an agreement with the managers of the International Convention Centre, who will buy all the electricity produced by the installation. The company will also sell the renewable energy certificates it gets through the federal renewable energy target. Each share, which costs $2,750, is roughly equivalent to owning 1kw of capacity and the company is expecting to make investors a return by paying dividends of at least $35,000 after the first seven months of operation, amounting to about $105 per share after the first year. That figure should increase each year, since the power purchase agreement includes a price increase of 3% each year. In addition, the company will divide up its capital each year, distributing it to investors, since it aims to wind up after 25 years. The project faces risks from a range of factors, including the potential of reduced solar output from bad weather or new buildings nearby creating shade.  Cavanagh-Downs said the company had no immediate plans to raise capital for any further projects but the board was keen to share its experience with others who were interested in creating similar projects."
"The average westerner’s carbon emissions destroy 30 square metres of Arctic sea ice every year, according to new research.  The work indicates that, even with current efforts to cut emissions, the Arctic will lose all its ice in summer within about 20 years. Plummeting Arctic sea ice cover is one of the most obvious signs of climate change and is increasingly linked to extreme weather events such as storms and floods in Europe and severe cold snaps in the US. The new study revealed a linear link between emissions of CO2 and the loss of Arctic sea ice, which has shrunk by half in the last 40 years. The link enables people to understand their own contribution to climate change, according to the leader of the work, Prof Dirk Notz, at the Max-Planck-Institute for Meteorology in Hamburg, Germany.  “It allows us, for the first time really, to intuitively grasp how we all individually contribute to global warming,” he said. “The observed numbers are very simple. For each tonne of CO2 that a person emits anywhere on this planet, three square metres of Arctic summer sea ice disappears.” “So far the global warming debate has always been about very large numbers like billions of tonnes of CO2 or very small numbers like 0.1C of temperature change,” he said. “Our study allows us to understand that it is really our own individual actions, every day, that contribute to ongoing global warming.” The research, published in the journal Science, analysed the declining extent of Arctic sea ice from 1953 to 2015 and found it tracked the emissions of CO2 from fossil fuel burning and other human activities. The relationship fits well with the underlying physics. As a result, it is possible to calculate how much Arctic sea ice is lost as a result of an individual’s emissions. The average annual emissions of a citizen of the 35 rich nations in the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) is 10 tonnes per year, leading to 30 sq m of ice being lost. Citizens of the US, Canada and Australia have a higher carbon footprint - about 16 tonnes - each causing almost 50 sq m of ice loss per year. In the UK, the average emissions are 7.5 tonnes per year, meaning 22.5 sq m of ice loss. Prof Len Shaffrey, at the University of Reading in the UK, said the new research was sound and showed a new way of linking Arctic sea ice loss and personal CO2 emissions: “It means on average we are [each] responsible for the loss of tens of square metres of summer Arctic sea ice. That’s a pretty sobering thought.” The link also allows the calculation of how much CO2 can be emitted in future before the Arctic is entirely ice-free in September, usually the month of the smallest extent. The scientists found 1,000 gigatonnes (GT) of CO2 was the limit. If all the carbon-cutting pledges currently made by the world’s nations are implemented, the Arctic will be ice free in summer in about 22 years, according to the new research. “There is not a god-given year when the ice will be gone but there is this number of 1,000GT - once we have emitted that amount, the [summer] Arctic sea ice will be gone,” Notz said. “If emissions don’t change at all from today’s level, which is extremely unlikely, then the ice will be gone in 25 years. If emissions continue to rise then the ice will be gone sooner than that.” The 1,000GT carbon budget is also the limit for keeping climate change below the internationally agreed threshold of 2C. This means that even if the Paris climate treaty, which enters into force on Friday, is successful, the Arctic will still become ice-free in summer.  However, the Paris treaty also includes an aspiration to limit the temperature rise to 1.5C, which would require radical cuts in CO2 emissions, including sucking the gas out of the air and burying it. If this was achieved, the Arctic ice cap would remain year round. Arctic sea ice fell to its second lowest recorded extent in September, and scientists say this matters for a number of reasons. “By losing Arctic sea ice, we are losing a very effective refrigerator, as sea ice today reflects most of the sunlight and keeps the Arctic cool,’ said Notz. “If we lose this refrigerator, the Greenland ice cap will melt much more rapidly, for example, and drive up sea levels.” Other scientists are increasingly linking the loss of Arctic sea ice to a weakening of a high level wind, called the jet stream, which is in turn linked to increasing extreme weather events, such as storms and floods in western Europe, severe cold snaps in the US and drought in California. “The jury is still out on how robust these studies are but there is mounting evidence,” said Notz. “Also, we are destroying a landscape from this planet which is extremely beautiful and future generations would have nothing to look at but open water in September, so for me that is an ethical thing,” he said."
"Millions of pounds of climate change aid to Bangladesh has been returned unspent to the British government following a long-running dispute over its delivery. Academics and climate change experts claim the return of £13m to the Department for International Development (DfID) over the past year, through the World Bank, represents a failure by the UK to recognise Bangladesh – one of the world’s most climate-vulnerable countries – as an expert on the issue. News of the unspent cash comes as the world gathers in Morocco for the first climate change talks under the Paris agreement. The money was part of a £75m pledge made to Bangladesh by Britain in 2008 to provide developing countries with climate finance. DfID decided that, rather than giving the money directly to the government, it should be channelled through the World Bank as part of the multi-donor Bangladesh Climate Change Resilience Fund established in May 2010. The Bangladeshi government opposed the move, initially refusing to accept the donation amid concerns that the World Bank would attach unfavourable “strings and conditions”, and there were protests in Dhaka about the bank’s involvement. However, donations to the fund were later accepted. Joseph Hanlon, a visiting fellow in international development at the London School of Economics, said the unspent money was indicative of a failure by donors to trust Bangladeshis, who are “ahead of the curve” in climate change mitigation. He accused DfID and other donors of wanting to portray Bangaldeshis as “victims”, and of insisting they know better. “Bangladesh has long had a struggle with the World Bank,” said Hanlon. “But Bangladeshis are very experienced. The level of expertise in terms of engineers and scientists is spectacular. They have been pushing against climate change for 20 years. They have led developing countries in negotiations on climate change. Yet the USA, DfID, and the other donors kept saying, ‘We know better than you.’” As co-author of the forthcoming book Bangladesh Confronts Climate Change, Hanlon has charted how scientists, politicians and communities in the country have tackled the issue through measures such as raising the land to match sea level rise, and bringing down cyclone deaths. “Bangladesh is poor and vulnerable and needs this money,” he said.  Saleemul Huq, director of the International Centre for Climate Change and Development in Dhaka, said it was a mistake for donors, including DfID, to set up a fund through the World Bank. Huq said: “The bank didn’t work with the Bangladeshi government, they did their own thing. There were demonstrations in the streets about why the World Bank should take that money from a developing country to manage the scheme.” The Bangladeshi government operates its own climate fund, the Bangladesh Climate Change Trust fund (BCCTF). “It was a mistake for donors to set up a separate fund,” said Huq. “It’s like saying we don’t trust you and we’re not giving you the money – that’s a bad message from the beginning. What they should have done is said, ‘We are giving it to the government trust fund but with strings attached – it has to be monitored and evaluated.’” Huq said differences of opinion existed between the banks and the government over which projects to fund. Last year, DfID’s annual review (odf) of the Bangladesh climate programme in Bangladesh highlighted “ongoing challenges” and tensions within BCCRF. The upshot was a decision by the World Bank and contributing donors to close the fund in June 2017. The BCCRF started with a pledged $125m (£101m), according to the World Bank. At one point, this had increased to $188m.  DfID’s report said: “The lack of understanding between donors and the World Bank on the operations of the bank’s trust fund model led to much of the tension between donors and the bank over the slow delivery of BCCRF.”  A lack of commitment by the government of Bangladesh had also hampered delivery of the fund, according to the report, which went on to speculate that “this might be explained in part by competition from the nationally owned BCCTF”. DfID’s review, which highlighted corruption and fraud as a “high risk” in the country, also made the point that the fund was at risk due to political instability in Bangladesh the previous year. A DfID spokesman said: “No UK funds have been lost in the closure of the Bangladesh Climate Change Resilience Fund and DfID’s investment in protecting Bangladesh from climate change has not been affected. Projects started under the fund are protecting some of the poorest and most vulnerable people from weather shocks and will continue until their planned end date.  “The UK remains fully committed to helping the people of Bangladesh build their resilience to the devastating floods and cyclones which hit the country, helping to save lives, homes and schools over the coming decades.” A spokesman for the Bangladeshi high commission in London suggested relations between the World Bank and the government had soured after the bank pulled out of a £764m project to build Bangladesh’s largest bridge, the Padma Bridge project, citing corruption concerns. He said: “There were issues over the World Bank over accusations they were making. There are a few issues that the prime minister is very strict about – like there should not be strings attached [to aid]. The PM feels very strongly that we will only take deals that will help. We are becoming stronger in our dealing with the international community.” In a statement, the World Bank confirmed the BCCRF had been closed down after a joint decision by donors and the bank. “[The unspent money] could not be spent on activities by a December 2016 deadline,” said the statement. “This money was refunded back to the donors because they wanted to use it for other purposes and asked for refunds. The refund process for all donors is almost complete. “The government of Bangladesh chaired the management committee running BCCRF and decisions on projects were made by this committee and not the donors alone. The fund was approving projects that passed certain basic criteria/standards and approved by the government of Bangladesh. Projects that were not considered well-designed by the management committee did not get approved.  “Following a review of BCCRF, the donors and the bank jointly decided not to extend the trusteeship, and communicated the desire for strategic planning for a pipeline of climate financed projects.” "
"Tony Abbott says the “moral panic” about climate change has been completely over the top and that he never thought it was the most serious issue faced by Australia. He said the election of Donald Trump as president of the United States was encouraging because the Republican – who has said that he believes global warming is a scam – would put climate change in better perspective.  In a wide-ranging interview with conservative host Andrew Bolt on Sky News on Wednesday, Abbott spoke at length on section 18C of the Racial Discrimination Act, Trump’s election, his own treatment by the media when prime minister, and Malcolm Turnbull’s leadership. He said Turnbull was finally growing into the role of prime minister, and Turnbull’s complaint about the “elite” media this week was a sign of that. “He appreciates that it’s one thing to appeal to a certain constituency when you are the would-be, but when you are the Man your constituency is first and foremost the party room, and secondly the people who are going to vote for the Coalition, or who you want to vote for the Coalition at the next election,” Abbott said. When asked why Turnbull had ratified that Paris Agreement on climate change when he knew that Trump wants to pull out of the agreement, Abbott said it was a sensible thing to do. He said his own government had been prepared to commit to a 26%-28% reduction in emissions because he believed Australia could achieve that without hurting the economy. He also said Turnbull’s position on renewable energy was much better than Labor’s. “Sometimes politics is the lesser evils,” he said. “There are many circumstances in which you have to choose the least bad option.” When asked if he agreed with Trump’s assertion that global warming was a scam, Abbott said he never thought that was the most serious moral, political and economic issue that we face. “Yes it is an issue, but the moral panic about this has been completely over the top,” he said.  “One of the encouraging things about the election of Trump is that we should finally be able to see this issue in better perspective.  “It is significant, we should take reasonable steps to limit our emissions, but the last thing we should do is impose socialism in the name of misguided environmentalism, and that has been the risk for a very long time.”"
"Coal-fired power stations in Australia will need to shut at the rate of about one a year between now and the mid-2030s for the country to meet the commitments made in Paris, a Senate hearing has been told. Witnesses also told the hearing that since Australia’s coal-fired power stations are now very old – mostly built in the 1970s and 80s – they would be shutting in the coming decades regardless of climate policy, further highlighting the need for a transition plan.  Olivia Kember from the Climate Institute said: “For emissions reductions consistent with the 2C goal, Australia’s existing coal stations essentially needed to have closed by the early 2030s and what that works out to is roughly the rate of the equivalent of a Hazelwood a year.” “The 2035 deadline is interesting because it keeps coming up in a whole lot of independent studies,” she told the Greens-Labor inquiry. Erwin Jackson, also from the Climate Institute, told the hearing that many power stations had already said they would be shutting. “We are going to see closures quite soon. Liddell is going to shut down in New South Wales, which is a 2000MW station, in the early 2020s, and Bayswater in 2025 – AGL have already put it on the record.” He continued: “To have a sensible conversation about how we do the transition, we need an agreement from both sides of politics that we have to have the transition. And we currently don’t have that.” Jackson said the lack of a transition plan was making the transition more expensive regardless of what outcome was pursued. “Regardless whether you’re building a renewable plant, or you want to upgrade a thermal generator, the lack of policy predictability going forward is hampering investment. If we do get an investment it’s going to be more expensive than it would have been otherwise because investors will need to factor in a high level of risk. “This again points to the need to having a sensible national policy where investors can think about how they’re going to manage the transition over the long term.” James Paterson, a Liberal senator, asked the witnesses how the closure of coal power stations would affect electricity prices. The closure of Hazelwood last week was thought to have raised prices in Victoria by between 4% and 8%. Jackson said since the coal power plants were old and going to close anyway, price rises were inevitable. “Electricity prices are going to have to go up anyway. Because if you are shutting down plants – and they will shut at some point – then the replacement plants are more expensive than the current plants we’re operating at the moment.” Paterson said: “Is another option other than just closing these power plants, replacing them with other more efficient coal-fired power plants?” Frank Jotzo from the Australian National University responded: “In the short term, as a thought experiment, if you replaced the La Trobe generators with ultra supercritical [efficient coal power stations], you’d make something like a saving of 50% in emissions in rough terms. But of course you’re locking in that investment for a long time and that’s fundamentally incompatible even with the existing Australian national 2030 emissions target. He continued: “Stepping back from environmental policy objectives, the current levelised cost of electricity – in terms of new build – of renewables and coal, are just about on par … The capital costs of coal power stations are essentially not changing over time whereas the renewables cost is falling.” “I would judge it highly unlikely you would see commercial investment in coal-fired power in Australia.” The hearing comes after a series of reports urged the government to plan for the inevitable closure of coal power stations. On Monday 17 prominent Australians, spearheaded by the Australian Conservation Foundation, presented the energy minister, Josh Frydenberg, with a “clean energy blueprint”. It urged the Turnbull government to extend and expand the national renewable energy target and create a market mechanism to govern an orderly phase-out of coal-fired power in Australia. That blueprint also called for a just transition. On Tuesday the Australian Council of Trade Unions released a report calling for a plan for a plan that ensured that the costs didn’t fall on the shoulders of workers and communities that rely on the coal-fired power industry. All this comes before the government’s review of its Direct Action policy in 2017, as well as a review of the national energy market led by Australia’s chief scientist, Alan Finkel. The Finkel review followed a political battle between the Turnbull government and state governments, with Malcolm Turnbull launching a rhetorical assault on state-based renewable energy targets after a statewide power blackout in South Australia in September."
"As news of Donald Trump’s victory reached Marrakech on Wednesday, the many thousands of diplomats, activists, youth and business groups gathered in the city for the UN’s annual climate conference were left in shock and disbelief that the US could elect a climate-change denier as president. Some of the younger activists were in tears. “My heart is absolutely broken at the election of Trump,” said Becky Chung, a delegate for youth advocacy group SustainUS from California.  “We will see a rising-up of people’s movements committed to mass civil disobedience to keep fossil fuels in the ground. The next four years will be critical. We have to get to zero emissions by 2050,” she said. The delegates from nearly 200 countries, many of whom had spent 20 years negotiating the complex Paris agreement that aims to limit global warming to a 1.5°C rise, were tightlipped but clearly nervous. The US delegation went into a huddle, meetings were cancelled and talk centred on whether Trump would fulfil his often-repeated threat to withdraw the US from the UN’s Paris agreement – blitzing decades of fraught but ultimately successful global negotiations. “No one thought this could happen. Everyone here is in shock,” said Bangladeshi scientist and diplomat Saleemul Huq. “No one had anticipated this result and, hence, there was no plan B. We will have to think about what happens next.” Morocco’s minister of foreign affairs, Salaheddine Mezouar, the meeting’s president, put on a brave face. “We are convinced that all parties will respect their commitments and stay the course in this collective effort,” he said. But few people agreed with him because Trump has consistently denied 40 years of climate science – and he claims that manmade global warming is a Chinese hoax. Ditching the Paris treaty, he has said, is his number one environmental priority. Withdrawal from the treaty, which was crafted over years by US diplomats, often against developing countries’ wills, would take four years to complete and would outrage world opinion. Many delegates in Marrakech privately think it more likely that a new US administration would choose to ignore it. Because the Paris treaty is voluntary, the US would face global opprobrium, but no sanctions or fines. Instead of reducing US emissions by a quarter to 28% below 2005 levels by 2025, as the US has pledged, Trump would support US coal, gas and fracking and halt payments aimed to help developing countries adapt to rising sea levels and temperatures. The result would be to increase US emissions, set back attempts to hold temperatures to a 2°C rise by years and, say businesses and activists, put a brake on the world’s renewable energy industries and consign poor countries to deeper poverty. The UN, privately rattled but publicly calm in Marrakech, fervently hopes that the reality of power, diplomatic pressure and business self-interest will keep Trump in the fold. At stake, say officials, is not just the treaty but the whole UN system, which is based on consensus between countries. Erik Solheim, head of the UN environment programme, told the Observer that Trump’s pragmatism and business sense was likely to score over ideology. “It’s clear there is uncertainty because of some of the statements made before the election. But I am certain we have crossed the Rubicon. There is no way back on climate change,” he said. Should the US leave the treaty, Solheim says that some of the biggest losers would be America’s working people. “They would lose out on all the new green jobs. It would be a huge lost opportunity for the US people. The thinking that climate is a cost is wrong. It is a business opportunity,” he said. Other diplomats and politicians claim that the US would lose important allies if it chose to become the world’s only climate rogue nation. “Trump has to acknowledge the reality of climate change. He has a responsibility as president-elect now,” said Alden Meyer, director of strategy at the Union of Concerned Scientists. The deep fear in Marrakech is that US opposition to the Paris agreement would signal to other countries that they need not meet their voluntary pledges, with the result that global emissions would soar and climate change could become unstoppable. Withdrawal would also undermine relations with China. “Climate co-operation between the US and China will need a new strategy with new priorities and highlights,” said Zou Ji, deputy director general of China’s national centre for climate change strategy. Developing countries were particularly nervous last week because Trump has also vowed to stop contributions to the Green Climate Fund, set up by the UN to distribute an eventual $100bn a year to help them reduce emissions and adapt their infrastructure to climate change. The US, which is expected to be the biggest contributor to the fund, has pledged $4bn over four years. Greenpeace international co-directors Jennifer Morgan and Bunny McDiarmid said: “We will not give up. We will work even harder and invite people to join this powerful movement. The stakes for current and future generations are too high and time is too short.” As the Marrakech meeting prepared to enter its second week, with the arrival of ministers from 200 countries, Jean Su of the US Center for Biological Diversity sought to quell fears: “I do believe that climate progress will not crash and burn because of one single man who was elected yesterday …. One single man cannot ruin a whole 20 years of progress on climate change.” Michael Brune, director of the Sierra Club, the US’s largest environment group, was adamant. “It would be very difficult for Trump to remove the US from the Paris agreement. If he tries to ... he will run headlong into an organised mass of people who will fight him in the courts, in the marketplace, and in the streets.”"
"Climate taxes on meat and milk would lead to huge and vital cuts in carbon emissions as well as saving half a million lives a year via healthier diets, according to the first global analysis of the issue. Surcharges of 40% on beef and 20% on milk would account for the damage their production causes people via climate change, an Oxford University team has calculated. These taxes would then deter people from consuming as much of these foods, reducing both emissions and illness, the team said. Food production causes a quarter of all the greenhouse gas emissions that are driving global warming, largely from the raising of cattle and other livestock. These emissions are increasing as people around the world become richer and eat more meat. Marco Springmann, from the Oxford Martin Programme on the Future of Food, who led the study, said: “It is clear that if we don’t do something about the emissions from our food system, we have no chance of limiting climate change below 2C. “But if you’d have to pay 40% more for your steak, you might choose to have it once a week instead of twice.” The research, published in the journal Nature Climate Change, evaluated the tax required for each food type to compensate for the climate damage its production causes. Beef has a heavy footprint, due to the deforestation and methane emissions associated with cattle and the grains they are fed, and needed a 40% tax on average across the world. The scientists then assessed how much less of each food type would be eaten as a result of the taxes. They examined different tax regimes and found the optimum arrangement in terms of both emissions and health was to combine the taxes with subsidies for healthy foods, such as fruit and vegetables, and payments to people to compensate for price increases. This ensured poorer people did not end up with worse diets as the result of taxation. This optimum tax plan would reduce climate emissions by 1 billion tonnes a year – the same as the entire global aviation industry. This huge potential cut in emissions surprised Springmann, as did the heavy impact of dairy products. Changes to how food is produced and consumed have largely been ignored in the battle against climate change, due to public sensitivity about their food choices, fears about increasing hunger in poorer parts of the world and the lack of straightforward measures to tackle the problem. “If people see any food price rise, they get angry, so you have to explain why you are doing it,” said Springmann, adding that a successful food tax policy could spend all the money it raised on ensuring people could afford healthier diets. He said a tax in Denmark on unhealthy saturated fats, where the government simply kept all the revenue, was aborted after a year. But in Mexico, a sugar tax on soft drinks has been successful after the funds were spent on free drinking water in schools. Most of the foods with big climate impacts also happen to be unhealthy when eaten in large quantities, such as beef and dairy. Therefore, if climate taxes cut consumption, fewer people would die from related diseases such as heart disease, strokes and cancers. In the US, for example, people eat three times the recommended level of meat. The researchers found climate taxes would save more than half a million early deaths every year, largely in Europe, the US, Australia and China. However, cutting the demand for meat and dairy would not be easy, said Rob Bailey, research director at UK thinktank Chatham House: “The challenge is political. As the new research demonstrates, in many countries there is a very strong public health and climate case for dietary change, but it isn’t happening. Governments are reluctant to ‘interfere’ in people’s lifestyle choices for fear of a public backlash and criticism for ‘nanny statism’, as well as the reaction from powerful interests in the food industry and agricultural lobby.” Bailey said there was currently little pressure on governments to act, partly because the public understanding of the link between diet and climate change is low. But, when people are informed, they find meat taxes far less unpalatable than is supposed, he said. Calls to cut meat-eating, by the UN and high-profile figures including climate change experts and the economist Lord Stern, have so far been both rare and controversial.  The new research found the taxes needed to compensate for climate damage were 15% on lamb, 8.5% on chicken, 7% on pork and 5% on eggs. Vegetable oil required a large tax of 25%, but this was due to the low initial price of the product, making a relatively modest surcharge look high. These tax levels were global averages but there was significant variation with, for example, the beef tax being higher in Latin America, where cattle-raising produces more emissions than in other regions. The optimum tax plan also had regional variations, including limiting climate taxes to beef in the lowest income countries, to ensure people there were still able to afford decent diets. Springmann said it was critical to find a way to cut the environmental impact of food production: “Either we have climate change and more heart disease, diabetes and obesity, or we do something about the food system.”"
"  A bicycle made out of bamboo grown in Cornwall, UK will be ridden the length of South America by an environmental activist and adventurer raising awareness about the loss of biodiversity.  The bicycle, which needs to be sturdy enough to carry Kate Rawles nearly 6,000 miles, is thought to be the first made from bamboo nurtured in the UK.  Rawles will set off from Costa Rica in Central America in December, following the spine of the Andes to Cape Horn at the tip of the continent.  The frame of the bike was made by Rawles, from Cumbria, at the London-based Bamboo Bicycle Club, from canes cut from a large clump of bamboo at the Eden Project in Cornwall.  “As far as we know this is the UK’s first home-grown bicycle,” Rawles said. “We’re delighted to have built it, and to be launching it on this mountainous environmental adventure.” Rawles’ journey – which she has titled The Life Cycle - is a follow-up to another adventure, The Carbon Cycle, in which she cycled from Texas to Alaska. The Life Cycle will focus on climate change. She says that although the world may not yet be doing enough about it, most people understood the urgent reality of climate change. But biodiversity loss, which she says is every bit as important, is less publicised and understood. “It’s a hugely important issue, with real impacts for people and other species too. And there is so much we could be doing to help arrest what’s been called the “sixth great extinction”.  Because the frame of the bike is made of bamboo rather than steel, it will have a lower carbon footprint. Efforts have been made to source other parts of the machine from the UK. Rawles will be crossing the Atlantic by cargo ship rather than plane. Mike Maunder, Eden’s director of life sciences, said: “We are very proud that our bamboo is being used for such an arduous adventure.  “Bamboo is an incredible resource for humanity - it protects millions of acres of watershed and as a sustainable crop provides building materials, food and fibre. At Eden we are working to replace polluting and wasteful single use water bottles with multi-use containers made from bamboo.” James Marr, of the Bamboo Bicycle Club, said “Kate is a seasoned cyclist but I don’t think people have really travelled by bike until they’ve built one themselves.”  "
"The commitments made by governments on climate change will lead to dangerous levels of global warming because they are incommensurate with the growth of greenhouse gas emissions, according to a new report.  The United Nations Environment Programme (Unep) said that pledges put forward to cut emissions would see temperatures rise by 3C above pre-industrial levels, far above the the 2C of the Paris climate agreement, which comes into force on Friday.  At least a quarter must be cut from emissions by the end of the next decade, compared with current trends, the UN said. The report found that emissions by 2030 were likely to reach about 54 to 56 gigatonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent a year, a long way astray of the 42 gigatonnes a year likely to be the level at which warming exceeds 2C. It's a climate change accord agreed by nearly 200 countries in December 2015, which came into force on 4 November 2016. The agreement commits world leaders to keeping global warming below 2C, seen as the threshold for safety by scientists, and pursuing a tougher target of 1.5C. The carbon emission curbs put forward by countries under Paris are not legally-binding but the framework of the accord, which includes a mechanism for periodically cranking those pledges up, is binding. The agreement also has a long-term goal for net zero emissions which would effectively phase out fossil fuels.   Erik Solheim, chief of Unep, said the world was “moving in the right direction” on reducing greenhouse gas emissions and tackling climate change, but that measures should be taken urgently to avoid the need for much more drastic cuts in emissions in future. “If we don’t start taking additional action now, we will grieve over the avoidable human tragedy.” He warned in particular that people would start being displaced from their homes by the effects of climate change, suffering from drought, hunger, disease and conflicts arising from these afflictions. Mass migration as a result of climate change is hard to separate from other causes of migration, but is predicted to become a much greater problem. This year is “locked in” to be the hottest on record, according to Nasa, eclipsing last year’s record heat, and may show the way to future temperature rises and their accompanying problems. Under the Paris agreement, reached last December, all of the world’s functioning governments have agreed to reduce greenhouse gases in line with the need to hold warming to no more than 2C, which scientists consider the limit of safety. That agreement has been ratified by the US, China and the European Union, and several other governments. However, while all of the governments involved in the Paris accord have agreed their own domestic targets for curbing greenhouse gases, these are not legally binding. In addition, few countries have set out concrete plans for how they would implement the curbs. Next week, signatories to the Paris agreement will gather in Marrakesh to flesh out some aspects of the pact reached last year. Supporters hope that some countries may come up with fuller plans for how they mean to achieve the necessary future emissions reductions, and countries that have not yet ratified the agreement will be persuaded to do so. None are expected to announce new targets on emissions in line with the reductions that the Unep report suggests are necessary. Nations currently have domestic targets on curbing or cutting emissions by 2020, set out in 2009 at the UN meeting in Copenhagen, as well as their Paris commitments which apply from 2025 to 2030. Asad Rehman, Friends of the Earth’s international climate campaigner, said: “This is a stark warning that cannot be ignored – tougher action on climate change is urgently needed to prevent the world speeding towards catastrophe. Governments are drinking in the ‘last chance saloon’ if the lofty goals of the Paris climate agreement are to be met.” Richard Black, director of the Energy and Climate Intelligence Unit thinktank, said: “Unep’s report confirms that there has been remarkable acceleration towards a global low-carbon economy over the past year, but considerably more action is required if governments are to meet the target they set under the Paris agreement.” Another significant climate agreement was signed in the last few weeks. Under the Montreal Protocol of 1987, countries agreed to phase out gases known to be harmful to the ozone layer. Some of the substitutes, however, turned out to be much more potent than carbon dioxide in warming the planet. Under a new addition to that agreement countries around the world have agreed to remove the harmful HFCs used in some air-conditioning and refrigeration systems. If fully implemented, this could result in a 0.5C reduction in future warming. Given the goal set in Paris for limiting global temperature rises to 2C, this would make a significant difference to the world’s actions on climate change if it is fully endorsed. Phasing out the relevant chemicals may take much of the rest of the decade, however, and could face resistance in some industries. Solheim urged countries to embark on more ambitious programmes to improve energy efficiency, increase the amount of energy coming from renewable sources, and look to meet the national targets they set in Paris."

"The UN secretary-general, Ban Ki-moon, said on Tuesday that action on climate change has become “unstoppable“, and he expressed hopes that US president-elect, Donald Trump, would drop plans to quit a global accord aimed at weaning the world off fossil fuels.  At a meeting of almost 200 nations in Morocco to work out ways to implement the 2015 Paris agreement to limit greenhouse gas emissions, Ban said US companies, states and cities were all pushing to limit global warming.  It's a climate change accord agreed by nearly 200 countries in December 2015, which came into force on 4 November 2016. The agreement commits world leaders to keeping global warming below 2C, seen as the threshold for safety by scientists, and pursuing a tougher target of 1.5C. The carbon emission curbs put forward by countries under Paris are not legally-binding but the framework of the accord, which includes a mechanism for periodically cranking those pledges up, is binding. The agreement also has a long-term goal for net zero emissions which would effectively phase out fossil fuels.    “What was once unthinkable has become unstoppable,” he told a news conference of the Paris agreement, agreed by governments last year, ratified in record time and formally adopted by more than 100 nations including the United States.  The accord, aiming to phase out net greenhouse gas emissions this century, was a breakthrough after more than two decades of negotiations, driven by increased scientific certainty that man-made emissions drive heat waves, floods and rising sea levels.  Ban said that he hoped that Republican Trump, elected last Tuesday, would drop his view that man-made climate change is a hoax and his pledge to withdraw from the Paris agreement.  “I am sure he will make a quick, wise decision,” Ban said, saying that climate change was having severe impacts from the Arctic to Antarctica. He noted that 2016 is on track to be the warmest year since records began in the 19th century.  “I hope he will really hear and understand the severity and urgency of addressing climate change. As president of the United States I hope he understands this, listens and evaluates his campaign remarks,” he said.  Ban said that companies including General Mills and Kellogg, states such as California and cities such as Washington, Nashville and Las Vegas were working to cut their greenhouse gas emissions.  He said that Trump, as a “very successful business person“, would understand that market forces were already acting to push the world economy towards cleaner energies, away from fossil fuels.  Ban, who will step down at the end of the year after a decade in charge of the United Nations, has made action on climate change a core issue of his time in office."
"The Australian government takes a delegation to the United Nations climate change talks in Morocco starting Monday – two weeks that are sure to be dominated by, well, who knows? Because, during the first week, the United States will go to the polls to pick a new president – an event that will act like a giant weapon of mass distraction in Marrakech.   The Republican candidate, Donald Trump, has pledged to pull the US out of the UN process on climate change and cancel the global deal agreed at the last talks in Paris.  Like other high-profile Republicans, Trump is not even convinced that humans cause climate change in the first place. Let’s just say he’s wrong.  But whether a Trump administration could follow through with the threat to “cancel” the agreement is questionable.  Todd Stern, who was the lead negotiator for the US delegation in Paris, has written that Trump has no power to cancel the deal because more than 190 other countries signed it. A withdrawal from Paris, Stern has written, would attract “almost universal condemnation” from other nations. China, the world’s biggest emitter of greenhouse gases after the US, launched a sort of pre-emptive strike this week with public comments criticising Trump’s climate stance. But aside from the distraction of US politics, what else for Marrakech – a meeting known as COP22 (so called, if you must ask, because this is the 22nd meeting of the conference of the parties to the UN framework convention on climate change)? And what about Australia’s position?  Since the Paris agreement was gavelled last December, the process to ratify the deal has been ongoing.  This process, known as “entry into force”, required at least 55 “parties” representing about 55% of global greenhouse gas emissions to ratify the agreement.  This threshold was met on 5 October and the deal will enter into force right about … now! This rapid entry into force (the Kyoto protocol took almost eight years) is another reason why, from the outside at least, the focus of the Marrakech talks feels unusually fluid. But the first meeting under the new Paris agreement (known as CMA1 – yeah, I know) will be looking to tie down some of the rules about transparency – that is, how and what each party needs to disclose to the convention.  Australia has still not ratified the Paris agreement but there are reports this could happen before the talks close on 18 November.  Before the Paris talks, countries around the world submitted their plans to cut emissions – these were known as intended nationally determined contributions (you gotta love the UN’s gift for language). They’re now just NDCs (because they were all accepted as part of the Paris agreement). Australia pledged that by 2030, it would cut emissions between 26% and 28% below where they were in 2005.  While the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade stands by the target as being ambitious and fair, there are many critics who say it’s anything but. On this, one diary point in Morocco will be the middle Saturday, when developed countries get to publicly question each other about their plans and ambitions. Close watchers of the UN climate processes are characterising the Marrakech talks as the “action and implementation COP” because it’s seen as the chance to start acting on the promises made in Paris. A big push from campaign groups will be to pressure the talks to get on with a fair and just transition away from a world mostly powered by fossil fuels (the decision by the French company Engie to close Australia’s dirtiest coal power station, Hazelwood, is such an example of this transition in action, and the need to plan for it). Perhaps the most important element of the talks, though, will be about a part of the Paris deal known as the ambition – or ratchet – mechanism.  When scientists have analysed all the targets that countries have put on the table, they have found they are not even close to achieving the agreed aim of keeping global warming “well below 2C”. Without further ambition, we could see warming of 3C or more. The ratchet mechanism is designed to push countries to become more ambitious over time, setting in place stocktakes, reviews and deadlines for new targets. How this will all work in practice will be a key part of COP22. Australia remains an influential country in the talks, owing in part to its position as chair of the umbrella group of countries – one of many negotiating groups. As yet there has been no formal announcement from the Australian government on who will attend, but there is an expectation among some that the foreign minister, Julie Bishop, will be there for the “high-level segment” that starts in week two. The Australian delegation will also have a new diplomat in charge. Replacing Peter Woolcott as climate change ambassador is Patrick Suckling, who took over the role in February after serving as Australia’s high commissioner in India. During his time in New Delhi Suckling made several statements supporting the controversial Carmichael mega-coalmine project in Queensland, being proposed by Indian company Adani. “This project will drive economic growth and create more than 6,000 jobs in Australia,” he said in 2014. “It will also boost India’s development by providing electricity to 100 million Indians.”  In one report in the Economic Times, Suckling was quoted as saying the Australian government was trying to tighten legal rules around who could and could not challenge coalmines through the courts (a theme that has re-emerged in recent weeks). “We are actively thinking of possible ways to limit the scope of litigation to only those with a real standing in a project,” he was quoted as saying.  Language like this tends not to go down well with the army of NGOs, campaigners and civil society groups who attend the climate talks and have given Australia more then a fair share of “fossil” awards over the years. The perception among many has been that Australia has sought to defend the coal industry too many times at UN meetings.  Will Australia stake its reputation on coal again? "

"Nasa released data earlier this year showing that global surface temperatures across land and ocean in February were a whopping 1.35C warmer than the average temperature for that same month from 1951 to 1980. As the COP22 comes to a close, it’s time we think hard, and think creatively, about the way forward and start preparing for new initiatives. Building on the impressive success of COP21 in Paris, many political and business leaders as well as representatives of civil society seem eager to engage. That is a good thing, but it is not enough. For better and, increasingly, for worse, our global system of governance rests overwhelmingly on territorial nation-states. In this system, each country’s government represents its own national interest. No one represents humanity as a whole. Such devotion to narrow interests leads to a host of profound problems, well known to economists and students of human behaviour. In various contexts they are known as “the tragedy of the commons”, “the prisoner’s dilemma”, “exporting externalities”, and “free riding”. When asked to act for the common good, nation-states are predisposed to echo Cain’s notorious response: “Am I my brother’s keeper?”  These decision makers, mostly middle-aged and older people, need to recognise that young people have a special role in representing mankind’s interest in our collective future. Most of the people currently deciding how ambitious we should be in reducing carbon emissions and adopting other environmentally sensible measures and policies won’t be around in 30 years. It is unacceptable that those with the biggest stake in the future be marginalised. We need new blood – and we need it on the playing field, not on the sidelines. Once a welcome and effective showcase, the COYs (Conferences of Youth), sponsored by the UN one month prior to COPs (Conference of the Parties), run the risk of becoming the symbol of the patronising way young people’s views and aspirations are treated. It has been said that democracy is the worst form of government to the exception of all others. For many years, the democracy (once removed) of nations appeared to be the best available alternative. Today, globe-spanning, individual-empowering technologies open new opportunities. Young people are ready for a global system in which democracy remains a guiding principle, but where other entities, such as a symbolic country representing global youth, join actual nation-states in the decision-making. Like the characters in the Star Wars series, this generation does not care so much about where you are from or what colour your skin is. Instead it wants to know what your values are and where you are heading. The time has come for a symbolic new country to take part in COPs and other key international gatherings, to represent the interests of those still under 30 worldwide – just like refugees were finally, deservedly, allowed to compete under their own banner in the Rio Olympics. A mix of scientists, entrepreneurs, activists, heads of NGOs and, yes, professional politicians would form the delegation. This “country” could have the rights and responsibilities that come with the turf, and play a commensurate role in debates and negotiations. While lacking in hard power, this country could presumably make use of reserves of soft power unavailable to most nation-states. Inertia and cynicism are powerful forces, so this idea won’t be an easy sell. Luckily, young people have some formidable allies: some enlightened governments, like that of Justin Trudeau in Canada, and some of the world’s leading corporations have convincingly expressed their deep sense of responsibility to the future. The future is ours. All of ours. Starting next year, let’s give millennials an actual seat at the table of negotiations of our annual Conference of Parties.

"As the Chicago Cubs finally won the baseball World Series, Twitter was awash with comments on things that had happened since 1908 – the last time the Cubs won. For example, since then there had been two world wars, the beginning and end of the Soviet Union and media had moved from a time when baseball wasn’t even broadcast on radio to when you could watch the game in HD on your phone on the other side of the world. And also, in the time since, the planet has warmed by around 1.5C.  I throw in this little nugget of information because it’s always worth reminding ourselves that while the flotsam and jetsam of daily news and politics flies by, so too are the temperature records. Nasa recently announced that September was the warmest September on record. There’s nothing too surprising about that – 11 of the past 12 months have been the warmest of each month. Only July did not set a record – it had to be content with being the third-warmest July on record. The 12 months to September set a new high for the warmest 12-month period recorded (breaking the old record set in August) of 1.04C above the average of the 1951-1980. The same period in 1908 was 0.42C below the average. So things have changed. Back in 1908 there was also a US presidential election. There were no debates then but, ironically, the same number of questions on climate change were asked in this year’s debates as back then – zero. We now have the prospect of a US president who either believes climate change is a hoax perpetrated by the Chinese, or at best believes it’s just a hoax perpetrated by some vague group because “it’s a money-making industry”. And yet this hardly rates a mention – lost amid an avalanche of stories about the emails of the other candidate. Now we could get on a high horse, except Australia doesn’t fare much better. Climate change at least was the topic of one question in the leaders’ debate but it hardly dominated the election. And, like the US, we also have multiple politicians who fall at the first hurdle when it comes to intelligence by professing that climate change is a con. Mostly here, the topic comes up as the cause of blame – such as renewable energy being cited as the cause for the blackout in South Australia or even again this week with the announcement of the Hazelwood power station closing. As such, the discussion revolves around the negative aspect of the cost of policies that will reduce carbon emissions. It’s a framing that has the underlying foundation that not pursing policies to reduce carbon emissions is a credible alternative. It is rather similar to businesses complaining of the cost of introducing domestic violence leave rather than worrying about the horrific fact that there is actually a need for such a type of leave. As Gay Alcorn noted on Friday – the closure of the Hazelwood power station was inevitable – and yet the sense is that both state and federal governments were caught flat footed. Unsurprisingly, the first reaction was to focus more on compensation packages for the workers. But there is a lack of any sense of governments accepting this is just the first of such closures and that plans and responses for them should be well in place by now. As the Climate Council noted this week, Australia’s climate change policy is mired in a valley of uncertainty, where our emissions reductions target for 2030 are based on measures that have been yet to be brought into force. We don’t have a gibbering fool like Trump for a leader who screams about China and international hoaxes on climate change but Turnbull has long shed the leather jacket persona of his Q&A days when he took pride in his then principled stand on climate change policy. Now more likely we’ll hear him talk of the great future for coal and rush to blame renewable energy rather than to push it as a solution. No, he’s not the gibbering fool; he is just the appeaser of those fools within his government. And that is no less damaging. It is not a strategy that can last, because while it might help to keep the issue off the political agenda, and keep his leadership somewhat more safe, the months keep passing and the temperature keeps rising. Because of its size, age and dirtiness, Hazelwood carries with it greater significance than do other coal-fired power stations. Perhaps its closure – regardless of the reasons for it – will force both federal and state governments to acknowledge that the future is here already."
"Calls for a tax on meat and dairy products (Report, 8 November) are misguided and would increase, not decrease, overall emissions from agriculture. Instead we should improve production systems by taxing nitrogen fertiliser and pesticides, the underlying causes of environmental damage associated with food systems. Something close to mass hysteria has developed in relation to cattle and other ruminants since the publication in 2006 of Livestock’s Long Shadow, by the Food and Agriculture Organisation. This report and its successor in 2013 are both flawed and misleading. They conflate the emissions from the destruction of virgin land in South America, the root cause of which is not chicken production, but our insatiable demand for vegetable oils, with the actual emissions from ruminants. They also failed to balance this by including emissions from the conversion of land to grow crops for human consumption, or the carbon sequestration associated with the planting of forests in parts of the world, such as the UK, that was taking place at the same time.  We do urgently need to reduce methane emissions, but fossil fuel extraction should be our primary focus because this puts new carbon into the atmosphere, whereas ruminants recycle existing atmospheric carbon and, under appropriate management, store large amounts of it in soils under grass.Richard YoungPolicy director, Sustainable Food Trust • Curbing advertising of junk food (Report, 12 November) to reduce childhood obesity is one needed measure, but it seems unlikely to be the most effective policy that could be employed to combat this urgent health crisis. Indeed, it appears to be a peripheral attempt to persuade the population to change their habits by removing temptation, hardly “tough” and at most superficial. On a recent journey from Glasgow to Sheffield it was striking that no service station visited offered healthy food options. Pre-packaged, high-fat, high-sugar hits were dominant. If the government is serious about tacking obesity, perhaps a more direct approach is needed? State-funded healthy eating outlets in motorway services would provide a welcome alternative. School meals have been transformed and are to an extent subsidised catering for young people, perhaps Jamie Oliver’s next big challenge could make a real difference for us all?John WardleSheffield • The Guardian’s Foodie traveller (Cook, 5 November) hosts Ben Tish advocating the eating of soft shell crabs. These, according to Mr Tish’s description, are killed by being “soaked in seasoned beaten egg” by which means they “eventually drown”. Mr Tish’s use of the word “eventually” indicates a period of pain and suffering. I do not like reading advocacies of animal cruelty, even towards crabs. I am not a militant vegetarian, just a normal member of the public. If the Guardian wants readers to support the Guardian financially, as you do, and as I am thinking of doing, please consider the very many of your readers who do not like the idea of the Guardian promoting animal cruelty for food pleasure. Those days really should be over, and I invite you to reconsider the Guardian’s position on this matter.Robin LeslieLondon • Join the debate – email guardian.letters@theguardian.com • Read more Guardian letters – click here to visit gu.com/letters"

"There’s a touch of irony in the fact the Australian government has invested $200m in the international Green Climate Fund, a United Nations fund to assist developing countries in adapting to and mitigating the effects of climate change.  There is, however, no equivalent investment fund by the government, or corporate Australia, towards developing sustainable economies on Aboriginal lands through one of those mitigation practices, namely carbon farming.   Investment in a sustainable Aboriginal carbon industry would directly impact climate change, Indigenous poverty and the management of traditional lands and waters. These are all key parts of meeting Australia’s commitment to the sustainable development goals (SDGs), specifically SDG13 (climate action), as well as SDG8 (decent work and economic growth), SDG11 (sustainable cities and communities), SDG14 (life below water) and SDG15 (life on land). The government formally adopted the sustainable development goals in Paris last year. At the same time the UN called upon the international business community to play their part in achieving the goals, saying their success relies heavily on action and collaboration by all actors. Paris is a long way from an Aboriginal community in Cape York undertaking carbon farming or central Australia where I live, and so is Sydney. But climate change is the great equaliser. All Australians experience the hotter summers, crazy storms and pungent smoke from out-of-control bushfires that float into the cities and towns. Climate change is like the polluted air all people, rich and poor, have to endure in Beijing and around the world. It impacts on us all. One of the ways Indigenous people are taking action on climate change is through carbon farming. Carbon farming is simply managing vegetation to increase carbon storage or reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Early dry season savannah burning across northern Australia is the most popular form of carbon farming practised by traditional owners and Aboriginal ranger groups today, and it’s something that comes naturally to most of them. As a young ranger I recall the old blokes always having a smile on their face and a spring in their step when we went out burning in the national park. The young blokes loved it too. The work is enjoyable and satisfied their cultural obligations to country.  Burning country not only maintains its health but makes a statement that country is being cared for. The “biggest estate on earth” didn’t happen by chance, rather, through good fire management practises, the land was kept in good order, a bit like housekeeping. Carbon farming through early dry season savannah burning takes place on Aboriginal lands in the Kimberley, Top End and Cape York. The Aboriginal rangers, mostly traditional owners, light small fires in April, May, June and July. This prevents the large hot wildfires that typically ignite in August, October and November, releasing huge amounts of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere. This early season burning always results in tired but happy rangers, a landscape that is well managed and in recent times, an economic return from selling carbon credits. These carbon credits can then be sold to the government through the Emissions Reduction Fund auction and/or corporations that want to be carbon neutral in the voluntary market. The income goes back to the community, rangers and management of Aboriginal lands and waters.  The Aboriginal Carbon Fund is putting forward the creation of an industry development fund to support carbon farming, which would resemble the financial commitment already provided to the Green Climate Fund, Cooperative Research Centre for Developing Northern Australia or Research and Development Corporations. A modest investment fund of $10m would go a long way to supporting sustainable economies on Aboriginal lands. By supporting the fund or purchasing these carbon credits, corporate Australia can make a direct investment in Aboriginal Australia and their lands for the first time. An Aboriginal-driven economy is being created, but like any new emerging industry it cannot stand alone, and it needs investment.  It must be questioned why such enormous amount of financial support for the intervention was found but none for an innovative industry on Aboriginal lands. Funds were found for placing an army of government business managers throughout communities in the Northern Territory, but no economy has been invested in.  Regardless of the reasons for the funding shortfall, climate change, Indigenous poverty and the sustainable management of Aboriginal lands are all connected and can all be addressed through carbon farming. With the support of business, not just the government, Australia can address these issues and meet its commitments to the sustainable development goals by taking action on climate change.  Rowan Foley will be speaking on SDG15 (life on land) at the SDGA16 conference in Sydney on 29-3o November "
"Germany’s coalition government has reached an agreement on a climate change action plan which involves reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 80 to 95% by 2050, a spokesperson said on Friday. The plan, which will require German industry to reduce its CO2 emission by a fifth by 2030, and Germany’s energy sector to reduce emissions by almost a half, will be reviewed in 2018 with a view to its impact on jobs and society.  “Especially the sector targets, included in the climate protection plan, will be subject to a comprehensive impact assessment,” government spokesperson Georg Streiter said at a news conference. He said the government agreed that the reduction targets could be adjusted in 2018. The last-minute breakthrough spares the German government some blushes for its representatives at next week’s high level segment of the Marrakech climate change conference , where pressure on Germany to show global leadership have increased after Donald Trump’s victory in the US elections. Germany’s environment minister Barbara Hendricks first presented a list of ambitious CO2 reduction targets for various economic sectors in 2015. But proposals had subsequently become bogged down by special pleading from ministers in her own governing coalition, especially the conservative-run ministries for agriculture and transport. Even Social Democrat leader and deputy chancellor Sigmar Gabriel had until recently vetoed the plans, expressing concerns that a phase-out of brown coal, which causes the highest CO2 emissions per ton when burned, could lead to large-scale job losses in affected regions. According to Reuters, the final plan contains lower reduction targets for power plants than proposed in earlier drafts. A call for introducing a minimum price for pollution certificates in the European Union’s carbon trading scheme was also reportedly scrapped. Gabriel, who is also Germany’s economic minister, said on Friday that the agreed plan represented “a very good and well-balanced solution”. He added: “Other countries will only follow in the footsteps of our very ambitious climate policy if we manage to combine the fight against climate change with the protection of industrial jobs even in energy-intensive sectors”. The president of the Association of German Industry (BDI) criticised the action plan : “In order for [German] climate policy to set the standard around the world, it has to be manageable for businesses and allow them to remain competitive,” Ulrich Grillo said. “That’s why we reject arbitrary and tonne-high reduction targets for individual sectors.” A spokesperson for Greenpeace International welcomed the German government sticking to its list of sector-specific reduction targets. “By committing to halving emissions in the energy sector, the government’s climate action plans effectively hail the phase-out of the coal industry and the end of the era of the combustion engine,” said climate expert Karsten Smid. “But given that Germany’s renewables revolution is now moving at a snail’s pace, it will no longer be able to claim a leadership role on climate protection.” "

" UN talks to implement the landmark Paris climate pact opened in Marrakech on Monday, buoyed by gathering momentum but threatened by the spectre of climate change denier Donald Trump in the White House. Diplomats from 196 nations are meeting in Morocco to flesh out the planet-saving plan inked in the French capital last December. “We have made possible what everyone said was impossible,” said French environment minister, Ségolène Royal, at the opening ceremony, in which she handed over stewardship of the climate forum to Moroccan foreign minister, Salaheddine Mezouar. Royal announced that 100 countries have ratified the Paris agreement, which entered into force last Friday, a record time for an international treaty. She appealed to other nations to do so by the end of the year. Amid growing alarm at the gathering pace of climate change and its impacts – rising seas, deadly storms, drought and wildfires – the world’s nations have moved quickly over the last year to tackle the still-growing problem. But as 15,000 negotiators, CEOs and activists settle in for the 12-day talks in Marrakesh, all eyes are on the United States, where voting Tuesday could thrust Trump into the White House. When it comes to global warming, the stakes could hardly be higher, the US president, Barack Obama, has warned. “All the progress we’ve made on climate change” – including the Paris pact, decades in the making – “is going to be on the ballot,” he told TV talk show host Bill Maher on Friday. Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton has vowed to uphold Obama’s domestic energy policies and international climate commitments. Experts in Marrakech say the Republican candidate cannot carry out his threat to “cancel” the still-fragile accord, but a Trump victory might cripple it. “It would be a shock, and I hope we don’t see it,” Laurence Tubiana, France’s top climate negotiator told AFP. “But if Trump is elected, I am sure that Wednesday morning you will hear everyone at the COP say, ‘We’ll stick to the Paris agreement’,” she added, using the acronym for the Conference of the Parties meeting. In Marrakech, front-line diplomats must roll up their sleeves and work through scores of procedural issues that will make the difference between success and failure. They have informally set 2018 as the deadline for laying that groundwork, Royal told journalists Sunday. Concretely, these include how to measure and track each nation’s CO2 emissions; disbursing hundreds of billions of dollars in financing in a way that reassures both rich and recipient nations; and setting criteria for compensating poor countries devastated by climate-fuelled storms, droughts or floods. 2018 is also the next high-stakes rendezvous when nations can narrow the so-called “emissions gap” between their carbon-cutting pledges and the level of reductions needed to stave off dangerous levels of warming. That gap is still huge, and getting bigger every year. On current trends, the Earth will heat up about 3C (5.4F) above the pre-industrial era benchmark, a sure recipe for climate catastrophe, according to scientists. The Paris agreement calls for capping global warming at under 2.0C, and even 1.5C if possible – a hugely daunting challenge. “We have to plug that gap,” Tubiana said. “The big battle of the next two years is how to get countries to increase their ambition.” The UN talks opened amid encouraging signs. New figures show that renewable energy attracted record investment of $300bn (€270bn) in 2015, outstripping fossil fuels. Installed capacity of solar, wind and hydro also, for the first time, overtook carbon-intensive coal, which is in sharp decline. A separate international agreement inked last month ensures the phase-out of potent, manmade greenhouse gases known as HFCs, potentially shaving 0.5C off global temperatures by the end of the century. Businesses – ever-more present at the UN climate forum – have also become crucial drivers of change, motivated by the need to anticipate the rapid shift to a low- or zero-carbon global economy. At the same time, however, climate scientists are sending up red flags. After two successive record-breaking years, 2016 is shaping up to be the hottest ever registered. “If we don’t start taking additional action now,” warned UN Environment Programme head, Erik Solheim, “we will grieve over the avoidable human tragedy.”  "
"Floods, earthquakes, tsunamis and other extreme natural disasters push 26 million people into poverty each year and cost the global economy more than half a trillion dollars in lost consumption, the World Bank has said. A bank study of 117 countries concluded that the full cost of natural disasters was $520bn (£416bn) a year – 60% higher than any previous estimate – once the impact on poor people was taken into account.  The World Bank published its findings at the COP22 climate change conference in Marrakech and said the report underlined the need to protect the most vulnerable against the effects of global warming. Jim Kim, the World Bank’s president, said: “Severe climate shocks threaten to roll back decades of progress against poverty. Storms, floods, and droughts have dire human and economic consequences, with poor people often paying the heaviest price. Building resilience to disasters not only makes economic sense, it is a moral imperative.” The report cited evidence from the impact of Tropical Storm Agatha in 2010, which led to consumption per head falling by 5.5% and increased poverty by 14%. Policies that made countries more resilient to extreme natural disasters and improved early warning systems could bring benefits of $100bn a year, the bank said. It cited the examples of Kenya, where the country’s social protection system had provided help to vulnerable farmers well before the 2015 drought, and Pakistan, where a rapid response programme of cash grants after severe floods in 2010 had benefited 8 million people. Stephane Hallegatte, who prepared the World Bank report, said: “Countries are enduring a growing number of unexpected shocks as a result of climate change. Poor people need social and financial protection from disasters that cannot be avoided. With risk policies that we know to be effective, we have the opportunity to prevent millions of people from falling into poverty.” The bank’s research showed that previous studies had underestimated the impact of natural disasters because they had measured the cost by assessing damage to physical assets. Costs were much higher when lost consumption of poor people who have fewer assets than the better off was taken into account. It said $1 in losses did not mean the same to a rich person and poor person. “The same loss affects poor and marginalised people far more because their livelihoods depend on fewer assets, their consumption is closer to subsistence levels, they cannot rely on savings to smooth the impacts, their health and education are at greater risk, and they may need more time to recover and reconstruct. “A flood or an earthquake can be disastrous for poor people, but have a negligible impact on a country’s wealth or production if it affects people who own almost nothing and have very low incomes.”"
"Last week, the Paris climate agreement officially entered into force, with the landmark global climate deal ushering in a new era of international climate diplomacy and sustainable development. This week, delegates from over 190 nations are convening in Morocco, seeking to build on the spirit of cooperation born in Paris, and working to convert the broad aspirational commitments into action.  While building on the architecture of the Paris agreement, national governments should keep the public health implications in mind.  Climate change is now recognised in the medical field as a clear and present danger to public health. The World Health Organisation’s director general has called it “one of the greatest health risks of the 21st century,” and the 2015 Lancet Commission concluded that climate change poses “an unacceptably high and potentially catastrophic risk to human health.” In Australia, where I studied medicine, these risks are already all too clear. This week, the Lancet, one of the world’s most prestigious medical journals, is launching a new research collaboration dedicated to tracking these risks in Australia and around the world. The Lancet Countdown: Tracking Progress on Health and Climate Change, will check in annually on countries’ progress on climate change and calculate the direct health impacts of the transition to a low carbon future. The Royal Australasian College of Physicians (RACP), meanwhile, is also releasing three position statements on health and climate change. These statements are informed by some dire observations.  Over the past half-century, average temperatures across the continent have steadily increased, bringing more frequent heatwaves that are longer and hotter than any in recorded history. Exposure to high temperatures over a prolonged period brings heightened rates of ailments such as dehydration, heat exhaustion, and heatstroke, and worsens existing health conditions like heart and potentially even kidney disease. These heatwaves have caused more deaths over the last century in Australia than any other natural event. Tragically, children and the elderly are most vulnerable. The public health impacts, however, go well beyond heat-related threats. Changes to precipitation patterns are causing both severe droughts and intense floods, which together have taken the lives of thousands. Over time, new rainfall norms and warmer temperatures are expected to alter the burden and distribution of infectious disease throughout Australia, as mosquito-borne diseases such as dengue fever and the Ross River virus take hold. Beyond these harms that warmer temperatures deliver, the combustion of climate warming fossil fuels creates other direct threats to public health. Air pollution from the burning of coal for electricity generation and from road transport presents a particularly worrying challenge, resulting in twice as many deaths as motor vehicle accidents (over 3,000 per year).  In urban areas, smog from tailpipes contains ground-level ozone, dangerous particulates, and other pollutants. Ozone irritates the lining of the lungs and exacerbates asthma, and is actually made more potent on hot, sunny days, which are anticipated to be more frequent as a result of climate change. By 2050, ozone-induced hospitalisations in Sydney are expected to double. Despite all of these troubling statistics and predictions, Australia’s government shows little interest in setting strong climate goals and facilitating the transition away from coal. In fact, the Australian delegation arrived at the COP22 climate talks without having ratified the Paris agreement (although it has since been ratified), and with some of the weakest greenhouse gas emissions reduction targets among all the participating nations.  Australia’s stated goal is to reduce net GHG emissions 26% below 2005 levels by 2030, a calculation that includes land use change and reforestation on top of modest emissions reductions from the burning of fossil fuels. The Climate Institute, an Australian think tank, has reported that under these current targets, Australia’s per capita emissions in 2030 would be twice as high as the average for other developed countries. Rather than explore ways to bring domestic policies in line with the international community, Australia’s politicians seem more concerned with protecting the coal industry and promising that the fossil fuel will be part of Australia’s energy mix for “many, many, many decades to come.” By doing so, they are not only steering Australia to a hotter, more dangerous, and less healthy future, but also cheating Australians out of the positive co-benefits of transitioning away from coal and other fossil fuels. If the Turnbull government needs hard evidence of the health benefits of climate action, they can consult the Lancet Countdown on Climate and Health, which will put real world economic costs on the policy choices. Between the Lancet Countdown and the RACP’s statements, it’s clear that physicians and public health professionals understand the climate-health nexus better than Australia’s politicians. Mr. Turnbull should act for the health and wellbeing of all Australians."

"Donald Trump is looking at quick ways of withdrawing from the Paris climate agreement in defiance of widening international backing for the plan to cut greenhouse gas emissions, Reuters has reported.  Since the US president-elect was chosen, governments ranging from China to small island states have reaffirmed support for the 2015 Paris agreement at 200-nation climate talks running until 18 November in Marrakesh, Morocco.  But, according to Reuters, a source in the Trump transition team said the victorious Republican, who has called global warming a hoax, was considering ways to bypass a theoretical four-year procedure for leaving the accord.  “It was reckless for the Paris agreement to enter into force before the election,” said the source, who works on Trump’s transition team for international energy and climate policy, speaking on condition of anonymity. The Paris agreement went into force on 4 November, four days before last Tuesday’s election.  Alternatives were to send a letter withdrawing from a 1992 convention that is the parent treaty of the Paris agreement, voiding US involvement in both in a year’s time, or to issue a presidential order simply deleting the US signature from the Paris accord, the source told Reuters.  Many nations have expressed hopes the United States will stay. Morocco, the host for the talks, said the agreement that seeks to phase out greenhouse gases in the second half of the century was strong enough to survive a pullout.  “If one party decides to withdraw that it doesn’t call the agreement into question,” foreign minister Salaheddine Mezouar told a news conference. Despite the threat of a US withdrawal, US secretary of state John Kerry said on Sunday that he would continue his efforts to implement the Paris agreement until Barack Obama leaves office on 20 January. Speaking in New Zealand following a trip to Antarctica, Kerry appeared to take a swipe at Trump when he listed some of the ways in which global warming could already be seen. He said that there were more fires, floods and damaging storms around the world, and sea levels were rising. “The evidence is mounting in ways that people in public life should not dare to avoid accepting as a mandate for action,” Kerry said. It's a climate change accord agreed by nearly 200 countries in December 2015, which came into force on 4 November 2016. The agreement commits world leaders to keeping global warming below 2C, seen as the threshold for safety by scientists, and pursuing a tougher target of 1.5C. The carbon emission curbs put forward by countries under Paris are not legally-binding but the framework of the accord, which includes a mechanism for periodically cranking those pledges up, is binding. The agreement also has a long-term goal for net zero emissions which would effectively phase out fossil fuels.   “Now the world’s scientific community has concluded that climate change is happening beyond any doubt. And the evidence is there for everybody to see,” Kerry said. The Paris agreement was reached by almost 200 nations in December and, as of Saturday, has been formally ratified by 109 representing 76% of greenhouse gas emissions, including the United States with 18%.  The accord seeks to hold global warming to no more than 2C above pre-industrial levels to limit rising temperatures that have been linked to increasing economic damage from desertification, extinctions of animals and plants, heat waves, floods and rising sea levels.  United Nations climate chief Patricia Espinosa declined to comment on the Trump source’s remarks to Reuters.  “The Paris agreement carries an enormous amount of weight and credibility,” she told a news conference. She said the UN hoped for a strong and constructive relationship with Trump.  The Trump source blamed US president Barack Obama for joining up by an executive order, without getting approval from the Senate. “There wouldn’t be this diplomatic fallout on the broader international agenda if Obama hadn’t rushed the adoption,” he said."
"The Paris agreement on climate change enters into force on Friday, marking the first time that governments have agreed legally binding limits to global temperature rises. The passage of the accord – the fruit of more than two decades of often tortuous international negotiations on combating climate change – was hailed by nations and observers around the world.  Under the agreement, all governments that have ratified the accord, which includes the US, China, India and the EU, now carry an obligation to hold global warming to no more than 2C above pre-industrial levels. That is what scientists regard as the limit of safety, beyond which climate change is likely to become catastrophic and irreversible. It's a climate change accord agreed by nearly 200 countries in December 2015, which came into force on 4 November 2016. The agreement commits world leaders to keeping global warming below 2C, seen as the threshold for safety by scientists, and pursuing a tougher target of 1.5C. The carbon emission curbs put forward by countries under Paris are not legally-binding but the framework of the accord, which includes a mechanism for periodically cranking those pledges up, is binding. The agreement also has a long-term goal for net zero emissions which would effectively phase out fossil fuels.   Countries have put forward commitments on curbing carbon emissions under the agreement, but a report on Thursday found those pledges would see temperature rises significantly overshoot the threshold, with 3C of warming. Environmental groups urged governments to do more. Andrew Norton, director of the International Institute for Environment and Development, said: “The voices of the people who will be hit hardest by the devastating impacts of climate change need to be heard. Governments must work to plan practical steps for the agreement’s implementation, and set out how climate finance can actually reach people in the poorest, most vulnerable countries.” Harjeet Singh, global lead on climate change for the charity ActionAid, added: “The Paris agreement sends a much-needed signal to politicians and industry that we have to build a new world, and this has to start now. However, the deal is not enough to keep people and the planet safe.”  Asad Rehman, international climate campaigner at Friends of the Earth, said: “The Paris agreement is a major step in the right direction, but it falls a long way short of the giant leap needed to tackle climate change. Far tougher action is needed to rapidly slash emissions.” Greenpeace said that while the deal needed strengthening, it was a “momentous occasion” that it had come into force. Next week, governments will meet in Morocco under the auspices of the United Nations to discuss how to put the Paris accord into force, and meet its aims. Patricia Espinosa, the UN’s climate chief, and Salaheddine Mezouar, foreign minister of Morocco, said in a joint statement: “Humanity will look back on 4 November 2016 as the day that countries of the world shut the door on inevitable climate disaster and set off with determination towards a sustainable future.  “The Paris agreement is undoubtedly a turning point in the history of common human endeavour, capturing the combined political, economic and social will of governments, cities, regions and businesses and investors to overcome the existential threat of unchecked climate change.” Lord Turner, former head of the UK government’s statutory advisory committee on climate change, said: “The fact that this crucial UN agreement is coming into force within a year of signing is a hugely important achievement, and the good news is that agreement to the Paris deal is being matched by real progress in many countries.” However, fossil fuel industries see continued opportunities for development within a low-carbon world.  Benjamin Sporton, chief executive of the World Coal Association, said: “For many countries, coal will continue to play a significant role in economic development, industrialisation and urbanisation. For the Paris agreement to be realised, we need to support those countries [that are committed to lower emission coal technology, such as high-efficiency plants]. We cannot wish coal away.”"
"Malcolm Turnbull has signalled Australia will not seek to withdraw from the Paris climate agreement even if the US president-elect, Donald Trump, follows through on his threat to cancel the emissions reductions commitments made by Barack Obama last December. Turnbull on Thursday confirmed Australia had ratified the Paris agreement despite domestic opposition from the One Nation party, a critical Senate bloc for the government, and persistent climate change scepticism roiling within Coalition ranks. After Trump’s victory, and ahead of Turnbull’s confirmation of the government’s intentions with ratification on Thursday morning, the chairman of the government’s backbench committee on the environment and energy, the Liberal MP Craig Kelly said on Facebook the Paris agreement was now “cactus”. Kelly shared a clip of Trump saying he would cancel the Paris agreement at an oil and gas conference in North Dakota in May. Kelly subsequently showed little interest in walking back his intervention, taking to Twitter to congratulate the Labor leader, Bill Shorten, for following his social media posts. Great to know that Bill Shorten follows my Facebook Page Labor raised the Kelly post in question time on Thursday. Trump’s victory has emboldened Australian political conservatives, who have used the opportunity to declare local MPs need to push back against so-called “elite” opinion and speak to majority views within the electorate.  Turnbull attempted during the session to shrug off Kelly’s display of defiance, declaring he was “proud to enter into agreement on behalf of Australia”. “My government is committed to [the Paris agreement]. We have ratified it,” he said. Asked earlier in the day by reporters whether Australia would pull out of the agreement if Trump followed through on his threat to pull out, Turnbull noted the US would not be in a position to do anything quickly. “If a country sought to withdraw from the agreement it takes four years,” the prime minister told reporters on Thursday. As for Australia’s position, Turnbull emphasised the fact the Paris agreement was a global undertaking and “when Australia makes a commitment to a global agreement, we follow through, and that is exactly what we are doing”. The prime minister said the Paris agreement was “a watershed and a turning point” that would deliver international action on climate change. Australia is the 104th country to ratify the Paris agreement, which came into force earlier this month. During the routine process of parliamentary review of the agreement, the One Nation senator Malcolm Roberts made a submission arguing the government should not ratify the deal. Roberts told the joint standing committee on treaties the Paris agreement should not enter into force for Australia “on 4 November 2016 or any other date, until both the science and economics have been rigorously and independently assessed and cause and effect is proven”. “There is no empirical evidence presented anywhere in the world proving carbon dioxide from human activity affects global climate or evidence that its production needs to be cut,” the One Nation senator said. “On this test alone, the treaty must not be ratified.” The parliamentary inquiry process produced a raft of submissions from a range of groups making the point Australia would struggle to meet its international climate commitments on current domestic policy settings. Despite the broad-based criticism, the government has repeatedly declined to say whether a review of the Direct Action policy scheduled for 2017 will yield any significant adjustments to the current policy. Current indications suggest it will be extremely difficult for the government to increase the current level of policy ambition because of internal resistance within the Coalition – which would create consequential problems given Australia has now signed on to the global emissions reduction framework. The government’s decision to ratify the Paris agreement was welcomed by a range of environment and community groups on Thursday. “Ratification of the Paris agreement on climate change is a critical aspect of Australia’s commitment to a long term climate and energy strategy that will help promote community and business confidence,” said the deputy chief executive of the climate institute, Erwin Jackson. Jackson said the timing of the ratification was also important. “Given the political events in the USA in the last 24 hours, Australia’s ratification also sends a message to the international community about our national intentions,” he said. “This provides us with a level of credibility to be able to join other nations in encouraging other countries, particularly in our region, to implement the agreement as well.” Kellie Caught, the Australian spokeswoman for WWF-Australia, said ratification meant the government could now move on to the important task of ensuring Australia had a roadmap to lower emissions in line with our international obligations. “Australia’s ratification means we can now focus on strengthening policies and actions to achieve the agreement’s goals and objectives – in particular the goal of rapid reductions in emissions,” Caught said. “WWF believes that the Australian government can and must do more to reduce pollution. The current climate targets and policies are not strong enough to limit global warming to 1.5 degrees and protect the people and places we love.” Oxfam echoed that sentiment. Its climate change spokesman, Simon Bradshaw, said: “Attention must turn to ramping up the Australian government’s contribution to tackling climate change and bringing it closer into line with what the agreement demands.” “While ratification is a vital step and should be celebrated, the government is yet to do the math on what the agreement means for Australia and the scale of action we must take if we’re to do our part and help avoid a much more dangerous future.”"

"Climate change may have been largely ignored during the presidential election but it will be on the ballot on 8 November, with Florida voters deciding on a measure backed by large utilities that could effectively snuff out the solar industry in the state.  The measure, known as amendment 1, has been criticized as “fundamentally dishonest” for superficially appearing to be pro-solar. However, renewable energy experts warn that it would remove the incentive for homeowners to get rooftop solar panels, devastating the solar industry in America’s sunshine state.   The amendment would change Florida’s constitution to give consumers the right to have solar panels installed. But it also states that the government should “ensure that consumers who do not choose to install solar are not required to subsidize the costs of backup power and electric grid access to those who do”.  A group called Consumers for Smart Solar, backed by more than $20m in campaign funding by Florida’s large energy utilities, has put forward the measure, ostensibly to protect Florida residents from rip-offs. But critics contend that the proposal would lead the way to solar panel owners facing fees or a reduced price for the excess energy they put back into the grid, known as net metering.  “The utilities have been fundamentally dishonest, their behavior is incredibly cynical,” said David Pomerantz, executive director of pro-renewables group Energy and Policy Institute. “It has confused quite a few voters and that was by design. The large electric utilities in Florida feel extraordinarily threatened by customer-owned solar. Instead of trying to adapt to it, they want to kill rooftop solar in the cradle.”  Pomerantz said the measure would be a major blow to a solar industry that is already “stunted” in Florida. Fewer than 20,000 Floridian homes have solar panels, despite its enormous potential for solar energy, compared with Massachusetts, a north-east state with a quarter of the population, which has 163,000 homes with solar panels.   The dismantling of net metering, one of the few incentives to get solar in Florida, could have a similar outcome as that seen in Nevada, where increased charges and reduced net metering credits saw leading solar panel installer SolarCity pull out of the state.   Environmentalists have rounded on the Florida measure, with former vice-president Al Gore accusing the utilities of “trying to fool you” into killing off the solar industry. A court challenge to stop the measure was defeated in the Florida supreme court but Justice Barbara Pariente, in dissent, called the amendment a “wolf in sheep’s clothing” and an attempt to “constitutionalize the status quo”.  Polling has shown strong support for amendment 1, although support has recently plummeted to close to the 60% threshold needed for the proposition to pass. The drop in support followed the Miami Herald’s release in October of an audio recording by Sal Nuzzo, vice-president of free market group James Madison Institute.  Nuzzo told an industry conference that amendment 1 was an “incredibly savvy maneuver” and “political jiujitsu” that would “completely negate anything (pro-solar groups) would try to do legislatively or constitutionally down the road”.  Consumers for Smart Solar, the utilities-backed group, has denied any connection to the Hames Madison Institute and insisted that the amendment would protect consumers from scams and from subsidizing solar companies from outside Florida.  “Amendment 1 is good for the environment, it is good for consumers and it is good for Florida,” said Dick Batchelor, co-chair of Consumers for Smart Solar.  “However, in looking at ways to increase the amount of our energy that comes from the sun, it is essential that we do so in a way that safeguards consumers – particularly our seniors – with commonsense consumer protection rules that benefit every consumer, and that we have all come to expect.”  The Florida solar measure isn’t the only climate-related item voters will decide on on Tuesday. Voters in Washington will decide whether the state will be the first in the US to introduce a carbon tax on emissions.  The measure, called I-732, would place a $25-per-ton fee on carbon dioxide emissions from 2018, rising gradually over the course of 40 years to $100. It will aim to be revenue neutral, however, because Washington’s sales tax will be cut by 1% and further tax rebated will be given to manufacturers and low-income households.  The vote has split environment groups, some of which supported an alternative that would have raised money to be funneled into clean energy projects. The Sierra Club has said it doesn’t support I-732 because it “does not include all that is needed for an equitable climate policy and just transition to a clean energy economy”, in particular by failing to support communities of color and low income. The projections put forward by Carbon Washington, the grassroots group behind the measure, have also been questioned. An analysis by the Washington Office of Financial Management found that the measure will cut the state’s revenue by $200m a year. However, the measure does retain some notable support, including former Nasa scientist James Hansen, actor Leonardo DiCaprio and Steven Chu, former secretary of energy under Barack Obama. An open letter penned by 51 climate scientists also backs I-732. “This revenue neutral measure offers the most progressive change in our tax code in decades and represents a bipartisan effort that rejects ideology,” the letter states.  “While many interrelated social and environmental needs demand our attention, complex problems are best solved one step at a time. I-732 is a simple step in the right direction.”"

"In September, Hillary Clinton came under fire for suggesting that half of Donald Trump’s supporters belonged in “a basket of deplorables” consisting of “the racist, sexist, homophobic, xenophobic, Islamaphobic – you name it.”  Labeling people in such a disparaging manner is not a constructive approach. However, research has shown it’s true that Donald Trump brings out the worst characteristics in Americans. Only about half of Trump supporters think global warming is real, and twice as many Republicans are unsure about the evidence as they were a year ago. Hostility towards women and racial resentment correlate with Trump support almost as strongly as party affiliation. Xenophobia, misogyny, and denial of science and facts are the defining characteristics of Donald Trump’s candidacy.   Journalists have struggled to treat Donald Trump as something other than a standard presidential candidate. Because he constantly spawns new scandals and is lacking in the policy department, to normalize Trump and abnormalize Clinton, network evening news programs have devoted three times more coverage to Hillary Clinton’s emails than all policies combined, as accurately satirized by Saturday Night Live: The nightly news programs have devoted zero time to discussing the candidates’ climate plans. Media false balance has struck again. It’s important to realize that Donald Trump does have a few policy positions. For example, he wants to burn coal indefinitely because he denies the climate change consequences. Trump also wants to eliminate government spending on clean energy and climate research, cut taxes predominantly for the most wealthy, build a costly and pointless border wall, engage in expensive mass deportations, and deregulate the financial industry. Hillary Clinton’s extensive policy plans are effectively the opposite of Trump’s. Many are puzzled that a candidate with such generally unpopular policy plans and who has been endorsed by the KKK could be supported by over 40% of Americans and have a chance at winning the presidency of the United States. Unfortunately we seem to have entered a post-truth era in which facts simply don’t matter.  The two American political parties have become so different that swing voters have virtually gone extinct and most conservatives would vote for Mister Ed, were he the Republican Party nominee. Political ideology trumps facts, truth, and reality. And Trump’s support comes heavily from a single demographic: white men, mostly older and without a college degree. The Trump campaign slogan “Make America Great Again” suggests that he wants to return the country to some bygone era. Based on the candidate’s words and his supporters’ feelings about science, women, and minorities, that era resembles the 1950s. In the 1950s, only about one-third of women participated in the American work force, and African-Americans were still fighting for equality in the Civil Rights Movement. The tobacco industry created the playbook followed by the fossil fuel industry today: spread misinformation and sow doubt to keep the public consuming its deadly products. Nearly half of Americans smoked cigarettes in the 1950s (as compared to under 17% today). The tobacco industry already knew that smoking caused cancer, but used the denial playbook to keep Americans puffing. These characteristics fit the era that Trump and his supporters appear to yearn for – an era in which white men dominated American society. Older, white male Americans who comprise the core of Donald Trump’s base are also the predominant climate science-denying group in the country. Social scientists theorize this is due to the group’s historical societal advantages. They have benefited from the societal status quo, and hence are least concerned with risks, especially when addressing those risks would mean changing the status quo from which they benefited. White, male Americans are in the process of losing those historical societal advantages. As minority populations grow, they’re losing their grip on the American majority. The first racial minority president was elected and re-elected. Women are approaching even footing with men in the labor force. Even social norms are changing, for example with gay marriage becoming legal. And of course the Earth’s climate itself is changing rapidly due to human-caused global warming, which is causing all sorts of negative consequences. Climate scientists are pleading with American voters not to make a choice our children will regret: You have a fateful choice to make. The policies of candidates and parties on climate change could hardly be more different. Hillary Clinton would continue to work with the international community to tackle the global warming crisis and help the transition to modern clean and renewable energies. Donald Trump denies that the problem even exists and has promised to go back to coal and to undo the Paris Agreement Donald Trump would be the only world leader to deny human-caused global warming and the tremendous risks it poses. His threats to undo the progress made to tackle climate change have elicited widespread condemnation from the international community, most recently from the Chinese government. When asked how his country would work with a Trump administration on climate change, China’s climate negotiator Xie Zhenhua said: If they resist this trend, I don’t think they’ll win the support of their people, and their country’s economic and social progress will also be affected. I believe a wise political leader should take policy stances that conform with global trends Donald Trump’s goal is to make America Mad Men again by reversing the progress we’ve made over the past half century and returning the country to a 1950s era-style society dominated by white men. While progress toward racial and gender equality could hypothetically be reversed in a Trump presidency, climate change can’t be. Only by continuing the progress we’ve made toward cutting carbon pollution can we slow global warming. Problems are not solved by denying their existence. America has many great characteristics; many argue the country is already great. But like every country, there are also dark periods in its past; for example, in the treatment of minorities and women as second-class citizens. Donald Trump aims to return America to those deplorable periods, and to put the world on a path toward a catastrophic future by undoing the progress we’ve made in tackling climate change. The world is counting on Americans not to make a catastrophically wrong choice in tomorrow’s election."
"A lot has happened since Nicholas Stern, then a permanent secretary at the Treasury, produced his landmark review of the impact of climate change 10 years ago. His work was quickly recognised as the definitive account of the economic dangers posed to the planet by global warming. Since then, global temperatures have risen to record levels. Arctic summer sea ice has continued to shrink, as have many major land-based ice sheets. Carbon dioxide is being pumped into the atmosphere in ever-increasing amounts. At the same time, low-lying coastal areas, such as south Florida and parts of Bangladesh, are experiencing more and more flooding as sea levels have risen. Scientists have begun to link extreme weather events to the planet’s changing climate, while animal and plant species are gradualling moving towards the poles. So, a decade on, is Stern plunged in despair over our prospects? Not quite. While the picture is certainly grim, the world’s top climate economist still believes there are grounds for modest optimism.  “We have been too slow in acting on climate change,” he told the Observer. “In particular, we have delayed the curbing of greenhouse gas emissions for far too long. When we published our review, emissions were equivalent to the pumping of 40-41bn tonnes of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere a year. Today there are around 50bn tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent. At the same time, science is telling us that impacts of global warming – like ice sheet and glacier melting – are now happening much more quickly than we anticipated.” In his report, published in October 2006, Stern warned that the cost of inaction would be far greater for future generations than the costs of actions taken today. “With hindsight, I now realise that I underestimated the risks. I should have been much stronger in what I said in the report about the costs of inaction. I underplayed the dangers.” These are stark remarks. Yet the dramatic success of the Paris climate talks last year, and their subsequent rapid ratification by more than 90 countries, has provided the 70-year-old economist with a sense of hope: “It has taken only 11 months to get the Paris agreement ratified. It took eight years to get its predecessor, the Kyoto protocol, into force. So in a sense, the last 12 months have been encouraging.” In his review, Stern made a cogent case for the need to make drastic reductions in fossil fuel burning to curb emissions of carbon dioxide, which are heating our atmosphere dangerously. The costs involved – in investing in the development of alternative energy sources, for example – would be far outweighed by the costs of coping with an overheated world afflicted by flooding, soaring temperatures, ruined crops and farmland, lack of food and displaced people, he argued. Most experts responded positively to the review. Yet the world is still burning more and more fossil fuel and pumping more and more carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. This has both long- and short-term consequences. “Apart from raising carbon levels and temperatures, burning fossil fuels causes air pollution, as we have learned over the past five years,” says Stern. “The consequences are terrible. Air pollution kills more than 30,000 people a year in Britain. That is about one in 2,000 of the population. It has become one of the very big killers around the world. In China, it causes about 4,000 deaths a day. “We are killing millions every year from air pollution produced by burning fossil fuels. Yes, there are other sources of air pollution but burning fossil fuels is a large part of the story. That understanding is new and very important.” As a counterbalance, Stern points to the fact that in recent years there has been an encouraging increase in the use of sustainable technologies that should help us to wean us of our fossil fuel dependency. Cities like Barcelona and Bogotá have made themselves cleaner and healthier. Coal burning has peaked in China. Hybrid cars and electric vehicles are being sold in increasing numbers and the cost of making solar panels has been reduced by a factor of 20. “We have reached the point where we can now see that the alternative route is not really something that should be regarded as a cost. It is actually a much better way of doing things, even if you had never heard of climate change,” says Stern. But the message has taken too long to sink in, and as result we are approaching a crunch point, he argues. In the next 20 years, as economies across the globe expand, the planet is likely to build infrastructure – roads, buildings, ports and airports – that will more than double what already exists. The crucial issue is the nature of that infrastructure. “If it is dirty and high carbon, it will lock us into that technology for a long time. We will be sentenced to live in cities where we cannot breath or move or be productive. If we do it using sustainable technology, however, we could have an extremely attractive future where you have strong growth, poverty is reduced, cities are cleaner and forests are saved. People have not sufficiently understood the importance of the next 20 years. They are going to be the most decisive two decades in human history.” Last year’s Paris climate deal suggests there is a will to avoid the worst and there is a prospect of further strong agreements being reached at this month’s talks in Marrakech. India, China and the US have all made positive noises. Hillary Clinton is a firm supporter of climate change initiatives – but what if Donald Trump is elected president? This is a man who has claimed the concept of global warming was created “by and for the Chinese in order to make US manufacturing noncompetitive” and who has pledged to tear up the Paris agreement. Stern’s response is diplomatic: “It would make things very much more difficult,” he says. Closer to home, Stern says he is confident the government understands the importance of adhering to its commitments to reduce UK carbon emissions by at least 80% by 2050 – despite the “policy wobbles” of the previous administration. David Cameron pledged his would be the greenest government ever but ended up cutting support for solar panels on homes, killing the Green Deal to help people insulate old homes, scrapping green building standards for new homes and cutting support for industrial solar projects. “To behave in an unpredictable way, as the government did last year, is to be really damaging to investment,” says Stern. “That is why it was worrying. But I am hopeful, though I cannot be sure, that the new administration will take a more balanced and predictable approach. It should certainly be at the core of the new government’s industrial strategy and I will be looking for hints of that in the chancellor’s autumn statement.” The proposed new runway for Heathrow is a more complex issue, however. Analysis suggests the country could just about deal with the extra emissions produced by the additional planes, and still cut its carbon emissions by 80% by 2050 – if there is a major improvement in aviation technology. This would involve developing more efficient engines, better biofuels and lighter planes. “However, that commitment to reduce emissions by 80% was made in order to hold global temperature rises to 2C. The Paris climate deal suggested we should be more ambitious and go for a 1.5C limit. That means that if the UK’s targets are altered – as I believe they should be – to reflect the Paris agreement, there is now a question about whether we can have that extra runway and the extra carbon emissions it will generate. We need to check again if it is manageable,” adds Stern. The Paris agreement remains central to Stern’s sense of cautious optimism. “It was the honesty of the delegates’ awareness of the nature of the problem and the speed of the agreement’s ratification that has given me most hope. We have a lot to do to limit carbon emissions to an effective level. I am confident that it is possible to achieve that, though I cannot say that I am confident it will happen.”"
"In July, UN Secretary Ban Ki-Moon highlighted the role of hydropower in boosting the use of renewable energy globally, when he visited a nonprofit institute in China that helps emerging nations develop and build hydropower plants. Many countries consider hydroelectricity a clean source of power because it doesn’t involve burning dirty fossil fuels. But that’s far from true. Hydropower is a significant source of greenhouse gas emissions: a new study shows that the world’s hydroelectric dams are responsible for as much methane emissions as Canada. The study from Washington State University finds that methane, which is at least 34 times more potent than another greenhouse gas, carbon dioxide, makes up 80% of the emissions from water storage reservoirs created by dams. What’s more, none of these emissions are currently included in global greenhouse gas inventories. These are already revealing a worrisome future in which rising global temperatures will likely cause environmental changes such as rising sea levels and stronger hurricanes, which could uproot communities and intensify competition for food and other resources.  “I think this study shows that dams as a source of energy aren’t without their greenhouse gas costs,” says Bridget Deemer, a research ecologist at the US Geologic Survey, who led the study during her prior position as a research associate at Washington State. “Even though it’s a renewable source of energy, people should keep the greenhouse gas side of the picture in mind when making planning and policy decisions regarding dams.” The research, which examines 100 recent studies on greenhouse gas emissions from 267 large reservoirs around the world, also calls into question the wisdom of building more hydroelectric dams as countries try to nix their dependence on coal, natural gas and oil. An estimated 3,700 new dams are proposed or under construction around the globe, the study reports. It suggests the hydropower industry will need to control its emissions. But industry officials in the US say the study misrepresents the benefit of hydropower in the fight to rein in global warming. “Singling out hydropower is irresponsible and inaccurate, to say the least,” says LeRoy Coleman, a spokesman for the National Hydropower Association, based in Washington DC. “Hydropower is needed to meet federal and state clean energy goals.” Hydropower represents 6% of all energy generation in America, according to the US Energy Information Administration. For newly built power plants, hydropower’s total cost of construction and operation runs about $68 per megawat-hour, which is comparable to solar, slightly more expensive than wind, and cheaper than coal and natural gas when those sources incorporate technology to capture carbon emissions. Hydropower is often considered a source of renewable electricity because its fuel, water, is constantly replenished by nature. By that standard, hydropower produces 52% of all renewable electricity in the US, according to the National Hydropower Association. Only 3% of reservoirs in the US are equipped to produce hydropower, Coleman says. Others are limited to water storage and flood protection duties, and some of them are good candidates for electricity generation, he adds. “The responsible and logical approach would be to capture the energy potential of these reservoirs and combat climate change by installing hydropower equipment,” Coleman says. As recently as a decade ago, little was known about emissions from water storage reservoirs. But understanding has evolved rapidly. For instance, researchers initially thought shallow reservoirs in tropical regions were the largest emitters because their stored water was more prone to heating up, which could fuel greenhouse gas production. But analysis by Deemer and her colleagues shows that the latitude and depth of water are not leading factors. Instead, “biological activities” in a reservoir – such as decaying vegetation and nutrient runoff from watersheds upstream – are more important indicators of greenhouse gas emissions. The nutrient runoff can be from natural processes or from farming, logging and land development. Using data from the 267 reservoirs, the authors estimate total emissions from all reservoirs worldwide and conclude that those water storage facilities account for 1.3% of all manmade greenhouse gas emissions. Another new study published by the journal PLOS One reaches similar conclusions, although it finds carbon dioxide to be a bigger share of emissions than methane. After examining data from more than 1,400 dams worldwide, it identifies the rate of soil erosion into a reservoir as a leading predictor of carbon dioxide emissions. Led by Laura Scherer, a research associate at the Swiss university ETH Zurich, that study concludes the “carbon footprint of hydropower is far higher than previously assumed”. “These are massive emissions, and we can’t ignore that,” says Kate Horner, executive director of the environmental group International Rivers, based in Berkeley, California. “There are a massive number of dams that are currently proposed to be built. It would be a grave mistake to continue to finance those with the impression that they were part of the solution to the climate crisis.” Coleman contends that it’s premature to use data from these studies to criticize hydropower because the science remains uncertain. It is challenging to measure reservoir emissions because so many factors can play a role, Deemer acknowledges. The scientific community also doesn’t follow a standard practice for counting emissions, even though the International Hydropower Association and the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organisation (Unesco) published a set of guidelines in 2010. Emissions vary according to a wide variety of factors, including water and air temperatures, season and time of day, vegetation and soil types in both the reservoir and the upstream watershed, and watershed management practices. Hydropower dams constantly manipulate water levels to make electricity, a process that also affects the amount of emissions that make their way into the atmosphere from the reservoir. As water levels decline, the hydrostatic pressure on submerged soils also lowers and allows gas bubbles to escape. Sometimes the methane in these bubbles is absorbed by the water column and never reaches the surface. Other times it makes the great escape into the air. Deemer and her colleagues note that many studies don’t sample emissions thoroughly enough both across reservoir surface area and over time. As a result, she says, the emissions estimates in her study are probably low. The challenge in measuring emissions also makes it difficult to figure out how to reduce them. Researchers speculate it may be possible to reduce emissions by managing water levels in a reservoir differently. This, however, could affect electricity generation, fishery and flood protection, and other operations. Protecting watersheds to reduce erosion into reservoirs could also reduce emissions as well as improve water quality, forest health and aquatic habitat. Global greenhouse gas inventories currently do not include emissions from reservoirs at all, but that is changing. At an October meeting in Bangkok, a committee of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change took a first step by agreeing to include reservoirs, which it categorizes as “flooded lands”, in an updated guidance document that instructs nations on accounting for their greenhouse gas emissions. But it may be several more years until that document is formally approved. The US government does not account for reservoir emissions in its own greenhouse gas inventory. The country is dotted with roughly 79,000 dams, including more than 2,200 private and public hydropower plants. The US Bureau of Reclamation, for example, manages 337 reservoirs, and a science advisor to the agency, Dave Raff, says the bureau is taking on the emissions accounting task. “We’re engaged in trying to understand what the different mechanisms are for reservoirs as they generate these greenhouse gases,” Raff says. “And ultimately, what are the management levers we have to pull that could mitigate those. I do think we feel a sense of urgency to be on that path.”"
"Australia’s lack of progress on climate change policy is increasingly at odds with global momentum and risks leaving Australia’s economy behind, according to a new report. The Climate Institute has released a report called “COP 22 – Getting to Zero” in the lead-up to an international climate conference next week.  World leaders are meeting in Marrakech, Morocco, from 7 to 14 November to decide the global rules towards achieving net zero emissions. The goal was set in train by the Paris agreement in December, which produced commitments for all countries to achieve net zero greenhouse gas emissions, to limit global warming to 1.5C to 2C. Australia is heading to the meeting in Morocco without having ratified the Paris agreement, which comes into force on Friday. But Guardian Australia understands the Turnbull government is likely to ratify it by the end of next week. If that occurs, it means Australia will have ratified it before the international meeting ends, allowing it to formally take part in the decision-making process at the meeting. The Climate Institute’s chief executive, John Connor, said Australia needed to drop the culture wars on climate change so it could take part meaningfully in the global movement to reduce emissions. “The Australian government will be in the spotlight in Marrakech and will need to step up efforts to help achieve commitments central to the Paris agreement,” Connor said. “Domestic action hasn’t kept pace with unprecedented global momentum in clean energy and emissions reduction. The 2030 target Australia set itself in August 2015 is not consistent with the Paris objectives. Nor is our emission reduction policy framework. These weaknesses leave Australia exposed,” he said.  “At a minimum Australia needs to ratify the Paris agreement, release its 2030 emission projections and incorporate achieving net zero emissions into domestic policy processes, like Coag energy reviews and the upcoming 2017 climate policy review.” Connor said the speed with which the Paris agreement had come into force had caught the global community by surprise, including Australia. He said the long-term implications of what the agreement was meant to achieve had not yet sunk into Australia’s mainstream political discourse, or into domestic policy making. But other countries had acted quickly in the past 12 months to pursue long-term emissions reductions targets, he said. The UK has agreed to reduce emissions by 57% by 2030 and the Canadian government is imposing a nationwide carbon price floor.  In August 2015, he said, Australia put forward an initial target of a 26% to 28% reduction in emissions, below 2005 levels, by 2030, but if other countries followed that example it would lead to warming of 3C to 4C above pre-industrial levels. He said in a “landmark” paper published last month, BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager, had advised investors to incorporate climate change risks into their portfolios. On Thursday the New South Wales government said it had set an objective to achieve net zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050. Connor said the state’s premier, Mike Baird, and his government should be congratulated. “Because of the federal vacuum, we seeing state governments realising that it’s in their long-term interests to have good renewable energy in their jurisdictions,” he said. "
"In Vladimir Nabokov’s novel The Gift, published in 1952, a character called Shchyogolev holds forth about world affairs: “France was AFRAID of something or other and therefore would never ALLOW it … Someone was PLOTTING and someone was STRIVING for something.” Such speculations defined the then new field of international relations. Positing realpolitik as a sphere separate from that of domestic politics, the field had emerged as a distinct study in the early 20th century from white supremacist fears about rising competitors (its most prestigious periodical in the Anglosphere today, Foreign Affairs, originated in the Journal of Race Development). Writing in the 1930s, Nabokov intuited how the typical practitioner of international relations would reduce internally complex and diverse countries to a standoff between “faceless and abstract bullies”: “the more brains, cunning and circumspection he found in their mutual activities, the more stupid, vulgar and simple his world became”.  Two superpowers threatening the planet with total annihilation did actually make the world seem simple (and, often, stupid and vulgar): it’s no accident that the speculations of international relations were exalted into an academic discipline in the US during the cold war. The discipline now has a degree of theoretical sophistication and intellectual respectability, but crude empiricists continue to flourish in the intellectual-industrial complex – thinktanks, foundations, research institutes: Shchyogolev is incarnated today by the columnist for whom some country or other is always rising or falling. A commentariat unable to analyse political economy and able to see international politics only at the level of faceless bullies was intellectually neutered from the start. Devoted, above all, to legitimising their own existence, the cold warriors in the media routinely exaggerated the Soviet Union’s military and economic capabilities, and the threat from communism. Even in the mid-80s, few of them noticed that the evil empire was near collapse. After 1991, many rushed to hail the new “unipolar” world where America was the “indispensable nation”. Some settled into a vigil for liberal democracy worldwide, believing that it would be eventually ushered in by capitalism, and end history altogether. Fervently promoting free markets in Russia, the pundits failed to foresee the country’s descent into gangster capitalism. Globalisation, they sang almost in chorus, is “lifting” hundreds of millions of people in India and China out of poverty, without anticipating that these numerous beneficiaries might get trapped in the limbo of frustrated ambition and rage where strongmen thrive. Hardly any of those who hailed the flattening of the world by consumer capitalism paid attention to the simple but devastating fact that, as the novelist Amitav Ghosh writes in his new book The Great Derangement, “the patterns of life that modernity engenders can only be practised by a small minority of the world’s population”. This fatal indifference can be blamed on the peculiar ideological and professional commitments of globalisation’s cheerleaders. An academic study recently revealed that the toxic haze that spread across south-east Asia from Indonesian forest fires last year caused the deaths of about 100,000 people; this periodic smog is only one of the many social, political and environmental disasters routinely suffered by billions of Asians. Yet in his new book Easternisation, which chronicles the economic potency and the diplomatic and military posturing of Asian elites, the Financial Times columnist Gideon Rachman, standing on the roof of Singapore’s flashiest hotel, can only see a busy port through the “morning haze” – and other awesome evidence – of “globalisation in action”. The Czech writer Václav Havel, writing from a communist prison, once marvelled at “the extent to which so many westerners are addicted to ideology, much more than we who live in a system which is ideological through and through”. Today, there are few prominent Anglo-American columnists on foreign affairs whose worldview was not decisively shaped by the Reagan and Thatcher revolutions, or their Clintonite and Blairite legacies. Indeed, as Washington’s (and New York-London’s) consensus hardened, many journalists and commentators joined politicians in floating free of traditional allegiances to region, nation and democratic institutions. The much-derided Thomas Friedman is merely the most egregious among many syndicated Shchyogolevs, who were more likely to be found hanging out with CEOs and hedge-funders at Davos, or with FT and Economist-reading technocrats in Seoul and Delhi, than reporting on non-unionised labour in Guangzhou and Dhaka. The conceits and complacencies of this glamorous new transnational class were legitimised by the technocratic-managerial revolution: the fact that, as Ghosh writes, “the countries of the west are now in many senses ‘post-political spaces’ that are managed by apparatuses of various kinds”. Massive earthquakes in their own backyard, such as Brexit and Trumpism, have now cruelly exposed many “opinion-makers”, as Pope Francis calls them in his encyclical on climate change, to be nearly as complicit as politicians, bankers and corporates in acts of concealment and even deception. “Twenty years of good times and global economic integration,” Rachman wrote in 2010, “created a ‘win-win world’, which ensured that all the major powers had reason to be satisfied.” To the inevitable questions – who exactly are the winners, and how do you know that “they” are satisfied? – Rachman had an answer that in our age of revolt against globalised elites can only seem audacious: the “creation”, he said, “of a Davos mentality – by which I mean that you could get leaders from China, the US, western Europe and India to all show up at the same meeting and to a significant extent they would be talking the same language.” Easternisation is also fuelled by the belief that insights into our present and future are guaranteed by constant proximity to the 1% of the 1%, who all talk the same language. As the financial crisis erupted, Rachman “sat down in Milan”, he tells us, “with Carlo De Benedetti … one of Italy’s leading industrialists through much of the postwar period”. Indeed, Easternisation opens with a private audience with Xi Jinping, and, after recording many such intimacies with the uber-powerful, ends by hailing the World Economic Forum as “hugely useful”. It should be noted that Rachman is one of the few sensible pundits in the Anglo-American establishment. Certainly, he has no truck with unrepentant neocons across the Atlantic. To these exponents of western supremacism, the possibility of decline remains incomprehensible, or too painful to accept; they still fantasise about America becoming great again by assuming, in Robert Kagan’s words, the “leadership of a united democratic bloc” against the many bullies out there. To his credit, Rachman recognises that not even Kim Jong-un, let alone Vladimir Putin, will start quivering at the prospect of a new concert of democracies. In Easternisation, however, he falls victim to what Orwell once called a “major mental disease” afflicting public intellectuals: “the instinct to bow down” before anyone who appears to be powerful. In 2003, the year of shock-and-awe in Iraq, Fareed Zakaria voiced a general consensus among the Anglosphere’s sages when he wrote that “America’s dominance now seems self-evident”. Just three years later, a “post-American world” had suddenly dawned as America struggled against insurgencies in both Iraq and Afghanistan, China suddenly appeared to be rising, and even India had metamorphosed, as Foreign Affairs announced, into a “roaring capitalist success story”. The imperative to worship power made it inevitable that the spine-stiffening tale of westernisation would give way to a stirring new fable of easternisation. Rachman brings to the latter myth, already much-faded, the naive fervour of the recent convert. “The economic development that allows China and India to push for great-power status has already happened,” he claims. The empowering of a toxic political movement in India that reveres Gandhi’s assassins and threatens to demolish India’s pluralist traditions and democratic institutions does make him slightly uneasy. Nevertheless, the country’s new leader is pushing for the economic reforms that foreign investors crave, and so in Rachman’s wary formulation, it is Modi’s “leftwing critics” who “accuse [him] of ‘xenophobic nationalism’”. The adjective “leftwing” is of course a trigger warning among Davos men, and code for deluded losers. Presumably, Rachman has to protect the fantasy, much loved by financial elites, that India might “be at the fulcrum of global economic development”. How such “progress” changes the global environment is revealed, along with other true faces of easternisation, by Ghosh in his short but broad-ranging and consistently stimulating indictment of our era of the “great derangement”. It has been a time, he writes, when “most forms of art and literature were drawn into the modes of concealment that prevented people from recognising the realities of their plight”. Ghosh details the original damage inflicted by the west’s carbon-fuelled modes of economic and political imperialism. But it was, he adds, the “expanding industrialisation of Asia’s most populous nations, beginning in the 1980s, that brought the climate crisis to a head”. China’s carbon emissions per head of population have now surpassed the EU’s; India is not far behind. Briskly, Ghosh outlines the devastating consequences: the loss in India of “some of the country’s most fertile lands”; the disappearance of “many of the subcontinent’s low-lying islands, like the Lakshadweep chain”; the “migration of up to 50 million people in India and 75 million in Bangladesh”; not to mention that “if the glaciers continue to shrink at the present rate, the most populous parts of Asia will face catastrophic water shortages within a decade or two”. Unlike many Panglosses of globalisation, who generalise from their own experience of rapid social mobility, Ghosh is keenly self-aware. He, too, started out as a writer in the late 80s, in a “breathtakingly exciting time”; but for him Asia’s history proves that “the universalist premise of industrial civilisation” cherished by politicians and commentators is “a hoax”. Describing the “broader imaginative and cultural failure that lies at the heart of the climate crisis”, Ghosh is most critical, in the way few journalists are, of the basic assumptions of his own vocation. Imaginative writing, as he sees it, has also failed to grasp the perilous new human condition, inhibited by its founding devotion to bourgeois orderliness, and scorn for the improbable. In Ghosh’s view of literary fiction, “the very gestures with which it conjures up reality are actually a concealment of the real”. Ghosh’s account of literary omissions can occasionally feel selective. The German Romantics protested eloquently against the despoiling of the natural world right at the beginning of the modern era; the counter-tradition inaugurated by them has informed much modern literature. He doesn’t linger long enough on the technical difficulties of incorporating climate change into artistic practice, or whether many novelists haven’t already described its consequences, such as civil war and ethnic cleansing. But his indictment of a complacent avant gardism in the arts is original and subtle. And he is of course right to assert that the era of the Anthropocene “presents a challenge not only to the arts and humanities, but also to our commonsense understandings and beyond that to contemporary culture in general”. A few writers, journalists and academics have already stepped up to this challenge: for instance, a book such as David Blackbourn’s 2006 The Conquest of Nature: Water, Landscape, and the Making of Modern Germany suggests one way in which the discipline of history can renew itself. But a whole new intellectual culture is needed to effect the shift from shattered assumptions of continuous progress to a mode of thinking that assumes, with the minimum of melodrama, that human violence has finally escaped its millennia-old cultural, social, political and geographic constraints, and now threatens to destroy the planet itself. Gnostic sects in the past, and fundamentalists in the present, were prone to warn that the end of time is near. But belief in the apocalypse is now widespread, and with good reason. The two ways in which humankind can self-destruct – civil war on a global scale, or destruction of the natural environment necessary to its survival – have rapidly converged. Today, global warming manifests itself in not just a rise in the level of the oceans, the increasing frequency of extreme weather events, the emptying of fish stocks or the desertification of entire regions on the planet. It can also be seen at work in violent conflict in Tunisia, Egypt, Libya, Mali, Syria and many other places exposed to food price rises, drought and declining water sources. Water shortages sparked riots in Bangalore, India’s hi-tech capital, in September. Africans, Bangladeshis and black residents of the Mississippi delta have long been the victims of the extravagant use of fossil fuels by rich consumers, corporations and governments. The large-scale flight of refugees and migrants from damaged areas, which has already caused wars in Asia and Africa, is now provoking political turmoil in the heart of Europe. It is as though a vengeful Earth is mocking, in Ghosh’s words, the “Cartesian dualism that arrogates all intelligence and agency to the human while denying them to every other kind of being”. Ghosh is sceptical of recent climate change agreements; investing hope and initiative in figures of religious authority such as Pope Francis, he seems to echo Martin Heidegger’s warning: “Only a god can save us now.” But then his book is not prescriptive so much as a bold meditation on ethical and cognitive failure and an impassioned call to think the unthinkable in our new geological age of the Anthropocene. Western ideologues, as Havel pointed out, missed the real significance of the discrediting of communism in 1989, which was that “the era of arrogant, absolutist reason is drawing to a close”. That era has now finally ended with the discrediting of neoliberal capitalism, and The Great Derangement is a bracing reminder that there is no more vital task for writers and artists than to clear the intellectual dead wood of a vulgarly boosterish age and create space for apocalyptic thinking – which may at least delay, if not avert, the catastrophes ahead. • This article was amended on 3 November.

"Global carbon emissions from burning fossil fuels have seen “almost no growth” for a third consecutive year, according to figures released as world leaders begin to arrive in Marrakech for a UN climate summit.  After zero growth in emissions last year, researchers at the University of East Anglia (UEA) have forecast a rise of just 0.2% for 2016, signalling a break from the average 2.3% year-on-year increases in CO2 output from fossil fuels until 2013. The rise in 2014 was 0.7%. Growth in emissions has stalled despite global economic growth exceeding 3% a year, and is mainly down to China burning less coal, according to a study in the journal Earth System Science Data.  “This third year of almost no growth in emissions is unprecedented at a time of strong economic growth,” said Professor Corinne Le Quéré, the director of UEA’s Tyndall Centre and lead on the global carbon budget analysis. “This is a great help for tackling climate change but it is not enough. Global emissions now need to decrease rapidly, not just stop growing.” The levelling of fossil-fuel emissions dovetails with the government pledges made at the Paris climate summit last year to limit global temperature rises, but still falls short of the actions needed to contain global warming to the UN target of “well below 2C”. “If climate negotiators in Marrakech can build momentum for further cuts in emissions, we could be making a serious start to addressing climate change,” Le Quéré said.  Several countries are expected to announce new emissions curbs at the Marrakech summit, although off-floor discussion will be dominated by last week’s US election, won by climate-change sceptic Donald Trump.  It's a climate change accord agreed by nearly 200 countries in December 2015, which came into force on 4 November 2016. The agreement commits world leaders to keeping global warming below 2C, seen as the threshold for safety by scientists, and pursuing a tougher target of 1.5C. The carbon emission curbs put forward by countries under Paris are not legally-binding but the framework of the accord, which includes a mechanism for periodically cranking those pledges up, is binding. The agreement also has a long-term goal for net zero emissions which would effectively phase out fossil fuels.    Trump has disparaged global warming as a Chinese hoax and promised to withdraw the US from the Paris agreement, although that pledge was removed from his official website on Thursday.  The US is the world’s second biggest emitter, responsible for around 16% of the greenhouse gases pumped into the world’s atmosphere.  Climate funding will certainly be another. The US has so far only delivered $500m of a promised $3bn contribution to the Green Climate Fund, which aims to disburse $100bn a year to help poorer countries deal with global warming by 2020.  The EU is the largest contributor to the fund, donating €17.6bn last year, but it is unclear whether it will move to fill any funding shortfall. “It is far too early to say whether there is a possibility, a capacity or the will to step up our climate finance commitment as the ministers have not yet had the chance to discuss this following the US election,” an EU source said.  Much of the official COP22 agenda will be focused on agreeing a rule book to implement the Paris deal. This will have to deal with technical issues such as setting common baselines and methodologies to measure emissions cuts.   Despite the tailing off of emissions growth in polluting industries, atmospheric concentrations of CO2 hit a record high in 2015 and are on track to continue doing so every year until emissions hit near zero.  The Paris agreement itself puts the world on track for a potentially disastrous 3C of global warming, but it also offers hope that this course can be changed by a series of reviews beginning in 2018. Under the Paris agreement, all governments that have ratified the accord, which includes the US, China, India and the EU, carry an obligation to hold global warming to no more than 2C above pre-industrial levels. That is what scientists regard as the limit of safety, beyond which climate change is likely to become catastrophic and irreversible.  Stock-takes based on the latest scientific assessments should follow every five years – with the first scheduled for 2023 – offering a chance for the world to adjust its trajectory towards the agreement’s 1.5C goal.  Liz Gallagher, a senior associate at an environmental thinktank, E3G, said: “The best thing that can come out of this summit would be making 2018 a moment on the map. We need to start the next round of ‘ratcheting up’ and we need to come out of this COP with a demonstration that the process is inevitable and unstoppable and that we are winning, as a message to the likes of Trump.”  Bob Ward, a director at the Economic and Social Research Council’s centre for climate change economics and policy said that while global fossil fuel emissions appeared to have peaked “Donald Trump as president could undermine this achievement if he carries through with his threat to scrap the Obama administration’s clean power plan, and encourages an increase in the use of coal for electricity generation”.  According to the UAE research, China, which is the world’s biggest polluter, accounting for 29% of global carbon dioxide output, saw emissions fall 0.7% in 2015 and they are projected to drop another 0.5% in 2016, though the scientists warn of large uncertainties in the figures. In the US emissions fell 2.6% in 2015 as the country reduced its coal use while increasing gas and oil consumption, and carbon dioxide is expected to fall 1.7% this year.  But the European Union’s emissions rose 1.4% in 2015, against a backdrop of long term declines in pollution, while another major emitter, India, saw emissions rise 5.2%.

"Canada’s attempt to act on climate change is being undermined by $3.3bn in government subsidies flowing to oil and gas producers in the country a year, a new report has warned. The prime minister, Justin Trudeau, has vowed to place a national price on carbon dioxide emissions by 2018. Last week, Trudeau said he would not be deterred by the election as US president of Donald Trump, who has called climate change a “hoax”, and would forge ahead with the plan to “show leadership that quite frankly the entire world is looking for”.  But a study by four major Canadian environmental groups has shown that carbon pricing risks being undermined by billions of dollars in subsidies to fossil fuel interests, from both federal and provincial governments. The $3.3bn annual subsidy, made up of extraction incentives and research and development, amounts to paying polluters $19 for each tonne of carbon dioxide they emit, according to the green groups. This would conflict, they say, with the planned carbon price, which will ramp up to $50 a tonne by 2022. “This system is like taxing consumers when they buy cigarettes while giving massive tax breaks to tobacco companies that encourage them to produce more cigarettes. It doesn’t make sense,” said Alex Doukas of Oil Change International. Dale Marshall of Environmental Defense added: “Unless Canada phases out massive subsidies to oil and gas companies, Trudeau’s carbon price will do little to encourage polluters to cut carbon emissions. The $3bn in annual subsidies could be put to much better use by investing in climate action, healthcare or other initiatives.” G20 countries, including Canada, agreed to phase out fossil fuel subsidies in 2009. However, the burning of oil, gas and coal is still supported across the world by subsidies amounting to $5.3tn a year, equivalent to $10m a minute every day, according to the International Monetary Fund. This huge sum, greater than the total health spending of all the world’s governments, comprises direct subsidies and financial support as well as the externalized cost that people pay for fossil fuels in terms of air pollution and extreme weather driven by climate change. Trudeau has emerged as a vocal proponent of action on climate change and found significant common ground on the issue with Barack Obama. He has said that Canada’s efforts to stave off the worst effects of climate change “will not cease”. However, he has been attacked by environmentalists for not raising Canada’s emissions reduction goal and for approving a controversial $27bn liquified natural gas project in British Columbia. The opposition Conservatives, meanwhile, have called a national carbon price plan “complete insanity” and a “sledgehammer” to the Canadian economy."
"Donald Trump’s astonishing victory in the US presidential election has made one thing abundantly clear: too many Americans – particularly white male Americans – feel left behind. It is not just a feeling, it can be seen in the data no less clearly than in their anger. And, as I have argued repeatedly, an economic system that doesn’t deliver for large parts of the population is a failed economic system. So what should President-elect Trump do about it? Over the past third of a century, the rules of America’s economic system have been rewritten in ways that serve a few at the top, while harming the economy as a whole, and especially the bottom 80%. The irony of Trump’s victory is that it was the Republican party he now leads that pushed for extreme globalisation and against the policy frameworks that would have mitigated the trauma associated with it. But history matters: China and India are now integrated into the global economy. Besides, technology has been advancing so fast that the number of jobs globally in manufacturing is declining.  The implication is that there is no way Trump can bring a significant number of well-paying manufacturing jobs back to the US. He can bring manufacturing back, through advanced manufacturing, but there will be few jobs. And he can bring jobs back, but they will be low-wage jobs, not the high-paying ones of the 1950s. If Trump is serious about tackling inequality, he must rewrite the rules yet again, in a way that serves all of society, not just people like him. The first order of business is to bolster investment, thereby restoring robust long-term growth. Specifically, Trump should emphasise spending on infrastructure and research. Shockingly for a country whose economic success is based on technological innovation, the GDP share of investment in basic research is lower today than it was a half-century ago. Improved infrastructure would enhance the returns from private investment, which has been lagging as well. Ensuring greater financial access for small and medium-size enterprises, including those headed by women, would also stimulate private investment. A carbon tax would provide a welfare trifecta: higher growth as firms retrofit to reflect the increased costs of carbon dioxide emissions; a cleaner environment; and revenue that could be used to finance infrastructure and direct efforts to narrow America’s economic divide. But, given Trump’s position as a climate change denier, he is unlikely to take advantage of this (which could also induce the world to start imposing tariffs against US products made in ways that violate global climate-change rules). A comprehensive approach is also needed to improve America’s income distribution, which is one of the worst among advanced economies. While Trump has promised to raise the minimum wage, he is unlikely to undertake other critical changes, such as strengthening workers’ collective bargaining rights and negotiating power, and restraining CEO compensation and financialisation. Regulatory reform must move beyond limiting the damage that the financial sector can do and ensure that the sector genuinely serves society. In April, President Barack Obama’s council of economic advisers released a brief showing increasing market concentration in many sectors (pdf). That means less competition and higher prices – as sure a way to lower real incomes as lowering wages directly. The US needs to tackle these concentrations of market power, including the newest manifestations in the so-called sharing economy. America’s regressive tax system – which fuels inequality by helping the rich (but no one else) get richer – must also be reformed. An obvious target should be to eliminate the special treatment of capital gains and dividends. Another is to ensure that companies pay taxes – perhaps by lowering the corporate-tax rate for companies that invest and create jobs in America, and raising it for those that do not. As a major beneficiary of this system, however, Trump’s pledges to pursue policies that benefit ordinary Americans are not credible; as usual with Republicans, tax changes will largely benefit the rich. Trump will probably also fall short on enhancing equality of opportunity. Ensuring preschool education for all and investing more in public schools is essential if the US is to avoid becoming a neo-feudal country where advantages and disadvantages are passed on from one generation to the next. But Trump has been virtually silent on this topic. Restoring shared prosperity would require policies that expand access to affordable housing and medical care, secure retirement with a modicum of dignity, and allow every American, regardless of family wealth, to afford a post-secondary education commensurate with his or her abilities and interests. But while I could see Trump, a real-estate magnate, supporting a massive housing programme (with most of the benefits going to developers like himself), his promised repeal of the Affordable Care Act (Obamacare) would leave millions without health insurance. (Soon after the election, he suggested he may move cautiously in this area.) The problems posed by the disaffected Americans – resulting from decades of neglect – will not be solved quickly or by conventional tools. An effective strategy will need to consider more unconventional solutions, which Republican corporate interests are unlikely to favour. For example, individuals could be allowed to increase their retirement security by putting more money into their social security accounts, with commensurate increases in pension benefits. And comprehensive family and sick leave policies would help Americans achieve a less stressful work-life balance. Likewise, a public option for housing finance could entitle anyone who has paid taxes regularly to a 20% down-payment mortgage, commensurate with their ability to service the debt, at an interest rate slightly higher than that at which the government can borrow and service its own debt. Payments would be channeled through the income-tax system. Much has changed since President Ronald Reagan began hollowing out the middle-class and skewing the benefits of growth to those at the top, and US policies and institutions have not kept pace. From the role of women in the workforce to the rise of the internet to increasing cultural diversity, 21st-century America is fundamentally different from the America of the 1980s. If Trump actually wants to help those who have been left behind, he must go beyond the ideological battles of the past. The agenda I have just sketched is not only about the economy, it is about nurturing a dynamic, open, and just society that fulfils the promise of Americans’ most cherished values. But while it is, in some ways, somewhat consistent with Trump’s campaign promises, in many other ways, it is the antithesis of them. My very cloudy crystal ball shows a rewriting of the rules, but not to correct the grave mistakes of the Reagan revolution, a milestone on the sordid journey that left so many behind. Rather, the new rules will make the situation worse, excluding even more people from the American dream. • Joseph Stiglitz is a nobel prizewinner in economics, university professor at Columbia University, a former senior vice-president and chief economist of the World Bank and chair of the US president’s council of economic advisers under Bill Clinton. © Project Syndicate"

"Hydroelectric dams contribute more to global warming than previously estimated, according to a study published in BioScience. It appears that the current and planned boom of hydroelectric projects would double the current cover of dams in the world and will aggravate the problem.  Researchers found that rotting vegetation in the water means that the dams emit about a billion tonnes of greenhouse gases every year. This represents 1.3% of total annual anthropogenic (human-caused) global emissions. When considered over a 100-year timescale, dams produce more methane than rice plantations and biomass burning, the study showed. “We estimate that dams emit around 25% more methane by unit of surface than previously estimated,” said Bridget Deemer, from the School of Environment at the Washington State University in Vancouver, and lead author of the study. “Methane stays in the atmosphere for only around a decade, while CO2 stays several centuries, but over the course of 20 years methane contributes almost three times more to global warming than CO2, a relevant period for policymakers,” she added. Methane is produced at the bottom of the reservoirs, where oxygen is low and bacteria decompose organic material, like trees and grasses, which is already present or carried by watercourse. Part of the methane becomes CO2; the rest is carried to the surface as bubbles. Analysing more than 250 dams and including bubble-based emissions, the researchers found that dams also emit more methane than lakes and wetlands. Emily Stanley, a professor in liminology and marine science at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, said that the study is “very relevant” because it delivers the best available information about greenhouse gas emissions from dams. It shows that high methane emissions are not linked to the location or antiquity of the reservoirs, as other researchers suggest, but to the quantity of organic material. According to the study, algae that proliferates in downstream dams may receive more nutrients such as nitrogen or phosphate, and therefore produce more methane. Deemer is enthusiastic about the possibilities that this research presents for designing, situating and operating dams that emit fewer gases. The researchers have suggested that the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change consider these methane emissions in future budgets."
"In my native Colombia, the cloud forests of the Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta have been described as holding the most important concentration of threatened wildlife on Earth. These forests are also the ancestral home of the Koguis, an indigenous group now numbering around 10,000 individuals.  In their cosmology, Koguis are the elders of humanity, living in the heart of the world, while outsiders are the “younger brothers” who were banished because of how they abused the land in the past – an accurate description of a planet where 160,000 acres of tropical rainforest are destroyed or damaged every day.  For centuries, the Koguis have strived to care for their land in a way that will preserve it for future generations. If we listen to them and other indigenous peoples, if we respect their rights and honour their traditions, I think we “younger brothers” still have a chance to get it right. At the COP 22 climate conference in Marrakesh this week and last, governments are unveiling plans to meet their emission reduction goals – including switching to lower-carbon energy and transport. But it is imperative that these plans also include the vast, sparsely populated areas that are home to indigenous peoples.  In Latin America, for instance, there are around 40 million indigenous people. Altogether, indigenous and community-owned lands represent around 23% of the region’s total land mass. This is an immense territory, roughly equivalent to the combined surface of India, Pakistan, and Afghanistan.  Much of this land is still covered by forests and grasslands whose preservation is a proven and cost-effective way of reducing emissions. In my experience, there is no better way to ensure the careful stewardship of these assets – whether in the Amazon basin, the Andean highlands or the jungles of Central America – than to give indigenous communities full control over the land.  Indigenous peoples have encyclopaedic knowledge about the landscapes they live in. They also have the strongest possible incentive to ensure the sustainability of those ecosystems. The World Resources Institute conducted a study of 80 forest areas in 10 countries in south Asia, east Africa, and Latin America which found that community-owned and managed forests delivered greater carbon storage, as when local communities have no legal rights, or very few, their forests are more vulnerable to deforestation. Indeed, evidence suggests that strengthening indigenous forest rights is associated with both better communities and healthier forests.  In the past, governments and policymakers tended to undervalue the link between climate change mitigation and indigenous land rights. But the Paris Agreement explicitly recognised this, and some governments – including Bolivia and Guatemala – incorporated such considerations into their Intended Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs).  Of course, land rights are no panacea. Even when they have control, communities need support when deciding how to most effectively use local resources, how to provide a decent livelihood for their people, and how to deal with illegal activities such as clandestine mining and poaching.  Donor nations and development banks must also help to strengthen the institutions responsible for land tenure and expand climate finance options for investments that promote sustainable landscapes.  At the Inter-American Development Bank we are seeing a surge in interest from countries to prioritise infrastructure and land use programmes that will contribute to their NDCs. So we are launching a new initiative, NDC Invest, to offer countries a range of support.    Today, I hope our deeper understanding of the potential impact of indigenous land stewardship will lead to an ambitious inclusion of these communities in the national and global discussions on climate mitigation and adaptation.

"A new way to tackle the much-maligned unpredictability of solar energy is being deployed at a solar farm opening today in Western Australia – cloud-tracking cameras.    The 1MW solar farm at Karratha airport, made possible by a $2.3m grant from the Australian Renewable Energy Agency (Arena), has been fitted with state-of-the-art CloudCAM cloud-tracking technology by Fulcrum3D – a technology also backed by a separate $545,000 Arena grant. Dips in power output from solar farms that occur when clouds pass over leads some solar farms to rely on backup energy storage to smooth out the output. The unpredictability of those dips in output also makes it difficult for the operators to predict prices and can hinder their ability to bid in electricity markets. According to the manufacturers, the cloud-tracking technology allows the solar operators to reliably predict the output of the solar farm 15 minutes ahead of time, meaning they can minimise the reliance on energy storage and can more effectively take part in market bidding. The chief executive of Arena, Ivor Frischknecht, said that the technology “makes solar cheaper and reduces intermittency by giving the operators a clearer picture of the solar resource they can expect in the immediate future”. “Cloud prediction makes solar cheaper and more reliable while reducing the need for batteries,” Frischknecht said. “That’s what makes this project so exciting.” The marriage of two separate Arena-funded projects demonstrated the effectiveness of Arena grants and how they were benefiting regional communities, Frischknecht said. Frischknecht said the Karratha airport solar plant would be a good example, demonstrating why more renewables should be connected to Western Australia’s North West Interconnected System (NWIS). The NWIS supplies electricity to Karratha, Port Headland and Goldsworth, as well as areas inland from there.  “The NWIS is a smaller network that requires renewable energy to meet performance criteria that are geared towards maintaining network stability,” Frischknecht said. “Arena-supported projects like the Karratha airport solar farm and CloudCAM are important for demonstrating to network owner and operator Horizon Power that solar can provide sustainable, reliable power into the NWIS without the need for large amounts of expensive battery storage,” Frischknecht said."
"2016 will very likely be the hottest year on record and a new high for the third year in a row, according to the UN. It means 16 of the 17 hottest years on record will have been this century. The scorching temperatures around the world, and the extreme weather they drive, mean the impacts of climate change on people are coming sooner and with more ferocity than expected, according to scientists. The World Meteorological Organization (WMO) report, published on Monday at the global climate summit in Morocco, found the global temperature in 2016 is running 1.2C above pre-industrial levels. This is perilously close to to the 1.5C target included as an aim of the Paris climate agreement last December. The El Niño weather phenomenon helped push temperatures even higher in early 2016 but the global warming caused by the greenhouse gas emissions from human activities remains the strongest factor. It's a climate change accord agreed by nearly 200 countries in December 2015, which came into force on 4 November 2016. The agreement commits world leaders to keeping global warming below 2C, seen as the threshold for safety by scientists, and pursuing a tougher target of 1.5C. The carbon emission curbs put forward by countries under Paris are not legally-binding but the framework of the accord, which includes a mechanism for periodically cranking those pledges up, is binding. The agreement also has a long-term goal for net zero emissions which would effectively phase out fossil fuels.   “Another year. Another record,” said WMO secretary-general, Petteri Taalas. “The extra heat from the powerful El Niño event has disappeared. The heat from global warming will continue.” “Because of climate change, the occurrence and impact of extreme events has risen,” he said. “‘Once in a generation’ heatwaves and flooding are becoming more regular.”  The WMO said human-induced global warming had contributed to at least half the extreme weather events studied in recent years, with the risk of extreme heat increasing by 10 times in some cases. “It is almost as if mother nature is making a statement,” said climate scientist Michael Mann, at Penn State University in the US. “Just as one of the planet’s two largest emitters of carbon has elected a climate change denier [Donald Trump] - who has threatened to pull out of the Paris accord - to the highest office, she reminds us that she has the final word.” “Climate change is not like other issues that can be postponed from one year to the next,” he said. “The US and world are already behind; speed is of the essence, because climate change and its impacts are coming sooner and with greater ferocity than anticipated.” The record-smashing heat led to searing heatwaves across the year: a new high of 42.7C was recorded in Pretoria, South Africa in January; Mae Hong Son in Thailand saw 44.6C on 28 April; Phalodi in India reached 51.0C in May and Mitribah in Kuwait recorded 54.0C in July. Parts of Arctic Russia also saw extreme warming - 6C to 7C above average. Arctic ice reached its equal second-lowest extent in the satellite record in September while warm oceans saw coral mortality of up to 50% in parts of Australia’s Great Barrier Reef.  Extreme weather and climate related events have damaged farming and food security, affecting more than 60 million people, according to the UN Food and Agriculture Organization. The level of CO2 in the atmosphere has also broken records in 2016, with May seeing the highest monthly value yet - 407.7 ppm - at Mauna Loa, in Hawaii.  The forecast for 2017 is another very hot year, but probably not a record breaker.  “As the El Niño wanes, we don’t anticipate that 2017 will be another record-breaking year,” said Dr Peter Stott at the UK’s Met Office. “But 2017 is likely to be warmer than any year prior to the last two decades because of the underlying extent of [human-caused] warming due to the increasing atmospheric concentration of greenhouse gases.” However, another analysis released at the UN summit in Morocco showed that global carbon emissions have barely grown in the last three years, following decades of strong growth. The main reason is China burning less coal.  Professor Corinne Le Quéré, at University of East Anglia in the UK, who led the analysis, said: “This third year of almost no growth in emissions is unprecedented at a time of strong economic growth. This is a great help for tackling climate change but it is not enough. Global emissions now need to decrease rapidly, not just stop growing.” The WMO’s temperature analysis combines the three main records, from the Met Office, Nasa and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, and stretches back to 1880."
"I want to do something very simple this weekend to cut through the staging and the static in Canberra right now. I want to talk about what’s happening rather than what people are saying. Over the next few weeks two things are likely to happen. The Turnbull government appears likely to unveil a deal that will allow some of the wretched souls detained in Nauru and Manus to finally be settled in other countries.  Assuming no outbreak of extreme crazy (which is a big thing to assume in the current climate, I’ll admit), it is also likely to ratify the agreement it signed up to in Paris last December, the one that produced commitments for all countries to achieve net zero greenhouse gas emissions and limit global warming to 1.5C to 2C. In normal political times, in that fantasy scenario where Malcolm Turnbull won the July election resoundingly, banked his personal mandate and was permitted to act more or less consistently as the politician voters have seen in the past, these things could be just transacted and presented to the public on their merits. But Turnbull has two problems. The first is that Labor is within striking distance of government. When you can feel the hot breath of your opponent on your neck, the backroom wisdom in such circumstances tends to dictate that daily politics becomes about maximising the points of difference with your opponent. We can call this survivalist mantra – pick a fight, any fight. The second problem has been on full display since the prime minister failed to win the election in the convincing way he wanted to win. Tony Abbott will play every point he thinks he can get away with, and even some he can’t get away with. Even if he’s a lone assassin, and right now he is, disowned by mostly everyone in the Coalition for different reasons, the voters see division and the net effect on a government is corrosive. Quite apart from the bruised feelings and antics of the prime minister in exile, the government remains divided philosophically and factionally, and the Coalition lacks Labor’s institutional mechanisms to enforce internal discipline. Everything is contested. Nothing is straightforward. So instead of just producing these two developments, the third-country resettlement deal and the Paris agreement ratification, as straightforward achievements, as statements of what kind of government the Turnbull government aspires to be – a government that won’t tolerate offending a basic principle of liberalism by keeping people arbitrarily detained offshore when they’ve committed no crime, and a government that knows we have to deal with the existential threat of climate change – they have to be presaged by bouts of extremism. Hence the proposed bill banning asylum seekers from ever setting foot in Australia for the remainder of their days, because that will fire up the base, wrong foot your opponent and lull the Fox News Lite night shift on Sky News – just in case anyone had a transitory impulse to wonder if Peter Dutton had suddenly gone soft – which could easily trigger an outbreak of cognitive dissonance from Ray Hadley and then Dutton might have to find a Bible to swear on. Then there’s all the shouting about windfarms, which makes absolutely no sense, given that Turnbull knows precisely what has to happen by way of transition to low-emission technologies and Josh Frydenberg is one of the brightest people in the parliament. Both of these characters know full well coal is on the way out, and Australia will need the much-maligned windfarms and the solar farms to decarbonise the grid in sufficient time to meet our international commitments, and to try to mitigate against the dangerous effects of climate change. Both were called out diplomatically, but comprehensively, on the political bollocks, in a speech the chief scientist made on Thursday night. Turnbull and Frydenberg, and the renewables bull horn do make a bit more sense if we tumble to the fact the government has not yet ratified the Paris deal, and doubtless wants to be able to ratify the Paris deal with only the mildest tut-tut from the Quadrant corner, rather than the whole process triggering yet another bout of internal cage fighting within the Coalition about climate change and whether it’s happening or not. Frydenberg and the foreign minister, Julie Bishop, are going to the planned meeting of leaders in Marrakech, Morocco, which starts this week. This pow-wow has been convened to decide the global rules towards achieving net zero emissions, which was the core of the Paris agreement. In no rational universe does the Australian government want to be in a position of going to that meeting and telling other countries we don’t intend to ratify the Paris agreement, but nothing is done until it’s done and the process isn’t yet locked down with a cabinet ruling. Obviously, this whole play – “look at those dreadful renewables and, oh look, here’s the Paris agreement” – is a lot more complicated than a simple game of bait and switch. But for a bit of light relief at the weekend, you could think of this as a drawing room comedy in which the lead character says, “My, aren’t windfarms terrible, Rupert,” while Rupert placidly signs another piece of paper guaranteeing a proliferation of windfarms into the future. Thanks, Rupert. Rupert always was a good sort. Provided Rupert is a good sort, of course. On that score, we are going to have to watch and wait."
"Residents of the Alaskan city of Barrow (due to change its name to Utqiaġvik on 1 December) would normally be looking out across a frozen harbour by now, but this year the sea is reluctant to freeze. Barrow’s average temperature for October 2016 was a balmy -1C, significantly warmer than the long-term average of around -8C. And over the North Pole the air has been a full 10C warmer than average of late.  Much of the reason for these warm temperatures and the sluggish rate of sea-ice formation is the exceptional summer sea-ice melt that occurred this year. By 10 September the National Snow and Ice Data Center reported that Arctic sea-ice had shrunk to an area of just 4.14m square kilometres – tying with 2007 for second lowest sea-ice extent on record, and some 740,000 square kilometres short of the record set in 2012.  The rapid melting of this ice earlier in the season gave plenty of time for the surface waters of the Beaufort, Chuckchi, Barents and Kara Seas to warm up, and it is these warm waters, combined with persistently warm dry weather blowing up from the south, that have boosted air temperatures and slowed the progress of fresh sea-ice formation. Summer sea-ice has been diminishing for a number of years in this region now, and research recently published in Nature Climate Change indicates that this change may be responsible for shunting the Arctic polar vortex towards the Eurasian continent during winter. The resulting change in atmospheric circulation patterns may be causing a cooler end to winter over parts of the Eurasian and North American continents."
"The energy and environment minister, Josh Frydenberg, has rejected his environment committee chairman Craig Kelly’s assessment that the Paris agreement on climate change is dead with Donald Trump as president. But just an hour after Frydenberg’s comments, the high-profile conservative backbencher George Christensen backed in Kelly’s view that the agreement was “cactus”.  Parliament should approve treaties. With #ParisAgreement my vote would've been NO. Aus has ratified but US withdrawal means Paris is cactus. Kelly used the same word in a Facebook post  as the Turnbull government ratified the Paris agreement. Frydenberg said while Trump had expressed “strong views” on climate change, the United States had already ratified the agreement, as had more than 100 other countries. Asked about Kelly’s statement, Frydenberg said: “I don’t think Paris is dead. No country can unilaterally end the agreement. “It was a watershed, to use the prime minister’s term yesterday, because more than 190 different countries adopted the agreement and now we are going ahead and implementing domestic policies to meet those emission reduction targets.” Frydenberg said it would take the US four years to pull out of the agreement. He said Australia would want to see the US “at the table”, given that the US was an important partner and emitted 16% of the world emissions. World leaders are meeting in Marrakech, Morocco, to decide the global rules towards achieving net zero emissions. The goal was set in train by the Paris agreement in December, which produced commitments for all countries to achieve net zero greenhouse gas emissions, with the aim of limiting global warming to between 1.5C and 2C. Climate groups have been critical of the Coalition’s emissions reduction fund, which is the centrepiece of the Coalition’s climate policy and has set aside $2.5bn to pay polluters to pollute less. In May the Clean Energy Regulator announced the results of its third emissions reduction fund auction.  It revealed the government had spent two-thirds of its emissions reduction fund but had achieved only 7% of the emissions cuts it would need to reach its 2030 target, according to analysts. Frydenberg said there was still $100m to spend in the emissions reduction fund and another auction was due this month. “We have a suite of mechanisms in order to meet that [Paris] target,” Frydenberg said. “That includes the emissions reduction fund, which has been very successful to date with the cost of abatement at about $12.10 a tonne.  “Our renewable energy target as well as our national energy productivity plan, which is aiming to boost the efficiency of energy use by 40% by 2030. “We are very confident, as we have beaten our first Kyoto target and we are on track to beat our 2020 target, that we will meet our 2030 target with the suite of mechanisms we have if place, together with the review we will conduct next year.”"

"A petition calling for fossil fuel lobbyists to be excluded from the UN climate change negotiations has been forced into the hands of the US delegation in Morocco, where almost 200 nations are meeting to work out ways to implement the 2015 Paris agreement to limit greenhouse gas emissions. The US delegation initially said it could not formally receive the petition signed by more than 500,000 people but later contacted Corporate Accountability International, agreeing to receive it on Wednesday.  The development followed a side event on Monday at the meeting in Marrakech, headed by the Ecuadorian delegation, where parties to the Paris agreement and non-government organisations met to discuss why a conflict of interests policy was needed and what it might look like. The petition, spearheaded by Corporate Accountability International, calls for the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change to create a policy that would screen non-state participants of meetings for conflicts of interests. It was written in support of moves by Ecuador, Venezuela and other developing nations representing the majority of the world’s population, who tried to initiate a conflict of interests policy in May. They argued that groups representing fossil fuel companies, whose net worth can be larger than the GDPs of developing nations, and who have funded climate change denial, should not be allowed in policy negotiations without being screened for conflicts of interest. That move was blocked by delegations representing rich nations including the EU, the US, UK and Australia, which argued that the negotiations should be “open” and that there was no clear definition of a “conflict of interest”. “I stand with the governments calling for an end to big polluter conflicts of interest at the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change,” the petition reads. “In order for the UNFCCC to create strong climate policy that protects people and the planet from climate catastrophe, we need to remove big polluters from the policymaking table.” In a statement, the lead negotiator for the Ecuadorian delegation said: “Too much is at stake to continue allowing the world’s biggest polluters and their agents to undermine this process.” He said the responsibility of saving the planet could not be left up to “the industries and their corporate powers that got us here”. Jesse Bragg from Corporate Accountability International said he and a group of activists from around the world took the US delegation by surprise in Marrakech. “We walked into the US delegation office, walked right across the threshold and started talking to the first person we ran into about what we were there to do,” Bragg said. The group was then taken to a closed-door meeting with press advisers, who took the petition but told the group they could not officially receive it. A press adviser later emailed Bragg, saying she would be able to accept it at 10am on Wednesday, local time. Bragg said the group would take the opportunity to discuss the issue with the US delegation. He said the the business models of fossil fuel companies was premised on the exact activity that is causing climate change. “You can have Shell and BP talking about being part of the solution but money talks,” he said. “That’s not what their intention is.” Bragg said the issue was particularly important after the election of Donald Trump in the US. “It’s hard to believe that the US delegation is excited to carry out the future Trump administration’s denialist assault on climate policy,” he said. “So, the best thing they can do for the planet is to stop blocking the policies that will help ensure that Trump, and the fossil fuel industry he’s tied himself to, have as little influence on the UNFCCC as possible.” In May, the Like Minded Group of Developing Countries – a collection of more than 20 countries representing most of the world’s population – pushed for a report to be prepared examining how “the United Nations system and other intergovernmental forums … identify and minimise the risk of conflicts of interest”. The call was blocked by rich countries but several developing nations rose to speak passionately about the issue, including Venezuela, Ecuador and China. Besides handing the petition to the US delegation, Corporate Accountability International is planning a protest action on the issue later this week, Bragg said."
"Droughts, water scarcity and stricter environmental regulations cost businesses a reported $14bn (£11bn) this year, up from $2.6bn in 2015. Yet companies still aren’t doing enough to protect themselves from water risks, according to a new report.  Compiled by environmental non-profit CDP and released Tuesday at the climate summit in Marrakech, Morrocco, the report approached more than 1,200 of the largest listed companies around the world in sectors exposed to water risk. Just over 600 responded, meaning the $14bn figure is likely to be hugely underreported.   The businesses, which included consumer goods giant Unilever and oil and gas company Suncor Energy, were measured on a number of factors, such as their efforts to track their water use and goal-setting to save water. Much of the increase in spending was related to Japanese power giant Tokyo Electric Power Company (Tepco), which spent $10bn over the past year to clean up groundwater pollution from its Daiichi nuclear power plant, damaged in the 2011 tsunami. More than a quarter of the companies said water-related issues, including floods and pollution, had affected their bottom line, typically due to higher operating costs and a disruption in production. One of the companies, Anglo American Platinum, said it was spending millions of dollars on infrastructure at its Mogalakwena mine in South Africa to protect its water supply against shortages, including a $6m upgrade to a nearby sewage works.  “Every business in every sector needs water in some form or another,” said Morgan Gillespy, head of water at CDP. “Addressing water risks is vital for business continuity, protecting the bottom-line and to enable an effective response to climate change.” Many businesses rely on water for their operations, but water supplies are at risk in many parts of the world due to pressure on resources, likely to be exacerbated by the effects of climate change. Although more companies than ever are making climate change a priority [pdf] in their sustainability efforts, they still aren’t moving quickly enough to tackle water risks, says the report.  Of the companies surveyed, around 60% said they tracked their water use, up only 3% from last year. Nearly half of the companies approached responded to the survey, up from 38% in 2015. Some sectors were more forthcoming than others. Almost three-quarters of IT companies responded, followed by the consumer staples industry, which includes food and beverage companies. The energy sector lagged behind, with less than one-third of companies responding (just 32 out of 109 firms). It’s a trend that has remained consistent, write the report’s authors, who highlight energy giants Exxon Mobile, Chevron and Royal Dutch Shell as having “failed to disclose critical water information to their investor shareholders” via CDP for the last five years. A spokeswoman for Chevron said the company reports on its water impacts through its website and corporate responsibility report, which she says “provide a clear description of how we identify and manage water risk.” Neither Shell nor Exxon had responded to the Guardian’s request for comment at the time of publication.  “For a long time, companies have regarded water as a free and plentiful resource,” said Gillespy. “This current understanding, especially in the energy sector, means that they don’t see water as a material concern.”  Of those energy companies that did respond to the survey, more than a third said they hadn’t examined how water risk could affect their business in the future. And yet energy companies, along with materials and utility firms, were hit the hardest financially from water-related issues. Energy companies reported being liable in their last reporting period for $78m in fines and penalties for incidents such as spills and violating environmental regulations, more than any other industry and seven times the amount that they reported paying last year. More than half of companies said they had set targets and goals to better manage their water supply. UK pharmaceutical company GlaxoSmithKline reported it had met its target to cut the water used in its operations by 20% last year against 2010 levels.  Reducing their water use also led to energy savings, according to over 50% of companies. Food and beverage giant Nestlé cut water use by 1.7m cubic meters at the same time as reducing carbon emissions by 80,000 tons in 2015.  To make setting targets easier, CDP is teaming up with other non-profits and charities, including WWF and The Nature Conservancy, to develop a tool to help companies set water targets aligned with climate science and global efforts such as the Paris climate agreement.  “Our goal is to enable companies to set targets that would, for example, allow them to make sustainable withdrawals from the river basins they operate in, rather than compete with other local users for that resource,” says Gillespy. The CDP report also highlighted 24 brands that were leading the way in mitigating water risks, up from eight that made the list last year. L’Oréal and German chemical company BASF were among the new additions, joining six firms that made the list for the second year in a row, including Ford and consumer goods company Colgate Palmolive."

"When it comes to global warming, we know that the real problem is not just fossil fuels – it is the logic of endless growth that is built into our economic system. If we don’t keep the global economy growing by at least 3% per year, it plunges into crisis. That means we have to double the size of the economy every 20 years, just to stay afloat. It doesn’t take much to realise that this imperative for exponential growth makes little sense given the limits of our finite planet.  Rapid climate change is the most obvious symptom of this contradiction, but we’re also seeing it in the form of deforestation, desertification and mass extinction, with species dying at an alarming rate as our consumption of the natural world causes their habitats to collapse. It was unthinkable to say this even 10 years ago, but today, as we become increasingly aware of these crises, it seems all too clear: our economic system is incompatible with life on this planet.   The question is what to do about it. How can we redesign the global economy to bring it in line with the principles of ecology? The most obvious answer is to stop using GDP to measure economic progress and replace it with a more thoughtful measure – one that accounts for the ecological and social impact of economic activity. Prominent economists like Nobel Prize winner Joseph Stiglitz have been calling for such changes for years and it’s time we listened.  But replacing GDP is only a first step. While it might help refocus economic policies on what really matters, it doesn’t address the main driver of growth: debt. Debt is the reason the economy has to grow in the first place. Because debt always comes with interest, it grows exponentially – so if a person, a business, or a country wants to pay down debt over the long term, they have to grow enough to at least match the growth of their debt. Without growth, debt piles up and eventually triggers an economic crisis.  One way to relieve the pressure for endless growth might be to cancel some of the debt – a kind of debt jubilee. But this would only provide a short-term fix; it wouldn’t get to the real root of the problem: that the global economic system runs on money that is itself debt.  This might sound a bit odd, but it’s quite simple. When you walk into a bank to take out a loan, you assume that the bank is lending you money it has in reserve – money that it stores somewhere in a vault, for example, collected from other people’s deposits. But that’s not how it works. Banks only hold reserves worth about 10% of the money they lend out. In other words, banks lend out 10 times more money than they actually have. This is known as fractional reserve banking. So where does all that additional money come from? Banks create it out of thin air when they make loans – they loan it into existence. This accounts for about 90% of the money circulating in our economy right now. It’s not created by the government, as most people assume: it is created by commercial banks in the form of loans. In other words, almost every dollar that passes through our hands represents somebody’s debt. And every dollar of debt has to be paid back with interest. Because our money system is based on debt, it has a growth imperative baked into it. In other words, our money system is heating up the planet.  Once we realise this, the solution comes into view: we need banks to keep a bigger fraction of reserves behind the loans they make. This would go a long way toward diminishing the amount of debt sloshing around in our economy, helping reduce the pressure for economic growth.  But there’s an even more exciting solution we might consider. We could abolish debt-based currency altogether and invent a new money system completely free of intrinsic debt. Instead of letting commercial banks create money by lending it into existence, we could have the state create the money and then spend it into existence. New money would get pumped into the real economy instead of just going straight into financial speculation where it inflates huge asset bubbles that only benefit the mega-rich.  The responsibility for money creation would be placed with an independent agency that – unlike our banks – would be democratic, accountable, and transparent, so money would become a truly public good. Commercial banks would still be able to lend money at interest, but they would have to back it dollar for dollar with their own reserves. In other words, there would be a 100% reserve requirement. This is not a fringe proposal. It has been around since at least the 1930s, when a group of economists in Chicago proposed it as a way of curbing the reckless lending that led to the Great Depression. The Chicago Plan, as it was called, made headlines again in 2012 when progressive IMF economists put it forward as a strategy for preventing the global financial crisis from recurring. They pointed out that such a system would dramatically reduce both public and private debt and make the world economy more stable.  What they didn’t notice is that abolishing debt-based currency also holds the secret to getting our system off its addiction to growth, and therefore to arresting climate change. As it turns out, reinventing our money system is crucial to our survival in the Anthropocene – at least as important as getting off fossil fuels. And this idea is already beginning to gain traction: in the UK, the campaigning group Positive Money has generated momentum around it, building on a series of excellent explanatory videos. The idea has its enemies, of course. If we shift to a positive money system, big banks will no longer have the power to literally make money out of nothing and the rich will no longer reap millions from asset bubbles. Unsurprisingly, neither of these groups would be pleased by this prospect. But if we want to build a fairer, more ecologically sound economy, that’s a battle that we can’t be afraid to fight.
