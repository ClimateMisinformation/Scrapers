By Ed Caryl
In the new state-by-state report from the White House, a new scourge caused by climate change has reared it’s ugly head. Asthma! (Gasp…choke…wheeze!).
In nearly every state, asthma seems to be the big concern, with hospital admissions and costs described in detail. No other disease is mentioned. Is Asthma the only disease that climate change is responsible for? Evidently. And Obama & Co. think it is really important we combat it.
Asthma has been around for as long as man has been around. The name is from the ancient Greeks. It is mentioned in Egyptian hieroglyphs, so it is clear that asthma cannot be solely caused by climate change. The implication is that warming has somehow made it worse.
Asthma is a disease caused by allergies. The allergens can be nearly anything in the environment. Outdoors, pollen is a famously common allergen in certain seasons. Indoors, the usual allergens are organic dusts of all kinds: Dust mites and their excreta, pet dander, mold, building materials that out-gas solvents, other chemicals, and gases, like sulfur dioxide, nitric oxide, formaldehyde, and in one citation, carbon dioxide. That CO2 could be an allergen seems very strange, as CO2 is present at about 4% concentration in every exhaled breath. If CO2 were an allergen, an asthmatic would not survive breathing. So simply raising the inhaled CO2 concentration from 300 to 400 parts per million in the air shouldn’t be a problem.
The answer is, of course, that the CO2 rise due to the normal rise in temperature as we warm from the Little Ice Age, has increased plant life, increasing pollen counts outdoors. Indoors, we now insulate all houses, and seal them against cold  in the winter and heat in the summer, this traps the indoor pollutants mentioned above. At least that is one theory.
But, why tie asthma to climate? First, it is very prevalent. Some 8% of Americans suffer from asthma. Everyone either has it or knows someone that has it. But does asthma rise to the top of everyone’s daily concerns? Probably not. Less than 0.1% of asthma sufferers die from it. According to the Center for Disease Control, of the 2,468,435 people that died in 2010, 3,404 died from asthma. That is 1.1 deaths per 100,000 people. When all the things you can die of are rank ordered, asthma is number 89, right below cancer of the larynx and above gall bladder disease. Breathing problems are only 4% of emergency room visits for both adults and children.
But let’s look at who gets asthma, and another possible reason for the increase. This is a chart of asthma prevalence and poverty level. (Source here.)

Figure 1 is a part of a chart found here that describes who gets asthma. The top bar represents the prevalence of asthma in those poor at or below the poverty level, about 11%. The middle bar is the prevalence of asthma in those at or twice the poverty level, about 8.6%, and the bottom bar is the well-to-do that are above twice the poverty level, a bit over 7%.

So, asthma seems to be an affliction of the poor. Why is it increasing? Is it temperature change? Here are charts of U. S. temperature anomaly versus asthma prevalence.

Figure 2a, Asthma prevalence and U. S. temperature anomaly in °F, and 2b, the corresponding scatter diagram with the R-squared value.
There doesn’t seem to be any relationship with climate. Perhaps the problem is in simply being poor. Here are the charts of food-stamp participation (SNAP) and asthma.

Figure 3a, Asthma prevalence and SNAP participation, and 3b, the corresponding scatter diagram with the R-squared value.
It appears to this author that asthma is an economic problem, not a climate problem, and I thank the current government for drawing this to our attention. Poor people can’t afford to properly maintain their homes, so dust, mold, animal dander and other indoor pollutants build up and cause allergies, increasing asthma. Raising the cost of energy is not going to improve the situation, it can only make it worse.
This is just one more example of over-hyped rhetoric used in the climate change debate and how wrong-headed it can be. It is another attempt to invoke a monster under the bed. This time it turned out to be the wrong monster. I wonder what it will be next week.

"The reserves and protected places that are the “jewels in the crown” of English nature cannot be managed properly because of budget cuts, Tony Juniper, the chair of Natural England, has said. The budget for the government’s conservation watchdog has been slashed in half over five years, leaving it “massively depleted”, according to Juniper, the influential former Friends of the Earth campaigner whom the environment secretary, Michael Gove, appointed earlier this year.  Sites of special scientific interest (SSSIs) cannot be monitored to ensure their wildlife riches are maintained, and on national nature reserves Natural England can only afford to ensure basic health and safety for visitors, he said. “I’ve inherited an organisation that is depleted, massively depleted,” Juniper told the Guardian in his first national newspaper interview since taking the job. “On a whole range of subjects, we cannot do what society expects of us.  “For example, all we’re able to spend on the management of the national nature reserve estate is for health and safety so visitors don’t hurt themselves. “We’ve got no monitoring capacity on the SSSIs. Our ability to give advice to planning applications and our works on landscapes, national parks and areas of outstanding natural beauty is cut now to pretty much nothing.” Juniper, visiting Halvergate Marshes in Norfolk, an SSSI and the second largest block of freshwater marshland in Britain, said he had been given no guarantees over budget increases or even an end to cuts so Natural England can revive wildlife and use natural landscapes to help tackle the climate emergency. But he said he had taken the job because he wanted to “reinvigorate the official nature conservation effort in this country”. Juniper said budget cuts left the watchdog vulnerable to legal challenges. The WildJustice group led by Mark Avery, Ruth Tingay and Chris Packham successfully forced Natural England to scrap the “general licence” that previously allowed landowners to freely kill certain bird species such as crows and woodpigeons. WildJustice has launched a fresh legal challenge against new temporary general licences, and Juniper invited Avery, Packham and Tingay to meet him. “They are good friends of mine and I’d be pleased to talk to them about this or anything else, but the involvement of lawyers makes that more difficult,” he said. “I would hope that conservationists could be working together to try to solve these problems in a less time-consuming and confrontational manner because these legal actions do use up a vast amount of resources.” Juniper appeared to accept that Gove was unlikely to remain environment secretary much longer. He said: “Michael Gove has been an incredibly energetic, dedicated and effective secretary of state for the environment and it’s very rare we get those. The last one who made that kind of impact was John Gummer back in the early 90s. As was the case with John Gummer we were very surprised how the brief became so passionately owned – Michael Gove has done that and the conservation community has a lot to thank him for, for putting these issues back on the map.” Juniper said he hoped Gove’s successor would take heed of the public mood, as outlined by recent Extinction Rebellion protests and the school climate strikes. He said: “I would hope no matter what the personal views of the new secretary of state they will come to the role recognising that the voters these days really want delivery on this stuff.” A spokesperson for the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs said: “Natural England’s work is vital for protecting and enhancing the nation’s natural environment. We have worked closely with Natural England to settle their budget for the coming year.”"

Share this...FacebookTwitterWatching the reaction from the greens, media, climate scientists, and a number of politicians here in Germany reminds me of the time when I was in 6th grade and a friend of mine and I threw a dead mouse in a group of 3rd grade schoolgirls out on the school yard. That sent them off in all directions screaming hysterically. 🙂

Order yours at: WattsUpWithThat 
Well that’s pretty much the reaction we’ve seen with many of the adults (grown men) here in Germany when Scripps announced that CO2 concentration had reached the 400 ppm level. You see, the day before when the concentration was 399.99 ppm, everybody was just going about their business; life was normal. But when the CO2 concentration reached 400 ppm, the gates of hell opened.
As one of the few calm people here, I now find myself busy dispensing on-site counseling to the emotionally shocked and hysterical in the report’s aftermath, and so I don’t have so much time. But here’s some reaction we’ve seen over the last few hours from the media, greens and “leading scientists”:
Green party honcho, drama-queen Dr. Herrmann Ott:
Exceeding the 400 ppm threshold of CO2 concentration in the atmosphere symbolizes the drama of galloping climate change and the threats to our civilization connected with it. […] To avert the unimaginable consequences of a continued dramatic increase in CO2, immediate and effective climate protection must have top priority!”
The leftist daily TAZ quoted Ralph Keeling of the Scripps Institution of Oceanography in San Diego [translated, not the original quote]:
‘We are moving into dangerous territory,’ said Ralph Keeling of the Scripps Institution of Oceanography in San Diego. […] In his view the efforts to reduce CO2 have failed. Some impacts of climate change are now irreversible.”
The centrist online FOCUS magazine wrote:

The CO2 concentration in the atmosphere has reached a historical high. […] Policymakers have to finally take action.”
Stephan Bakan of Max Planck Institute for Meteorology in Hamburg (via klimaretter.de):
The climate models show that independent of short-term fluctuations, the global mean temperature of the lower atmosphere continues to rise with increasing CO2 concentration. With every increase we are moving towards the 450ppm level. And the time remaining for effective emissions reduction reduces accordingly.”
450 ppm? At least now we know when to expect the next outbreak of mass hysteria.
Jelle Bijma of the Alfred Wegener Institute for Polar and Ocean Research in Bremerhaven, reported by klimaretter.de):
With this we surpass the 400 ppm mark for the first time in 25 million years. […] The Earth’s climate does not fundamentally react to the rise in CO2 in a linear fashion, explained Bijma. However there seems to be a relationship: The continued increase in greenhouse gas concentration as a whole strengthens the tendency to warming of the atmosphere. The higher the CO2 concentration, the graver are the consequences of climate change.”
The German Green Party wrote at their site:
Reaching the 400 ppm mark and the foreseeable increase in CO2 concentrations mean a much warmer world, and foremost a more volatile world connected with a sea level that is meters higher. […] It has probably been 3 million years since CO2 concentrations have been so high. […] To avert the consequences of a further dramatic increase in CO2 emissions, we must immediately and effectively protect the climate.”
There’s much more of course. But I’ve got to get back to calming the hysterical here. I’m telling them that over the Earth’s history CO2 have meandered over a broad range of 180 ppm to as high as 7000 ppm. At 150 life really starts having problems. During the ice ages we were dangerously low, below 200 ppm. At 400 ppm we now at least have a small buffer against extinction.
At the moment they are blocking it all out, of course. But tomorrow when they wake up, they will see that the earth is still there. It’s a slow process that moves one step at a time. They’ll wake up 5 mornings in a row, then do so for a whole year, and then for a decade, and more, and the world will still be there. Most by then will have relaxed and returned to a functional life.

"I grew up in the shadow of a giant. All the reflections shared today reinforce that his greatness was one of a kind. However, his blood is my blood and his story has become part of my story. When I was four years old, I sat by my grandfather’s knee in 1989 when he addressed the nation on climate change. It is actually one of my first memories. Having spent my entire professional career working in climate change and sustainability, you could say that that night rubbed off on me.  However, it is only in recent years, with the passing of my nan and pop, that I’ve truly reflected on just how their values have shaped mine and what I carry forward. Of all the things said about Bob these past weeks, there is one story that, to me, speaks to the legacy that is most relevant to the future of Australia. For both what was achieved and what is possible, in 1989, Bob was handed some cabinet papers, requesting Australia’s support to open Antarctica to mining. He was horrified. But he was told that years of international negotiations could not be unwound. It was a done deal. “Bugger that” he said.  Refusing to sign, Bob courted the world with an ideal for something greater, better and fairer. Enlisting global eco champion Jacques Cousteau, the Hawke/Keating government determined to set about changing the world’s mind, and they did. In 1991 the Madrid protocol was executed, making the last great wilderness on earth a place devoted to peace and to science, protected from exploitation. Now, that is legacy. To me, this tells the greatest of stories. It speaks of pop’s values of fairness and equality, and his love and his faith in the brotherhood of mankind. It speaks of true leadership and his willingness to be unpopular and to listen to unpopular truths. Thirty years ago I sat by his knee and he implored us to take action on climate.  These past months, he expressed such great sadness that we have failed to do so. He saw it as a collective failure of our nation that we have traded short-term interests over intergenerational equality.  He would say that the foundations of excuses we cling to are fragile and will inevitably collapse. We must stop delaying the cost of change now, for all we do is load our future citizens with a debt that they cannot repay. Let us listen to the children and young people who parade their courage and conviction, because their tomorrows will be affected by our actions today.  Many tributes have been shared today, but truly honouring my grandfather means reflecting on his achievements and applying his values to the future choices we make.  Let us take to heart his courage, borrow his optimism and mirror his love for the brotherhood of human kind. In his twilight years, pop was a gruff old bugger at times. I imagine that if he were here today, he would look at me with love and with fierce pride and with a twinkle in his eye, say in his grumpy old man voice, ‘Well, get on with it then.’  So, that is my path. It was both his gift to me and my enduring tribute to his legacy."

Share this...FacebookTwitterThe political beauty about climate data is that it can be easily manipulated in order to fool the public.
The National Oceanic And Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) recently released its State of the Climate in 2012: Highlights. To no one’s surprise, the report gives the reader the impression that warming is galloping ahead out of control. But their data show just the opposite.

The NOAA says 2012 was the 8th or 9th warmest on record, but fails to mention it was one of the coolest of the decade, and thus confirms the cooling trend. (Above sequence estimated using the chart. Trend line is only approximate). Also see: woodfortrees.org from:1998. 
When one carefully reads the report, we find that the NOAA findings actually do confirm precisely what the skeptics have been claiming all along:
1. The Earth has stopped warming.
2. The climate models exaggerated future warming. CO2 climate sensitivity is much lower than we first thought.
That’s the real issue at hand.
On global temperatures, the NOAA report itself states (my emphasis): “Four major independent datasets show 2012 was among the 10 warmest years on record, ranking either 8th or 9th, depending upon the dataset used.

Source: NOAA
2012 one of the coldest this decade
But if 2012 is only the 8th or 9th warmest and we are told again and again that almost all the warmest years occurred since 2000, then it can only mean that 2012 was one of the coolest so far this century.
And indeed the above NOAA chart confirms just that. Moreover, the stagnation of the last 15 years defies all computer model projections, thus confirming that the models all exaggerated CO2 climate sensitivity. In order for the models to be correct, the global temperature over the last 6 years would have to be 0.2 to 0.3°F warmer.
We suppose that the NOAA and NASA will soon be going to work readjusting the 1998 to 2005 data downwards to get the curve shape they need. Such dubious (and perhaps criminal) manipulation of data has long since become NASA’s “scientific” approach over the recent years. It kind of reminds us of the days when Stalin tried to change history by cutting and pasting photos.

NOAA admits using random weather anecdotes as “data” to show warming
Now that we see that the global temperature data show there’s been NO WARMING and that the models all exaggerate, how does NOAA arrive at the conclusion that the globe is warming? Answer: They use scattered weather anecdotes as evidence. Something that even 6th grade students learn not to do. Their science is that bad.
The NOAA even admits this: “The report used dozens of climate indicators to track and identify changes and overall trends to the global climate system.” These “climate indicators,” as you are about to see, are merely cherry-picked weather events.
For example the NOAA writes that the Arctic sea ice extent last year reached a record low “during the satellite era“. However, the satellite era only goes back 33 years, and the NOAA couldn’t be bothered to tell readers that low Arctic sea ice also persisted in the 1950s and is all part of natural cycles, and is thus not “unprecedented“. Also read here.
The NOAA in its report also uses a single 4-week-long period of weather over Greenland last summer as conclusive data that our planet is warming. But this is just a weather event.
Another remarkable single event that the NOAA uses is: “A weak La Niña dissipated during spring 2012 and, for the first time in several years, neither El Niño nor La Niña … prevailed for the majority of the year.” A La Niña naturally disappearing is evidence of global warming? You gotta be kidding.
NOAA’s scientific incompetence reaches a new high
The NOAA just released it’s State of the Climate: Extreme Events chart:
Again the NOAA confuses weather events as “climate events”. The scientists at the NOAA are no longer able to distinguish between a single tropical storm like Sandy and climate. Scientific incompetence has reached a new high.
If you think scientists just couldn’t get anymore incompetent, then think again. NOAA scientists even appear to believe that cold events are now signs of warming. It includes expanding Antarctic sea ice as evidence the globe is warming:
Antarctica sea ice extent reaches record high … reached a record high of 7.51 million square miles on September 26. This is 0.5 percent higher than the previous record high extent of 7.47 million square miles that occurred in 2006 and seven percent higher than the record low maximum sea ice extent of 6.96 million square miles that occurred in 1986.”
When the traditional fundamental data stop supporting your claims and you’re scientifically desperate, then I guess you have to resort to fringe weather anecdotes. Who would have thought that the NOAA would devolve to such a low level?
And as the warming stagnation continues, expect a lot more comedy to come from the NOAA in the years ahead.

Share this...FacebookTwitterEvery sane, half-way educated person knows that a warmer planet is better than a colder one. During the ice ages, when CO2 concentration was just 180 ppm, much life on the planet stood on the brink of extinction. When the planet was a hot-house and CO2 was over 1000 ppm, the Earth was a literal garden of Eden teeming with life. Hat-tip: reader Manfred.

So it’s no surprise that the British Antarctic Survey tells us in a fascinating report that the emperor penguin faces starvation should Antarctic sea ice grow, as it is doing right now.
The British Antarctic Survey writes at the very end of its report:
They have a high survival rate compared to other penguins, with an average of 95% surviving the year. However, if it is a harsh sea-ice year, many chicks will die of starvation. Emperors are the least common Antarctic penguin, with only about 200,000 breeding pairs.”

Antarctica has seen a whole bunch of harsh years recently, and it doesn’t look like things are going to improve anytime soon.

Of course the extra sea ice we’ve been seeing at the South Pole doesn’t mean these dignified birds will become extinct any time soon. Like polar bears, they’ve survived far worse conditions. But it does mean the weaker ones aren’t going to fare as well and some will have to make an agonizing, early departure from Earth.
Already I’m seeing emperor penguins falling from the sky to their death! Must be those damn man-made aerosols cooling the southern hemisphere.

Just a few years ago global warming experts (like David Viner and Mojib Latif) were forecasting balmy, snowless winters for Europe. Now we see just the opposite is taking place.
For the US, Joe says that before the Atlantic turns colder, springs are likely to be colder like in the 1950s.
On Al Gore, Joe Bastardi wonders if he ever looks at anything that challenges his belief.

Do They Even Look?
Baffled German Government Concedes! “Global Warming Has Stopped…Warming Pause Is Remarkable…Unexpected”
This is a headline in my friend Pierre Gosselin’s Blog “No Tricks Zone.” The article is here for you to read, but in it, there is an admission that global warming has stopped and it’s baffling as to why.
There is much to be gained from this about the methods of people pushing this issue. The headline above uses the word “baffled.” It should not be, and here is why: Most environmentalists simply will not look at anything that can challenge their idea. The turn to colder in Europe and the far East has been easier to forecast than the US following the turn to colder in the Pacific Decadol Oscillation. The linkage to colder is much faster in these areas, when the Atlantic is in its warm cycle as it still is (I have a de-icing company that supplies both areas, so being right is crucial.) In the US, it lags because…”

"This week highlighted a number of massive problems we have in this country. The most obvious of course is the horrendous intrusions on freedom of the press. But a close second is the revelation about how poorly we debate and treat issues of the economy and climate change. Everything you need to know about how we rate the importance of climate change is how the latest economic national accounts and greenhouse gas emissions data were released. On Wednesday at 11:30am EST precisely, the Australian Bureau of Statistics released the national accounts, detailing the entire production within Australia’s economy during the first three months of 2019. On Thursday at no set time – but six days after it was required by Senate order – and after the headline figures had been given to the Australian for soft coverage, the government released the inventory for Australia’s greenhouse gas emissions during the last three months of 2018. Let’s be honest, the way these figures were released is perfectly in keeping with the contempt our prime minister and his government regard action on climate change. For him the climate crisis is just an opportunity to say some soft soap marketing spin when out among the people or in front of microphones and to then reveal what he really thinks by appointing Angus Taylor as minister for “emissions reduction”. It was no shock to anyone that our emissions are rising. They have been rising ever since the carbon price was removed – marking the LNP’s “emissions reduction fund” as a phrase of mendacity. Any suggestion that the LNP cares about reducing emissions is a lie. They don’t, they never have, and they never will until forced to do so by voters. After this election they will feel no such compulsion. And so the lies and spin will continue, whether it be in the renaming of ministerial titles or the releasing of emissions data when it best suits – such as the day after the State of Origin and while the media is focussed on AFP raids on the ABC and News Corp. This is not news; it is abundantly clear that the LNP was re-elected off the back of a fistful of lies. There was of course the big lie about death taxes, but underneath it all was the foundation lie of the campaign – that Australia’s economy is strong. It is not – it is as weak now as it has been any time since the GFC. The foundation was set before the election began when Scott Morrison suggested that: “We have a plan that has been keeping our economy strong”. The economy is not strong; they didn’t have a plan. Just how lacking in strength is our economy? In the past year the economy grew more slowly than it has for a decade. All that is keeping us out of a recession is population growth, as the past three quarters have seen GDP per capita decline in seasonally adjusted terms. When did that last occur? Try 1983. Household disposable incomes since 1959 have grown on average by 3.2% in real terms, but in the past three years they have grown on average by just 0.9% – the worst growth since 1988. On a per capita basis, household living standards are below not just what they were at the 2016 election, but also when the LNP came to power at the 2013 election. None of this is at all surprising to anyone who was paying attention. But for far too long the media and in turn voters have swallowed the line that the budget surplus or deficit is the indicator of anything remotely close to economic management. We spend too much time obsessing about the budget and GDP growth and too little time obsessing about household living standards. We spend too much time concentrating on unemployment and too little time on underutilisation – which is higher now than when the LNP won office in 2013. We have a government that produced a budget which forecast a budget surplus in the next financial year and which allowed them to go to an election suggesting that was the defining economic measure by which it should be judged. And it worked. And now, three weeks after the election, the Reserve Bank has cut rates to record lows because the economy is stuttering to a halt. It is time for action, and yet the treasurer Josh Frydenberg’s performance at the press conference announcing the figures does not fill one with confidence. Rather than a man with the details of our nearly $2tn economy at his fingertips, he comes across more like a small-town accountant who, after reviewing your work expenses, pauses uncomfortably too long before telling you he thinks they might be tax deductible. A week like this brings into very sharp relief the importance of elections. Had the ALP won three weeks ago the narrative would have been about changing the direction of both the economy and emissions. Instead, we are told nothing is wrong and all will be fine. And we have three long years before any chance that a different story gets told. • Greg Jericho is a Guardian Australia columnist"
"The United States creates more planet-warming greenhouse gas emissions through its defense operations alone than industrialized countries such as Sweden and Portugal, researchers said on Wednesday. The Pentagon, which oversees the US military, released about 59m metric tons of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases in 2017, according to the first study to compile such comprehensive data, published by Brown University.  The Pentagon’s emissions were “in any one year … greater than many smaller countries’ greenhouse gas emissions”, the study said. If it were a country, its emissions would make it the world’s 55th largest contributor, said Neta Crawford, the study’s author and a political scientist at Boston University. “There is a lot of room here to reduce emissions,” Crawford said. Request for comments to the Pentagon went unanswered. Using and moving troops and weapons accounted for about 70% of its energy consumption, mostly due to the burning of jet and diesel fuel, Crawford said. It dwarfed yearly emissions by Sweden, which the international research project the Global Carbon Atlas ranks 65th worldwide for its of CO2 emissions. Pentagon emissions were higher than those of Portugal, ranked 57th by the Global Carbon Atlas, said Crawford. China is the world’s largest emitter of carbon dioxide, the main gas responsible for climate change, followed by the United States. The Pentagon called climate change “a national security issue” in a January report to Congress and has launched multiple initiatives to prepare for its impact. Global temperatures are on course for a 3C to 5C (5.4F to 9.0F) rise this century, far overshooting a global target of limiting the increase to 2C or less, the UN World Meteorological Organization said in November. Four degrees Celsius of warming would increase more than five times the influence of climate on conflict, according to a study published in Nature magazine on Wednesday. Crawford said the Pentagon had reduced its fuel consumption significantly since 2009, including by making its vehicles more efficient and moving to cleaner sources of energy at bases. It could reduce them further by cutting fuel-heavy missions to the Persian Gulf to protect access to oil, which were no longer a top priority as renewable energy gained ground, she said. “Many missions could actually be rethought, and it would make the world safer,” she said."
"Arctic sea ice has diminished drastically over the last 40 years. Now a study shows that the southern half of the US may be suffering from more summer heatwaves as a consequence. Dagmar Budikova, a climatologist at Illinois State University, and colleagues used satellite data to measure the ebb and flow of Arctic sea ice in the Hudson Bay region since 1979 and compared this with heatwave frequency across the US. Their results, published in the Journal of Geophysical Research: Atmospheres, show that summer heatwaves were far more common across the southern US in the years when the Hudson Bay basin experienced a warm spring and reduced sea ice.  That’s because these conditions reduce the north-south temperature contrast, resulting in slacker winds and a loopier jet stream: the perfect breeding ground for lingering high-pressure systems and summer heatwaves over the southern plains. So how is this summer shaping up? Thankfully spring temperatures and sea ice were near normal levels across Hudson Bay this year and unlikely to trigger heatwaves in the southern US. “This, however, does not mean that the southern US will not see heatwaves, just not those triggered by sea ice in the Hudson Bay area,” explains Budikova."

Share this...FacebookTwitterNorthern hemisphere winters in the big picture
 by Juraj Vanovcan (Slovakia)
According to the climate models, anthropogenic warming is supposed to predominantly manifest itself by increasing the winter temperatures th the middle latitudes – caused by the increased “greenhouse effect“ or increased amount of long wave infrared radiation LWIR from the sky to the surface. Children won’t know what the snow is, was the meme in 2000s after a string of warm winters in Europe.

Central England temperature vs Arctic oscillation index.
Only a decade later, things changed and cold and snowy winters are now becoming the norm and not the exception over all of Europe. Now the warming is the cause of invasions of cold Arctic air into mid-latitudes, some climatologists insist. They are basically admitting that not LWIR, but prevailing direction of air circulation makes a winter season warmer or colder than average. Of course there is another popular ad-hoc theory plugging the hole. It relates to the loss of summer ice to weather half a year later.
Coming back to air circulation, its direction is dependent on atmospheric highs and lows and the stability of their position. This known phenomenon is characterized by Arctic Oscillation (AO) or North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) index. Negative AO means increased frequency of Arctic air plunging to the mid-latitudes, while a positive AO means milder winters with persistent southwestern flow into Europe.
Looking back at history and combining AO index with the winter temperatures from Central England Temperature record (CET), there is a clear relation between the two. A decade of mild winters during the 1920s is indistinguishable, temperature-wise, from the decades after 1990. Cold winters coincide with periods of negative AO, the last one in early 1980s and again in recent years.
What’s interesting is the trend in AO since 1990, which is clearly negative. Now, let’s compare this observation with Chapter 10.3.5.6. in the last IPCC AR4 report, which says:
…In the recent multi-model analyses, more than half of the models exhibit a positive trend in the NAM (NAO)…
…Although the magnitude of the trends shows a large variation among different models, Miller et al. (2006) find that none of the 14 models exhibits a trend towards a lower NAM index and higher arctic SLP (sea level pressure)…

…In another multi-model analysis, Stephenson et al. (2006) show that of the 15 models able to simulate the NAO pressure dipole, 13 predict a positive increase in the NAO index with increasing CO2 concentrations…
…The average of IPCC-AR4 simulations from 13 models suggests the increase of the NAM index becomes statistically significant early in the 21st century (Figure 10.17a, Miller et al., 2006)…”
and finally
In summary, the future changes in the extratropical circulation variability are likely to be characterized by increases in positive phases of both the NAM and the SAM.”
Again, observations are in stark opposition to climate models. Claims, that warming basically causes negative AO period is nowhere to be found in “peer-reviewed” literature from those times when winters were mild and spring came in March as usual.
Be sure, that in case of mild winter, it should be exactly as scientists predicted because in today’s world of climate, everything is exactly “as models predicted”, even if it contradicts itself and none of the models had actually predicted it.
To sum it up:
1) It is obvious that winters, at least in NW Europe, are dominated by AO/NAO.
2) During the the last century, AO cycles bear no relation to CO2 level or “human influence”.
3) Since a 1990 positive AO spike, its trend has been negative, which is in agreement with the increasingly colder observed winters.
4) None of the models predicted negative phase of AO.
5) AGW theory is just riding on the warm period of the NAO (and AMO), which has already ended.
As Albert Einstein once said, a good theory predicts things in advance and a bad theory needs additional adjustments after each new discovery. The problem with the anthropogenic warming theory is: it cannot sustain anything new. For every new and unexpected climate or weather trend a special sub-theory must be developed, and it doesn’t matter if they often completely contradict each other.
“There are 3 roads to ruin yourself: women, gambling and scientists. The most pleasant is with women. The quickest is with gambling. But the surest is following the advice of scientists.”

"Extinction Rebellion is working. A YouGov poll last week showed that the protests by the direct action group, as well as those of millions of children led by Greta Thunberg, have sent public concern about the climate crisis to record levels. Extinction Rebellion shouldn’t have to exist. It only does because most of the media and government have failed. Despite Nasa warning we faced global disaster as far back as 1988, the media has taken an emperor’s new clothes approach. It has conveyed what Sir David Attenborough calls “our greatest threat in thousands of years” with the urgency of a quiche recipe on a daytime TV show, and with a detachment that suggests it doesn’t believe what it is saying. For years, it has told us the most you can do is recycle plastic and unplug your phone charger. But this hasn’t worked. Last year global emissions were the highest on record. Meanwhile, the scientific warnings have become louder and louder. The world’s leading climate scientist has urged parents to take to the streets. Extinction Rebellion has pierced the bubble of denial. By giving talks to local communities across the country, it has humanised this crisis. Instead of flatly explaining that sea levels will rise, diseases will spread and crops will fail, it has made it clear this is about our children and us. It has expressed grief for our kids, for wildlife, for nature and fear at the degrading of the systems that keep us alive. Paradoxically, by stating the terrible truth, it has created authentic hope for the first time. It has been the small child brave enough to step forward, pointing at the naked king, stating the reality: that all life on Earth is under threat, even the families of journalists and MPs, and only a mass mobilisation of people across the world will force our deluded leaders to act. With that knowledge, thousands have stepped forward and taken to the streets to cause the peaceful disruption that seems the only way to get the media to focus on a story that should have led the news from the moment they knew the facts until this nightmare is solved. The battle is not yet won. Two weeks ago, when more than a million school kids protested for their lives, the BBC News website gave greater priority to a story about the dangers of dog leads. When Philip Hammond suggested £1tn is too high a price to ensure the future of our children, serious commentators nodded in agreement. It seems that the terrifying reality of what we are facing has not yet hit home. There are still too many people in positions of power who believe that if they state that the situation is not dire then that makes it so. These people cannot see that the disruption we face now is nothing compared with the coming fury from a nation of parents realising that the science, certain for a very long time but presented constantly with doubt, means that, if the worst-case scenario comes to pass, their children may not live past middle age. This week Penguin publishes the group’s first book, This Is Not a Drill. The Penguin logo on the cover is dead and horizontal. It’s not Extinction Rebellion or Greta Thunberg it wants us to listen to: it’s the scientists who have been yelling at us for the last 30 years. If that message can hit home to people in positions of influence, then it may yet prove to be the movement that saved all of us from ourselves. If not, we face a reality so terrible no one can comprehend it. • Matthew Todd is a journalist and author"
"One of the many ironies of the climate crisis is that as temperatures change and extreme weather becomes more common, we need more energy to maintain comfort. Hotter summers have driven an increase in power-hungry air conditioning and cooler temperatures in some places – which may be driven by the melting Arctic – raise demand for heating. BP’s report that carbon emissions from energy use have risen at the fastest rate in nearly a decade reflects those forces, as well as continuing demand from a rising global population and expanding industries.  The effect is already discernible in the atmosphere. Last week, the Scripps Institution of Oceanography reported that carbon dioxide levels in the air leapt this year by the second highest amount in their records, to 414.8 parts per million, at the famous observatory in Mauna Loa where CO2 has been measured continuously since 1958. We cannot afford many more years like this. Every year of high emissions adds to the stock of carbon in the air, bringing us closer to the 450ppm of carbon dioxide that scientists warn could tip us into catastrophe. The IPCC’s stark warnings last year showed how dangerous a rise of 1.5C would be, and on current terms we are headed for an even bigger rise. A decade ago, when emissions were last rising this fast, the financial crisis and global recession led to an unexpected pause in carbon emissions. Fatih Birol, of the International Energy Agency, urged governments and businesses to take advantage of this to reset their economies. Lord Stern, author of the 2006 landmark Stern Review of the economics of climate change, also noted that governments had a choice about how to pull out of the slump and could choose to favour low-carbon methods. The warnings went largely unheeded and the pause turned out brief: by 2011, Birol was shocked by a record rise in emissions. The world carried on burning fossil fuels and building infrastructure that depended on them, even while alternatives were falling rapidly in price. As a result, high emissions were and still are being locked into our future: buildings, transport networks, power stations and other industrial plants constructed now will still be operating five decades hence. By that time, our future will have been long decided. The UK government’s independent statutory advisers, the Committee on Climate Change, recently set out proposals for a net-zero carbon target for 2050, saying it was needed to stay within 1.5C. Those plans came under fire from the chancellor, Philip Hammond, who warned in a letter to Theresa May that it would cost £1tn. That sounds a lot. But what Hammond failed to say was that it represents less than six months of GDP in the next three decades – in other words, we would arrive at the same level of national wealth just six months later if we choose to safeguard the planet than if we choose to ignore science. On the plus side for those hoping for political leadership, every candidate for the Tory leadership apart from Esther McVey has publicly said they support the net-zero target. While ministers squabble, the fossil fuel industry pleads the need for public investment to persuade them to clean up. BP’s chief economist, resisting calls to invest in carbon capture and storage, said: “You can’t rely on the generosity of the private sector.” If that is so, in the interests of the rest of us, governments will have to regulate. The question is, will MPs who now support net-zero follow their warm words with concrete actions? And if they do, will BP and the other fossil-fuel profit-makers support them?"

SMA Solar Technology AG Informs Employees About Necessary Corporate Downsizing
The Managing Board of SMA Solar Technology AG (SMA) today informed the company’s employees at an employee meeting about further planned personnel adjustments. To respond to the changing conditions in the global photovoltaic market and the associated strong decline in sales, a gradual downsizing of 700 full-time positions in Germany is planned by December 31, 2014.
“We are expecting an extended period of consolidation in the solar sector. For the first time in many years, measured in Euros, the global photovoltaic market will decline in 2013. As market leader, we will be especially affected by this. In such a short space of time, we are not able to offset the sharp decrease in sales – nearly 50% since 2010 –with the ongoing measures for increasing productivity and saving on material costs alone. We have therefore been forced to make even more far-reaching changes than planned to our personnel structure over the coming months,” explains SMA Chief Executive Officer Pierre-Pascal Urbon.
At the employee meeting, the company announced that in relation to the cutoff date of March 31, 2013, a total of 700 full-time positions will be downscaled in Germany by the end of 2014. This corresponds to around 800 employees, as the layoffs will affect both full-time and part-time employees. By the end of 2014, full-time positions in Germany will be at 3 000.
In recent weeks, the Managing Board has led constructive negotiations with the Works Council to ensure that any personnel adjustments are handled in the most socially responsible way. These negotiations are still in progress. The options of a further voluntary separation scheme or a transfer of the affected employees to a transitional company are under discussion. At present, the Managing Board is unable to exclude the possibility of compulsory terminations for operational reasons if the stated measures do not result in the required reduction in staff. “The planned downsizing is unavoidable if SMA is to emerge strengthened from the current consolidation phase in the solar sector. When making decisions about these cutbacks, we have used our best judgement and have kept an eye on our shared values,” says Pierre-Pascal Urbon.
The planned reduction in staff will affect all SMA divisions and corporate center in Germany. IT and development specialists will not be affected. SMA plans to continue investing, particularly in the area of technology development to strengthen the company’s ability to operate in the future and to systematically extend the global technology leadership. The Managing Board believes that the long-term prospects in the industry and for the company are good. “Our future energy supply will be largely decentralized and will be based on renewable energies. We will actively help to shape the transformation in the energy sector through the development of entirely new product platforms, our excellent service and our global presence,” explains Pierre-Pascal Urbon.
About SMA

The Sun In July 2013 – News and Some Statistics
By Frank Bosse
According to the Solar Influences Data Analysis Center (SIDC) in Brussels, the “official” solar sunspot number (SSN) last month was 57.0. Thus it reached only 57% of the mean value of cycles 1-23 in the corresponding time period, see graph below: “Average Solar Cycle”:

The chart is a plot of sunspot number (SSN) versus months after the start of the cycle.dark blue: mean value of cycles 1-23, red curve is the current cycle 24, and the gray curve is cycle no. 5.
If you calculate using the entire Cycle 24. then we get an activity level that is only about 45% of the mean value. The comparison of all cycles up to the current month:

You have to go back all the way to 1827 (SC 7) to find a comparably small activity like what we have seen since 2009. Leif Svalgaard once called the sun a “messy place” in order to tell us that our mother star is always full of surprises. Could there be an unexpected increase in Solar Cycle 24 activity coming up and what is the probability of that happening? Here the solar sunspot number anomalies of the previous chart (ASSA 56 – the accumulated solar sunspot anomaly after 56 months after the start of the cycle) is compared to the total sum of the anomalies (ASSA acc) of the previous cycles 1-23:

google_ad_height = 200;
//-->





Result: There’s a very high probability (average 88%) that we will continue to see an extremely weak solar cycle. A lot indicates an anomaly of -2400 at the end of Cycle 24. Signs show that we are already past the maximum. Also renowned the website spaceweather.com determined this on 26 July 2013. Readers of our monthly Sonneninfo already suspected this earlier (see “The sun in June 2013 – on the way to a grand minimum? New work on the possible consequences“). Here the polar solar fields were depicted. Last month also confirmed the measurement data: The polarity has switched and the maximum is behind us. So how long will the weakening of SC24 take?
This question is hardly unimportant for telling us what to expect from the upcoming SC25. It has long been known that a long solar cycle of weaker activity is followed by a similar cycle, and vice versa. When you plot the length of the previous cycle with accumulated sunspot anomaly (“ASSA acc”) together with the following cycle, you get this interesting diagram:

Blue curve shows SCn (months) *(-1); Red curve ASSA (SCn+1)
The inverted cycle length of Cycle 1 (blue) was compared with the ASSA acc (red) of the subsequent Cycle 2. Just the length of Cycle 23 (May 1996 until November 2008: 150 months instead of 131.5=10.9 years on average) should have led to the prediction of a weaker Cycle 24, the correlation is over 0.7. In the meantime David Hathaway of NASA has recognized: “Relationships have been found between the size of the next cycle maximum and the length of the previous cycle…”.
Summarizing: The current Cycle 24 is in total the weakest since 1820, the probability of a change into stronger activity is only 12% and the length of the cycle can certainly be a useable indicator for the development of the upcoming SC 25. If solar scientists Livingtson and Penn are correct, SC 25 may be even weaker than SC 24  should the magnetic field strength B in the lower chart fall to 1400 Gauss on average. Below this limit no sunspot can be created, as you can see at the bottom of the chart. The last time that happened, it is suspected, was during the solar Maunder Minimum from 1645-1715.

Share this...FacebookTwitterDie kalte Sonne website posted an article yesterday about a Skeptical Science video folly.
============================================
Climate activist group close to IPCC removes video: The science on which it was based, from Stefan Rahmstorf, is no longer the scientific consensus
By Fritz Vahrenholt and Sebastian Lüning (translated/edited by P Gosselin)
For years Skeptical Science has been actively defending the climate catastrophe model scenarios of the IPCC. The name of the website was purposely selected to mislead, as it is not skeptical of the climate catastrophe, like the name implies. Rather it is more skeptical of climate skeptics (“Getting skeptical about global warming skepticism”). At the website, a group of activists discusses the more common climate-skeptical points and attempts to refute them scientifically, which more often than not fails. A look at the discussion there reveals shocking results. For example, an incomplete temperature chart was used as the basis of discussion for showing the climatic impacts of the sun. The temperature plateau of the last 15 years was mysteriously missing.
On 10 January 2013, a new 2-minute video was featured at Skeptical Science, which used the argumentation of Stefan Rahmstorf (Foster & Rahmstorf 2011) to show that the stop in temperature rise of the last years was indeed in agreement with the current IPCC models. So all was well at the IPCC. However, all that changed. A wave of new publications has shown a significantly reduced CO2 climate sensitivity and a stronger influence by ocean cycles. Moreover, scientists dismantled the methodical approach used in the video, and thus the one used by Foster & Rahmstorf (2011). Then about a month later on 21 February 2013, Skeptical Science pulled the emergency brake by taking down the video altogether. When you call up the video at YouTube, there’s nothing to see. At the Skeptical Science site the following message is found:
Update 21/02/2013: Troy Masters is doing some interesting analysis on the methods employed here and by Foster and Rahmstorf. On the basis of his results and my latest analysis I now think that the uncertainties presented here are significantly underestimated, and that the attribution of short term temperature trends is far from settled. There remains a lot of interesting work to be done on this subject.”
On 21 May 2013 Skeptical Science then published an even more detailed error discussion at its site. These efforts are openly welcome, and do help re-establish some confidence in climate science. However the broad rejection of the Foster & Rahmstorf approach by the IPCC colleagues does not come as a surprise. Already on February 4, Die kalte Sonne blog contributor Frank Bosse did a comprehensive error analysis of the dubious Rahmstorf paper. In his blog article “How much man-made influence is there in climate change?” Bosse criticized, writing:

We remove what we know very well and conclude from it: Whatever is left, must be anthropogenic. In the end that’s how you could describe the approach used by F/R 2011. This indeed may be a good strategy to use on TV quiz shows (the process of elimination) and may function reasonably well because there is only a very limited number of possible answers. However in science there’s always something new that gets found. One example is the effect of black carbon, or soot. It has been assigned a warming effect that is approximately  2/3 the effect of the IPCC-assumed CO2 warming effect (see our article ‘Soot is a much greater climate killer than previously thought. Must the CO2 effect now be scaled back?‘). The space that is left for CO2 in the overall equation is becoming increasingly smaller.  Who knows  what we will soon know with greater certainty and what we will be able to remove from the overall equation. Research on solar impacts on our climate is now proceeding at full speed and goes beyond the total solar irradiance (TSI). See our article ‘New US National Research Council Report on the Climate Effect of the Sun‘).”
At his KlimaLounge blog Ramstorf has been silent about the video folly. No comment. The large June 2013 flood seems to be taking most of his media attention.
With all the folly surrounding the video, it’s understandable that readers would want to view it as the latest sorrowful example in the recent science story. Although the original video has been removed by Skeptical Science and is no longer available to the public, some other dedicated climate catastrophe warrior has the video in his Youtube film repertoire. It’ll be interesting to see for how much longer (PS: you may want to save a copy – quickly!):

One question still remains open: Why didn’t Rahmstorf’s science-colleagues even lift a finger when the Foster & Rahmstorf 2011 paper appeared? Did it really have to take 2 years to discover that the simplistic methodical approach was incomplete? Other than scientific reasons, could other reasons be involved here?

"Carbon emissions from the global energy industry last year rose at the fastest rate in almost a decade after extreme weather and surprise swings in global temperatures stoked extra demand for fossil fuels. BP’s annual global energy report, an influential review of the market, revealed for the first time that temperature fluctuations are increasing the world’s use of fossil fuels, in spite of efforts to tackle the climate crisis. The recorded temperature swings – days which are much hotter or colder than normal – helped drive the world’s biggest jump in gas consumption for more than 30 years. They also resulted in a second consecutive annual increase for coal use, reversing three years of decline earlier this decade. Carbon emissions climbed by 2% in 2018, faster than any year since 2011, because the demand for energy easily outstripped the rapid rollout of renewable energy. That level of growth in emissions represents the carbon equivalent of driving an extra 400m combustion engine cars onto the world’s roads, said Spencer Dale, BP’s chief economist. Dale said the increase in the number of extreme weather events and increasing demand for energy could be a vicious cycle. “If there is a link between the growing levels of carbon in the atmosphere and the types of weather patterns observed in 2018 this would raise the possibility of a worrying vicious cycle: increasing levels of carbon leading to more extreme weather patterns, which in turn trigger stronger growth in energy (and carbon emissions) as households and businesses seek to offset their effects” Dale added that the report reveals “a growing mismatch” between society’s rising demand for climate action and the actual pace of progress. Public concern over the global climate breakdown has grown significantly in recent months, driven by factors ranging from the protests led by the teenage activist Greta Thunberg to the Extinction Rebellion action, which brought parts of central London to a standstill. Last week data from the polling company YouGov found that Britons cite the environment as their third highest concern after Brexit and health, and ahead of the economy, crime and immigration. “At a time when society is increasingly concerned about climate change and the need for action, energy demand and emissions are growing at their fastest rate for years,” Dale said. Two-thirds of the world’s energy demand increase was due to higher demand in China, India and the US which was in part due to industrial demand, as well as the “weather effect”. This was spurred by an “outsized” energy appetite in the US which recorded the highest number of days with hotter or colder than average days since the 1950s. “On hot days people turn to their air conditioning and fans, on cold days they turn to their heaters. That has a big impact,” Dale said. The unusually high number of “heating days” has continued in the first months of this year. The combined number of particularly hot and cold days was unusually high in the US, China and Russia where the use of fossil fuels remains high. The US shale heartlands helped to meet its rising energy demand with the biggest ever annual increase in oil and gas production for any country. Bob Dudley, BP’s chief executive, said: “The longer carbon emissions continue to rise, the harder and more costly will be the necessary eventual adjustment to net-zero carbon emissions.” “As I have said before, this is not a race to renewables, but a race to reduce carbon emissions across many fronts,” he added. The report acknowledges that emissions might have been higher without the “extraordinary growth” of renewables, which climbed by 14.5% last year, but warns against relying on green power and electric vehicles. The number of electric vehicles rose by just 2m, to a total of 5m. Dale added that the growth in renewables would need to have climbed by more than twice the rate achieved over the past three years to offset the impact of burning coal for electricity. “Alternatively, the same outcome for carbon emissions could have been achieved by replacing around 10% of coal in the power sector with natural gas,” he said. BP owns vast reserves of gas fields and consistently leads calls for countries to switch from coal to gas. It has also backed industry calls for governments to fund carbon capture technology which can scrub the emissions from the flues of power plants and factories before they reach the air. However, BP will not undertake “material” projects without government funding. “You can’t rely on the generosity of the private sector,” Dale said. The BP report comes amid growing calls for arts institutions to sever their ties with fossil fuel companies. Several leading figures in the art world have called on the National Portrait Gallery to end their sponsorship deals with BP on the eve of their annual awards event this week. At the same time, activists at Extinction Rebellion urged the gallery, and the Royal Opera House, to end their “complicity in climate breakdown”.  Alongside BP’s climate warning, the company has confirmed that Transocean, one of its North Sea contractors, has issued a legal injunction against the Greenpeace activists occupying a BP oil rig in the Cromarty Firth, in Scotland. Greenpeace has vowed to continue with the occupation, despite the legal action, to protest against BP’s plan to drill new oil wells which could hold up to 30m barrels of oil. "

Share this...FacebookTwitterThe Handelsblatt today writes about the newly imposed import tariffs the EU has levied to keep out low-cost, affordable solar panels made in China.
The subheading below the title reads:
With punitive tariffs on solar products, the EU has angered China. The government in Peking has condemned the import tariffs and is now retaliating: with a new anti-dumping process against wine from the EU.”
Here we see who the real intended targets of this retaliation are mainly France, Italy, Spain and Portugal. All these countries are already reeling from high unemployment and find themselves on the brink of social instability. So far Germany seems more or less spared by China’s retaliation. Germany did not support imposing import duties on Chinese solar products. Germany’s Minister of Economics Philipp Rösler (FDP) calls the tariffs “false” and considers them “a big mistake”.
Benny Peiser here calls the move by the EU: “A trade war that can’t be won” launched by “green fanatics“.
The proponents of these tariffs, which will be a whopping 47.6% by August, are putting the jobs of millions of Europeans at stake – only to protect an unviable industry that happens to be the symbol of the Great Green Transformation. Indeed it’s tantamount to throwing the whole baby ward out with the bath water.
For years the EU claimed that solar panels needed to be subsidised so that economies of scale could be achieved, and thus make them cheap, affordable and one day perhaps competitive on the energy market. Thanks to China, that goal was closer than ever. Is the EU rewarding China for this? No. The EU instead is now punishing China for doing what it said needed to be done. Worse, in the end, it is the European consumer who will be punished by this short-sighted protectionist move.

According to Customs, China imported 290 million liters of wine from the EU last year. Imports from the EU make up about two thirds of the total wine imports by China.
We suppose this is not a problem for Europe. The government will just buy up the warehouses of unsold wine and literally pour it down the drain…also at taxpayer expense of course.
Wine is only one option from many that China has to choose from. Other possibilities, if push comes to shove, are Airbus planes, machinery, chemicals, and a vast array of technology.
So what’s behind the trade tariffs? As Benny Peiser writes: green fanatics and a massive solar industry lobby.
Peiser sums it up: “This began as a story about a misguided green attempt to prop up a stumbling industry, but it’s quickly becoming another tale illustrating Europe’s global impotence.”

"When Extinction Rebellion activists shut down London in April, we sounded the alarm loud and clear about the climate and ecological crisis that threatens humanity’s very survival. In response, around the world, governments, local councils, companies and professionals are stepping up and declaring a climate emergency.  And yet, the silence from the major agents of climate destruction remains deafening. In the heart of London, the city that heard our rallying cry to “Act as if the truth is real”, BP, a global fossil fuel giant, is sponsoring the Royal Opera House Big Screen in Trafalgar Square. Rather than denouncing the damage these companies continue to do to our planet, our cultural institutions are lending them legitimacy. On Tuesday evening, Extinction Rebellion Lambeth and rebels from across London will protest before the Big Screen showing of Romeo and Juliet. Their own silent tragedy of Petroleo and Fueliet will highlight the pain and devastation caused to the silent masses and demand our leaders end complicity in climate breakdown. Oil majors have known what is at stake for a long time and have waged multimillion-dollar lobbying campaigns, spinning a web of deceit. Now is the time to expose how they use sponsorship of arts and cultural organisations to greenwash the truth about what they do. BP has made the third biggest contribution to climate change of any company in history. It is time to say: no more. Fossil fuels are the main drivers of the climate crisis, and as coal faces an investor exodus, new oil and gas infrastructure is a growing global threat. In the UK, we’ve seen electricity generation become coal-free for more than a fortnight. This is great news; now the fight for clean energy in the UK must aim at stopping oil and gas expansion, and boosting solar, wind power, battery storage and other low-carbon technology. Further gas or oil exploration is incompatible with keeping global warming below the 1.5 degrees we need to mitigate the risk of societal collapse, mass migration and hunger. New oil exploration is utterly incompatible with preserving life on Earth. Nonetheless, BP plans to spend over $70bn in new gas and oil fields in the coming decade. A Greenpeace Unearthed investigation recently exposed how BP lobbied the Donald Trump administration for drilling rights in the protected Arctic national wildlife refuge, one of the last untouched ecosystems on Earth. This is despite the fact that the company is already responsible for 200,000 gallons of crude oil spilled from pipelines in Alaska in 2006 and the Deepwater Horizon tragedy in 2010. Governments and investors are belatedly waking up to high risk of oil and gas. Last year, New York City divested US$5bn. On Wednesday, the trillion-dollar Norwegian sovereign wealth fund will divest up to US$8bn from around 150 oil and gas exploration companies. BP and the oil majors might not be part of that exclusion list, yet, but the tide is turning. To act in accordance with the realities of climate breakdown, to stand in solidarity with the millions of people already feeling its catastrophic effects, to have any hope of turning the ship around in the small window of time we have left, we can no longer sanction the behaviour of the oil majors. By allowing them to share a platform with our respected cultural organisations we are complicit in the destruction they are wreaking on our planet. Sponsorship deals allow BP to promote itself as a philanthropic organisation and a responsible player in society, maintaining its social licence to operate, while deflecting attention from its destructive impacts on communities and national economies. In April, Extinction Rebellion targeted Shell’s London headquarters. Now it is the turn of BP. In what looks set to be the largest protest against oil sponsorship to date, Extinction Rebellion Lambeth is joining the art-not-oil movement in calling for our cultural institutions to sever their ties with big oil. In February, hundreds of activists occupied the British Museum to protest against its relationship with the oil giant, and today one of the judges of the prestigious Portrait Awards has spoken out and demanded the National Portrait Gallery remove BP sponsorship. The environmental movement is coming together and the pressure is relentless; society will no longer normalise the actions of the oil majors. BP used to be a British state-owned company, and it extends our emissions around the world. It must be stopped – wherever BP goes, protest will follow. • Farhana Yamin is a climate change lawyer and a coordinator of Extinction Rebellion’s international solidarity network"
"For the last week Britain has been encircled by a gigantic loop in the jet stream, the result of which has been some remarkably wet weather for the east of the country. While welcome for places that had been suffering a long drought, it is a stark warning of weather patterns to come.   The warming Arctic and loss of sea ice has meant that the jet stream does not flow strongly, as it once did, from west to east, pushing weather systems steadily across our shores and onwards into the continent. These days, because there is no longer a stark temperature difference between the Arctic and the Atlantic, the jet stream meanders, causing weather extremes by pushing cold air south and warm air far to the north. This can leave giant high-pressure systems, or in our case last week, a large low, trapped and static between these loops. Research shows that this is likely to be a continuing pattern in the future, causing extreme weather events in North America and Europe as the Arctic continues to warm. The good news is that the loop over the UK is breaking down today and the jet stream is reforming. Longer term, however, it appears Britain’s benign weather will become more extreme, more often. "

Share this...FacebookTwitterAnyone who really does his homework and studies the roots of the green movement will soon find himself back in Nazi Germany. This is a conclusion that many independent scholars have arrived at. That feeling of intellectual superiority, infallibility, obsessive intolerance to other views, and being convinced you know what is best for everyone else have a common thread.

“Blut und Boden “(Blood and Soil) celebrates the relationship of a people to the land they occupy and cultivate, and it places a high value on the virtues of rural living. Image source: German Bundesarchiv
The latest on this troubling relationship is an article by the Jerusalem Post titled: The Nazi Roots Of The Green Movement. By BENJAMIN WEINTHAL.
Academic and journalistic research over the past five years shows the key role of Nazi figures in the party’s founding and development. […]
After strong similarities were revealed between an initiative by Germany’s neo- Nazi NPD party last year in a state parliament to demarcate Israeli products and a Green Party federal initiative in the Bundestag to impose a similar system on Israeli goods, critics pointed to the “Brown” — the color symbolizing Nazism – roots of the Green Party in an effort to explain the punitive measure directed at Jewish businesses.
The popular pro-Israel website Lizas Welt tweeted last month, “Not sure what the Greens actually have against Nazis. They even sometimes copy from them.”

This should not surprise anyone, as the Greens are notorious for their delusions of towering superiority, condescending arrogance and their belief they are the ones who ought to be running the world. The Wall Street Journal, noting their snobby, condescending attitude, once wrote a commentary titled: “The Green Supremacists“.
NoTricksZone has looked at the phenomenon on multiple occasions:
– Blut und Boden: Browns feel at home with green ideology.
– Greens and intellectual purity.
– FOCUS: Green movement has very brown roots
– Leading Pollster: Green movement shows shades of Brown
– Intolerance – Green calls for intellectual purity
– Green indoctrination
– Green as an anti-humanistic ideology.
– More intellectual purification, intolerance.
That’s for starters. The phenomenon is undeniable. The Greens of course will deny in the strongest terms that they have anything to do with Nazism – but actions speak much louder than words. The whole world is beginning to notice.
Surely there are many good Greens out there who have nothing but good intentions. For those we ask you to pause a moment and reflect on the kooky movement you’ve hitched your wagon to. Take a look at the global temperature data for the last 15 years. Hello!
I’ll refrain today from linking to that 10:10 No Pressure video as yet another exhibit.

Share this...FacebookTwitterAs the sporadic, unpredictable supply of solar and wind energies increasingly become a part of Germany’s power mix, the country’s electrical grid is becoming more and more unstable and thus vulnerable to a massive power outage.
Dr. Klaus Peter Krause has an article at www.freiewelt.net called “Renewable, but not controllable“, which looks at Germany’s ever more precarious power grid, all thanks to its madly rushed foray into renewable energies, particularly wind and sun. Krause describes the situation in Germany as: “Getting closer to a power outage – The energy policy of madness“.
In the article he brings up a presentation by 2 German power grid experts, Dr. Bernd Benser and Prof. Helmut Alt, which was made at an event organized by the European Institute for Climate and Energy (EIKE).
Most people have experienced a power outage at one time or another, and so may view it as only a nuisance. However, such power outages are almost always very local, isolated, and usually last only a few minutes or a couple of hours at most. But a prolonged, large-scale power outage would be much more than just a nuisance. It would be a catastrophe for a developed country like Germany. Fortunately, few of us have ever experienced that. That may change soon.
Peter Krause reports on how Benser and Alt described what would happen if a large-scale power outage did hit Germany:
What happens when the power goes out
Benser and Alt warned of the consequences of such a power outage and described what it would mean. Here’s just an excerpt: The communication system would immediately go silent or would collapse, if it could function, because of overloading, Fire departments, aid organizations and law enforcement could no longer be reached, payment systems would come to s standstill, ATM machines would no longer dispense cash, water supply and wastewater removal would no longer operate, traffic would jam up completely due to non-functioning traffic lights and signals, entire logistics systems would collapse, production systems would stop functioning, refrigeration systems would stop and perishables would rapidly spoil, air conditioning would cease at in large poultry farms, cows would not be milked, in buildings the electrical blinds for windows would not operate in the morning, also (after 4 hours, at times after just 2 hours) plundering would have to be expected, the medical care system would be crippled as about 90 percent of German hospitals are unable to supply themselves with emergency power for more than 48 hours. According to Benser, six days are needed to bring power back online after a total power outage. “‘n the worst case, we estimate 200,000 dead.“ In high-tech Germany, the most important things practically stop functioning. A large scale power blackout is a national catastrophe scenario.”

Share this...FacebookTwitterGermany’s online Frankfurter Rundschau features an interview with climate scientist Stefan Brönnimann, Director of the Research Group for Climatology at the University of Bern in Switzerland.

Sounding more unsure about CO2 than ever…climate scientist Stefan Brönnimann
If Brönnimann represents what is going on among warmist scientists, it is that global warming scientists are no longer so cocksure about their beloved global warming theory and “settled science”. Increasingly they are admitting that there are still lots of unknown factors and that they are lacking explanations.
On the lack of warming over the last 15 years, Brönnimann admits that they were “unusual”, blaming it on the unexpected lack of “strong El Nino events in the tropical Pacific“. Yet he claims that this and the unusually cold European winters over the last few years “do not refute the CO2 greenhouse gas effect“. However Brönnimann is forced to concede:
Yet, extreme warming scenarios that could not be excluded with certainty are now looking highly improbable.”
Brönnimann is then asked if the climate models are in trouble, as Hans von Storch has been suggesting lately.
We don’t expect the climate models to exactly reflect the precise course of the climate, rather only the long-term changes – that is up to 2050 or 2100. […] A few models show only a slight warming for the last 15 years, which in reality has been the case. At the moment observations and models are still in agreement, but just barely.”
This is what we call clinging to your climate guns and Bible. Brönnimann’s claim reminds of the saying used for the doomed: “Hope is the last to die.” One or two percent of the models being almost right hardly justifies claiming that the models as a whole are still hanging in there.

The gig is just about over. Chart source: www.drroyspencer.com.

Concerning Brönnimann’s comment that the models cannot predict the climate curve exactly, this is an admission that scientists still do not understand the powerful natural factors of sun, clouds, aerosols, and oceans, to name a few. But failure to predict over time is just part of the story
Models that don’t have short-term accuracy also cannot possibly have any regional accuracy
If Brönnimann admits that models are pretty much temporally useless over years and decades, then they also cannot be of any use on regional geographical scales. Yet, hundreds, if not thousands, of models have purported to have the skill to predict regional climate. As a result, many policymakers in lots of countries have even based their national policy on such useless regional models – all with the approval and blessings of the climate scientists. Talk about a con-job.
Brönnimann is asked further about what he thinks may be the uncertainties in the models. Here he says that the uncertainties surround “cloud cover and aerosols” and admits that “also the oceans play a big role because they store lots of thermal energy.” Suddenly climate science is full of uncertainties and unknown variables after all. Then he goes on to say:
That we do not know much about the sun, despite the having researched it for a long time, has two reasons: Firstly there is great uncertainty about fluctuations in solar activity. Just how much the does the sun fluctuate as a whole and how strong are the fluctuations in the UV and the visible light spectrum? Secondly there is uncertainty in on the mechanisms.”
Finally climate scientists are leaving the door open to indirect solar impacts and amplification mechanisms. A little later in the interview Brönnimann is asked about why European winters have been so brutal over the last few years and if it’s possible that the sun may be playing a role. Brönnimann responds:
We’ve determined in a published study: A reduced solar activity leads to weakened westerly air currents over Europe, which normally would bring in air masses from the Atlantic. The result is colder temperatures for Central and Eastern Europe. Some of the recent cooler winters depicted such patterns, and solar activity was low. Therefore there could be a relationship. But it is still just one factor from many.”
Brönnimann now concedes the potential for a multitude of factors. Such is the long journey from activism to science. Climate science is progressing. The door is being left open to the sun and other natural factors. Brönnimann is also asked about the cosmic ray theory (viewed as kryptonite by many climate scientists) proposed by Danish scientist Hendrik Svensmark. His comment:
Experiments are being conducted on that at the Swiss CERN. On one hand it’s about the fundamental processes which are also scientifically interesting for aerosol researchers. And on the other hand its about the actual relevance these processes have on climate. Here results are still missing. We are waiting with excitement.”
At the end of the interview, Brönnimann tries to play down the sun’s impact on climate, and pumps up CO2 as a driver, reminding us that it is expected to lead to a warming of 1.5 to 4.5°C by the year 2100 (based on the models). But as the interview shows, scientists like Brönnimnn are now beingg forced to leave the door open to nature’s powerful climate forces. They are not going anywhere.
Expect that door to open up further with each passing year.

" The mayor of Greater Manchester, Andy Burnham, has pledged to make the region carbon neutral by 2038,more than a decade earlier than the target date adopted by the European commission, at the unveiling of a new industrial strategy. But Burnham was quickly accused of peddling “empty rhetoric” because of the regional authorities’ majority stake in Manchester airport, which aims to double passenger numbers over the next 20 years, and plans to spend £6bn on new roads.  While Burnham said he wanted Manchester to be the “greenest city region in the UK”, Pete Abel of Manchester Friends of the Earth said the current plan would blow “our carbon-budget twice over, putting us on a path to climate chaos”. Abel welcomed Greater Manchester signing up to the 2038 carbon-neutral plan and for setting a science-based carbon budget, but said: “We need to urgently pull the plug on plans that will increase climate-wrecking emissions. Unless Greater Manchester stops planning to build more roads and double passengers flying from Manchester airport, then the climate plan will just look like empty rhetoric.” Burnham said it was not hypocritical to make his pledge despite Greater Manchester councils owning 65% of the airport and air travel being a major producer of carbon emissions. “Aviation is a national and international issue, it’s not something that a region can influence,” he added. The mayor, who has frequently called for more powers at a local level, aid any attempts to cut air travel should be made byWestminster. “I am all in favour of tough decisions at a national level. I don’t believe there should be a third runway at Heathrow, for instance. But I think those are decisions for national government,” he said. Manchester airport wants to increase passenger numbers from more than 25 million to 45 million by 2040, but Burnham insisted that growth could come from other UK airports. “I’m not necessarily calling for more flights to the UK – it might mean taking passengers from other places,” he said. “But there is a debate to be had about aviation isn’t there? There are changing public attitudes about aviation. Rather than just saying no to people flying, don’t we need to accelerate research into low and zero carbon forms of aviation?” Greater Manchester’s new industrial strategy also talks about reducing car use to no more than half of all daily trips by 2040 – “this will mean finding ways to create a radical change in behaviour, with a million more trips each day using public transport, cycling and walking”. Though Burnham has committed £160m for the development of Greater Manchester’s “bee network” of safe routes to walk or cycle, almost £6bn of road schemes are being mooted in the region, including £5.4bn for an extension to the M60 and M62 near Bolton and £477m for a motorway link through the Goyt valley in Stockport. On Wednesday Manchester city council announced plans for a £9.1m revamp of Great Ancoats Street, a key commuter route just outside the city centre, which did not include any provision for cyclists. The council signed up last year to a manifesto proposed by Chris Boardman, the Olympic gold medal-winning cyclist who is Greater Manchester’s walking and cycling commissioner. The manifesto promises to “ensure all upcoming public realm and infrastructure investments, alongside all related policy programmes, have walking and cycling integrated at the development stage”. Sir Richard Leese, the longstanding leader of the city council, said the Great Ancoats Street redesign aimed to “take traffic out of the city centre” and included multiple pedestrian crossings. A new cycling route would run parallel to it on quieter roads, he said. "

Share this...FacebookTwitterFor a science claimed to have been settled already years ago, there sure are lots of new, profound questions popping up. For example: Why has global warming stopped? or Why are European winters getting bitter cold? or Why have the models been so wrong? or Where are the hurricanes!
Now there’s another question that has been unsettling scientists as of late: Why is Antarctic sea ice expanding?

This is one question a German research institute now aims to answer. Antarctica has long been a painful thorn in the warmists’ side. Hopefully a real answer will be found, and not some concocted plausible-sounding explanation of the sort we’ve been getting lately.
Germany’s polar research center Alfred Wegener Institute located in Bremerhaven has issued a press release about its upcoming expedition to Antarctica.

Below I’ve highlighted the part describing one of the purposes of the expedition:
Bremerhaven, 6 June 2013. A group of researchers from the Alfred Wegener Institute, Helmholtz Centre for Polar and Marine Research is flying to South Africa today. However this trip south is no summer holiday, but rather the start of a special journey: on Saturday, 8 June 2013 the research vessel Polarstern will be embarking on an expedition to the Antarctic winter. 49 researchers from institutes in twelve countries together with 44 crew members will spend a good two months in the Southern Ocean. They will be exploring the sea ice, the atmosphere and the ocean, until the expedition comes to an end on 12 August in Punta Arenas, Chile. 
The research ice-breaker Polarstern is one of the few ships in the world that is able to navigate the Antarctic Ocean in the winter. At this time of the year the Weddell Sea, which is the destination of the expedition, is covered by sea ice, and the members of the expedition team will face temperatures of around minus 30 degrees Celsius and the polar night with only a few hours of twilight. These special conditions have meant that not enough research has been carried out into several physical, chemical and biological processes in the Antarctic winter. The Antarctic plays a key role in the Earth System: It is where the so-called deep water, which drives global ocean currents, is formed.
Chief scientist Prof. Dr. Peter Lemke from the Alfred Wegener Institute has assembled an international team and is taking the most modern research equipment on the expedition in order to obtain baseline data in the wintery Antarctic. On the Greenwich Meridian through to the Antarctic coast the team plans to investigate, for example, the fundamental question of why Antarctic sea ice is expanding slightly whilst the sea ice cover in the Arctic is steadily shrinking.
The second half of the expedition then moves on to the incipient spring: the planned route takes the Polarstern from the Antarctic coast in a north-westerly direction, away from the polar night and into the rising sun. The second central question addressed by the research programme looks at which mechanisms permit the ecosystem of the Southern Ocean to come back to life after the long, cold and dark winter.

"The net zero carbon target will require sweeping changes to almost every aspect of British life, affecting our homes, food and the way we get around, as well as jobs and businesses across the board. Ministers hope there will be health benefits and improvements to the natural environment along the way, as well as helping to stave off the global climate emergency. On some of the key areas where rapid change is needed, however, the signals so far have been mixed.  Phasing out coal use and bringing more renewable energy on stream are the key planks of the government’s strategy. Gas has become an increasingly important source of fuel in the last three decades, particularly for domestic heating, but to reach net zero it will have to be phased out too. Support for renewable energy has been reduced and in some cases scrapped by the government. Onshore wind is now one of the cheapest forms of energy, but the withdrawal of subsidies and stricter planning rules have resulted in a dearth of new projects, though offshore wind is continuing to make progress. The number of new solar installations plunged by 94% in April, according to Labour, after the government’s withdrawal of support. Chris Hewett, the chief executive of the Solar Trade Association, says: “Solar and wind are now the lowest cost forms of power generation in the UK, yet there is no route to market and government is continuing to subsidise the fossil fuels it is aiming to phase out.” The number of jobs in renewable energy in the UK fell by about a third, from 36,000 in 2014 to 25,000 in 2017, according to the union Prospect. Carbon capture and storage will be needed if we are to continue to use any fossil fuels. A long-running £1bn competition to build the first large-scale demonstration project for the technology was scrapped by George Osborne, but the government says that smaller projects not requiring taxpayer assistance could start to develop. Controversially for some, the Committee on Climate Change says fracking is compatible with a net-zero target – but only if the gas produced displaces gas which would otherwise have been imported. There are only about 210,000 electric vehicles in the UK. About 1% of households use an all-electric car and about 2% hybrids, so tens of millions of cars will have to be replaced. Public transport, walking, cycling and ways of working that avoid travel will also be part of the solution. Darren Shirley, the chief executive of the Campaign for Better Transport, says: “In the coming weeks the government should commit to restarting the programme of rail electrification, outlining further incentives to rapidly grow the market in electric vehicles in the UK, and start work on publishing a national strategy for buses with investment to grow the network and green the bus fleet to be published by 2020.” The government has pledged to phase out diesel and petrol cars by 2040, but that target should be brought forward to 2030, according to the CCC. The government has slashed support for electric vehicles, resulting in slower take-up. A lack of charging points is also hitting demand. There are about 8,500, but they are not spread evenly across the country, and some towns have few or none. The CCC notes that the number of flights we take can continue to grow at least in the short term provided emissions come down in other areas, but campaigners say the decision to allow Heathrow’s expansion will blow away any chance of reducing the UK’s overall transport emissions. All newly built homes – of which the UK needs a record number to solve the housing crisis – were meant to be zero emissions from 2016 under plans from the Labour government in 2006. Those plans were scrapped in 2015 on cost grounds, and now there are few requirements for new-build houses to incorporate energy-saving features or renewable generation. Government policy is key to making the built environment, which accounts for roughly 40% of the UK’s carbon footprint, more climate friendly, says Juliet Barfield, an architect at Marks Barfield. “The government must regulate if we want to bring down emissions.” Repurposing and refurbishing existing buildings is nearly always preferable to demolishing and rebuilding, unless the existing construction is dangerous or of such poor quality it cannot be remedied. Concrete is one of the most commonly used construction materials, but associated emissions are sky-high. If the global concrete industry were a country, it would be the world’s third biggest emitter. Alternative materials from timber to wool are not widely used, and while innovators are working on ways to bring down emissions from concrete – using additives from coffee grounds to beetroot, for instance – it remains a significant source of carbon. When new buildings are needed, a long-term vision – at least 50 years, for the lifetime of a building – and resisting cost-cutting temptations are also important. Barfield notes that high ceilings make buildings more liveable and easier to adapt in future, as well as having benefits in ventilation and light that help in designing ways to reduce energy use. Many architects, however, come under pressure to reduce ceiling height to squeeze in more rooms, which limits the building’s future potential. Less than 1% of Britain’s housing stock each year is newly built, and old homes tend to be leaky, draughty, costly to heat and inefficient. The government scrapped measures, such as the “green deal” policy, to insulate existing housing stock. Cash-strapped local authorities lack the resources to offer the insulation needed, even though it would save residents money and improve their health. The CCC recommends turning down heating to 19C in winter, but that may be of little comfort to people in unsuitable and uninsulated homes. Heavy industries such as steel and chemicals currently come under the EU’s emissions trading scheme. Companies are awarded a certain number of allowances to emit carbon dioxide, some free and some paid for, and the most efficient can sell any spares to laggards, who are supposed to be spurred by the additional cost to mend their ways. The system has suffered many setbacks in its nearly 15 years of operation, but it is still one of the main ways in which industry is held to account for its contribution to global heating. It is not yet known what, if anything, will replace emissions trading after Brexit, when manufacturers and other heavy industries are likely to come under increasing economic pressure if trade is disrupted. Manufacturing output has already come under pressure from the prospect of a no-deal exit, but losing manufacturing in the UK will not reduce carbon emissions overall, but will increase reliance on imports. More than a tenth of greenhouse gas emissions comes from agriculture and this proportion is rising as other sectors have been able to reduce emissions faster. Growing more trees is the key plank of the government’s strategy on land use, along with better soil management. Michael Gove, the environment secretary, has set out plans for the UK’s first soil strategy since the “dig for victory” campaigns of the second world war. Soil is one of the world’s biggest carbon sinks, but can also be a major source of carbon depending on the farming techniques used. Details of the strategy are still to come, and when it comes to tree planting farmers face some uncertainty. There are benefits under the common agricultural policy for planting new and maintaining existing trees, but these can be complex and hard to access. The government has promised £50m for rural tree planting in England to meet its target of 10m new trees across the countryside. The UK is one of the least wooded countries in Europe, with 10% of land forested in England, 15% in Wales, 19% in Scotland and only 8% in Northern Ireland. Urban trees can also be a vital way of reducing carbon, cleaning air and reducing the impact of climate change by providing shade and health benefits. The government has put up £10m for 130,000 new trees in towns and cities in the next two years. There is no national policy, however, and some local authorities and landowners such as Network Rail have embarked on tree-cutting programmes without clear oversight of the environmental costs and benefits. Our heavy consumption of meat is taking a toll on our health as well as the planet, and farmers can help reduce emissions from livestock, for instance by improving their diet so they produce less methane. Ultimately, however, meat consumption must be reduced. Moving from a high-meat to a low-meat diet would cut emissions by 35%, the CCC found. Biodegradable food waste must not be sent to landfill, where it rots to produce methane, after 2025, according to the CCC. Food waste should be avoided as far as possible to bring down agricultural emissions. Unavoidable food waste, treated properly with anaerobic digestion, can be a source of natural gas to be used for heating or electricity generation, displacing fossil fuels. Tim Benton, the dean of strategic research at the University of Leeds, says food will only increase in importance as a source of greenhouse gases. He says: “When you have reduced everything else – energy, transport, and so on – the thing you’re left with is food.” When the UK first made its “dash for gas”, it was in the context of closing coal mines and the aftermath of the miners’ strike of the 1980s. Hundreds of thousands of workers in traditional coal-mining areas lost their jobs and the devastation is still keenly felt across swathes of the UK. The recent and enduring memory of that loss and upheaval should act as a warning of how not to engineer a transition to a new form of economy, trade unions believe. Sue Ferns, Prospect’s senior deputy director general, says: “We need a just transition for all the workers affected and this means we need to work proactively to ensure that the damage inflicted on coal communities in the 1980s is not repeated.”"

Share this...FacebookTwitterWith leaders from 35 countries now meeting at the Petersberger Climate Dialogue in Berlin, every German government-funded institute is now busily issuing press releases to get their two cents worth of alarmism in. The DWD national German Weather Service is no exception.
Two days ago it tweeted a message telling the public that it only “feels like its cooling“. You see, the last 5 bitter-cold winters are just in our heads.

Figure 1: The DWD tweets: “Climate press conference of the DWD: #Temperature will continue rising globally – inspite it feels like it’s cooling #Winter.”
With every press release coming out of the DWD, two things are becoming clear: 1) It is becoming increasingly activist and misleading and 2) its statements are more and more confused and contradictory.
Temperatures are rising, even if they are stagnant
It seems the DWD can’t decide whether temperatures are rising or stagnating. Its latest (2013) press release says (my emphasis):
Global temperature, despite the current stagnation, is rising over the long term. ‘The Earth’s mean temperature has stagnated over the last 15 years at a high level. However, it is not necessary to rewrite the story of climate change,’ underscores Dr. Paul Becker, Vice President of the German Weather Service (DWD) at its annual climate press conference of the Federal Authorities in Berlin.”
In 2013 they write global temperature has stagnated over the last 15 years.
But in May 2012 they wrote:
The long-term trend of rising temperatures in Germany and worldwide continues uninterrrupted.”
Well, which statement is the false one?
Of course the DWD may protest and claim the warming is long-term trend and the stagnation is not. Is it really? Let’s take a look at the temperature data for Germany since 1890.

Figure 2: Germany’s annual mean temperature chart. Source: EIKE.
Above we see a more or less flat trend from 1890 to 1985, i.e. 95 years. It is only from 1985 to 2000 (15 years) that we have seen a temperature jump. And then from 2000 until now we have a declining trend. How can the brief rise of 1985 – 2000 be called “longterm” and the last 15 years not?
The following chart shows Germany’s mean annual temperature for the last 15 years.

Figure 3: Germany’s annual mean temperature. Data source: Deutsche Wetterdienst, Chart by: EIKE
The models from “climate scientists” projected 0.4°C of warming for the above shown period. But in reality, precisely the opposite occurred! The German Weather Service provides no explanation for this. Instead they simply tell readers that it’s getting warmer (over the long-term) and tweet that the cold is only in our heads.

Using the cold 1961-1990 period as a reference
Another trick the DWD likes to use is the cold period of 1960 – 1990 as the reference. This is how they come up with all the warm anomalies for today. The DWD writes on global temperatures:
Although the years 2011 and 2012 did not set any records globally – they are among the 12 warmest years since 1880 with an annual mean temperature of of 0.5°C over the 1961-1990 reference period.”
On Germany’s mean annual temperatures, again they use the cold 1960 to 1990 period (many weather outfits use the 1980 – 2010 period), see Figure 2.
Also the mean temperature of 9.1°C for 2012 was significantly over the mean of 8.2°C. The year 2012 was thus the 16th warmest since 1881. According to evaluations conducted by the DWD, 24 of the last 30 years in Germany were too warm.”
That is if you compare the last 30 years to the cold 1961-1990 period. This is how DWD creates headlines.
DWD says he (felt) cooling is caused by natural drivers
Natural influences currently are masking the man-made climate change. Even a few years without records, or isolated weather periods – for example a winter that is too cool – are thus not suitable to draw real statements on climate change. The question of climate change must be viewed over the long-term. We cannot expect that temperature increase to occur as smoothly as the CO2 increase in the atmosphere. Climate is impacted by many factors. Among them solar irradiance and volcanic activity, as well as large internal variability of the climate, for example the regular changes in the sea surface temperature in the Pacific through Eö Nino and La Nina.
Here they make it a point to totally ignore the powerful PDO and AMO cycles, who positive phases occurred precisely during the 1980 – 2000 warming. Best not to bring that up.
The DWD press release concedes there are many unknowns:
Becker: “All these effects overlap each other and  to some extent mask man-made climate change  – of which there is no doubt. Today for this reason we still cannot say which factors are 2/3 of the impact on our climate. But we’re convinced: Over the long run the man-made impact is the strongest and thus a further temperature increase is coming.”
This brings us to an old question that remains unanswered today: “If unknown factors are acting to cool global temperature today, then why are these very factors not repsonsible for the warming from 1980 to 2000?
The DWD spreads the fear of a public health crisis
The DWD finishes the press release by stoking up public health disaster scenarios resulting from climate change and embellishing in some unbridled speculation. Here it seems to be extending its outdated logo-chart way out to yonder. The DWD writes:
The temperature increase will not only be limited to outdoors, but will also impact indoors. Climate scientists have determined that from May to September for the upper Rhine region, in an average year, 15% of the average nighttime indoor temperatures are over 25°C. By the middle of this century, that figure will rise to 35%.”
The increasingly alarmist DWD also writes that life for people with allergies could get a lot more miserable.
People with allergies are going to suffer from pollen a lot more. […] Becker: ‘The bad news for people who have allergies is: They are going to have to struggle with other types of pollen and are going to have to live with longer pollen seasons.’ Just these few mentioned aspects show, according to DWD estimates,  what explosiveness as a whole the expected changes could have for the people in our country.”
This is ludicrous speculation based extrapolating the outdated curve that it uses as its logo. It’s hard to think of any orgnaization that has deteoriated so much in the klast few years.
It was once one of the world’s most renown and respected weather institutes. But in the recent years, during a time of cooling German temperatures no less, it has meandered off deep into the realms of the unserious, and is rapidly approaching the preposterous and absurd.
It’s not the climate that is radically changing – but rather it’s the institutions that monitor it.

"Scottish police have begun talks with climate protesters from Greenpeace after its activists boarded an oil rig heading out to the North Sea. Two protesters climbed on to the 27,000-tonne platform as it was being towed out of the Cromarty Firth, north of Inverness, after Greenpeace used boats to intercept it at about 6.30pm on Sunday. The two activists unfurled a banner bearing the words “climate emergency” – a reference to the urgent need to reduce and halt fossil fuel use – after occupying a gantry on one leg of the rig underneath its main deck. Greenpeace said the protesters had enough food for several days and were planning to remain on board until BP abandoned its new oilfields and switched to investing in renewables. On Monday, Police Scotland liaison officers met Greenpeace support staff to try to negotiate a peaceful end to the occupation. As yet, no police officers are thought to have boarded the rig, but Greenpeace expects BP to quickly launch court proceedings in an effort to force the activists off the vessel. BP refused to comment on its plans. The rig, Paul B Loyd Jr, is owned by Transocean and leased to BP for £140,000 a day. It was a Transocean rig operated by BP that caused the Deepwater Horizon disaster in the Gulf of Mexico. BREAKING: Two activists are blocking a @BP_plc oil rig from setting out to the North Sea where it intends to drill for 30 million barrels of oil. We're in a #ClimateEmergency - the age of oil is over. RT to show your support! #NoMoreOil  In a statement released by Greenpeace, an activist on the rig called Jo said: “Warm words flow from BP on their commitment to tackling climate change. Yet this rig, and the 30m barrels it seeks to drill, are a sure a sign that BP are committed to business as usual, fuelling a climate emergency that threatens millions of lives and the future of the living world.” A Police Scotland spokesman said: “In relation to the ongoing protest involving Greenpeace in the Cromarty Firth, Police Scotland is working with the operators, the port authority and other interested parties in an effort to resolve the situation as safely as possible.” Nicola Sturgeon, the Scottish first minister, has adopted a tough target set by the UK Committee on Climate Change (CCC) to cut Scotland’s carbon emissions to net zero by 2045, but has not accepted demands to close down North Sea oilfields as a matter of urgency. The UK government has not yet accepted the CCC’s net zero target of 2050 for the UK as a whole. The net zero concept allows some burning of fossil fuels, as long as the CO2 is captured and stored underground, or offset by tree planting or similar measures. The Committee on Climate Change says cutting greenhouse gas emissions to zero by 2050 is necessary, affordable and desirable. Here are some of the actions needed to make that happen: • Petrol and diesel cars banned from sale ideally by 2030 and 2035 at the latest. • Quadrupling clean electricity production from wind, solar and perhaps nuclear, plus batteries to store it and connections to Europe to share the load. • Connection of new homes to the gas grid ending in 2025, with boilers using clean hydrogen or replaced by electric powered heat pumps. Plus, all homes and appliances being highly efficient.   • Beef, lamb and dairy consumption falling by 20%, though this is far lower than other studies recommend and a bigger shift to plant-based diets would make meeting the zero target easier. • A fifth of all farmland – 15% of the UK – being converted to tree planting and growing biofuel crops and restoration of peat bogs. This is vital to take CO2 out of the air to balance unavoidable emissions from cattle and planes. • 1.5bn new trees will be needed, meaning more than 150 football pitches a day of new forests from now to 2050. • Flying would not be banned, but the number of flights will depend on how much airlines can cut emissions with electric planes or biofuels.  Describing the protesters’ actions as irresponsible for putting themselves and others at risk, BP said: “We share the protesters’ concerns about the climate. We support the Paris agreement. And we are working every day to advance the world’s transition to a low-carbon future. “We’re reducing emissions from our own operations – down 1.7m tonnes last year – improving our products to help our customers reduce their emissions, and creating new low carbon businesses. We are committed to being part of the solution to the climate challenge facing all of us.” "
"Activist groups are stepping up their efforts to lobby Australia’s biggest companies on climate policy as the corporate sector prepares for the annual general meeting season. Some of Australia’s best-known companies could face hostile shareholder resolutions at their annual meetings in the spring as the battle over climate policy moves into the country’s boardrooms. Westpac acknowledged on Thursday that it has a “variance” in opinion with the Business Council of Australia over “climate and energy policy and advocacy”. The bank, which is committed to action to achieve net zero emissions, did not spell out exactly what the variance entailed. It emphasised that it agreed with the BCA, which counts more than 100 of Australia’s biggest companies as members, on support for the Paris agreement and a carbon price. Sign up to receive the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning “We respect that industry associations may hold different views – but where there is a difference we engage with the leadership,” a Westpac spokesman said. “We have identified considerable alignment with the BCA, including their support for the Paris Agreement – however there is some variance around our respective positions on climate and energy policy and advocacy.” But the BCA’s advocacy for Kyoto carryover credits and extending the life of coal-fired power stations has led some activists to doubt that it can also support the Paris agreement to cut emissions, as its website states. It was also outspoken in its condemnation of Labor’s policy to cut carbon emissions by 45%, calling the proposal “economy wrecking”. Westpac was among several companies reviewing their membership of business associations in the light of divergent opinion about climate policy, along with BHP, Rio Tinto and Telstra, according to the Australasian Centre for Corporate Responsibility (ACCR). The BCA rejects claims that the stances are incompatible and says Kyoto carryover credits are not prohibited by the UN. A BCA spokesperson said: “We have long supported action to tackle climate change. That’s why we support a realistic, pragmatic plan to manage the transition to a lower carbon economy which includes a market-based, economy-wide mechanism to reduce emissions, give businesses the ability to plan for the future, meet our Paris commitments and achieve net-zero emissions by 2050.” But Australian companies could nevertheless face a series of shareholder revolts at this year’s AGMs. The ACCR’s Dan Gocher said Westpac had committed to carrying out a review after the ACCR threatened a shareholder resolution at the bank’s AGM last year. The lobbying effort included “identifying to Westpac” that the BCA’s interventions in discussion of climate policy appeared to contravene the bank’s own position. “It would have looked a little silly if Westpac said they were in complete alignment with the BCA,” he said. “By not identifying the ‘variances’, it lets the BCA off the hook, so to speak. Investors are increasingly focusing on lobbying, but their focus to date has been on resources companies.” Gocher said the ACCR was meeting up to 20 large companies, including Coles, Woolworths and Qantas, to lobby them ahead of the AGM season. “Running up to the AGM season we are meeting companies, investors and trying to get them to understand these issues. If the company doesn’t understand we consider filing a resolution at the AGM,” he said. It follows a series of successful challenges by shareholder activists against the boards of large companies during last year’s AGM season, notably Telstra, Tabcorp and Westpac. “We are trying to weaken the influence of groups such as the BCA, the Australian Petroleum Production & Exploration Association and the Minerals Council of Australia. They have played a destructive role on climate for 20 years and have never been the subject of scrutiny.” Emma Herd, the chief executive at the Investor Group on Climate Change, said investors around the world were looking for companies to be constructive participants in the discussion on climate change and in “getting effective policy in place”. She said investors were increasingly voting on resolutions at AGMs and also pushing behind closed doors for more effective action. “Investors are less interested in statements on paper and more interested in how companies are going to align their strategy with the decarbonising economy,” she said."
"One of Theresa May’s most consequential decisions of her unhappy premiership is to set a legally binding target for the UK to cut its greenhouse gas emissions by 2050. If it were to be achieved, this would mark the end of Britain’s contribution to global warming, apart from the those emissions “exported” by buying products made abroad. It is undoubtedly a very good thing that her successor will not only be left with draft laws to enact, but also with raised public expectation that they do so. Mrs May’s decision comes not a moment too soon. The influential BP review of worldwide energy use estimates that global CO2 emissions grew by 2% in 2018, the fastest growth for seven years. This country ought to reach net-zero emissions before the middle of the century. Clear policy direction is essential to change the way we produce, distribute and consume energy. The cleaning of the British economy can be traced back to the landmark decision by the European Union in 2007 to implement “20-20-20” green targets: reducing greenhouse gases by at least 20% below 1990 levels by 2020; for 20% of energy consumption to come from renewables; and 20% reduction in energy use. The impact has been dramatic.  A decade ago, 80% of the UK’s electricity came from fossil fuels. Now, not only is electricity demand falling in the UK, but the country also gets about a half of it from low-carbon sources. What flowed from the historic 2007 EU deal was a series of national decisions in the UK, such as phasing out coal and investing in renewables. Ministers, however, have recently lost the focus on climate change, despite its existential threat, and the UK is recklessly opening new coal mines, extending Heathrow airport and pushing fracking. The climate emergency requires ministers to dispense with such political expediency. Net zero means no one will be able to emit much greenhouse gas in 30 years’ time. Ministers will have to come up with a route map to deal with the carbon-intensive sectors of transport, heating homes and businesses, and agriculture. In these bits of the economy carbon, emissions are either rising or flatlining. What is needed is a government that will balance the ecosystem, rather than obsessing with balancing its budget. The market won’t deliver technological change on its own. The state is needed to design regulation so environmental and social objectives can be met. The UK ought to copy California and require carmakers to sell a fixed proportion of their overall sales as electric cars. It must start subsidising bus routes, not cut funding for them. Big cities will need mass transport systems. Agriculture will have to peel itself away from oil-intensive farming. Perhaps the biggest challenge is the heating of homes and businesses, 90% of which rely on fossil fuels. That needs a hydrogen economy built almost from scratch. All this is feasible; the technologies are available and could become much cheaper if they were widely deployed. What has been missing is the political ambition; it is a shame that Mrs May only supplied this as she is departing."

Share this...FacebookTwitterLondon publisher Stacey International will soon be releasing the German skeptic best seller book “Die kalte Sonne” in English under the title: The Neglected Sun.
Reader Loodt Pretorius writes:
Amazon UK will release the book The Neglected Sun on 12 September and are taking pre-release orders at £10.99, a big discount to the Amazon USA price. This may be of interest to your English readers and followers in Europe.”
That is indeed a great price. For the German version I paid 25 euros last year. At the price of £10.99, you may want to think about getting copies to give out as Christmas or birthday presents.
The English version has been updated.
The German version created a wave of outrage among the warmists and one of the authors, Fritz Vahrenholt, had to get personal body guards. So do be careful being seen reading this book in public. Some Birkenstock-wearing, granola-eating planet-rescuer may attack you.
The book cites hundreds of peer-reviewed papers that the new IPCC 5AR will surely ignore.
Even though I had followed and blogged about climate science for years, this book helped fill in lots of knowledge gaps that I had earlier.
After reading the first chapter of the English version, which I’ve had the chance to see in advance, I can assure that you won’t be able to put it down. The warmists aren’t going to like this book.

"A member of the Trump administration’s National Security Council has sought help from advisers of a conservative thinktank to challenge the reality of a human-induced climate crisis, a trove of his emails show.  William Happer, a physicist appointed by the White House to counter the federal government’s own climate science, reached out to the Heartland Institute, one of the most prominent groups to dispute that burning fossil fuels is causing dangerous global heating, in March.  In the messages, part of a group of emails obtained under the Freedom of Information Act, Happer and the Heartland adviser Hal Doiron discuss Happer’s scientific arguments in a paper attempting to knock down the concept of climate emergency, as well as ideas to make the work “more useful to a wider readership”. Happer writes he had already discussed the work with another Heartland adviser, Thomas Wysmuller. The emails from 2018 and 2019, received by the Environmental Defense Fund and provided to the Associated Press, also show Happer’s dismay that Jim Bridenstine, the Nasa administrator, had come round to accepting the science of climate breakdown. In May 2018, an exchange between Happer and Heartland’s Wysmuller called Bridenstine’s change of heart “a puzzle” and copied in the Nasa administrator to urge him to “systematically sidestep” established science on temperature increases and sea level rise that the duo call “nonsense”. This was followed by a February 2019 email in which Happer relays a complaint to James Morhard, Nasa’s deputy administrator, about climate crisis information on the space agency’s website. “I’m concerned that many children are being indoctrinated by this bad science,” said the email that Happer forwarded. Happer has argued that carbon dioxide emissions actually benefit the planet rather than drive harmful climate disruption, once claiming that carbon dioxide has been demonized much like “the poor Jews under Hitler”. The physicist was previously a leader and co-founder of an advocacy group called the CO2 Coalition that received money from far-right organizations and fossil fuel interests such as the Mercer Family Foundation and the Charles Koch Institute. Earlier this year the Trump administration launched an NSC initiative in which a panel would challenge the well-established findings of the government’s own agencies, including Nasa, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (Noaa) and the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), as well as international climate scientists, that human activity is causing the planet to dangerously heat up. The Trump administration has recently ramped up its efforts to muzzle its own scientists from acknowledging the reality of the climate crisis. Last month, the White House barred a state department official from giving written testimony to Congress that the climate emergency was “possibly catastrophic”. The testimony of the official, Rod Schoonover, was critiqued by Happer but the state department refused his suggestions to remove references to harm caused by global heating. “These people are endangering all of us by promoting anti-science in service of fossil fuel interests over the American interests,” Michael Mann, a Pennsylvania State University climate scientist, told the AP."

Share this...FacebookTwitterThe European Institute for Climate and Energy (EIKE) here links to an article published by Stimme Russlands (Voice of Russia). The article is titled: Die Welt vor einer Eiszeit, in English: The World On The Verge Of An Ice Age.
Reports of global cooling are becoming more frequent. FLASHBACK: 30 experts predict cooling.

You’ll notice that this Voice of Russia report is more than a month old, and so one wonders why it was never picked up by the western mainstream media.
The article writes that Russian scientists are predicting that “a little ice age will begin in 2014“. The article adds:
They reject the claim of global warming and call it a marketing trick.”
Wow! That’s heavy.
When it comes to warming and the man-made CO2 greenhouse gas effect, the Voice of Russia writes that “Russian scientist Vladimir Bashkin is categorically in disagreement. He claims that the climatic changes are characterized by cycles and have nothing to do in any way with the activities of man.”

The Voice of Russia continues:
Together with his colleague Rauf Galiullin from the Institute for Fundamental Problems of Biology of the Russian Academy Of Science, he demonstrates that the current warming is a reverberation of the planet coming out of the ‘Little Ice Age’ and that in the near future, of course measured on geological timescales, we are at the threshold of an ice age.”
The Voice of Russia quotes Bashkin:
The periods of a cooling and a warming follow each other at 30-40 year intervals. In Russia for example there was a warming in the 1930s, a time when seafaring at the Northern Sea Route was possible, then a cooling followed during the wartime years, and then warming followed in the 1970s, etc.. The current warming period ended at the end of the millennium.“
Note here that the Russian scientists confirm that the Arctic sea ice extent was also low in the 1930s. This tells us that nothing is really so unusual in the Arctic today.
The Voice of Russia then explains that the cooling is related to “a change in solar activity” and that this “also has an impact on our climate“. Bashkin adds:
The scientific research of the climate of the past geological epoch causes us to doubt the motives behind the demands of the IPCC. […] “The greenhouse effect that is connected with the anthropogenic factor is about 4 or 5 percent of that from natural emissions. The eruption of a volcano produces more. A real contribution to the greenhouse effect is made by normal water vapor. Thank God nobody has gotten the idea that this too needs to be regulated.“
The Voice of Russia continues: “The world’s oceans contain 60 times more carbon dioxide than the atmosphere. When the temperature of the planet rises, it begins to be quickly released. This leads to an increase in atmospheric CO2 concentration, and not vice versa. A global warming that so many are talking about is not so much a scientific problem, rather it is much more a marketing trick. […] We do not have global warming ahead of us, rather we have global cooling, the Russian scientist claims. However, we do not need to fear the cooling because it will take place gradually and won’t be noticeable until the middle of the 21st century.”
The scientists add that part of the motive behind the “marketing trick” is to manipulate the market for fossil fuels.

"Young people will advise ministers on how the UK should meet the target of ending carbon emissions by 2050, to which Theresa May committed the nation on Wednesday. The commitment to net zero greenhouse gas emissions was described as “historic” by leading figures. But the UK is not yet on track to meet its 2025 and 2030 goals, so a huge transformation of energy, transport and buildings is urgently required.  Thirty young people, aged 15-24, will assess how this should be done, starting in July. They will present their recommendations to ministers after the summer. The Youth Steering Group was founded in February to provide perspectives on all issues and has now been tasked with examining the climate, wildlife and plastic crises. Young people striking from school in the UK and around the world have pushed public concern over the climate emergency to record levels. Following the visit in April by the first school striker, Greta Thunberg, the environment has risen to third in the public’s concerns, with only Brexit and health ranked higher. Amanda Chetwynd-Cowieson, the chair of the British Youth Council, the charity hosting the Youth Steering Group, said: “Young people are both the custodians and the inheritors of the natural world. We are proud to be working with the government to assess progress, and set out our views on the priorities for environmental protection and conservation.” Izzy Warren of the UK Student Climate Network, which helps coordinate the school strikes, said: “[We] have undoubtedly played an integral role in pressuring the government to act. However, the legislation and target year for 2050 is severely lacking in ambition and disregards any sense of climate justice. Simply put, it’s too late.” The Committee on Climate Change says cutting greenhouse gas emissions to zero by 2050 is necessary, affordable and desirable. Here are some of the actions needed to make that happen: • Petrol and diesel cars banned from sale ideally by 2030 and 2035 at the latest. • Quadrupling clean electricity production from wind, solar and perhaps nuclear, plus batteries to store it and connections to Europe to share the load. • Connection of new homes to the gas grid ending in 2025, with boilers using clean hydrogen or replaced by electric powered heat pumps. Plus, all homes and appliances being highly efficient.   • Beef, lamb and dairy consumption falling by 20%, though this is far lower than other studies recommend and a bigger shift to plant-based diets would make meeting the zero target easier. • A fifth of all farmland – 15% of the UK – being converted to tree planting and growing biofuel crops and restoration of peat bogs. This is vital to take CO2 out of the air to balance unavoidable emissions from cattle and planes. • 1.5bn new trees will be needed, meaning more than 150 football pitches a day of new forests from now to 2050. • Flying would not be banned, but the number of flights will depend on how much airlines can cut emissions with electric planes or biofuels.  The government followed the guidance of its official advisers, the Committee on Climate Change (CCC), in setting the 2050 date, but others argue it should be sooner. Clara Goldsmith at the Climate Coalition said: “The past 10 years have shown incredible cost reductions in clean technologies, so we firmly believe the UK can go even further, driving innovation to reach net zero before 2045.” Prof Mark Maslin of University College London said acting sooner would create more green jobs: “We must adopt a 2030 zero carbon target.” The government did not accept the CCC’s advice that the net zero target for 2050 should be met solely by cutting emissions in the UK, and not buying carbon offsets from abroad. A government spokesperson said the option of offsets was “a sensible contingency that we don’t intend to use” and might help reduce the cost of cutting emissions. Alison Doig at Christian Aid said this was very disappointing. “It is vital the government emissions reductions are not merely outsourced through dodgy loopholes. Otherwise this target will end up as state-sponsored greenwashing,” she said. However, the CCC gave a more sanguine reaction, while emphasising that meeting the 2050 target by cutting domestic emissions was preferable and entirely possible. Chris Stark, the CCC chief executive, said: “If the world is addressing climate change as it must, then by mid-century, when we really need these credits, they will be very expensive because every country in the world will be demanding them. But I don’t feel I can be overly critical of the government if they want to try and make them work [as a contingency].”. The UK government’s net zero target was hailed as “historic” by both Laurence Tubiana, one of the architects of the 2015 Paris climate deal, and Lord Nicholas Stern at the London School of Economics. Stern led a landmark 2006 review of the economics of climate change, which concluded: “The benefits of strong and early action far outweigh the economic costs of not acting.” The chancellor, Philip Hammond, had told the prime minister the costs of the meeting the net zero target could be £1tn over 30 years, but was widely criticised as having failed to factor in the benefits. Stern said: “The Treasury should recognise that the significant investments required for the zero-carbon transition will yield very substantial economic returns, such as reductions in air pollution and greater energy efficiency, as well as the avoided impacts of dangerous climate change. “This is a very attractive path of inclusive and clean growth with great advantages nationally and internationally for the UK.” The prime minister said there would be a review of the net zero target in five years “to confirm other countries are taking similarly ambitious action and ensuring that our industries do not face unfair competition”, a move seen as a concession to Hammond. But Stern said the review was unfortunate: “This could create uncertainty for businesses, ultimately making the transition more expensive.”"

Share this...FacebookTwitterOver the last few days, parts of Germany have been hit by some of the worst flooding seen in 100 years after heavy rains hit southern and eastern regions over a period of 4 days. Since then armies of climate charlatans have appeared in the media claiming it’s all because of man’s fossil sins.
Today the German Weather Service (DWD) issued a press release. I’ll remind readers that the DWD is now under the control of warmist activists, who have far more faith in crystal ball fortune-telling models than they do in real observations. Here are some excerpts of the DWD press release:
After the extreme precipitation of the last days, especially in southern and eastern Germany, and the subsequent devastating flooding situation, citizens are asking two questions: How often can something like this happen, and do we have to expect such extreme events more often in the future because of climate change? What follows are some explanations by the German Weather Service (DWD).”
The DWD then explains that flooding in general is nothing really unusual, but that this time the extreme flooding was due to a large weather system and the 4 days of heavy precipitation it brought with it. Some 22.75 billion metric tonnes of water fell onto Germany. That’s 22.75 cubic kilometers! Moreover, the ground had been already saturated from of a wet month of May and, to make things worse, snowmelt in the Alps added to the water mass. In summary a number of factors happened to converge.
The question of course is: Did this happen because of climate change? The DWD writes (my emphasis):
Analyses by the DWD over the period of 1951 to 2000 show no distinct trend of more extreme precipitation events can be derived. However there is a trend to more precipitation days with 30 liters and more per square meter – especially in the winter. Global warming shows an increase, which means more water vapor in the atmosphere. The latest climate analyses and projections show a tendency to more wet low pressure systems over Central Europe. The median annual number increases 20% accordingly from 1951 until the end of the century.”

As they added the word “projections” we can assume here they mean the end of the 21st century. Note how sloppy (tricky) they are with the communication by blurring the past and the future. If you read carefully, they seem to be saying no trend from 1951 to 2000, yet their projections show 20% increase by 2100, leading a reader tio believe that there is an overall upward trend. If a reader doesn’t read carefully, then he may easily get the idea that there is a “20% trend” The reality however is: their real observations show no trend, but their crystal balls foretell a 20% increase by 2100.
Should we believe the DWD crystal balls? Like Richard Feynman said: “If the observations don’t match your guess, then your guess is wrong. That’s all there is to it.” It doesn’t matter how many awards you got, how renowned the newspapers say you are, or if you think you won a Nobel Prize, or if your are the director of the Weather Service – it’s wrong.
As a final note, Dr. Roy Spencer shows us just how well 73 climate climate models are doing so far:

Unfortunately I can’t attend. But if anyone else does, your report on the event may be published here at NoTricksZone.
Admission is free. Here is the announcement in English:
Relationship between greenhouse gases and global temperature!
Interpretations of climate revolve about changes of atmospheric composition, which involve an increase of greenhouse gases. Carbon dioxide and methane are each emitted by human activities, as well as a host of native processes. Their relationship to global temperature is central to understanding current climate and how it will evolve.
Atmospheric composition and temperature are found to obey a clear two-pronged relationship in the proxy record from ice cores, which represents ancient changes that operate on time scales longer than several thousand years. A similar relationship is found to be obeyed in the observed record of actual atmospheric measurements, which represents modern changes that operate on time scales shorter than a century. Supporting analysis shows that the two relationships are connected. It reveals a common physical mechanism behind changes of composition in the two records. The physics common to the records provides unified insight into recorded changes of greenhouse gases, those apparent in the proxy record of ancient composition as well as those actually observed during the 20th century. The governing relationship is then compared against the relationship that prevails in climate models, in their simulation of future changes.”

Share this...FacebookTwitterGerman EU Parliamentarian Holger Krahmer has posted a very interesting view on Obama’s recently announced new climate initiatives, which aim to reduce USA’s CO2 emissions 50% by 2030.
Photo: MEP Holger Krahmer, EU
The reductions are supposedly to come mainly from “the shut down of coal power plants and the introduction of more renewable energies“.
But Krahmer calls Obama’s plan “a bluff”, and Europe is falling for it.
The announced efforts are in truth not efforts, and the reductions in CO2 emissions for the USA can be reached without any additional cost. American CO2 emissions have been falling for years, and have been so without any action from the government – ever since affordable gas from unconventional sources has started replacing coal as a source of energy. One could call the shale gas revolution also the market-economy energy revolution. […]

One look at the numbers shows: Coal’s share of the USA’s energy mix has been steadily dropping since 2007, from 48.9% to 37.4% in 2012. On the other hand, the share of natural gas has gone from 21.7% to 30.4% for the same time period.”
America’s use of renewable energy has also increased, but are still practically insignificant in the overall energy mix. Obama’s initiative is one that tries to grab credit for what the free-market economy is doing on its own already. As a result of the reduction in coal, Krahmer writes:
American CO2 emissions in the same time period dropped 13.5%. Of course it would not be serious to make a straight line extrapolation to the year 2030, but one can see that gas in the USA will continue its boom and that it will lead to a shift in the energy mix in favor of gas. Obama’s climate promises are only anticipating a development that is completely independent of any measures by the US government. In other words: It’s a reduction in US-CO2 emissions that is based on the fortune of having huge gas reserves at its disposal, and it is going to cost the USA nothing. Making promises that don’t cost anything is easy. And Obama did precisely that at his recent speech at Georgetown University.”
Krahmer then asks what shall the USA do with its vast coal reserves, which the country will no longer need. Krahmer writes that the answer is a no-brainer:
The coal will be exported. In 2012 the USA exported 125.7 million tonnes. In 2007 the amount was only 59.1 million tonnes. In just five years the USA was able to double its coal exports. The grateful customers of this American coal just happens to be self-anointed climate protection bulwark Europe, which in 2012 took in half of the total US coal exports. When Obama is serious about his climate promises, then he is not casting into question – as he announced – the financial support for coal power plant construction in foreign countries, but rather the export of American coal. Because this is not to be expected, nothing more needs to be said in regards to the free trade agreement with Europe.”

"Theresa May has sought to cement some legacy in the weeks before she steps down as prime minister by enshrining in law a commitment to reach net zero carbon emissions by 2050, making Britain the first major economy to do so. The commitment, to be made in an amendment to the Climate Change Act laid in parliament on Wednesday, would make the UK the first member of the G7 group of industrialised nations to legislate for net zero emissions, Downing Street said.  Environmental groups welcomed the goal but expressed disappointment that the plan would allow the UK to achieve it in part through international carbon credits, something Greenpeace said would “shift the burden to developing nations”. Last week No 10 dismissed claims from the chancellor, Philip Hammond, that such a target would cost £1tn and could thus require spending cuts to public services. With May departing as prime minister next month, as soon as her successor is chosen, she has stepped up efforts on policy areas sidelined by Brexit, including new spending commitments, efforts to tackle modern slavery and the environment. The 2050 target, in an amendment being put down as a statutory instrument, meaning it does not require a vote of MPs, will be one of the most ambitious such goals set by a major polluting nation. France proposed net zero emissions legislation this year, while some smaller countries have gone for dates before 2050, such as Finland (2035) and Norway (2030), though the latter allows the buying of carbon offsets. While the 2050 date was recommended by the UK’s official Committee on Climate Change (CCC), May has rejected its advice on international carbon credits, whereby a country can pay for cuts elsewhere in lieu of domestic emissions. John Gummer, the CCC chair, said last month it was “essential” that such credits were not used. Doug Parr, the chief scientist for Greenpeace UK, said the target was “a big moment for everyone in the climate movement” and a legacy May could be proud of. However, he said the “loopholes” of allowing international carbon credits would need to be unpicked and the target date moved forward. “As the birthplace of the Industrial Revolution, it is right that the UK is the world’s first major economy to commit to completely end its contribution to climate change, but trying to shift the burden to developing nations through international carbon credits undermines that commitment,” he said. “This type of offsetting has a history of failure and is not, according to the government’s climate advisers, cost-efficient.” May, who will mark the target on Wednesday by meeting science and engineering students, said it was “the time to go further and faster to safeguard the environment for our children”. She said: “This country led the world in innovation during the Industrial Revolution, and now we must lead the world to a cleaner, greener form of growth. Standing by is not an option. Reaching net zero by 2050 is an ambitious target but it is crucial that we achieve it to ensure we protect our planet for future generations.” The plan was endorsed by the CBI’s head, Carolyn Fairbairn, who said such efforts “can drive UK competitiveness and secure long-term prosperity”. She added: “Some sectors will need clear pathways to enable investment in low-carbon technologies, and it is vital that there is cross-government coordination on the policies and regulation needed to deliver a clean future.” Downing Street poured scorn last week on Hammond’s warnings, disclosed in a leaked letter, saying the supposed £1tn figure ignored both the economic benefits of action and the costs of not doing anything. A Treasury source said Hammond fully backed the 2050 net zero target but had pushed for a full costing of the plan to make sure it did not negatively impact on other areas of public spending. May has rushed through the legislation with one eye on her legacy after being effectively forced out of office before doing everything she wanted to in terms of domestic policy. Downing Street sources said implementing the target before she leaves No 10 in a few weeks’ time was extremely important to May. It is understood she also reminded her colleagues in cabinet on Tuesday morning that she wanted them to make sure they did not forget about dealing with the fallout from Grenfell Tower after she leaves office."

Share this...FacebookTwitterTo mark the start of the new decade, NoTricksZone and its readers made a climate bet (see right side bar) against two warmists from Skeptical Science: Rob Honeycutt and Dana Nuccitelli (and others). Also see update-5. The warmists are pledging more than $14,000.00!
Rob overall has been a good sport and is a pleasure to deal with. Dana, on the other hand, has been, shall we say, a bit abrasive.

The coolists are clearly in the lead. Chart by Robin Pittwood – Kiwi Thinker
The bet is on whether or not the current 2011-2020 decade would be warmer or cooler than the previous 2001-2010 decade. NTZ and its readers say it will be cooler or the same. Messieurs Honeycutt and Nuccitelli say it’s going to get warmer for sure. After all, man is spewing more CO2 into the atmosphere than ever. The money won will be donated to a charity for children in need.
Almost two and half years have now passed and I think it’s a good time to see how the bet is coming along. Thanks to Robin Pittwood and his Kiwi Thinker blog, we now have preliminary results for the first 2 years and 5 months.
Clearly in the chart above we see that the current decade is running a bit cooler than the last one. In fact, temperatures haven’t warmed in 15 years.
Of course it’s still early and nobody really knows what tricks Mother Nature could play. But Rob and Dana really should be scratching their heads, though. Okay, the bet was made before they found out that oceans eat up warming. Indeed it is warming, they insist, but the cooling is just covering it up! You just wait…the warming will be back, they keep saying. And when it comes back, it’ll be for real. Besides, cooling is caused by warming anyway. Right?
Problem is, nobody knows when the warming will be back. Even the Prince of Global Warming Darkness himself, Hans-Joachim Schellnhuber of the Palace of Doom and Gloom in Potsdam recently said the warming may be delayed even another decade. Doesn’t look good, Rob and Dana.

Like I wrote, it’s remotely possible that it will warm a bit this decade, and maybe Rob and Dana could even eke out a victory. But will a few hundredths or even a tenth of a degree be enough?
Not really because of the model projections are rising much faster and the divergence between observed temperature and model projections will be more glaring than ever. Even if the two do pull off an upset, it’ll be a hollow victory. They’ll still have lost the science argument, which is all about sensitivity. By the end of the decade, it could be that we will not have seen any significant warming in over 22 years.

Temperature would have to jump 0.4°C in the next 7 years just to be at the lower range of the model projections. Chart: www.drroyspencer.com/
To be on the safe side, I’ve asked Robin Pittwood to disclose his calculations and the data he used to produce his non-hockey stick chart.
First he told me he had lost the data, then he told me that it was private property and that I was not privy to it. Next he said it was not covered by the Freedom of Information Act, and so he didn’t have to provide it. He also asked why he should provide it to me if my sole aim was just to find something wrong with it. Then he said I had to be a scientist to see it. During all of this he told the press that I was just a hack of Big Oil and the coal industry. But I never relented, and so he eventually coughed it up. /sarc 🙂

Thanks Robin!

"The worst part about being lied to is knowing that you weren’t worth the truth. — Jean-Paul Sartre Australia’s emissions have increased four years in a row. Excluding the land sector, our emissions have never been higher.  As the gravity of the unfolding climate emergency begins to dawn upon Australians, instead of lies and obfuscation from our elected representatives, we urgently need leadership capable of navigating our economy to a prosperous, zero-emissions future. Cynically, the prime minister, Scott Morrison, has designated Angus Taylor as the minister for emissions reduction and, unfortunately, telling the truth doesn’t seem to be Taylor’s strong suit. (“You’re wrong, Barry,” interjected Taylor when the former host of ABC Insiders correctly pointed out that emissions were on the rise.)Taylor never did deliver on his last posting, as the minister for reducing power prices. In his latest derogation of duty, he held back publication of the national emissions accounts. When he did finally front the media he falsely claimed seven times in two and a half minutes that the government’s plans to reduce emissions by 26% to 28% were “laid out to the last tonne” — when the government has no such plan. In 2005 Australia’s total carbon emissions were 610 megatonnes. Reducing emissions by 26%, the lower end of our “ambition”, would mean annual emissions of 451 Mt. In 2015 our annual emissions reached their lowest point since 2005 at 530.7 Mt, some 13% below 2005 levels. They have increased every quarter thereafter. With LNG production set to increase 12.9% in 2019, there is no reversal in sight. Since our 2015 emissions nadir, the land sector and a slew of new wind and solar projects have delivered welcome emissions cuts. But all this progress has been wiped out by large increases from other sectors, especially from the “fugitive gas” released during gas extraction and processing. There may come a quarter soon where the clean energy boom delivers such standout emissions reduction that increases in other sectors are temporarily offset. It would have come sooner if Taylor hadn’t worked so hard behind the scenes in 2014-15 to slash the renewable energy target, in a move that has cost Australia thousands of jobs, gigawatts of cheap power and up to 6 Mt of carbon abatement a year. The Morrison government’s weak commitment to reducing emissions is evidenced by its climate solutions package (CSP), with its largest proposed “reduction” through an accounting trick – claiming credit for past tree-clearing that didn’t happen and that won’t avoid a single tonne of future emissions. The second biggest proposed reduction is the carbon reduction fund, which was set up to buy $200m of carbon offsets annually. In the treasurer Josh Frydenberg’s first budget, he slashed the program to just $47m a year over the forward estimates. Even if funding were restored, the CRF’s total efforts would be swamped by the emissions of just one or two of our 10 operating LNG projects. The third biggest proposed reduction is the amorphous category named “technology improvements and other sources of abatement”, ie, crossing our fingers and hoping that emissions fall through no efforts of our own. The CSP even includes 10 Mt abatement via an “electric vehicle strategy” – awkward, given Taylor’s derision towards EVs during the election. Regardless, the government has conceded that the strategy won’t be released until mid-2020. The figure below shows several emissions trajectories. The government’s CSP scenario (the orange line) sees emissions almost flatlining through the Paris agreement period, eventually reaching zero in 2980! Clearly the CSP does not deliver 26% emissions reductions (the green line) by 2030, or deliver Australia’s share of decarbonising the economy. For Australia to do our fair share of meeting the Paris budget, the CSP leaves us with the impossible task of decarbonising the economy in just three years from 2030. A steeper trajectory before 2030 gives us breathing room for a more realistic trajectory afterwards. It’s important to remember why reducing emissions is so important. As Joelle Gergis told RN Breakfast on Tuesday, in terms of climate, Australia is the most vulnerable nation in the developed world. At 2C we effectively lose the Great Barrier Reef, the natural wonder, the biodiversity and the tens of thousands of jobs. We’re on track for 4C of warming, which would make much of the country a living hell.  This month I travelled to China as part of a “Smart Energy” delegation. In Shenzhen, where every bus and taxi is fully electric, we toured the factory of BYD, where many of its 250,000-strong workforce are building the energy storage and transport systems of tomorrow. Our tomorrow, their today. We toured the highly advanced factory of Jinko Solar. With 10.5 gigawatts of annual production, Jinko is the largest solar panel manufacturer in the world. These “factories of the future” are no longer dependent upon cheap labour, but on big investments, smart manufacturing, world-leading quality systems and highly skilled researchers and engineers. As we dither, China zooms past. Prof Ross Garnaut paints a picture of Australia as a superpower of the post-carbon world economy. Our world-leading wind and solar resources can and should be harnessed into making the world’s lowest-emissions steel, aluminium and lithium, instead of just exporting ore. Our cheap clean energy can be turned into hydrogen, the “God molecule” of the post-carbon industrial era, and the economics are shifting such that it may soon make sense to export electricity by subsea cable to our south-east Asian neighbours. Has Angus Taylor ever set out a vision for Australia’s energy future that’s even remotely compelling? Anything other than caretaking a highly polluting 20th century energy system while we push civilisation further into climate chaos? No. Taylor ducks and weaves around the bad news in our quarterly emissions data, suggesting that Australia should be applauded for exporting gas. As experts have pointed out, claims about the environmental benefits of gas are “grossly exaggerated” and “likely to be wrong”, and, if we want praise for small, potential emissions reductions overseas, we must also take responsibility for the large, actual footprint of our coal exports. Ask Taylor in which year emissions will fall to 451 Mt — 26% below 2005 levels — and you’ll get no straight answer. History won’t be kind to this energy minister for approaching the climate challenge with all the care and subtlety that Captain Smith of the Titanic approached the fatal iceberg. History will be doubly harsh on Taylor for his failure to navigate a course that captures the economic opportunities of the global energy transition. • Simon Holmes à Court is senior adviser to the Climate and Energy College at Melbourne University This piece was amended on 24 June to clarify the attribution of second graph"

The climate calamitologists depend on a continuous calamity supply: high temperature records, the occasional flood, forest fires, tornadoes striking cities, and hurricanes wiping out coastal areas, preferably the heavily populated. Some tropical storm Sandy damage to Staten Island will probably remain un-repaired simply because it is proximate to New York City and all the media therein. It’s very handy for photo-ops and as background for TV climate docu-drama talking heads. As everyone seems to be making money from these copyrighted pictures, none are included here.
The current spate of stories about temperature records in the western U. S. is a case in point. These temperature “records” are all produced by locations that are designed to produce temperature records. The automated station at Bad Water in Death Valley is just one example. As John Daly pointed out, and Anthony Watts reiterated, the station is backed up against a western-facing cliff, right in front of a black-top highway and centered on the black-top parking area, with a white salt pan to the west to reflect the afternoon heat. Just go to Google Street View on the highway and spin the view around. The whole area looks like a giant boy-scout solar bake-oven. Sooner or later, this spot will produce a world record high temperature, which will be publicized across the world as proof of global warming/climate change/extreme weather, or whatever the buzz-phrase de jour.
Another example is Mercury, Nevada. You don’t suppose the name refers to the local summer temperature, do you? Both weather stations there are at the airport (of course). The station next the the asphalt is the one setting records (of course). One gets tired of pointing out that all weather stations at airports are surrounded by large expanses of tarmac (Black), and little else, except the occasional taxiing jet hairdryer-on-steroids. Both airports and aircraft have increased in size during this period of “global warming.” Could there possibly be a connection? I still await that article in the approved, peer-reviewed literature.
The loss of 19 firefighters in Arizona during a west coast heat wave was a gift from heaven for the Calamitologists. But please don’t notice that they died attempting to save homes built in a forest. These homes should not have been there, or at least should have been protected by firebreaks constructed before the fire and not during the fire as these brave men were attempting. Thirty years ago, this calamity would not have happened because the homes would not have been there.
Much has been made of natural disasters blamed on climate change. Few people point out that the opportunity for disaster has increased due to the growth of cites. Look at this picture of Texas from the ISS.

Source NASA, Public Domain. Texas at night from the International Space Station: Houston, lower right center; Dallas-Fort Worth, upper center; San Antonio, left center; Austin to the right of San Antonio; Port Arthur, lower right; Galveston, lower left.
Large parts of even the huge state of Texas are now covered by city. The odds of a tornado touching down in a populated area are increasing with the development of each suburb. That path of light from San Antonio to Dallas is Interstate Highway 35. Any tornado crossing that highway appears to have about a 50% chance of striking a populated area. Only a few years ago in that area, only beef cattle and the occasional oil rig were in danger. The recent storms that caused damage in the Oklahoma City area are also examples of tornadoes in areas where only 30 years ago there was only farmland. In “tornado alley” (the American plains states) with declining tornado activity, in spite of increased detection capability, (see here), (and more data here), the increasing size of cities is insuring a steady rise in urban damage, playing right into the hands of the Calamitologists.
None of the things described above have anything to do with climate and everything to do with population and infrastructure growth. But sooner or later the economic policies followed by the West will begin to limit growth. Any decrease in urban damage will be because there less urban value to damage. Weather will still do what it normally does.

Share this...FacebookTwitterSometimes I really wonder about the people major media outlets choose to interview. The ones with the most spectacularly catastrophic visions get all the attention.
German scientist Lutz Wicke (photo right) said in an interview with the Süddeutsche Zeitung (SZ) that “future generations will curse us climate scientists” and that we now find ourselves in an “absolutely desperate situation” with regards to climate protection.
H/t: Oliver Geden @Twitter.
Wicke’s alarmist interview comes on the heels of the 4th International Petersberger Climate Dialogue in Berlin, which was supposed to lay the groundwork for the next UN climate conference in Warsaw in November. Representatives from 35 countries atteneded the Berlin Petersberger Climate Dialoge. However, little if any progress was achieved.
If Lutz Wicke is an indication, then activist scientists are becoming increasingly frustrated, outraged and impatient.
Wicke is from the Institute for Environmental Management at the ESCP Europe and in the interview “he is demanding that climate scientists worldwide join together and exert more influence on policymaking.”
Wicke says there’s absolutely no reason for optimism when it comes to nations finding an effective agreement to stem global warming.
Wicke has visions of Sahara-like summers
Wicke expects global temperature this century to rise 4°C, which, he says “means 8°C in the Mediterranaen region“:
Then in the summertime we will have heat waves there like in the Sahara. The living space of billions of people will destroyed.”
Wicke seems to suffer from acute climaphobia and to be obsessed with end-of-world scenarios. One thing is certain: he’s intent on spreading his fear to the readers of the Süddeutsche.
For a long time, the lack of progress in implementing an eco-authoritarianism on the world was blamed on political leaders, especially those from the USA, China and India. But now Wicke says climate scientists must take a share of the blame:
…they should have appropriately advised the political leaders. That didn’t happen. Even climate politicians are not expert enough to tell us in detail how agreements are to be designed so that a reduction in emissions can be reached.”
Wicke angry that states failed to boss citizens around
Here Wicke advocates that climate-paranoid scientists write international agreements for politicians. It gets better. A little later on in the interview he says:
It is crystal clear that states worldwide are not able to require themselves to appropriately reduce their emissions of climate gases, or to comply to these requirements. They can’t influence their citizens and the economy so that they accept it.”
In Wicke’s view, states just aren’t capable of bossing around their citizens and getting them to commit economic suicide. European climate alarmists are growing impatient.
Later in the interview Wicke suggests limiting per capita CO2 emissions globally to five tons per person, or taxing fossil fuels so much that they’ll be too expensive to use.

So why aren’t these brilliant ideas not being discussed, the Süddeutsche asks? Wicke:
Among other other things, climate scientists have been much too quiet about this.”
Wicke says scientists should write the international agreements
Amusingly, the Süddeutsche asks Wicke if climate scienists really are the right people to hammer out international agreements. Wicke:
Who, when not us, should politcians, who we meet at climate conferences, should make concrete proposals? Climate science cannot restrict itself to develoiping computer models. For that, the matter is just too important and dramatic.”
Then he says climate scientists need more funding so that they can do the things they need to do to rescue the planet.
Wicke: climate scientists can rescue the future generations
Wicke disagrees with Hans von Storch, who says science should deliver the results and leave the job of policymaking to the policymakers and citizenry. But Wicke insists:
Scientists cannot act like it’s all none of their business. We can’t just provide the diagnosis and then quit. We also have to try to prevent the prognoses from happening. This is about the destiny of future generations.”
Gee, who really stands to benefit in that deal? What would a roofing company be tempted to tell a homeowner who isn’t allowed to get a second opinion?
By now we get the sense that this Wicke scientist obviously is interested in only one thing. And we thought Schellnhuber was bad.
The Süddeutsche then correctly points out that scienitists in the past have made many false prognoses, so can the scientists really be trusted? Wicke:
The models must undergo continuous correction, that’s completely clear. But in the meantime the biggest problems we had at the start of climate science have been overcome. Also in the next 7-year IPCC report there will again certainly be small corrections to the earlier prognoses. But the certainty of how things will develop will be even greater. And we can thus expect the worst fears to be confirmed … with business as usual there will be with a high probability an increase in temperature of around 6°C by 2100. […]
If we do nothing now, then also us climate scientists will be cursed by the future generationsfor not having done enough to avoid the catastrophes – even though we knew they would happen.”
Just for Wicke, and his followers, here’s a chart showing what “small corrections” are needed:

"The Nationals MP Michelle Landry has conceded she does not have an exact figure for the number of ongoing jobs to be created by Adani’s Carmichael coalmine, but claimed it would be “considerable”. In an interview marking the Queensland government’s decision to sign off on Adani’s groundwater management plan, Landry also compared the mine to an apartment block in Sydney, arguing that in neither case could regulators be certain of the environmental impact of the projects. The chief executive of the Australian Conservation Foundation, Kelly O’Shanassy, has accused the Queensland government of adopting a “dig it and see approach” by allowing the mine to proceed with checks on its effect on ground springs to follow. Sign up to receive the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Landry told Radio National she believed the mine would proceed because Adani had done “everything they’ve been asked to do”. “This mine has the strictest environmental conditions of any mine in this nation,” she said. “There is continued ongoing work about the springs – because we certainly don’t want it damaged … it will be constantly monitored.” Landry claimed that “nobody is certain with anything”. “When you build a housing block or estates down in Sydney – people don’t know what that actually does to things, [likewise] when people build farms in areas.” Landry said the Adani mine would create “6,750 indirect jobs, 1,500 direct”, of which 750 jobs would be fly-in fly-out from each of Rockhampton and Townsville. “There’s a rail line being built, there’s a lot of businesses right around central and northern Queensland that will be providing services,” she said. Asked about the number of ongoing jobs, Landry said it would be “well over 2,000” and rejected claims the mine would be fully automated, citing assurances from Adani Australia’s chief executive, Lucas Dow. “He has assured us there will be as many local jobs as we can possibly have and, you know, you can’t set a figure [on it] … I haven’t got the figure – I could get the figure for you – I could ring Lucas [Dow] and get the figure. “I haven’t had the total number of jobs … [but it is] considerable,” she said. “I’ve never actually asked a specific number.” Landry suggested the number of ongoing jobs would be “thousands and thousands”, citing the fact that “a lot of contractors are involved in this”. The agriculture minister, Bridget McKenzie, has previously said the mine would create 1,500 jobs in the construction phase and 100 ongoing jobs, before claiming “there could be up to 1,800 ongoing jobs”. In its latest statements Adani has said the number of ongoing operational jobs at the mine would not be 1,800 but between 800 and 1,500, based on mines of similar size in Queensland. Landry said opposition to the Carmichael mine was “crazy” because other coalmines had been approved while Adani had sought approval for it. “I’m sick and tired of people saying we’re doing the wrong thing up here.” On Friday the Queensland government raised more questions about the federal government’s decision to rush out its approval of Adani’s groundwater management plan before calling the federal election, with the state’s environment minister saying it “reeked of political interference”."

Cooling Will Be Worse Than We Thought

At Weatherbell.com, we try to show people the ‘why’ before the ‘what’.  My father taught me that if you are right, then you should have the reason why first, and not excuses for being wrong later.
From where I stand, the reasons why we are right are clear. But the barrage of excuses coming from the other side is growing shriller with each passing day. And the idea that people spouting the CO2 idea are being driven from the field in spite of the overwhelming evidence against them is nonsense. When facts don’t matter, it’s not the facts that will force them to quit. This is well beyond science. Any rational person can see what is going on and can say that in the least there is enough doubt to stop the madness that demonizes those that disagree. In reality, their point has been driven from the field.
What I am doing here is giving you the ‘why’ before the ‘what’. What I’m amazed at is how people can keep seeing things that are opposite of what they claimed would happen 5 years ago, simply change the terminology and then say the things they say. That kind of mentality is one that does not accept any answer except the one they think it should be. So the fight is not on a level of a normal argument. The arguing is with people who believe they possess the “truth” and that anything short of their “truth” cannot be tolerated.
But we must smile and fight with facts. Debunk, and try not to demean.
In any case the following link will be very helpful in trying to get my point across, and I am going to use relative humidity and mixing ratios to show some of this: weather.cod.edu.pdf.
Here is why this should be simple: Energy can neither be created nor destroyed. So what is the source of energy to the Earth? Answer: the sun. If outgoing radiation equals incoming, then there is no trapping and all this hullabaloo is a moot point. Since that is the case, the game should be over.
However if you want to start confusing the issue, then you assign major importance to very minor items, control the language, and then you can control the perception.
The fact is that the Earth has been warming since the very cold period of the 1700s (Little Ice Age). It just so happened sunspots were in the tank, and it was cold. When sunspot activity increased, the Earth responded by getting warmer. Should be simple, right? The link to the oceans in the overall rise that has occurred is obvious in the graph below (from the outstanding site: Climate4you.com/.

Figure 1: CO2 concentration and global temperature.
 The cumulative effect of the warm AMO and PDO added heat to the atmosphere, so temps rose from the late 1970s to around 2000. After the air absorbed the heat, it leveled off, the PDO flipped, and we started trending down.
Simply using the PDO, as seen in the chart below from Wikipedia, shows an almost direct correlation:
The warm years from the late 1970s to a bit beyond 2000, the latest downturn can be seen as well. The Pacific is much larger than the Atlantic, but the Atlantic turned warm in the mid-1990s so it is still not fully on board with the cooling. But when it does turn, chances are global temps will respond as one would expect knowing the heat capacity of the ocean is 1000 times that of the atmosphere. This chart alone should cast doubt, if not slay, the CO2 dragon being a major climate factor, if any at all. It’s simply too small to do what these people spouting this agenda-driven idea say it will.

Figure 2: Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO)
Again the overall rise of the past 200 years is easily explained by sunspots, which is why a lot of people are nervous about cooling. After all, if you are claiming the sun caused the warming, and you take it away, and the oceans flip to their negative phase, and a couple of volcanoes blow to boot, then there is real trouble. Hence the triple crown of cooling, which I showed on national TV 4 years ago when explaining why the cooling would commence, and by 2030 temperatures would return to levels seen in the late 1970s.
As for CO2, the rise may be due in part to a lag that FOLLOWS warming, and doesn’t cause it. Since the 1950s, the only time CO2 was correlated was when the oceans warmed. This is not brain surgery.
There is science and pseudo-science. Science comes up with an idea like the oceans are causing warming, and when they cool, the air cools. Pseudo-science says: well CO2 is adding to this, but how much? IT’S A QUESTION THAT CAN NEVER BE ANSWERED. Does the question then become: Would we already be heading into a mini ice age were it not for CO2 saving us?  How do you answer that?  Untold amounts of money are being thrown at a question that isn’t even something of consideration.

Now here is the problem. Temps have been dropping as you can see…not a lot, but some. But what should be very disturbing for planners and people looking forward is that the Relative Humidity is dropping. That means the wet bulb has dropped more than the temperatures. 

Figure 3: 300 mb (top); 600 mb (middle) 1000 mb (bottom).
Why is the RH dropping? Think about it. A cooling Pacific, especially in the tropics, means less water vapor available to the system. So we get the initial temperature drop off because of the cooling Pacific is no longer adding to the warmth of the air – primarily in the tropics. But the RH is dropping too.
Where it’s dry, it does warm up and the large dry land areas do warm in the summer season, until such the entire earth/ocean system adjusts (the AMO flips to cold too). But the drop of RH, seen above in the chart is a big hint!
Notice how at this time, the 1000 mb is lagging. Eventually, though, the transport of moisture from the lagging low levels will cool the mid levels (increased moisture leading to temperatures falling toward the wet bulb),  leading to more instability, more cloudiness. Until a balance is reached, the earth’s temps will cool. Perhaps faster!
A look at the skew T and the mixing ratio relationship to temperature really drives my point home about why this is a distortion of temps and not warming. By distortion I mean its obviously warmer in the northern areas, but THE COOLING IN THE TROPICAL AREAS, EVEN THOUGH MUCH SMALLER, CARRIES HAS A FAR GREATER IMPACT ON THE WEATHER AND CLIMATE.
A way to think about it like 2 people that weigh the  same, but one may have more mass in one part of the body than the other.
An example of this can be seen when one looks at what it takes to change the mixing ratio 2g/kg at 30°C vs -20°C.
Look at how the mixing ratios increase dramatically with higher temps. In other words, suppose we lower the temps 1°C at 30°C (from Wikipedia chart).

Figure 4: Mixing ratios
Doing so, we would change the mixing ratio by about 2g/kg. Now how much of a rise at -20C would we need to offset that? At -20°C the mixing ratio is about 0.7 g/kg. To move up 2 g to 2.7 g/kg, we would have to raise the temp about 15°C.
The changes in temperatures in the tropics have a much greater overall impact on the climate than those in the Arctic. It is, if you will, easy to warm cold, dry air, but to cool warm tropical air is much harder.  So if the Earth’s temperature is about steady, or falling off a bit as we saw in the graph above, and the Arctic is still warm, the compensating drop in the tropics means more to the Earth’s climate than the same movement of temps in the Arctic  It becomes a predictor of what has to happen as the PDO continues cold and the AMO turns cold…the warmer northern polar regions will cool. A degree is not a degree when it comes to the climate system. A one-degree movement up and down where wet bulb temperatures are 30°C have far greater effects on the system than a 1-degree change where its near 0. That is the message behind the mixing ratio example above.
Now let me ask you this question, in terms of the climate system, which is far more important: 1) the tropical oceans and the air masses around them, or  2) what is going on in the Arctic? The answer is given above.
Again this is simply saying there is a natural large-scale thermostat called the ocean. The warmer the ocean, the more it drives the whole climate system.
The slight cooling with dropping RH is a sign of bigger things to come. This means the wet bulbs are falling faster than the actual temps. It is a predictor of future temperature drops (it’s worse than we thought). For usually when the RH falls, the temperatures rise.  But in this case, temps are already falling and the RH is falling too!
At the very least I expect temperatures by 2030 to return to where they were in the late 1970s, which was the end of the last cold PDO phase and, by the way, the start of the satellite era: the most objective form of measurements.
Is the cooling worse than I thought? We are going to find out in the coming decades.

"If there’s one word to sum up today’s political pace, perhaps it is urgency. Climate catastrophe is coming; hate crimes are rising; the far right is advancing and none of us can remember the last time parliamentary democracy wasn’t characterised by a hopeless race against a ticking clock. And yet, having spent a lifetime lulled into the complacency that comes with privilege and a centrist establishment, it seems our political class just isn’t getting it. We have 30 years to change the course of history, say school climate strikers. People are dying now, say human rights and equalities campaigners. Real change takes time and consensus and a series of repetitive votes in a crumbling old palace, say politicians.  This generational divide between an establishment desperate to cling on to the idea of slow, gradual change and a youth fired up and impatient for radical overhaul was highlighted again last week when ex-BP boss John Browne was asked in the Observer what he would say to climate campaigner Greta Thunberg. “I would say that I have been at this for longer than you’ve been on the planet and that [decarbonisation] will take time,” he responded. “Remember that energy is a very big system and there is not one solution.” Aside from his patronising tone and the fact that Thunberg’s activism is in part only necessary because of his lifetime commitment to burning the fossil fuels that caused the climate crisis, Browne’s response is undoubtedly frustrating for youth activists in other ways. While the older generation has little to lose from patience and timidity, a new wave of activists has already lost, born into a world damaged beyond repair through no fault of their own. With no rose-tinted memories of the so-called good old days, they have little to gain from sitting patiently and waiting while white men 50 years older than them debate a future they won’t be part of. It’s easy for the establishment to patronise young activists because the former exist within a political structure that has been built explicitly to accommodate their type of politics: a slow, bureaucratic, opaque process overseen by people who have far more invested in their own reputations and interests than in those they represent. It might have ticked along nicely for a while – at least for those privileged enough to feel its benefits – but, ultimately, it has failed. And so perhaps Browne’s response points to something else about this generational divide that is somewhat more uncomfortable to acknowledge. It’s one thing to accept that our politicians and experts simply have a different theory of change, frustrating as it might be. But the fact is that it was their commitment to the establishment wisdom of steady, gradual change that led us here in the first place. To accept that anything else is required is also to accept responsibility and, ultimately, failure. In our feral and uncompromising political system, will anyone be brave enough? What the political establishment crucially fails to acknowledge is that a new generation of activists has grown up watching things go wrong on a dramatic scale in the blink of an eye. For millennials and generation Z, political life has been defined by the collapse of institution after institution. In 2008, a generation of students went to sleep one night and woke up to an unforgiving job market that may never recover fully from the financial crash. In 2016, they watched along with their younger peers as hate-crime statistics soared following the UK’s decision to leave the European Union. In their relatively short lives they’ve seen fascists win elections, terrorist attacks devastate countries across the world, climate change-accelerated natural disasters claim the lives of thousands. How can anyone expect them to believe that change should be slow and steady when disaster has been so swift and ruthless? Ultimately, it’s not just that the older political establishment has a different approach or an inherited wisdom, but that it is actively standing in the way of progress on issues that require radical and urgent solutions. In a system built explicitly to advance the slow and gradual politics that have benefited its representatives for decades, this is no small ask. But the ways of the past have failed us. While today’s youth have little to lose and everything to gain from a radical new approach, the power and successes of today’s establishment hang in the balance. To sacrifice progress and change for pride and self-interest would certainly be business as usual. But it was business as usual that got us into this position. It will have to be urgency that saves us. • Eve Livingston is a journalist specialising in politics, social affairs and inequalities"

Share this...FacebookTwitterI was looking at the Climate4you.com/ chart Joe Bastardi used in a recent post. It shows the CO2 and the temperature curves. In it we already see the first signs of why the warmists are getting seriously nervous. The divergence is beginning:

Figure 1: TODAY: CO2 concentration and global temperature. The divergence began in 2005. 
I asked myself what is it going to look like in 10 or 15 years with the negative AMO and PDO (let’s leave out the solar activity slumber for now) continuing. So I took the Climate4You chart, cut and extended it out to the year 2030. We know CO2 is going to keep rising. Next I simply extended the negative phase of the AMO and PDO global temp out to 2030 so that it’s behaves similarly to the last negative phase for the 1950s, 60s and 70s. Doing that you get the following development:

Figure 2: 2030…oh my, what a wonderful correlation. 
Now you know why the warmists are crapping bricks big time right now. They see the writing on the wall – they know the Great Climate Scam has got but only a few more years to live, and then it is over! RIP! It’s going to get worse with every passing year. In fact, let’s hope CO2 skyrockets to 500 ppm soon…it’ll make their error look even more profound.
Many will argue that you just can’t assume the AMO and the PDO will have a similar impact as it did from 1950s through the 1970s. Well, we’ll see. So far it’s right on track!
And let’s recall that next years will see low solar activity, and so the temperatures could drop even more. It gets even worse if a major volcano erupts. The warmists are not going to have a place to hide.

Share this...FacebookTwitterOne by one the great warmist scientists today are finding it ever harder to come to terms with brutalities of climate reality, and are gradually being exposed as incompetent science buffoons. Back in 2011 Tamino’s (Grant Foster’s) careful analysis led him to conclude (my emphasis):
To answer the question posed in the title of this post: presently, Earth is warming at about 1.7 deg.C per century.  There’s good reason to believe that it’ll be warming even faster in the upcoming decades.  And there’s good reason to believe that this spells trouble for life on earth — including human life.”
And:
The conclusion is inescapable: the globe is warming, and shows absolutely no sign whatever of stopping or even slowing its warming. Any talk of “cooling” or even a “levelling off” of global warming over the last decade is absolute nonsense.”
Now just 2 years later, even the biggest warmists are conceding global temperatures have levelled. Hat-tip Dana Nuccitelli. My, how 2 years can change things.
I wonder if statistics designer Tamino (Grant Foster) is now ready to rein in all his big warming talk and apply some downward corrections. My guess is that he isn’t, and he will continue insisting that the models are infallible (though they’ve been totally wrong since the start):

Grant Foster sees no signs of levelling off. Source: drroyspencer.com/.
“Good reason for faster warming,” he writes. Really?
What reasons do you see, Mr. Foster? Models certainly aren’t reasons. To the contrary, model performance so far is actually excellent reason not to believe there is going to be faster warming.
Scientists like Foster would do well to wake up to reality very soon before find themselves totally marooned in Absurdistan.

"In London’s Parliament Square last October, teenage activist Greta Thunberg spoke of the urgent need to face the climate emergency: “It is time to rebel.” That was a clarion call for peaceful protest. The Australian eco-warriors in this satire feel that such calls have fallen on deaf ears, so they decide to hold the country’s environmental minister hostage at a Fleetwood Mac concert in Australia’s Parliament House. There are wooden guns, fake walkie-talkies and coded language between the climate extremists that draws on musical references (“Donna Summer paging the Ronettes”). There are also a few shocking fatalities as they take their radical action.  Despite its comic setup, the questions underlying the play are serious and radical. What are the limits of peaceful protest? What is needed to provoke governments out of wilful blindness? Entwined into this drama is metacommentary by the playwright, David Finnigan, who reflects on the hostile reception his play received for its title when he first tried to stage it in Australia. He explains his draft stages of writing, the making of a prop and lectures us earnestly about the climate. His words sound redundant and repetitive, and the interruptions slow down the momentum of the hostage plot. The comedy feels stalled by it, too. Australian comedian Felicity Ward plays the environment minister, Gwen Malkin, and she is a charismatic performer. There is sparkling chemistry between her and Kelly Paterniti, who plays her slick social media assistant. They make Instagram videos in the hostage situation, more concerned with image-making than truth, politics or climate change, and set them to old-school house and rave music before posting online. The social media satire is clever and pointed, while Bec Hill is winning as the wild-eyed, “sexy but dangerous” climate terrorist. The shootouts and knife fights between these parties are set to music and dance, and the physical comedy in them is the highlight of the production. While Kill Climate Deniers is a bold play with some energetic writing, it sets up edgy themes that ultimately feel underdeveloped and frustrated by metatheatrics. At the Pleasance, London, until 28 June."
"Australia could cut greenhouse gas emissions halfway to its Paris agreement target, and save $7.7bn a year in bills, by adopting existing global standards on energy efficiency. From new hot water heaters to better standards for appliances, a new report has found Australia is missing an opportunity to “easily” meet its emissions targets and fight the looming climate crisis. The report, from the Energy Efficiency Council (EEC), found that adopting the measures used in Germany would save the average Australian household $790 a year on power bills. It would also create 70,000 extra fulltime equivalent jobs – from advanced engineering to plumbing – as houses are fitted with new boilers, draught-sealing and new lights, and factories invest in efficient equipment. A YouGov survey commissioned by the EEC found that “investing in energy efficiency” is one of the most politically popular actions the government can take on the climate crisis – with more than 85% support among both Labor and Coalition voters. However, Australia is not on track to meet its target of a 40% increase in efficiency by 2030, according to the EEC’s head of policy, Rob Murray-Leach. Since 2015, Australia has only improved an average of 0.7% a year, according to the EEC’s figures – well below the 2.3% rate needed. Murray-Leach said the levers of change were controlled by the states and territories – meaning Australia could still “crack on” even if the federal government was inactive. The report said Australians should start thinking of energy efficiency as a form of energy generation – adding capacity to the grid and reducing power bills. “Energy efficiency is just another form of supply,” Murray-Leach said. “When I look at Germany, their bills are 30% lower”. According to the report, Australia has “barely begun to tap the potential of energy efficiency”, and was the worst developed country for efficiency, out of the top 25 energy-consuming countries. In comparison, China set a target of 20% improvement in only five years between 2006 and 2010, and exceeded it. And California in the 1970s generated the equivalent of two new nuclear power plants of energy, just by improving the efficiency of fridges. “It wasn’t until I went overseas that I realised how far behind we were,” Murray-Leach said. “We have fundamentally dropped the ball on what is seen as the standard way of how you do business. It’s like every other country in the world did accounting, and we just didn’t bother.” The report found that adopting best practice from around the world would “easily deliver half of the abatement required to meet Australia’s target to reduce emissions by 26-28% by 2030”. And that push would create 120,000 fulltime equivalent jobs, up from the current 50,000. “A lot of energy efficiency jobs are not labelled energy efficiency jobs,” Murray-Leach said. “It’s a builder who 20% of his time is making sure the doors and the roof are keeping the heat in … It’s a lot of different jobs making things work better. “If you are upgrading the efficiency of a factory, you are getting highly skilled chemical and mechanical engineers to go in. If you are talking about draught-proofing a home, you are talking about a skilled tradesman. And if you are increasing the replacement rate of hot water, then those are plumbing jobs.” The report also recommended Australia improve minimum standards for appliances, and implement an energy rating scheme for houses. Australia currently has minimum standards set for 21 kinds of appliances – much less than our biggest trading partners, the US (with 51), the EU (41) and China (also 41). Simply matching those standards would boost trade as well as energy conservation, the report said. In the US, California also updates its building codes every three years to keep new buildings energy efficient. If Australia copied the same building codes as the US or Japan, an office building in Brisbane would be 20% more energy efficient, the report found. It also recommended that houses be given energy efficiency ratings in the same way appliances are, so new buyers and new renters can see how much money they would lose by choosing an energy inefficient home – a scheme the UK has had since 2007. “The research has shown you could easily double energy productivity – so a 100% improvement by 2040, instead of a 40% increase by 2040,” Murray-Leach said. Californian energy commissioner Andrew Mcallister told Guardian Australia “there is a lot of low-hanging fruit in Australia, that in California we have already harvested”. “Energy efficiency advocacy is not really a radical thing,” he said. “It is rational, it is good policy. It is not a partisan thing at all. It’s just good management.” Murray-Leach said much of this could be achieved without the federal government. “The levers for energy management really sit in the hands of states and territories,” he said. States have the power to institute energy-efficiency schemes (which currently exist in New South Wales, Victoria, South Australia and the ACT), can establish new building standards for homes and fund businesses to improve their own efficiency, as has recently happened in NSW. “Queensland can put in an energy efficiency scheme, it can introduce one tomorrow,” Murray-Leach said. “Businesses would prefer to have a national approach to these polices. But the states can coordinate with each other without the federal government. And the cost of inaction would be far worse than being uncoordinated.” The report also recommends that manufacturing businesses be given incentives and grants to improve efficiency, and that the government introduce stronger fuel-efficiency standards for vehicles."
"During a commencement address this week, Michael Bloomberg announced that he’s spending $500m to help the United States move closer to a carbon-neutral future. We should be very grateful that Bloomberg isn’t running for president: the money he’s pouring into Beyond Carbon will fund some great and necessary work, like his injection into the Sierra Club’s Beyond Coal campaign several years back. But it would be much better for the planet if billionaires like him didn’t exist at all. As Axios recently reported, the 1% and the world’s biggest companies have more money than they know what to do with, and they’re either hoarding it or pouring it into things like stock buybacks to make the wealthy even wealthier. Hedge funds and private equity funds are snapping up privatized public goods like water and electricity, while rich households are spending their extra cash on asset managers who’ll help them place bets on the next Theranos. Corporate profits have grown as wages have stagnated, all while some of the most useless and destructive parts of our economy balloon.  After the Great Recession, successive rounds of quantitative easing poured trillions of dollars into the global economy, and low interest rates have made credit easy to come by. These factors – and the fact that we place virtually unlimited faith in the prudent investment decisions of corporations and the wealthy to plan out our economy – leave as their legacy a bloated tech sector and fracking, a disaster for the climate that was unprofitable before we bailed out the banks. The result of all this has concentrated outrageous levels of wealth at the top of the income bracket as global temperatures rise. Before the financial crisis, the top 1% held a collective $15bn in cash. Today they’ve got almost $304bn. And while the yachts and frequent flying habits of the wealthy are a pox on the planet, so is the fact that they now have more money than ever to throw into world-wrecking investments, buying off politicians and lobbying for their pet causes – namely, to let them keep doing more of the same. For every Michael Bloomberg there are dozens of Koch brothers and Rebekah Mercers, who have poured tens of millions of dollars into spreading climate denial and blocking decarbonization efforts at the local, state and national level. None of them should have as much money as they do. The climate crisis isn’t going to be solved with the benevolence of a couple of billionaires, and their outsized control over our politics and economy stands in contradiction to our hopes for a livable future. With rightwing populism on the rise around the world, having elites like Bloomberg as the public face of the climate fight is also risky politics. We don’t need their money to fund the Green New Deal – the US has more than enough for that – but we should take it anyway, with a far more progressive tax system than the one we’ve got. If that sounds radical, it’s worth remembering that the top marginal tax rate during the time hailed as capitalism’s Golden Age floated somewhere north of 90% in the US. After it had already fallen, Ronald Reagan’s administration collapsed it to 50% when he took office, and it would dip to just 28% by the time he left. The many billions that have been lost as a result are resources that have been captured out of democratic control, emboldening a handful of oligarchs to run roughshod over people and planet alike. To avert runaway climate catastrophe, we have to take them back."
"If you set aside Republicans’ obsession with cow farts, perhaps the most prevalent criticism of the Green New Deal is its emphasis on social justice. Critics contend that the far-reaching climate agenda is far too concerned with extraneous issues such as jobs, infrastructure, housing, healthcare and civil and indigenous rights. Stick to greenhouse gases, they say; reforming the energy system is utopian enough. This criticism crosses the aisle among elites. In February, the New York Times editorial board wondered whether addressing the climate crisis was “merely a cover for a wish-list of progressive policies and a not-so-subtle effort to move the Democratic Party to the left?” A day later, the Washington Post editorial board opined that serious policymakers should not “muddle” decarbonization with social programs that “divert money and attention from the primary mission”. And in a widely circulated 11,000-word Open Letter to Green New Dealers, Jerry Taylor, the president of the Niskanen Center, a pro-market environmental group, was incredulous. “The Green New Deal resolution quite literally gives a nod to every single last policy demand forwarded by the Democratic Socialists of America,” he wrote. “The climate is too important to be held hostage to political commitments.” The general gist of all this: take your social justice agenda elsewhere, activists. It has no place in serious climate policy. But here’s the thing: social justice concerns are always intertwined with public policy – and absolutely central to climate policy. Experts agree that we must quickly deploy vast resources to mitigate and adapt to global warming. If the United States aims to shift to 100% clean and renewable energy, we will need to build solar and wind farms across the country along with a national grid to connect them. Such a transformative investment could create a boom in jobs. But who would those jobs go to? Where would we build all of this new, green infrastructure, and who should own it? Which communities get energy first? How do we keep it affordable? And that’s just the energy sector. To decarbonize our economy, we must make equally challenging choices across many other sectors – transportation, agriculture, buildings, manufacturing. In this vast and tangled web of society-wide choices, questions of social justice are everywhere. Up until now, legislators have mostly made these decisions in ways that harm communities of color, working families and the poor. We build much of our polluting infrastructure – power plants, industrial sites, highways and waste facilities – in these communities. As a consequence, African Americans are nearly three times more likely to die from asthma-related causes than white people. Nearly half of Latinos live in counties where air quality does not meet EPA clean air standards. Indigenous communities like the Navajo nation live with the residual effects of uranium pollution in their water, exposing as many as 54,000 Navajos to harm – and that’s just one tribe. At the same time, the climate crisis is a driver of injustice, widening the gap between the haves and the have-nots. Communities of color number among the most vulnerable to the impacts of climate change because they live in areas at higher risk of wildfires and flooding – often without basic economic protections like insurance. In New Orleans, Hurricane Katrina displaced 75,000 African Americans and hollowed out the city’s black middle class, which has never recovered. Today, the city’s black population is smaller and poorer. Similar dynamics are at play in Houston, where a year after Hurricane Harvey the poorest communities – primarily Latino and black – have been the slowest to recover. All of this should have major implications for how we write and implement policy. The Green New Deal, which envisions a society where people have universal access to energy, jobs, healthcare and housing, is a call for renewed commitment to the equal distribution of opportunity and justice – fundamental tenets of the social contract that have languished for far too long. It’s about investing in the communities polluted and left behind by the fossil fuel economy because these are the places with the highest levels of toxicity to clean up, but also because this is the right thing to do. Elizabeth Warren unveiled a $2tn green manufacturing platform that included explicit commitments to unions and communities of color For all the naysayers’ hand-wringing, it appears that social justice has found a home in climate policy – at least with some. Last week, Elizabeth Warren unveiled a $2tn green manufacturing platform that included explicit commitments to unions and communities of color. The same day, Joe Biden, previously noted for his Green New Deal skepticism, did an about-face, putting out a platform that cited the Green New Deal resolution and included an entire section dedicated to environmental justice. The next day, Jay Inslee – the governor of Washington, who is running a climate-focused campaign for president – published a 50-page foreign policy package that included an extensive examination of the United States’ responsibility to the Global South and to climate refugees. This came on the heels of his Evergreen Economy Plan, which focused on the role of justice in a clean energy economy. Public opinion, too, is shifting in favor of policies that link climate action with social justice. New data compiled by political scientist James Stimson of the University of North Carolina shows that Americans are more supportive of liberal “big government” than they have been at any time since 1961 – the days of the New Deal and the Great Society. And in new polling, Data for Progress, a left-leaning thinktank where I work, finds robust support for the Green New Deal nationally, including support for policies that prioritize social justice and investment in communities of color. Yet some pundits and politicians – like the New York governor, Andrew Cuomo, who is working behind the scenes to remove economic justice provisions from the state’s new Climate and Community Protection Act – are still trying to reject this reality. Surveying a landscape of environmental racism and intransigent inequality, one wonders if opinion leaders and policymakers with the privilege not to think about these problems are looking at anything other than old theories, bad data and one another when they suggest that climate policy be separated from questions of redistribution. Non-elites experience policy through their daily lives, their monthly energy bill, their paycheck and the quality of their neighborhood, not through the concentration of carbon in the atmosphere or share of renewables on the grid. Elites who divorce climate policy from social justice and the people it is meant to help are almost as out of touch as those who deny climate science altogether."
"A leaked document on the EU’s priorities has been criticised as offering little more than “a collection of buzzwords” to tackle the climate crisis and accelerating the destruction of the natural world. EU leaders are due to adopt a “strategic agenda” for 2019-24 at a Brussels summit starting on 20 June, but a draft has encountered a volley of criticism from some green groups, who accuse officials of lacking urgency.  The five-page document, drawn up by the team of Donald Tusk, the European council president, is intended to set the bloc’s priorities for the next five years in an “increasingly unsettled [and] complex” world. Spanning migration, trade and the EU’s place in the world, the document avoids details such as targets, budget numbers or specific countries. While it describes the climate crisis as an existential threat and calls for an “in-depth transformation of [the EU’s] own economy and society to achieve climate neutrality”, some campaigners say it lacks ambition. The document states that EU policies should be consistent with the Paris agreement, but spells out little detail about what that means. Under the Paris agreement, the EU has pledged to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by at least 40% by 2030 (compared with 1990 levels). The bloc also aims to get at least 32% of energy from renewable sources and increase energy efficiency by at least 32.5% by the same date. Last year, the European commission called for the EU to be “climate neutral” by 2050 in order to keep global heating below the UN’s 1.5C target (equivalent to a rise of 2.7F). The campaign group WWF said the EU needed to hit net zero emissions 10 years sooner, in 2040. “Given the ecological emergency we are facing, climate action and nature loss must be prioritised in the coming mandate – but such promises are meaningless without fixed timelines for the EU to reach net zero emissions by 2040 and halt and reverse biodiversity loss by 2030,” said Ester Asin, director of WWF’s European policy office. “The strategic agenda is critical in that it will help guide the next commission president,” she said. Asin added that the next European parliament – which will have a record number of Green MEPs – should vote only for a commission president who has “a clear work programme on climate action, environment and sustainability”. Greenpeace criticised the absence of any mention of food production, when livestock farming accounts for between 13%-17% of the EU’s greenhouse gas emissions. The EU farming sector has seen no decline in emissions since 2010 and benefits from £24bn in public subsidies through the common agricultural policy. “European leaders are feeling the pressure to talk big on climate, but their strategic agenda is more of a collection of buzzwords than an emergency response to humanity’s greatest threat,” Greenpeace’s EU director, Jorgo Riss, said. “This list of contradictory proposals suggests European leaders will prioritise economic growth in much the same way as before, driving social inequalities and fuelling the climate and ecological crisis even further.” Other campaigners were more encouraged. Ariel Brunner, senior head of policy at BirdLife International, said the text covered most of the bases for a turn in a progressive direction. “This text, while still a bit vague, does suggest a real commitment to building a sustainable society, starting by addressing the twin crisis of climate breakdown and biodiversity collapse” he said. “Now actions must follow, starting with setting up a new commission able and willing to address the crisis through strong legal proposals, strict enforcement of legislation, and bold reform of broken policies such as the CAP.” The text is likely to undergo further changes before it is presented to EU leaders at a Brussels summit next week. That gathering is scheduled to be the last one attended by Theresa May as prime minister, but the document gives no opening to discuss Brexit. Without mentioning the tortured process of the UK’s exit, it expresses hope for an EU trade policy that is “robust, ambitious and balanced” as well as “based on reciprocity and mutual benefits”. Elsewhere, the document sets goals that reflect longstanding British priorities within the EU, such as developing the single market in services. The text also seeks to boost the EU on the world stage, declaring that “the EU needs to be more assertive and more powerful” to defend its interests and values. To achieve these goals, it calls on EU member states to be more united in foreign policy and spend more on defence. On the issue of migration, the paper stresses control of external borders and calls on countries “to find a way through” long-running disputes on asylum policy – without suggesting how to break the deadlock."

Share this...FacebookTwitterIt’s not every morning one wakes up and finds you’ve been quoted by the New York Times. That’s what happened to me this morning.

CO2 losing its fizz. Public domain photo. 
In his article, A Change in Temperature, Justin Gillis tells his readers that the issue of CO2 climate sensitivity has become more hotly disputed than ever, but warns catastrophe still looms.
Here are just a few comments I have:
1) The New York Times first have to learn that science is not about insisting you are correct, or being obsessed with a popular pet hypothesis. In the article Justin Gillis and scientist James Annan come across as having a very hard time departing from the hypothesis that CO2 climate sensitivity is high.
2. CO2 lags temperature, history has proven. Moreover, although CO2 has risen tremendously (in relative terms) over the last 15 years, the global temperature has not. For the last 15 years, sensitivity has been zero. Worse, there’s strong, mounting evidence that there isn’t going to be any warming for another 10 or 20 years at least. (Hint: oceans).
3. There’s no correlation between CO2 and temperature. Of the last 130 years, CO2 has risen 100% of the time, but temperature have risen only during 45 of those years (1920-45 and 1978-98). That’s a very lousy correlation. And you only need to look back at the previous Eemian interglacial. While CO2 was steady at about 260 ppm, the temperature dropped 6°C.
Now it’s CO2 quadrupling
4. But what I find particularly interesting about Gillis’s latest article is that the once much ballyhooed consensus is totally shattered, and the overall warmist retreat now taking place. It is clear that scientists are now abandoning the high CO2 sensitivity values in droves. Naturally we don’t expect them to abandon the high values and to run right over to the low CO2 climate sensitivity values. The next logical step is that they adopt the middle sensitivity values, and act like those are going to be catastrophic as well.

…several recent papers have offered best estimates for climate sensitivity that are below four degrees Fahrenheit, rather than the previous best estimate of just above five degrees, and they have also suggested that the highest estimates are pretty implausible. Notice that these recent calculations fall well within the long-accepted range — just on the lower end of it.”
But even mid-range sensitivity values are becoming difficult for people like Annan to defend, and so now they’re forced to consider undramatic low CO2 sensitivity values.
It will certainly be good news if these recent papers stand up to critical scrutiny, something that will take at least a year or two to figure out.”
And German journalist science Jürgen Schönstein writes about the NYT article at ScienceBlogs here:
(Annan assumes that the warming from a doubling of atmospheric CO2 will be at the lower end of the projected ‘range’).
The problem here, however, is that with low CO2 climate sensitivity it gets really hard to conjure up catastrophic warming scenarios with a doubling of CO2. So what to do?
No problem. Gillis and Annan present their latest trick: They talk about tripling or even quadrupling of CO2 to get the catastrophe which they are so obsessed with, and claim it’s really plausible.
Some experts think the level of the heat-trapping gas could triple or even quadruple before emissions are reined in. […] Even if climate sensitivity turns out to be on the low end of the range, total emissions may wind up being so excessive as to drive the earth toward dangerous temperature increases.”
There you have it. Now climate scientists and the catastrophe-obsessed media are now forced, for perhaps the very first time, to talk about CO2 quadrupling in order to get the much wanted catastrophe scenarios.

"Pope Francis has declared a global “climate emergency”, warning of the dangers of global heating and that a failure to act urgently to reduce greenhouse gases would be “a brutal act of injustice toward the poor and future generations”. He also endorsed the 1.5C limit on temperature rises that some countries are now aiming for, referring to warnings from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change of “catastrophic” effects if we crossed such a threshold. He said a “radical energy transition” would be needed to stay within that limit, and urged young people and businesses to take a leading role.  “Future generations stand to inherit a greatly spoiled world. Our children and grandchildren should not have to pay the cost of our generation’s irresponsibility,” he said, in his strongest and most direct intervention yet on the climate crisis. “Indeed, as is becoming increasingly clear, young people are calling for a change.” The Pope’s impassioned plea came as he met the leaders of some of the world’s biggest multinational oil companies in the Vatican on Friday to impress upon them the urgency and scale of the challenge, and their central role in tackling the emissions crisis. It followed a similar meeting last year, but this time the Pope’s stance was tougher as he warned that time was running out and urged them to hear “the increasingly desperate cries of the earth and its poor”. The chief executives or chairs of BP, ExxonMobil, Shell, Total, ConocoPhilips, Chevron and several major investors including BlackRock and Hermes, responded by calling on governments to put in place carbon pricing to encourage low-carbon innovation, and called for greater financial transparency to aid investors. However, they made no pledges to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions, and set no timetable for action. In two statements, which came at the end of a two-day meeting in the Vatican that was addressed by the pope and led by senior Vatican churchmen, the signatories called for a “combination of policies and carbon pricing mechanisms … designed in a way that simultaneously delivers innovation and investment in low-carbon solutions while assisting those least able to pay”. The oil companies’ pledges did not go far enough, said Mel Evans, climate campaigner for Greenpeace UK. “The oil majors knew all about the risk from climate change many years before most of us first heard about it. They knew where we were heading, they knew their products were the cause, and yet they kept it quiet and lobbied for business as usual,” said Evans. “And they’re still lobbying for business as usual. When it comes to saving the planet they will do what they are forced to do, and no more, which is why we’re having to block them from drilling new oil wells as we speak. Expecting leadership from them is a path to certain disaster.” Emissions are rising at their fastest level in close to a decade, BP said this week, leaving an ever shorter period to prevent dangerous levels of global heating. Every year of high emissions takes the world closer to the brink, because it adds to the stock of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, which can take a century to dissipate. Last month, the concentration of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere showed the second highest annual increase since continuous records began more than 60 years ago. On Friday, BP served an injunction on the Greenpeace ship Arctic Sunrise to try to prevent it joining the activists occupying the oil company’s rig in Cromarty, Scotland. Greenpeace is trying to highlight the dangers of new oil drilling, which it says will gravely worsen the climate emergency. In previous speeches, the pope has slammed “the continued search for new fossil fuel reserves” and said “fossil fuels should remain underground”. Bob Dudley, chief executive of BP, said after the Vatican meeting: “The world needs to take urgent action to get us on a more sustainable path and it is critical that everyone plays their part – companies and investors, governments and individuals. This requires all of us to come together, build understanding and collaborate to find solutions. Constructive dialogues such as this meeting are essential in aligning key players on the steps needed to accelerate the energy transition while still enabling advances in human prosperity. I am grateful to his Holiness for continuing to support this critical engagement.” BP’s chief economist warned this week that the world “should not rely on the generosity of the private sector” when it came to investing in key clean technologies such as carbon capture and storage, and called for the government to use taxpayers’ money to fund such initiatives instead. BP’s profits doubled last year to a five-year high as its output of oil and gas soared. Mark Campanale, founder and executive director of the Carbon Tracker, said: “We must forego business-as-usual protocols and short-term market-driven goals or face environmental and financial ruin of catastrophic proportions. Oil and gas companies have a crucial role to play in transitioning to a low-carbon economy but must today collectively take those hard decisions in the wake of determined investor and public pressure, and unambiguous scientific evidence.” The IPCC warned last year that the world had about a decade to bring greenhouse gases under control, or face a probable rise in temperatures well beyond the 1.5C above pre-industrial levels they warned would bring devastating effects such as droughts, floods, heatwaves and damage to agriculture."
"A two-foot-wide pipe connecting the Mobil oil company’s Idoho offshore platform to a terminal near Nigeria’s eastern border ruptured in January 1998, spewing crude oil directly into the Atlantic Ocean. Dr David Page visited Nigeria after the spill and offered his views of its impact to the New York Times, which were published in special report dated 20 September that year. Page’s arrival on the scene was anticipated years earlier in Mobil’s plans, internal Mobil Foundation documents newly obtained by the Guardian reveal. “Between Mother Nature and Mobil’s highly effective and targeted response, the shoreline was spared what could have been a very serious environmental event,” Page, described as a Bowdoin College professor and “an American oil spill expert”, told the New York Times. “I’m not an attorney,’’ Page continued, “but it’s fair to say that because so little oil got ashore, I’d be very surprised if fishermen’s livelihoods were cut off.’’ Others found the spill far more significant, however. It proved to be one of the largest in Nigerian history – by the gallon, one-sixth the size of the Exxon Valdez catastrophe. Roughly 1 million people lived in areas Human Rights Watch later listed as “the worst hit” by the spill. Crude reached as far as Lagos harbor, over 500 miles away. Mobil collected oil-clogged nets from fishermen and burned them, offering in exchange sums locals said were a fraction of replacement costs. Legal battles, protests and unrest continued for two decades. Five years before the spill, the Mobil Foundation, run by top Mobil executives, had named Page in its decision to continue funding Bowdoin College’s Marine Research Laboratory – writing that a proposed $10,000 grant for the lab could help “assure rapid response to any possible Mobil spill events”. “Drs [Edward] Gilfillan and Page … are our most valuable marine pollution contacts outside the industry,” Mobil Foundation wrote in the documents, adding that the lab had already received $132,000 from Mobil from 1986 to 1993, and that the lab maintained “a healthy attitude toward the oil industry’s requirements for transportation and storage of petroleum on the world’s waters”. The foundation had listed Nigeria as one of four areas worldwide where Page’s work on mangrove swamps could prove useful, especially when it came to “litigation concerning environmental damage”. In an email response to the Guardian’s questions about Mobil Foundation funding for Bowdoin, Page said: “At no time was there an expectation of a quid pro quo – in any form. It was a philanthropic activity in an area of interest to Mobil.” He said the grants went towards funding summer research student placements. “In the case of the 1998 IDOHO spill, Mobil asked us to work with a group of Nigerian academic and non-academic professionals to share our experience and help them conduct a post-spill impact study that would meet international standards,” he wrote. Nigeria was not the only place Mobil reaped benefits its tax-exempt foundation sought to claim from its charitable giving, according to previously undisclosed internal documents from the early 1990s. The Mobil Foundation also sought to use its tax-exempt grants to shape American laws and regulations on issues ranging from the climate crisis to toxic chemicals – with the explicit goal of benefiting Mobil, the documents show. Recipients of Mobil Foundation grants included Ivy League universities, branches of the National Academies and well-known civic organizations and environmental researchers. Benefits for Mobil included – in the foundation’s words – funding “a counterpoint to so-called ‘public interest’ groups”, helping Mobil obtain “early access” to scientific research, and offering the oil giant’s executives a forum to “challenge EPA behind-the-scenes”. The documents, which include research, engineering and environmental affairs grant recommendations for 1994, cover over 120 proposals worth about $1.2m – roughly 10% of the foundation’s total budget that year – and list more than 700 grants from prior years. Dozens of the single-page grant recommendations include full paragraphs on the “benefits to Mobil” that Mobil executives predicted the company could cull from the foundation’s gifts. Each recommendation offers an unprecedented window into Mobil’s internal reasoning. One page lists $100,000 in grants from 1990-1993 for the HarvardSchool of Public Health’s Center for Risk Analysis. The center’s director, John Graham, “has been effective in … pointing out the safety risks associated with excessively stringent fuel economy standards”, Mobil Foundation wrote as it proposed more funding. Graham had previously published a 1992 report titled The Safety Risks of Proposed Fuel Economy Legislation which made no mention of Mobil’s funding for the Harvard-based center. Another page reveals the former Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) assistant administrator John Moore sought out grants from Mobil and at least seven other large corporations for the Institute for Evaluating Health Risks, where Moore served as president and chief executive officer. Mobil gave $40,000 to help the newly formed institute “staff up and demonstrate its effectiveness”. Mobil Foundation recommended more for 1994, writing that Moore’s work offered a way “ultimately to influence the development of more cost-effective [environmental, health and safety] regulations”. A third page reveals Mobil Foundation’s efforts to expand its audience inside environmental circles via a grant for the Environmental Law Institute, a half-century-old organization offering environmental law research and education to lawyers and judges. “Institute publications are widely read in the environmental community and are helpful in communicating industry’s concerns to such organizations,” the entry says. “Mobil Foundation grants will enhance environmental organizations’ views of Mobil, enable us to reach through ELI activities many groups that we do not communicate with, and enable Mobil to participate in their dialogue groups.” The documents also show Mobil Foundation closely examining the work of individual researchers at dozens of colleges and universities as they made their funding decisions, listing ways that foundation grants would help shape research interests to benefit Mobil, help the company recruit future employees, or help combat environmental and safety regulations that Mobil considered costly. “It should be a wake-up call for university leaders, because what it says is that fossil fuel funding is not free,” said Geoffrey Supran, a postdoctoral researcher at Harvard and MIT. “When you take it, you pay with your university’s social license,” Supran said. “You pay by helping facilitate these companies’ political and public relations tactics.” In some cases, the foundation described how volunteer-staffed not-for-profits had saved Mobil money by doing work that would have otherwise been performed by Mobil’s paid staff, like cleaning birds coated in oil following a Mobil spill. In 1987, the International Bird Rescue Research Center’s “rapid response and assistance to Mobil’s West Coast pipeline at a spill in Lebec, CA not only defused a potential public relations problem”, Mobil Foundation said, “but saved substantial costs by not requiring our department to fly cross country to respond”. If Mobil classified donations as charitable contributions but it actually received valuable services as a result of its “gifts”, that could raise concerns about illegal self-dealing, tax experts told the Guardian. The “benefits to Mobil” paragraphs struck Marcus Owens, a Loeb & Loeb attorney who served for 10 years as the director of the exempt organizations division of the Internal Revenue Service, as out of the ordinary. “I’ve looked at all kinds of grant files in my career, both wearing an IRS hat and in my private practice,” he said, “and I’ve never seen that. The reason is because, even if it isn’t an act of self-dealing, it sure smells like it.” “It’s like a red flag,” he added, “a blinking red siren light.” The IRS had little institutional capacity to investigate self-dealing by private foundations, Owens said, citing a lack of IRS enforcement staff focused on not-for-profits. The IRS today, he added, has less ability to investigate than it did in the 1990s, when there were at times special audit programs looking at foundations. An IRS representative declined to comment on the bureau’s investigation capacity. Mobil might have been able to claim similar tax benefits by signing contracts for services with some of the not-for-profits they funded and listing the expense as a business deduction, tax experts told the Guardian – but not-for-profits on the other side of those deals might have faced their own ethical, tax or legal questions if they took payment for the services Mobil sought. In addition, by offering funding through the Mobil Foundation, Mobil created the impression that the grants were made at arm’s length and explicitly not for the company’s private benefit. Publicly available disclosures shed little light on Mobil’s motives for funding – and outwardly similar grants could appear very different from inside the foundation. The Mobil Foundation’s tax filings for 1994 – the only information Mobil would generally have been required to make public – list a $25,000 “civic” grant for the Academy of Natural Sciences in Philadelphia. The newly uncovered documents reveal the foundation had separately considered two distinct donations to the academy. One $10,000 grant was for “environmental research and science education programs”, listing “special employee nights at the museum” among the “Benefits to Mobil Foundation, Inc”. A second $15,000 grant was directed at the Academy’s Environmental Associates Program, founded by a pioneering scientist, Dr Ruth Patrick, who got her start at the academy in 1933, taught generations of scientists during three decades at the University of Pennsylvania, and helped to draft the Clean Water Act. “Based on the contacts of the Academy,” the Mobil Foundation wrote as it recommended that larger grant, “the Environmental Associates Program has the potential to challenge the EPA behind-the-scenes on the effectiveness of a regulation for the environment and whether sound science supports the proposed law.” Another $15,000 grant for the American Council on Science and Health (ACSH) is listed under “Health Agencies” in the Mobil Foundation’s 1994 tax filing. Mobil Foundation’s internal documents reveal concern over regulation motivated its grant-makers. “ACSH promotes rational understanding of the relative minor risks from most industrial chemicals compared with those accepted as normal from natural causes,” the Mobil Foundation wrote as it recommended a $15,000 grant for 1994, adding that the proposed grant had the support of Mobil’s medical and public relations departments. “One of the major benefits is due to the Executive Director, Dr Elizabeth Whelan, an articulate spokesperson who often appears as a counterpoint to so-called ‘public interest’ groups.” The statute of limitations for any tax code violations from the 1980s and 90s is probably long expired, tax experts said. The IRS approved Mobil Foundation’s merger into the ExxonMobil Foundation in 2001, after Mobil Corp joined with Exxon to form the world’s largest publicly traded oil company. ExxonMobil is currently facing investigations or lawsuits by multiple state attorneys general, related to claims the oil giant failed to communicate known climate change-related risks to investors and the public. While much attention has focused on what Exxon knew about climate change before the two companies merged, the records reveal Mobil’s growing alarm about climate change in the early 1990s. From 1991 to 1993, Mobil gave $75,000 to Columbia University’s Lamont-Doherty Geological Observatory, famed for its climate change research, and recommended an additional $25,000 for 1994 so employees could “develop personal relationships with some of the key experts” on what Mobil predicted would be “the key international environmental issue of the 1990s”. “While there currently are no regulations limiting emissions of greenhouse gases, such regulations are a real possibility within the next five years,” the grant recommendation adds. “Technical information and understanding will be key to Mobil’s ability to participate in the debate on these regulations.” A Mobil vice-president named John J Wise signed the approvals for that recommendation, along with about $1.2m in other grants for the year. Within roughly five years, Wise counted himself both a member of the board of trustees at the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution (recipient of listed donations totalling over $200,000 from Mobil) and a part of UN efforts to study climate change. Wise ultimately co-authored two UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change reports, serving as a lead author on one. One report chapter Wise co-authored prominently recommended, among other things, burning natural gas (an ExxonMobil product) instead of coal as a way to combat climate change."

Share this...FacebookTwitterOn 22 June 2013 the Swiss newspaper Basler Zeitung published an interview with climate historian Christian Pfister . Director of Business, Social, and Environmental History at the University of Bern, Switzerland. There’s been a lot of grumbling in Europe this spring due to the cold and wet weather, and so the Swiss daily decided to check what#s behind it all.

Suspected witches being hanged in England, published in 1655, public domain image.
According to Pfister, the weather has always been fickle throughout history, and is nothing unusual today.
Not surprisingly hysterical minds in the past also blamed bad weather on humans. The Basler Zeitung writes, “Christian Pfister advises us to calm down with regards to the cold, heat, winds, hail and storms. There’s been far worse than what we’ve seen this year” and reminds us that “We are powerless against the weather“.
Here are some excerpts of the interview:
Is the weather freaking out, or are we freaking out because we think the weather is freaking out?
Let me tell you what happens when the weather really freaks out. Imagine that it has hardly rained over the last 11 months. The leaves fall drom the trees in the middle of the summer, cattle die of thirst, forest fires rage. You can walk far into Lake Constanz like during a very dry winter, the Rhine dwindles to a creek. The water boils.

When did that happen?
In 1540. An almost one-year long drought, from Toscana to the north German border, from France to Poland. A blanket of smoke from the burning forests covered the continent, just like we saw in Russia in 2010. Then came the anti-summer in 1588: It rained and storms raged during 88 of 92 days. The grape harvest could fit in a hat. We had never seen such a summer, wrote the admirals of the Spanish Armada, it was like the British fleet that struck back then in the English Channel.
How can people be blamed for bad weather? 
When the weather was continuously cold and wet, as was the case this spring, those who were hit needed to find someone to blame. In most cases it was women who were accused of witchcraft. The accusers often assumed a conspiracy of witches who had sexual misconduct with the devil was at work. For this reason, suspects were tortured until they named their co-conspirators, who then were next. Entire groups of women were burned at the stake. Today we estimate that from 1430 to 1650 in Europe 60,000 women were executed as witches, not only because of, but most often because of weather-sorcery. It cannot be excluded that during that time, witches would have been burned after having a spring like that of 2013.”
Today hysterical climate alarmists blame industrial witches for today’s weather misfortunes, and accuse them of having a pact with the devil. These alarmists claim that they have science on their side and that they know the truth.
Today in modern times the psychological affliction of weather hysteria still persists with many lawmakers, scientists, and activists demanding that people start performing rituals in order to get Nature to bestow nicer weather. Back to the Dark Ages!

"Scott Morrison flew to the Solomon Islands last weekend to “show our Pacific step-up in action” but this policy will fail if his government doesn’t take meaningful action on climate change. A successful step-up must include stopping our own pollution, defending the sovereignty of our friends in the Pacific and offering a safety net to those who may need it. Over the past five years Australia’s standing in the Pacific has declined dramatically because of an unwillingness to take strong action on climate change. It’s not as if the Pacific hasn’t been clear. From female fishers to the Fijian prime minister, to remote communities in the Solomon Islands, climate change is a top-order issue. It’s about the very survival of people, nations and cultures. If action isn’t taken, in 40 years there are people in Pacific island states who may have nowhere to go. It’s difficult to overstate how upset Pacific Islanders are when they look at Australia’s track record on climate. We are one of the world’s worst per-capita polluters and biggest exporters of thermal coal. While the Australian Department of Foreign Affairs has a strong track record of support to Pacific islands, that record is totally contradicted by political rhetoric on climate and our lack of emission reductions. In the week before our election, Pacific leaders issued a statement reiterating their concern: All countries, with no caveats, must agree to take decisive and transformative action to reduce global emissions, and ensure at-scale mitigation and adaption support for those countries that need it. If we do not, we will lose. We will lose our homes, our ways of life, our wellbeing and our livelihoods. We know this because we are experiencing loss already. Yet, here at home, the Australian government is still failing to grasp that our backsliding on climate change action and promotion of thermal coal exports have significantly damaged our standing in the region. This lack of political solidarity (which at times strayed into outright contempt by the Abbott government) with our closest neighbours has altered the region’s geopolitical landscape. This isn’t happening in a vacuum; China has spent the last decade dramatically expanding its influence in the Pacific. The ballooning of Chinese investment into infrastructure projects, such as the announcement that Huawei would build Papua New Guinea’s domestic internet network, has caused security concerns. This has heightened the stakes for Australia in our quest to get this right. It is only recently that we have realised our political de-prioritisation of the Pacific islands and their needs has advanced China’s entrance to our region. For nearly two decades, as the World Wide Fund for Nature’s CEO in the Pacific, then China, and now Australia, I’ve met with the heads of nations, government ministers, senior officials and business and community leaders across the Asia-Pacific region who all speak about Australians with respect and warmth. But our relationships in the Pacific have been deeply undermined by a failure of political leadership on climate. Australia can repair this relationship by listening to and acting on the needs of Pacific island nations. The Pacific step-up – overall a good policy with bipartisan support – must also become a climate step-up. So, how? First, acting quickly at home to reduce our emissions and transition out of exporting thermal coal will show Australia has “heard” Pacific leaders. Reducing Australia’s pollution by 45% on 2005 levels by 2030 and reaching net-zero pollution by 2050 would be a good start, but it is the bare minimum we must do. There’s no point making emissions reductions at home then selling fuel that will be burnt elsewhere. We must also urgently commit to a just transition to phase out thermal coal exports by 2030. Second, Australia must champion that Pacific Islanders will always be the owners of what they themselves now call “Pacific Ocean states”. This means acknowledging they retain enduring sovereign rights over their islands and seascapes, despite the current interpretation of the international law of the sea, which questions the ownership of exclusive economic zones once islands are submerged. Third, we need to rebuild Australia’s beleaguered aid program which should have the Pacific step-up at its heart. It’s essential Australia expands programs that are helping Pacific nations build resilience and adapt to climate change impacts in line with their rallying cry: “We are not drowning. We are fighting.” But in a worst-case scenario no option should be off the table, up to and including the granting of Australian permanent residency for the entire populations of those nations at greatest risk. As Kevin Rudd pointed out in his February 2019 essay, this would now include Tuvalu, Nauru and Kiribati – the combined populations of which are less than half of Australia’s annual regular migration intake. I disagree, however, with the former prime minister’s suggestion that such arrangements should come at the cost of Pacific nations’ EEZs. Rather, this safety net should be an act of solidarity, humanity and mateship to our neighbours. By supporting islanders to retain the rights to their homelands, there will always be Pacific Ocean states. The prime minister has a clear choice in Honiara. Listen to Pacific leaders and implement a Pacific step-up through new pro-Pacific, pro-development, pro-climate policies that embrace our neighbours’ needs, or risk a further decline in our regional standing and the consequences that come from that. • Dermot O’Gorman is the CEO of WWF-Australia"

Share this...FacebookTwitterDie kalte Sonne website here has just posted the video presentation of Murry Salby in Hamburg in April. If anyone ever demolished the dubious CO2 AGW science, it’s Salby!

Most of the presentation is very mathematical and technical. But the last 10 minutes sums everything up very nicely for the laypersons.
Die kalte Sonne writes:
Prof. Murry Salby, climate scientist at Macquarie University of Sydney, made a presentation in Hamburg on April 18th as part of a European tour. Prof. Salby is author of the textbook Physics of the Atmosphere and Climate (Cambridge University Press) and Fundamentals of Atmospheric Physics (Academic Press) and is renowned worldwide as an astrophysicist. He recently caused excitement with new findings on the relationship of the 12C- and 13C isotopes and the development of CO2-concentration. From the findings he concluded that the anthropogenic emissions only had a slight impact on the global CO2-concentrations. They are are mainly a consequence of temperature changes. This relationship is known up to now only from the warming phases after the last ice ages. Prof. Salby extends this relationship to our current climate development.
The video recording of the presentation, which was organised by the host Helmut Schmidt University, is now available at Youtube (above).”
Near the end (1:02:50) Salby on CO2 and temperature:
Their divergence over the last decade and a half is now unequivocal. In the models global temperature tracks CO2 almost perfectly. In the real world it clearly doesn’t.” 
Salby then presents two charts for comparison, which I’ve arranged side-by-side: the model world vs real world:

Model world (left) vs real world (right). Graphics from Murry Salby presentation.
1:04:05 mark he sums it up neatly:
CO2 then evolves not like temperature, as it does in the model, but like the integral of temperature. In dotted blue is the integral of observed temperature. It closely tracks observed CO2 – even after the 1990s when the observed record of CO2 and temperature clearly diverged. If CO2 tracks the integral of temperature, which it clearly does, it cannot track temperature, which it clearly doesn’t.
In the model, CO2 and temperature are related directly. In the real world they are also related, but differently. The distinctly different relationship between CO2 and global temperature represents a fundamental difference in the global energy balance between its evolution in the model world and the real world. If the global energy balance is wrong, everything else is window dressing.”
The points of Salby’s presentation lead to the following implications:
– In the Real World global temperature is not controlled exclusively by CO2, as it is in the Model World.
– In significant part, however, CO2 is controlled by Global Temperature, as it is in the Proxy Record.”
At the end of the presentation, Salby implies, quoting Richard Feynman, that CO2 science today can be described as “Cult Science”.
He sums up quoting Feynman: “If it differs from observations, then it’s wrong. That’s all there is to it.”

"Oil giant Mobil sought to make tax-exempt donations to leading universities, civic groups and arts programmes to promote the company’s interests and undermine environmental regulation, according to internal documents from the early 1990s obtained by the Guardian.  The documents shine a light on the ways corporations have used their money to buy influence, amass prestige and shape public policy through grants to academic programmes and advocacy groups. The documents come to light as ExxonMobil, formed when Mobil merged with Exxon in 1999, is now facing investigations by multiple state attorneys general over claims it failed to communicate known climate crisis-related risks to investors and the public. The documents, dated in 1993 and provided to the Guardian by the Climate Investigations Center, show the Mobil Foundation justified spending by detailing major “benefits to Mobil” they expected in return for more than 80 proposed grants for 1994 – a practice not-for-profit experts said may have violated federal law. The foundation wrote that its grants for not-for-profits could help Mobil fight environmental regulation, fund scientists whose work had been “favorably received by the industry” and prepare Mobil to defend itself against lawsuits following oil spills and industrial accidents. For example, in a one-page entry listing past Mobil grants, the company was successful in “having the National Safety Council Board of Directors pass a resolution opposing the mandating of any alternative fuel”, the foundation wrote. Grants for the council totalled nearly a quarter-million dollars, according to the entry, which recommended further grants for the coming year. The internal grant-making recommendations and records, many marked confidential, cover $1.2m worth of funding – about 10% of the foundation’s annual budget. More than two-thirds of the roughly 120 full-page grant recommendations predict specific benefits for the oil giant. Justifications for offering money to not-for-profits and universities included: “Global warming is likely to be the key international environmental issue of the 1990s,” the foundation’s internal records predicted in 1993, adding that climate regulation was “a real possibility within the next five years”. The foundation recommended a $25,000 grant to the Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory at Columbia University to help Mobil “develop personal relationships with some of the key experts on this issue” and enable Mobil to “participate in the debate on these regulations”. The Mobil Foundation recommended contributing a total of $25,000 to the Harvard Center for Risk Analysis, saying the center had already effectively argued against tighter fuel economy standards and influenced America’s toxic air pollution laws, and its stances may help keep Mobil’s costs down in future. “Mobil’s environmental expenditures exceeded $1bn in 1992,” the document said. “Without a greater appreciation of scientific risk analysis, those costs will continue to escalate as environmental rules and programs are made excessively stringent in response to the public’s unfounded panic over relatively minor incidents.” The Academy of Natural Sciences in Philadelphia describes its Environmental Associates Program as “a group of corporate executives concerned about environmental effects of industrial activities”. The program was founded by Dr Ruth Patrick, who helped to draft the Clean Water Act, a major federal law giving the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) power to write rules to protect people against harm from water pollution. “Based on the contacts of the Academy,” the Mobil Foundation wrote, “the Environmental Associates Program has the potential to challenge the EPA behind the scenes on the effectiveness of a regulation for the environment and whether sound science supports the proposed law.” The Mobil Foundation recommended offering the National Research Council, part of the National Academies, funding for a study of an oil spill clean-up method, writing: “By helping to fund the study, Mobil may be offered the opportunity to participate or to receive early access to the findings.” Leaders of Mobil and its foundation had offered public hints that they expected to harvest benefits from the company’s charitable giving. “Should corporations ever engage in pure philanthropy, giving money away because it gives one a nice feeling and the shareholders don’t seem to mind?” Herbert Schmertz, Mobil’s vice-president of public affairs for about two decades and a former Mobil Foundation president, asked during a 22 September 1987 talk on philanthropy and corporate social responsibility. “I guess I’d answer that by saying I don’t know whether corporate philanthropy as I’ve sort of defined it, which is just to get a warm feeling, ever existed,” he said. “But if it did, I’d have to say that it’s a dying concept in terms of corporate giving.” A 1998 book thanking Richard Mund, who served as Mobil Foundation’s executive director from 1979 to 2000, for his edits offers a similar view of corporate grant-making, advising that companies “identify a significant business reason” for grants and “obtain as much business value from social investments as is allowable and practical”. Tax experts told the Guardian that the Mobil Foundation’s stated intent to benefit Mobil through “charitable” grants would have raised serious red flags for illegal self-dealing, had it come to light before the statute of limitations ran out. “The public would have a very hard time finding out any of this,” said Naomi Oreskes, author of Merchants of Doubt and a Harvard University professor of the history of science, adding that “typically one can only see the organization and amount, but no details of what or why”. “What I see here is a pattern of ‘charitable giving’ that is anything but disinterested,” she said. A spokesperson for ExxonMobil said: “Our philanthropic arm follows all laws and required disclosures. The ExxonMobil Foundation has a strategic focus supporting education with an emphasis on math and science, promoting women as catalysts for economic development and preventing deaths from malaria.” A lawsuit filed in October by the New York attorney general alleges ExxonMobil defrauded investors for years about the risks climate crisis regulation posed for the fossil fuel giant. In January, the US supreme court allowed Massachusetts attorney general Maura Healey’s investigation into how ExxonMobil described climate crisis risks to consumers and investors to move forward by refusing to hear the company’s appeal. A spokesperson for Healey declined to comment on the newly revealed documents, citing ongoing litigation. The ExxonMobil Foundation was also formed after the 1999 merger of Exxon and Mobil. Corporate watchdogs said issues associated with private industry’s use of not-for-profits to influence American policy have become more pronounced since the 1990s, particularly in the wake of the supreme court’s Citizens United decision, which protected political spending by corporations and which critics say fuelled a rapid expansion of so-called “dark money” advocacy groups whose funding is more difficult to trace. “It’s extremely troubling,” Lisa Graves, president of the board of the Center for Media and Democracy, said. “One of the primary rules for nonprofits is that they’re supposed to be in the public interest,” she said, “not for private benefits.”"
"The case for action to tackle the climate emergency, on a scale far beyond anything that has yet been attempted, is increasingly widely understood. Almost three decades after the first UN climate treaty was agreed in Rio de Janeiro in 1992, and despite the commitments thrashed out among nation states at every summit since, global carbon emissions last year rose to a record 37.1bn tonnes. In October, UN scientists warned that within 12 years a target of 1.5C of global heating would be out of reach. Above this level, temperature increases are predicted to cause colossal disruption: 10 million more people displaced as a consequence of higher sea levels; greatly increased risk of fires, drought and extreme weather of all kinds; shrinkage of plant and insect habitats with massive effects on agriculture as well as nature; the extinction of coral.  Thankfully, and due to efforts by activists as well as scientists, in some parts of the world the climate emergency is finally receiving some of the attention it deserves. Last month’s elections to the European parliament saw Greens win nearly 10% of the seats. For a week in Britain at the end of April, when four sites in London were occupied by Extinction Rebellion activists, and the Swedish school striker Greta Thunberg met party leaders in Westminster, the story dominated the national news. This was a stunning achievement by campaigners, and appears to have had an effect. An opinion poll last week showed the environment overtaking every other issue apart from Brexit and health among voters’ priorities. As one of her final acts as prime minister, Theresa May this week committed to a target of net-zero carbon emissions by 2050. But the danger remains. For decades, our attitude to the climate crisis has combined complacency and denial, while the number of people (and politicians) firmly committed to action on anything like the required level has struggled to climb above a tiny minority. With attention focused by recent, alarming temperature rises and emissions increases, as well as by the prospect of a series of crunch meetings at the UN, serious attempts are at last being made to frame a policy response. The Green New Deal embraced by leftwing US Democrats and elsewhere is the best chance we have. Economist Joseph Stiglitz wrote recently that we should think of the response to climate change as a “third world war”. It is helpful to have a historical analogy on which to draw, when thinking about the transformation that is needed if we are to avoid a descent into chaos and dystopia. To be paralysed by panic would be a disaster. But there are also big differences between the situation human civilisation faces now, and any we have ever faced before. The climate crisis differs from a war because it does not have an end – or not in the same way. And while there is an enemy, in the hugely powerful fossil fuel industry and the politicians who are its backers, this is a much harder foe to identify than a foreign power. As for the Green New Deal, there is a risk that it can be made to sound too much like a leftwing utopia. It is extremely difficult to see a safe way through the next few decades that does not involve a drastic reorientation of global priorities, towards wildlife and away from consumption. Meeting the UK’s 2050 net-zero target, for example, will require planting almost 3bn trees. We can expect air quality to improve as we shift to electric cars. Some people are already discovering a new relationship with food. If the world is to come together as we need it to, human values will have to assert themselves over the forces of capital. But everyone who is serious about addressing what Thunberg rightly calls an “existential crisis” must be honest about what the process of getting there will entail. Some are already doing this. US activist Emily Johnston takes as a starting point her sense of “despair” about the state of the oceans, but goes on to argue that “the only sane thing to do is to radically change our agriculture and our forestry to help stabilise the climate”. Richard Powers’ recent Booker-shortlisted novel The Overstory focused on the immense psychological challenge, for humans, of making wildlife a priority above the struggles between ourselves that so preoccupy us all. Individual choices matter: in Sweden, air passenger numbers have fallen as a result of people choosing not to fly. Analysis shows that the generation taking part in the climate strikes (born between 1997 and 2012) should have an allowance of six times less carbon per person than their grandparents. Cutting down on carbon is essential, and cannot be left to governments. But lifestyle audits are not the main point. If taken to extremes, the focus on personal habits can even become a distraction. Turning vegan or giving up flying are good and important things to do. But they will not save the world. What we must do is reorient our politics towards a recognition of the limits of our planet. Increased numbers of “climate voters” are one indication that this is already happening. But the number of British adults who regard climate as a priority remains small: only 27% see it as one of the top three issues. That figure doubles among 18- to 24-year-olds. Currently, young people seem to have a better handle on the situation than most. It makes sense that they are at the forefront of the new wave of environmentalism. As the humans with the most years ahead of them, they have the most to lose from the status quo. But children know they cannot solve the crisis on their own; there are only a handful of countries in which 16- and 17-year-olds even have a vote. That’s why, last month, Thunberg and others called for adults to join them on 20 September in a global general strike. Whether and where such action takes place will depend on local factors as well as how the global climate movement develops over the summer. In the US and Australia, vigorous activism coexists with entrenched denial, while China’s authoritarian government makes mass protests there a remote prospect. But in Europe, particularly in countries where Green politicians have made gains, large-scale climate strikes are possible. There are many reasons why they might not happen. But when it comes to the environment, as the Indian writer Arundhati Roy has argued, imagination is at the heart of it; and the question of whether we can see the future clearly enough to prioritise it over short-term gain. Having cheered on the school strikers, we adults must now show them that we can. This is what a climate emergency means. • Susanna Rustin is a Guardian leader writer"

Share this...FacebookTwitterGerman politicians are in race to see who can come up looking like the most dedicated world climate rescuer. So the ideas we hear coming from them often get really nutty.

To become a thing of the past? Soon German kids won’t know what meat is anymore. Public domain photo.
German tabloid Bild here a few days ago reported that Germany’s powerful Green party is calling for a ban of meat consumption. Of course the Greens are aware that it is not possible to restrict meat overnight, and so they are calling for a first major step: a “Veggie Day” once a week.
Bild writes:
The Greens want to forbid our meat!
The Greens want to enact a nationwide vegetarian day after the national elections [in September]. Once a week there is to be NO meat or meat sauce on the menu at public cafeterias!”
Veggie Day protects the climate!
Moreover, Bild paraphrases Green faction chief Renate Künast:
It’s also good for the climate, and leads to higher quality animal keeping. Moreover you’ll appreciate the Sunday roast much more after a ‘Veggie Day’, Künast says.”

Bild writes that the idea has already taken hold in the first cities in Germany: In Bremen no meat is offered one day a week at the cafeterias of public offices, schools and kindergartens.
Bild quotes Bremen’s socialist mayor:
 This is how everyone can make ‘a personal contribution’ to climate protection , says Bremen’s SPD mayor Jens Böhrnsen.”
But meat lovers ought not panic just right now. This eco-tyranny and climate protection delusions have already been rejected in other cities, Bild writes:
In Stuttgart in 2011 the ban of meat failed: Employees rebelled against ‘Veggie Day’ and simply refused to be told that they were to go without meat.”
Us meat-lovers can relax some, but we must always remain vigilant against the green zombies like Künast and Böhrnsen.
And don’t rely on the conservative Christian in-name-only CDU party to defend your rights; they are just as bad as the greens. Recall that they too are deep into the “climate protection” delusions themselves.
Ultimately, politicians want to control our entire lives: our health records, healthcare, light bulbs, the electricity we buy.
Already they are monitoring all our internet activity, our reading habits via e-books, our financial transactions, our cell phones, and they are monitoring us in our living rooms through digital televisions. So it’s only natural that they also want to tell us how, what, and when to eat.
Proposed food bans are nothing new. Denmark once tried to make fat a luxury for the rich. But that didn’t work out. Not because of a conservative party, but because the people spoke out.

Share this...FacebookTwitterWhen the Little Ice Age brought widespread crop failures, mass starvation, and disease in populated Europe some centuries ago, the enlightened ones blamed the climate-related misery and misfortune on the black magic of sorcerers and witches – who were promptly tried and burned at the stake. In other cultures, people performed rain-dances, human sacrifices, or other bizarre rituals, all in a futile attempt to appease the weather gods. Of course the victims of these rituals were often political opponents.
Today nothing has changed apparently, as Spiegel poignantly demonstrates with its latest online round of hysterics titled: Flut-Drama in Deutschland: Wir sind schuldig!  In English: Flood Drama in Germany: We’re to Blame! by Jakob Augstein.
According to Augstein, today’s German flooding is a result of man’s sins against the climate. Climate deniers are mostly to blame for the “Katastrophe“. He writes:
High water of the century is rolling across southern and eastern Germany. Now is an opportunity to take the deniers of climate change for a tour of the dikes, and to take the preachers of growth to Magdeburg. But they would just say they are not to blame. And we would all agree!”
If you thought Augstein sounded like some zealot inquisitor from the Dark Ages who zealously prosecuted at witch trials, you wouldn’t be far off. His hysterical language and mindset are the same. In publishing his ridiculous commentary, Spiegel looks like it is stuck in the Dark Ages. Little wonder that renowned astrophysicists like Murry Salby are calling climate science a “cult science“.
In describing the flooding disaster in his commentary, it’s clear for Augstein:  “Our way of living is not coming without a price.”
He adds:
The question is: What proof do the climate change deniers need before they open their eyes? What is it going to take to get the preachers of growth to learn?
Like during the Dark Ages, weather misfortunes are proof enough for the high priests and witch-trial seeking prosecutors like Augstein. Who needs scientific data when we have Maxeiner, Miersch and Magdeburg?

Today modern climate statistics show that hurricanes/accumulated cyclone energy (ACE) are near lows, tornadoes show no trend, and global temperature has been flat 15 years. Worse, ALL the crystal ball warming projections of the “renowned” scientists have been completely wrong from the start.

All 73 models got it completely wrong. Source: drroyspencer.com/
Yet, Spiegel thinks we should just ignore all the hard data and simply accept a single spring flood as a “moment of clairvoyance“.
In his tirade, Augstein singles out pro-growth economics professor Karl-Heinz Paqué, who he says is to be thanked for making sure the Enquete Commission Report to the German government of last week became a “document of failure“. He goes after skeptic journalists Michael Miersch and Dirk Maxeiner for discrediting the results of climate science in the “right-wing corner” of a leading daily, saying that the German government was correct in singling them out and slandering them as infidels.
Augstein sees little hope that people will adopt the green religion (good news!) and warns us by bringing up the downfall of earlier human civilizations.
Those who follow old ways under new living conditions will end up extinct. That’s what did in the people of Easter Island, the Vikings in Greenland, and the Mayans. We should not be surprised if we are next.”
Ironically, all of those earlier civilizations perished because of natural climate change, and for some extinction came because they tried to solve their climate problems precisely with neurotic rituals like human sacrifices, and rain-dancing. Today Augstein and Spiegel are advocating we do the same, but with different rituals: changing light bulbs, going by foot and buying locally. Ask the people whose homes were flooded in Magdeburg if their energy saving lights, carbon credits and buying locally kept the waters back. Human rituals, no matter how righteously and ceremoniously carried out, aren’t going to control the weather.
Science is not about accepting what “renowned” scientists insist we believe, and not daring to question their authority. To the contrary, it is precisely about not accepting what they insist we believe, and it is about scrutinising and putting what they tell us to rigorous test. Anything else is just the superstition of fools, which belongs to the dustbin of history – to join the Dark Ages, witch-hunters, and Augstein.

Share this...FacebookTwitterJust when you thought going green could not get more outrageous, now comes one of the most enraging plans imaginable: erecting a large-scale wind park next to the sacred D Day beaches of Normandy, where thousands of soldiers died to liberate France and Europe in 1944.

Members of an American landing party lend helping hands to other members of their organization whose landing craft was sunk be enemy action of the coast of France. These survivors reached Omaha Beach, by using a life raft. Photographer: Weintraub, 6 June 1944. Image source: U.S. federal government, the image is in the public domain.
The English-language The Local from France reports here that “A controversy is brewing over plans to construct 75 windmills in Normandy, next to the site of the D-Day landings in WWII. Opponents of the French project say the windpark would be an act of desecration. […] desecrates the memory of the liberators.”
The Local writes that the project is being proposed by French power company EDF, which plans to construct seventy five 100-meter tall windmills near the beaches where British and Canadian forces landed and thousands lost their lives. The Local adds:

‘These beaches belong to history. It’s from here that the liberation of the world began. If you allow the comparison, I don’t think the Germans would permit the construction of a wind park next to the ruins of a concentration camp. These are sacred areas,’ said Karel Scheerlinck, a Belgian who lives in the town.”
Is this how some people in France say “merci”? Talk about ingrates. For a nation that prides itself in being sophisticated, this idea sure is an example of very poor manners and bad upbringing by some among them.
This is an idea they’d be wise to scrap immediately.

As an aside, here’s a worthwhile (outstanding) video:

Share this...FacebookTwitterNo. 1, multi-million circulation national daily Bild here has an unflattering piece about Al Gore and his newly found mega-riches titled: “Al Gore earned 75 million euros – in one month!”
So profitable can the global warming scam be! Never mind that there hasn’t been a bit of warming in 15 years.
The Bild piece starts with:
Rich, richer, Gore! The former vice president of the USA, Albert ‘Al’ Gore, alone in January earned 75 million euros. Now he has an estimated wealth of 153 million euros (200 million dollars)!
[…] That’s an increase in wealth of 11,000%!”
Much of this comes from spreading fear over global warming (which, again, hasn’t happened in 15 years). The more fear that Gore spreads, the more his investments in green energy and “climate-protection” technologies and activities pay off.
Bild also informs readers that Gore earned huge amounts from sales of shares of Apple and “Current Network TV“.
This was sold in January for 382 million euros to ‘Al-Jazeera,’ a TV network in Qatar. An estimated 70 million euros found their way into Gore’s bank account. The politician is a stakeholder in various companies and investment funds. Among other things, he’s a co-founder of ‘Generation Investment Management’, which made a profit from 2008 to 2010 of 166 million euros.”
Not too shabby.

Gee, suddenly where are all the anti-capitalist, anti-speculation greens? Bild also tells its readers of another source of income:
Because of his popularity, Gore receives a fee from industry associations, symposiums, and other events of up to 130,000 euros – per speech!”
So what on Earth could Gore be possibly doing with all that climate-cash? Bild tells us:
With his millions, Gore bought a 20-room mansion in Nashville/Tennessee and a luxury beach house in Montecito, California. So nice losing can be: Had Al Gore won the US presidential election election in 2000 against George W. Bush, he would have earned ‘only’ 306,000 euros per year.”
Most Germans have a strong aversion to wealth of this sort. An unflattering piece for Al Gore. Bad publicity to say the least.
Hat-tip: Meteorologist Dr. Wolfgang Thüne, by e-mail.
PS: Another reader wrote: “Yeah, this is how someone can get filthy rich with supposed climate-protection. No wonder so many so-called environmental scientists and countless institutes want to imitate him.”
Things are beginning to come around for Al Gore and his scam.

"If concern over the climate crisis or revulsion over the contamination of the food chain are not enough to change consumer behaviour, one grocery store is hoping that another emotion may persuade people to shun single-use plastic bags: shame.  Customers who don’t bring their own bags to the East West Market in Vancouver will instead have to carry their grocery home in bags reading “Wart Ointment Wholesale” or “Into the Weird Adult Video Emporium”. David Lee Kwen, the shop’s owner, insisted that the plan wasn’t to embarrass customers. “We wanted to give them something humorous, but also something that made them think at the same time,” he told the Guardian. “It’s human nature not to want to be told what to do.” Kwen initially hoped that a fee on single-use bags would discourage their use. But when the five-cent a bag charge failed to stop people using plastic, he tried a different approach. The bags are meant to force customers to think twice about consumption habits. In a social media post, the store points out that millions of plastic bags are used once before being discarded – and are part of growing problem of plastic waste. Like countries around the world, Canada is grappling with a deluge of plastics which cannot be recycled and instead end up in landfills. Earlier this week, Canada’s prime minister, Justin Trudeau, announced plans to ban single-use plastics in 2021, including grocery bags, plastic cutlery and straws. Kwen admits there may have been an unintended consequence to the bags: “Some of the customers want to collect them because they love the idea of it,” he said. But he still believes the plan is working. “Even if you have the bag, you have to explain its origin to your friends. And then, we’ve started a conversation.” The bags, which Kwen has run in limited numbers of 1,000, cost customers five cents. It costs extra for him to print the newly designed bags so he’s hopeful customers instead opt to bring in their own. In the meantime, he plans to transfer the images on the plastic bags to canvas bags. “It’s a double-edged sword. We wanted to address an issue, but we’ve also made something popular, so it’s turned out great.”"
"For 23 years, I worked at a libertarian thinktank, arguing against climate action. But my views have changed. I now embrace decarbonization. Why? For one thing, I’ve come to better understand risk management. The raucous political debate with denialists aside, the real debate in climate science is about how much warming we’ll have to face, how abrupt it might be, how quickly we can adjust, how much severe weather we’ll experience, and how likely it is that various low-probability, high-impact climate events will come to pass.  Uncertainties persist because scientists are still unsure how sensitive the atmosphere is to greenhouse gases. Evidence from the peer-reviewed literature suggests that a doubling of greenhouse gas concentrations above pre-industrial levels (which we’re likely to see sometime after mid-century) will probably warm the planet anywhere between 1.5C (2.7F) and 4.5C (8.1F). There’s a world of difference between those “likely” low-end and the high-end estimates. “Lukewarmers”, such as the journalist Matt Ridley, contend that warming will be at the low end and prove of little consequence. Many scientists, however, have little patience for those arguments, arguing instead that warming is more likely to be at the higher end, with global environmental and economic convulsion the likes of which we’ve never seen. Like many in the climate arena, I got caught up in this debate, and the uncertainties surrounding climate change allowed me plenty of fodder to argue my case. But I finally came to the realization that the debate about what’s most likely to happen will not take us very far. That’s because humanity’s response to climate change is an exercise in risk management – and risk management is not about discerning the optimal response to the most likely outcome, it is about determining the optimal response to the full distribution of possible outcomes. In his recent book, economist Richard Tol (who I used to cite when I wanted to push back against aggressive climate action) offers three reasons why – even if you think climate change is an overblown concern – we should hedge our bets. First, surprises are weighted toward the bad. Despite some technical ambiguity, scientists believe that the chance of a nasty surprise is much greater than the chance of a pleasant surprise. Second, the risk of locking ourselves into a high-carbon, worse-than-expected climate world is larger than being locked into overly expensive zero-carbon energy. That’s because once CO2 is in the atmosphere, it will stay there for centuries, and is very expensive to remove through technical means. Zero-carbon energy facilities, on the other hand, can be retired rather easily if need be, and will at least deliver significant health benefits regardless of how climate change plays out. Third, we have rightly demonstrated a willingness to pay in order to avoid incurring risks that are asymmetric, ambiguous and irreversible. Global warming is all three. Risk management is not a controversial undertaking in other contexts. Consider, for instance, that the most likely outcome of investing your money in equities (stocks) is a better return than you might receive from investing in other financial instruments, such as municipal bonds. This does not mean you should invest all of your money in equities. Most of us understand that markets are rife with uncertainty, and that in any given year it’s hard to predict returns on investment. As such, investors usually hedge their bets – especially when economic risks are non-diversifiable (which is the case in the climate context). The distribution of possible outcomes could be likened to a deck of cards. Equities have a greater spread of good and bad draws from the deck than do bonds, which pay the same no matter how the economy is doing. Therefore investing in bonds is an investment in stability – which is so attractive to investors that they forgo greater returns elsewhere to secure that stability. Investing in cutting CO2 emissions is investing in stability. Unfortunately, no analogy is completely applicable to the climate policy debate. We have a plethora of historical data to inform our understanding of the likely distribution of potential outcomes in the finance sector. We have much less data to repair to when informing our sense of the distribution of potential outcomes – and the likelihood at which they might come about – in the climate arena. We have imperfect geologic records and imperfect computer models, which reflect our imperfect understanding of climate dynamics. It took time for me to come to the realization that uncertainty is an argument for – not against – decarbonizing the economy as quickly as possible. Never before have we run an experiment where greenhouse gases were loaded into the atmosphere at today’s rates. While we don’t know precisely what will follow, we understand basic physics well enough to know that “warming is coming”. How much, and how dangerous it will be, is an open question, but we have no backup planet if the answer is a bad one.

Share this...FacebookTwitterHolger Thuss, President of the European Institute for Climate and Energy (EIKE) at Facebook brings up a report appearing at the online FOCUS just last September. In the report the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact research (PIK) warned that summers in eastern Germany would suffer from “water shortages”.
That’s what their models had shown.
FOCUS wrote (my emphasis):
Scientists have played out climate scenarios for Germany’s regions until the year 2100. It appears clear: Expensive times are coming especially for Eastern Germany. Heat deaths and water shortages in the summer, existential fear of flooding in the winter.”

FOCUS quotes PIK director Hans-Joachim Schellnhuber, chief fantasizer-prophet of future climate catastrophes:
Eastern Germany will probably be hit harder with heat waves in the summer and more precipitation in the winter.” Using today’s laws, power plants located near rivers will have to be shut down at times because the cooling water will be too warm.”
FOCUS wrote that in the future:

Because of the significantly reduced precipitation, for example the already much drier Brandenburg region will see its moisture go further in the negative.”
Today large parts of eastern Germany are under water. The PIK’s model projections all fly in the face of reality.
All 10 of the last summers saw normal or above normal precipitation
And we are not talking about just a single year. Meteorologist Dominik Jung wrote a few months ago that the PIK models also fly in the face of summertime statistics for the last 10 years in a row! Every summer in Germany over the last 10 years has seen normal or above normal precipitation!
What does EIKE president Holger Thuss say at Facebook?
Unbelievable but true! German climate scientists (PIK) have predicted, using advanced computer models last year, that the Elbe River would almost dry out in the summertime in the future. Such people spend 20 million euros a year for their ‘science’.”
So throw the failed PIK precipitation models on the scrap heap along with the other 73 epic fail temperature models coming from an array of other “leading” institutes.
Talk about a complete waste of money.
What’s even more amazing is that lots of policymakers were actually stupid enough to believe them, taking them as golden truth.

"Flood damage estimated at £1.1bn a year is being prevented by the UK’s network of river barriers and defences, according to research. The Association of British Insurers (ABI) says it is the first time the financial contribution of river defences has been quantified.  The modelling, based on thousands of simulations of weather events with and without flood defences, emphasises the value to UK homes and businesses of flood defence spending and the importance of government investment, particularly for flood-prone locations such as Cumbria, Yorkshire, Somerset and the Welsh valleys. The Environment Agency recently warned that whole communities may need to be moved away from coasts as a result of flooding caused by the climate crisis. The research, published on Wednesday and commissioned by Flood Re and conducted by Risk Management Solutions, suggested inland flooding would, on average, cost almost three times more a year without the defences – a bill of £1.8bn rather than £700m across the whole of the UK. In England, the government spends about £600m a year on building and maintaining flood defences. The Environment Agency has called for spending on flood defences to increase to £1bn as the nation prepares for warming of up to 4C above pre-industrial levels. Closer examination of what happened in Cumbria in December 2015 shows the flooding caused by Storm Desmond would have done damage worth three-and-a-half times as much without river water defences – £2.8bn rather than £600m. James Dalton, the ABI’s director of general insurance policy, said: “The human cost of flooding is immeasurable, putting lives at risk, causing families great trauma and pushing some businesses to the brink. Flood defences are an essential part of the protection system which prevents and minimises the trauma caused by flooding as much as possible. “Faced with the growing threat of climate change, there is a clear financial argument for investing in flood defences. The barriers, walls and natural defences that currently prevent greater damage being done by the UK’s rivers during times of extreme weather make economic sense, but they must keep pace with the threat if they are to continue being effective.”"
"The other day, as I boarded a budget airline plane to attend a conference in Spain, I was overcome with a feeling I’ve come to recognise: carbon-footprint guilt. As a PhD student, this would be my first international conference, an exciting chance to meet fellow researchers in my field – feminism and gender studies – and discuss topics we care about. But as I sat chatting casually with other academics headed the same way, I couldn’t help but worry about how my short trip would harm the environment. My booking confirmation showed the figures: the outbound flight would release 178kg of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere, the return another 168kg. Short flights add up quickly, and airlines such as Ryanair are now ranked among Europe’s top polluters. Off-setting emissions is reasonable, but it’s really just a way of covering our backs.  Academic conferences present a dilemma for climate-conscious researchers and educators. If we are to be truly ethical in our research practices, we need to confront the high environmental price of the international conference circuit, which includes emissions and the wasteful use of finite resources. It can feel hypocritical to buy into this when I try to be as environmentally aware as I can in my day-to-day life. I’ve stopped buying new clothes, gone vegan, given up my car, started using fairer tech and shopping at an ethical and plastic-free shop. But none of this stopped me from boarding that plane to speed up the journey.  Travel isn’t the only damaging aspect of conference culture. At registration, I was given a plastic name tag holder, badges, a pen and a guide to the local city. We have come to expect these promotional items, but they’re not exactly essential. And then there is the ubiquitous event-branded cotton tote bag. A report from the Danish Environmental Protection Agency showed that I would have to use the bag thousands of times to make it worth the resources used to produce it, yet it is currently just hanging on my bedroom door handle with various other cotton companions from universities, galleries and libraries. Encouragingly at my conference, the food was vegan and prepared on site at the venue’s canteen. Yet there was still the looming presence of plastic water bottles at lunch, even if a sign encouraged the use of disposable cups for tea and coffee.  Entirely eco-friendly conference models are possible, and indeed already being realised. The Nearly Carbon-Neutral conference model is freely available for guidance and recommends that all proceedings take place online. The creators of the open-access concept want to challenge the traditional format, uploading videos that remain on the website as accessible resources and creating Q&A sessions that allow for more discussion time than the typical – usually very rushed – question round after a panel.  Not only are these arrangements more sustainable than travelling across the world for a few days, they open up participation for people who cannot afford travel or obtain visas. Undoubtedly, online meetings are not the same as face-to-face debates or continued conversations over coffee, but they can create new avenues for collaboration. Equally, refraining from international travel for a symposium might also steer attention to more local dialogue. In my immediate surroundings, there are countless people whose research I know nothing about. What’s more, reducing air travel does not necessarily have serious career consequences. Recent research published in the Journal of Cleaner Production has shown no direct correlation between flying and academic publication output. More senior male academics were found to have much higher emissions: this carbon spending could be cut, not only for the benefit of the planet but to allow those at earlier stages in their careers, or from parts of the world where international travel is less common, to have opportunities instead.  Although universities are slowly beginning to implement green initiatives as a result of pressure on campuses, the norms that rule academic life must respond to the climate crisis threat. Academia is not isolated from the realities of an unstable world, and the effects of conference habits make this glaringly apparent. Changing the way we organise events and disseminate research would acknowledge that PhD students and early career researchers such as myself face environmental futures very different from those of our predecessors. As we progress from a discourse of climate “change” to the realities of climate emergency, every plastic bottle, tote bag and flight matters.

"A judge and several leading artists have written to the director of the National Portrait Gallery on the eve of its annual awards calling on it to end its links to BP. They accuse the central London gallery of helping to launder the oil industry’s image through its BP sponsorship deal and say the oil company is aggravating the climate crisis by extracting fossil fuels.  “Either we distance ourselves from one of the world’s biggest fossil fuel producers and embrace the challenge of decarbonising, or we continue to give legitimacy to BP and its business activities that are seriously exacerbating the problem,” the judge and artist Gary Hume writes in a letter to the gallery’s director, Nicholas Cullinan, seen by the Guardian. In a separate letter to Cullinan, eight leading artists, who have all been involved with the BP portrait award in the past, have added their voices to calls for the gallery to sever its ties. Those who have signed the letter include Paul Benney, Henry Christian-Slane, Raoul Martinez and Darvish Fakhr. “We are in a climate emergency,” they write. “Evidence of the damage fossil fuels cause to the climate, and especially to poor, marginalised and vulnerable communities worldwide, is irrefutable.” The letters are part of a growing campaign against fossil fuel companies’ involvement in the arts, organised in part by the group Culture Unstained. Jess Worth, the group’s co-director, said: “Art enriches our understanding and experience of the world. BP, with its plan to invest billions in new fossil fuels, is clearly intent on destroying it. By siding with the oil industry rather than the artists and art he is supposed to champion, Nicholas Cullinan seems determined to damage not only the gallery’s reputation but his own.” Hundreds of people occupied the British Museum in February in protest against its relationship with BP, and protesters say their campaign against “big oil”, and in particular BP, will be stepped up in the coming weeks. Activists from Extinction Rebellion (XR) are due to disrupt the Royal Opera House’s BP Big Screen event in Trafalgar Square on Tuesday, and the XR families group will stage a protest at the Petroleum Group annual awards dinner, which is due to be held at the National History Museum later this month. Farhana Yamin, a lawyer who helped negotiate the Paris climate agreement and now coordinates XR’s International Solidarity Network, said big oil companies were in protesters’ sights. “The environmental movement is coming together and the pressure is relentless. Society will no longer normalise the actions of the oil majors,” she writes in a comment piece in the Guardian. BP “used to be a British state-owned company and it extends our emissions around the world. It must be stopped. Wherever BP goes, protest will follow.” The National Portrait Gallery (NPG) said in statement that it respected the rights of other people to express their views. “The sponsorship of the portrait award by BP is now in its 30th year and this support directly encourages the work of talented artists and helps gain wider recognition for them and enables free admission for the public, over 275,000 visitors in London last year,” it said. “Since 2010 BP has also given special support to the BP portrait award: next generation programme, which encourages 14 to 21-year-olds to become involved in painted portraiture.” A spokesperson for BP said the firm was disappointed that several artists had voiced their concerns about its support of artistic endeavours, adding that millions of people had visited exhibitions sponsored by the company. In a statement it said: “As for BP’s role in the energy transition, our position is clear. We support the Paris agreement and are taking action to advance the world’s transition to a low-carbon future. We’re reducing emissions from our own operations, down 1.7m tonnes last year, improving our products to support our customers’ efforts to reduce their emissions and creating new low-carbon businesses. We are committed to being part of the solution to the climate challenge facing all of us.” In his letter Hume, however, said that as the climate crisis escalated, it was time for the gallery to cut links with the fossil fuel company. “As the impacts of climate change become increasingly apparent, the gallery will look more and more out of step by hosting an oil-branded art prize,” he said. “Continuing to promote BP as the climate crisis intensifies will do unacceptable damage to the NPG’s reputation, relationships and public trust. I urge you to commit now to finding an alternative.”"

It has circled the globe more than  53,500 times. FOX writes that “the joint U.S. and French satellite was decommissioned this week after its last remaining transmitter failed, according to a NASA statement“.
The satellite scanned the ocean surface and mapped sea level for more than 95 percent of the planet’s ice-free ocean area. According to Jason-1’s readings, it has detected a rise of nearly 1.6 inches over the last 20 years. Its radar altimeter determined sea levels to within a few centimeters.

NASA lost contact with the satellite on June 21 and efforts to re-establish it have failed.
NASA scientists say sea surface height changes with temperature so altimeter measurements are means to determine how much heat is stored in any given area of the ocean and how that changes. Jason-1 also recorded Pacific Ocean cycles. NASA scientist Lee-Lueng Fu at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena says, “These Pacific Ocean climate cycles are responsible for major shifts in sea level, ocean temperatures and rainfall every two to five years, and can sometimes be so large that worldwide weather patterns are affected. Jason-1 data has been instrumental in monitoring and predicting these ever-changing cycles.”
Jason-1 worked together with Topex-Poseidon, which was launched in 1992 and was decommissioned in 2006.
Jason-2, launched in 2008, will continue recording ocean data. Jason-3 is scheduled for launch in March 2015. They will work together with Envisat in mapping the Earth’s surface.

"Tree-planting in England fell well short of targets in the past year new figures show, despite government promises to restore and plant new woodland across the country to combat the climate change crisis. Only 1,420 hectares (3,507 acres) of trees were planted in England in the year to March 2019, against the government’s target of 5,000 hectares in the period, with smaller areas in Wales and Northern Ireland, at 500 hectares and 240 hectares respectively. The total tree cover of the UK is unchanged at 10% in England, 15% in Wales, 19% in Scotland and 8% in Northern Ireland.  However Scotland did far better, with 11,200 hectares planted, taking the UK’s total to 13,400 hectares, the highest level overall in the last decade. Michael Gove, the environment secretary, has promised a national campaign of tree-planting, with pledges from the government of £50m for 10m new rural trees and £10m for 130,000 urban trees by 2022. Setting out measures the UK will need to implement to achieve the net-zero carbon target, which is shortly to be enshrined in legislation, the Committee on Climate Change said 1.5bn trees would be needed by 2050, equivalent to an area of 30,000 hectares every year, with 15% of crop land turned to tree-planting and growing plants for fuel. The Woodland Trust, which planted half of the new broadleaf woodland for England last year, called for much greater government support for tree-planting. Farmers in England face complex choices over tree-planting, because they get little support for it owing to the way the government has implemented the EU’s common agricultural policy. They are also uncertain over Brexit – the government has promised “public money for public goods” in a new agricultural system after Brexit, but there is little detail on how this will work and the new “environmental land management contracts” will only be phased in from 2024, which leaves a gap in the potential support available. Abi Bunker, director of conservation at the Woodland Trust, said: “It will be a challenge, it will cost money, it will mean tough choices, but the human race is at a crossroads for our environmental future. To avoid climate breakdown, we have to act. If the framework is in place, meeting the ambition of 17% tree cover [for the UK] is achievable.” The Soil Association said that the way in which the EU’s common agricultural policy has been implemented in England has helped to discourage tree-planting by farmers, and called for any new post-Brexit system to provide much more support. “At the very least, future agricultural policy should not disadvantage farms pursuing agroforestry,” the organisation said at a parliamentary event this week. “Agroforestry is not a short-term investment for farmers.” Guy Shrubsole, trees campaigner at Friends of the Earth, which is campaigning to double tree cover, said: “Our government talks the talk on fighting climate breakdown, but these figures show that planting of new trees, and replacing those felled, in England is [near] a historic low. Trees are going to form a key part in getting the country to net zero emissions, so we need to see a huge improvement in how quickly trees are being planted.” A spokesperson for the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs said: “Our forest and woodlands are vital for providing timber, reducing flood risk and protecting our wildlife, which is why planting more trees is at the heart of our ambition to protect the environment for future generations. This is why we are introducing our new environment bill, which will include ambitious legislative measures to take direct action to address the biggest environmental priorities of our age.”"

Share this...FacebookTwitterRemember a few years ago when Dr. Mark Serreze, Director of the National Snow and Ice Data Center, nsidc.org, talked about the Arctic being in a death spiral because of sea ice was disappearing due to man-made global warming? Well, I’ve found another one of his death spirals…this one in Antarctica, which has been breaking sea ice records daily.

Antarctic Sea Ice chart – inverted so that even alarmist scientists can read it. 
Call it the Antarctic open sea water death spiral.
Remember that alarmist scientists normally only see warming death spirals, and not cooling ones. So to help them out, I’ve turned the Antarctic sea ice chart upside down. When you do that, the sea Antarctic ice chart looks like the summer Arctic ice melt. Now we can clearly see the Antarctic open-sea-water death spiral.
Soon penguins won’t know what open sea water is!
Of course, now we should all worry about albedo reflecting the heat back into space instead of getting absorbed by the dark sea water. This lack of heat will then cause accelerated ice growth. By 2050 the entire south pole may be covered with sea ice year round.

Share this...FacebookTwitterAccording to preliminary findings of the Arbeitsgemeinschaft Energiebilanzen (AGEB), Germany has consumed far more energy in the first half of this year than a year earlier, up 4 percent.

 Germany burns more coal because of cold weather. Image (cropped) by Arnold Paul, Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 2.5 Generic license.
Alarmist site Klimaretter here, quoting the AGEB report, attributes the increased energy use to “the comparably long winter and the cool spring“. The AGEB writes that economic development played no role in the increased consumption.
According to the AGEB, consumption of natural gas rose almost 10%. Black coal consumption, a major contributor to CO2 emissions, jumped 8%.
Consumption of the massively subsidized renewable energy jumped only 4%. Most of the increase was due to biomass and hydro-power. According to the statistics, wind energy supplied 10% less energy into the grid during the period than a year earlier.
The bulk of Germany’s energy consumption continues to be supplied by fossil fuels, about 1/3 by oil, a quarter by natural gas, and 23% by coal. Only 11.7% was supplied by renewable energy in the first half of 2013, despite the massive subsidies. Renewable energy’s share in the energy mix remains unchanged from a year earlier.
In summary Germany’s investment in the energy transition to renewable energy has cost consumers tens of billions of euros, but has only resulted in higher (not lower!) CO2 emissions, its share remains stagnant, and energy bills for the poor have skyrocketed.
Ironically, experts blame the lack of progress in curbing energy use and combatting global-warming emissions on the persistent cold weather.

Share this...FacebookTwitterOnline Spiegel magazine (SPON) has an article today by Axel Bojanowski titled: “Sea level rise: Greenland melting more slowly than expected“.
Bojanowski writes:
Melting in Greenland is a decisive factor on how fast the sea level rises. Now research on five glaciers on the country are showing: The northern ice cap will indeed melt more gradually than assumed.”
This dumps cold water on the global climate catastrophe scenarios that the German government-funded climate institutes, media, and politicians of every party like to trumpet.
The Spiegel article cites a new study here that finds “melting Greenland glaciers will lead to less sea level rise over the next 200 years than earlier feared” and that “the accelerated ice loss of the past decades will not continue at the same rate.”
The Spiegel story contradicts an older 2010 New York Times 2010 doom and gloom portrayal of Greenland, which cited Stefan Rahmstorf, who said:
The past clearly shows that sea-level rise is getting faster and faster the warmer it gets. Why should that process stop? If it gets warmer, ice will melt faster.”
Of course we know that it hasn’t gotten warmer at all in 15 years, and may have even cooled slightly, and so the process naturally will not accelerate.

Rahmstorf is a leading scientist at the notoriously climate-catastrophe-obsessed Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research. He once accused Spiegel of “climate scientist bashing” and “defamation”. Why? Because Spiegel dared to question his brand of bed-wetting alarmist climate science.
Bojanowski at SPON writes that the scientists reported here at Nature that a melting calculated under strongly rising temperatures for all of Greenland would lead to a sea level rise of maximum 18 cm…”well within the prognoses of the UN IPCC.”
But with global temperature data showing no warming in 15 years, oceanic cycles like the PDO and AMO turning negative, solar activity tanking, and many scientists projecting a slight to moderate cooling over the next decades, these newest prognoses may very well turn out to be exaggerated as well, especially for the next 50 years. Many parts of Greenland are indeed thickening.
In summary, it’s all very much in dispute. But we know things just don’t disintegrate like they do in Rahmstorf’s wild collapsing-world fantasies.
Bojanowski writes that glacier behavior is complex, and that predictions are fraught with uncertainty: “…the strong increase in ice loss of the past years will not continue in a linear manner, but instead will tend to moderate, the scientists suspect“. Remember – the scientists are assuming strong warming, which is not even happening.
The scientists say their predictions are “only a rough estimation that has to be fine-tuned with respect to the strong individual different dynamics“. Spiegel adds: “Calculations over ice melt in Greenland fluctuate because only very few glaciers have been systematically observed over many years.”

"Sir Philip Green does blink, after all. Last Friday, he reached into his wallet – or, rather Lady Green’s – and agreed to give Arcadia’s revolting landlords another £9.5m a year in rent. The sum is not a hand-out, obviously. The Greens still want lower rents on 194 of their shops. The £9.5m merely represents the difference between reductions of between 30% and 70%, as proposed in plan A – shot down by the landlords last week – and the new offer of cuts of 25%-50%. One response could be to declare a triumph for the property giants, or at least those who dug their heels in. They heard Green’s threats that Arcadia would be tipped into administration if they voted against the restructuring plan – formally, a company voluntary arrangement, or CVA – but decided to take their chances. They’ve secured a better offer that they are free to reject or approve at the rescheduled vote this Wednesday. So, yes, it’s a little victory for the landlords.  Take a step back, though, and this CVA still looks a remarkably good piece of business from the Greens’ point of view. Chucking an extra £9.5m in the landlords’ direction is a small price for Green to pay if he gets the deal over the line and thereby secures his bigger prize – an effective cap on his pension liability. On the pension front, Green’s absolute priority will have been to avoid the humiliating fiasco of BHS, where he was eventually obliged to cough up £363m in 2017, when the department store chain collapsed a year after he sold it to a former bankrupt. In the Arcadia restructuring, therefore, he had to make peace with the Pensions Regulator. And he has done it: after some huffing and puffing, he’s got an agreement whereby the fund gets contributions of £100m over three years from Lady Tina, three annual payments of £25m (reduced from £50m) from Arcadia itself, plus security over £210m of assets. That collection adds up to £385m, but remember two important points. First, the deficit in the Arcadia scheme is much larger – between £537m and £727m, according to different accounting measures, on the most recent public data. Second, CVAs do not have a great record of rescuing businesses: half the companies that use them subsequently fail, and sometimes quickly. So what would happen if Arcadia, perhaps dragged down by tired brands such as Dorothy Perkins, Evans and Wallis, becomes one of the flops? What if the deficit in the scheme, at the moment of collapse, still runs to many hundreds of millions of pounds? Therein lies the beauty of the deal for the Greens. Lady Green would still be on the hook for any outstanding element of her £100m contribution; and the pension fund could claim £210m of security over assets. But it is hard to see how the Pensions Regulator could demand that the Greens fill the rest of the deficit. Why? Well, unlike at BHS, Sir Philip would be able to say: “Look, the regulator approved everything and voted in favour of the CVA.” It would be a strong argument. That, one can guess, is why the Greens are desperate to get the landlords’ approval and secure the CVA. It is also why, even at this late stage, it is welcome that Frank Field MP is putting pressure on the Pensions Regulator to explain its workings. So it should. The Greens were paid a £1.2bn dividend from Arcadia in 2005 and, at any subsequent point, could have chosen to address the pension deficit decisively from their own fortune. If the landlords could press harder, why couldn’t the Pensions Regulator? Over the years there have been plenty of examples of the Treasury being unable to see the wood for the trees. But in terms of failing to spot the bigger picture, the claim that transforming the UK into a zero-carbon economy by 2050 carries a £1 trillion price tag takes some beating. Yes, of course, £1tn sounds like an awful lot of money. Yes, inevitably, there will be some painful adjustment for some of Britain’s more carbon-intensive sectors if the government is serious about meeting the target. Yes, the Treasury is the custodian of the public finances and it is only right that the cost of greening the economy should be taken into account. All that said, the Treasury’s argument that tackling climate change means less money for schools and hospitals really doesn’t pass muster. For a start, the £1tn figure is spread over a couple of decades and doesn’t take into account the impact of a growing economy and rising inflation. By 2050, assuming there are no positive benefits of fighting the climate emergency, the economy might be 0.5-1% smaller than it would otherwise have been. But the spin-off economic benefits of being in the vanguard of decarbonisation are potentially enormous. The countries that move first to develop green technologies will reap monopoly profits until such time as their rivals catch up. What’s more, the Treasury case assumes that the course of action it is proposing – to do little – has no economic costs. This is a view at odds with all the scientific evidence. Paying a small insurance premium against the risk of a climate catastrophe makes obvious sense. As noted by the economist Joseph Stiglitz, the fight against global heating is the equivalent of a third world war. And winning wars means being prepared to ignore the advice of the bean counters. Until last week, Neil Woodford had many cheerleaders in the City and the retail investment community. Over the years the most vociferous of his boosters was Hargreaves Lansdown, the online investment platform that backed the launch of Woodford Investment Management in 2014 and promoted the fund manager’s services to its 1.2 million customers. The enthusiasm of Hargreaves was undimmed despite the shocking performance of Woodford’s flagship Equity Income Fund over the past two years. Displaying more loyalty than sound judgment, the firm kept Woodford on its prestigious Wealth 50 list – an influential list of the best funds into which private investors should put their money. Woodford was not struck off the list until Monday last week, hours after he suspended withdrawals from his £3.7bn fund. The fall of Woodford’s reputation now threatens to take the Hargreaves brand with it, but only after the firm has benefited handsomely from backing the man who was once Britain’s most-respected stock picker. Hargreaves collected a fee of 0.45% on customers’ investments in the Woodford fund – a lucrative return for promoting a fund that had too much invested in illiquid assets. Thousands of investors are now trapped in the fund after those assets could not be sold fast enough to meet a deluge of redemption requests in recent weeks. As if all this did not look bad enough, it also emerged last week that Hargreaves’s research director (along with his wife, Annette) and chief investment officer cashed in millions of pounds’ worth of shares in their firm in the weeks before the Woodford farrago. This could all have long-term consequences for Hargreaves Lansdown. Shares in the FTSE 100 firm fell more than 14% last week, while a less quantifiable metric, investor trust, has undoubtedly suffered an even sharper decline."

In response to a Freedom of Information Act request filed by Landmark, former administrator Lisa P. Jackson, current administrator Bob Perciasepe, and Jackson’s chief of staff’s records “all appear to have been excluded from the search for responsive records. The LLF Their exclusion appears to be the result of EPA’s apparent bad faith implementation of an agreement to narrow the scope of search to EPA’s senior officials in the Washington, D.C. headquarters.”
The FOIA request sought records that would “reveal whether or not EPA’s political officials were participating in the improper manipulation of the Agency’s regulatory agenda” with the aim of helping President Barack Obama in the 2012 general election.
In the court filing, the plaintiff Landmark claims the EPA “has engaged in a breathless pattern of obfuscation and apparent deception in its response to Landmark’s FOIA.” So much for the most transparent administration ever.

The EPA refused releasing records, citing “privacy exemption” rights, which the LLF calls “not legally justified”.
An agency must justify withholding responsive records, and bears the burden of defending its withholding of records responsive to a FOIA request. Landmark writes that the EPA failed to perform an adequate search and failed to properly justify withholdings in response to Landmark’s FOIA request, saying that it “unreasonably and improperly limited the search”.
Landmark calls the Agency’s declaration “vague, conclusory, and does not describe a search sufficient for summary judgment”.
The conclusion of Landmark’s filing reads:

The record in this case leaves substantial doubt as to the sufficiency of the search and the good faith conduct of EPA officials in the processing of Landmark’s FOIA request at issue in this cause of action. Accordingly, EPA is not entitled to summary judgment. The Court should deny the motion and instead should order EPA to submit to discovery in order to afford Landmark the opportunity to determine the circumstances surrounding EPA’s improper limitation of the scope of its search for responsive records — including whether EPA employees have acted in bad faith; and to determine the actual scope of EPA’s search for responsive records. Finally, the Court should award Landmark its attorneys fees and costs incurred to conduct such discovery.”

With the formidable Landmark Legal Foundation taking the EPA to get public information, and attorney Chris Horner doing the same, the EPA is coming under massive pressure to honor the pledge of transparency that the President promised earlier. Eventually it’s all going to come out.

Share this...FacebookTwitterObviously the German Weather Service (DWD) just couldn’t be bothered to update the chart it prominently features as part of its website logo. Perhaps it’s because an updated version would completely spoil the desired message of “uninterrupted warming“.

Figure 1: Part of the DWD internet logo totally misleads the public. Source of graphic: DWD
The chart-part of the DWD logo is definitely misleading, and likely controversial legally. Notice how the curve starts to fade already in 2005 (compare to Figure 2 below) and ends in the warm year of 2007, conveniently leaving out the colder years that follow, which would almost totally spoil the impression of warming.
Worse, only the section from about 1975 [correction: 1955] to 2006 is shown – the only section that shows real warming from the entire 120-year long chart. The rest is ignored!
No wonder Harald Martensen was fooled and bought a house at the Baltic Sea, thinking it would become the new Mediterranean.
Apparently the DWD allowed former Chancellor Gerhard Schröder to have a peek at the up-to-date chart. Schröder went ahead and purchased a home down south in sunny, warm Turkey, which is supposed to burn up because of global warming.

I happen to have the up-to-date Germany temperature data for the readers.

Germany’s annual mean temperature chart (Use the light blue curve, which is uncorrected for the urban heat island effect). Oh look! Now the temperature is cooling. Source: EIKE/.
I’m not a lawyer, but I think there’s an excellent chance to legally force the DWD to take down this old, very deceptive logo. False advertising. More importantly, the DWD ought to update it in order to maintain accuracy. The institute is supposed to help provide accurate forecasts based on real data, and not false ones based on speculation.
Over the last few years, lots of businesses planned for warm winters, and got burned by cold ones.
Here’s a chart showing the last 15 years, from EIKE/.

Share this...FacebookTwitterThe European Institute for Climate and Energy (EIKE) based in Germany has issued a three-part rebuttal to the German Ministry of Environment’s alarmist pamphlet, which blacklisted skeptical US and German journalists and scientists – including EIKE itself – last month.

Scientists and experts at EIKE criticize Germany’s Ministry of Environment (UBA) for targeting dissenting views, calls notion of consensus absurd. Source: EIKE.
In the last of the three-part series rebutting the scientific claims and the assertions of the made by the UBA, EIKE sums up as follows:
The claim made by the UBA over the supposed scientific consensus of dangerous climate damage caused by CO2 is ABSURD, BASELESS AND FALSE!
Our Assessment of the UBA Pamphlet
Das UBA is amiss at every level in its climate pamphlet. In view of the politically motivated propagation of anthropogenically caused climate change, the UBA has denied every factual explanation. It has one-sidedly affiliated itself with the prophets of climate catastrophe, who derive their prognoses using fictional models results, and done so without any stringent argumentation.

The UBA violates the Ockham Law Principle where the hypothesis of fewest assumptions should be selected, the paradigm of modern natural science. The AGW hypothesis is namely not necessary for explaining the climate development after the start of industrialization. All climate changes of the last 150 years are within the range of natural fluctuations of at least the last 2000 years. Thus applying the Ockham law principle, the AGW hypothesis cannot be alone at the center. Only more future research can tell us what can be behind climate change.
With the publication of such dubious quality and its forcing of opinion upon others, the UBA will not succeed in ending the skepticism on ‘climate change’. Unintended by the UBA, its pamphlet has indeed lead a part of the media to inform the public of the danger to our democracy arising from the suppression of politically undesired dissenting views and from the denigration of scientists who have a different opinion, and have made it clear they will no longer stand for it.
We hope that our rebuttal to the UBA will bring more seriousness and scientific honesty to the climate debate. Not only the UBA is available for factual discussion and for questions, but EIKE as well.

Share this...FacebookTwitterToday is the 80-year anniversary of mass book burning by Nazi Germany in 1933, one of the darkest chapters of human civilization.

Literary and philosophical works that did not conform to the ideological standards of the Nationalist Socialist Party were collected from prestigious university libraries and burned in public. They included some of the greatest works ever written. Much of the burning was zealously carried out by students and academics.
Wikipedia writes: “On April 6th, 1933, the Main Office for Press and Propaganda of the German Student Association proclaimed a nationwide ‘Action against the Un-German Spirit’, which was to climax in a literary purge or ‘cleansing’ (‘Säuberung’) by fire. The students described the ‘action’ as a response to a worldwide Jewish ‘smear campaign’ against Germany.”
Today the German media are carrying many reports and reflecting on this dark, shameful chapter.

Book burning, calls for executions are back today in climate science
Many of us might think: “Well, this happened 80 years ago, and could never happen today, especially in Europe or America.” Think again. It just happened on a small but poignant manner in sunny, enlightened California, at the University of San Jose Department of Meteorology and Climate Science. Read about it here at WUWT.
Recently a University of Graz professor called for the execution of climate science skeptics. Aren’t the parallels eerie? This ought lead us to pause and reflect deeply for a moment.

Share this...FacebookTwitterIn relatively windy Germany many people think wind turbines are a reliable investment. After all, especially near the North and Baltic seas, the wind blows almost all the time, and surely wind energy is competitive, even when generated onshore.
But that’s proving to be a total myth, so reports Germany’s leftist-greenie daily, TAZ.
According to the TAZ, wind energy investors were misled by exaggerated projections from the wind industry. Many wind parks in Germany are now struggling to break even. The TAZ writes:
Many years wind energy has been considerably exaggerated. Hardly a wind park has produced the earnings that had been promised to private investors. […]. This the result that accountant Werner Daldorf of Kassel has come with after evaluating more than 1150 year-end financial statements from the year 2000 to 2011 coming from 175 wind parks. All the wind parks that were examined were installed before 2006.”
The TAZ adds that the wind parks reached only 86% of their projected turnover. The TAZ quotes Daldorf:
 About half of all onshore wind parks are running so poorly that the investors can be happy to get back their limited partnership capital in 20 years.“
That’s a long time. Sounds like it’s much safer to put your money in CDs (certificates of deposits) at your local savings bank. The TAZ continues:
37 percent of the year-end financial statements even showed a negative cash-flow – the repayment of the loan was higher than what the wind park brought in.”
I know the problem with my home solar system. Even with the high rates the power company is forced to pay me, I’m just barely breaking even. As I wrote earlier here, I’ll be happy to see my money back in 12+ years. And after that I’ll probably make enough money to pay for the disposal costs at the end of the system’s lifetime (20 years).

Meteorological wind models were inflated
The TAZ writes that the disappointing results are mostly due to the “over-estimation of wind income potential“. Wind models exaggerated wind projections. The TAZ adds:
In the earlier times a wind index – as would be evident later– was anticipated that was noticeably higher than the actually observed meteorological conditions.”
Sound familiar? In fact the entire green industry was spurred on by an anticipated temperature index – as would be shown later– that was noticeably higher than the actually observed meteorological conditions.
Has the wind-power promotion industry corrected their models? The TAZ has the answer:
The so-called BDB, or also the Keiler-Häuser Index, on which the wind experts rely on, were corrected downwards multiple times, the last time in December 2011. ‘In the view of the BWE German Wind Energy Association expert, it is now correct,’ says association spokesman Matthias Hochstätter.”
Gee, I’m sure all the people who invested years ago all feel a whole lot better about that now.
Note that all this disappointment is happening in Germany, a country that gets a rather healthy dose of wind. So when you look at wind parks being installed onshore in other dubious places, like my home state of Vermont, or Ontario, Canada, or wherever, many such places rarely see strong winds – often seeing days or even weeks of doldrums – and thus we can expect they will have even far greater trouble getting a return on their investments.
My prediction? In 20 years we should expect to see a landscape blighted by rusty, old, broken-down wind towers. All monuments commemorating a period environmental madness that had emanated from Al Gore’s brain and swept across the world like a global pandemic.

"As an economist I endorse Dan Button’s article (Stop obsessing about GDP: we should focus on wellbeing, 11 June). The most we can say is that a succession of GDP figures over months should indicate whether the economy is growing or moving into recession. Also aggregate GDP statistics tell us nothing about how national wealth and income are distributed: globalisation in recent decades has increased the size of the cake, but the main beneficiaries have been the already better-off. To extract meaning from GDP trends we have to break it into its components: consumption, investment, government spending, the trade balance. Consumption is by far the largest of these, and the main driver of the economy, but its level is precariously underpinned by unsecured private debt. It is broadly accepted that real investment (in new productive capacity) is dismally inadequate for the continued growth of a modern economy; much of what does take place goes into buying paper assets.  As for government expenditure, most of us are crying out for more on education, health, social care, police, early childhood services, to name a few, but as a nation we want “big state” levels of public services financed by “small state” levels of taxation. Last, we have a massive balance-of-payments deficit: we are exporting too little to pay for our imports; we are living beyond our means. We can only continue this by selling capital assets (such as water companies) to overseas investors, thus losing the dividends and tax revenue that they generate.Lawrence LockhartBath • Spot on, Dan Button. But focusing on GDP is even more absurd than “prioritising short-term growth over long-term sustainability”. In Jeremy Lent’s The Patterning Instinct (a magnificent book recently recommended by George Monbiot) a passage spells out the absurdity: “Anything that causes economic activity of any kind, whether good or bad, adds to GDP. An oil spill, for example, increases GDP because of the cost of cleaning it up: the bigger the spill, the better it is for GDP.” He goes on and finally shows that “after a country’s GDP per capita reaches a moderate level … there is no correlation between the wealth of a country and the reported happiness of its population”. Trouble is, this is hard for free-market “wealth creators” to swallow and, as Lent observes: “the mainstream media unquestionably accept the mantra of our locked-in ideology that economic growth, measured by GDP, is the social objective to be pursued above all else”. So well done Dan Button and the Guardian for questioning the mantra. Keep it up.John AirsLiverpool • Although the measurement of “personal wellbeing” introduced by David Cameron’s government in 2010 is a welcome addition to crude GDP measures, it relies heavily on subjective assessments of life satisfaction, personal happiness, perception of financial situation, level of anxiety and a strange “worthwhile rating”. It would be more useful to measure the wellbeing of society as a whole using objective criteria. These could include, along with GDP per head, medical factors such as infant mortality, longevity, incidence of mental illness, numbers of doctors per head and access to hospitals; social factors such as crime rates, percentage of population in prison, stability of marriages and partnerships, working hours, holidays, homelessness and unemployment; cultural factors such as human rights and access to the arts; and environmental factors such as pollution and carbon footprint. Such a measure, if internationally agreed, could be used to rate the success or otherwise over time of governments, and to compare wellbeing between countries.Peter WrigleyBirstall, West Yorkshire • It is increasingly accepted that continued economic growth is a short route to eventual disaster for anyone not protected by high wealth: the decline in biodiversity, global heating, air pollution, water stress, soil deterioration and rising sea levels are all trends directly linked to the increase in the amount of the natural world’s resources going to fuel consumption. The only way we can protect the mass of human populations is to abandon economic growth altogether and concentrate on better using what we have. This will include changing the numerous ways in which human societies channel the profits of economic activity into the pockets of a few, and challenging the immense pressure exerted by those few on governments whether democratic or other.Jeremy CushingExeter  • Join the debate – email guardian.letters@theguardian.com • Read more Guardian letters – click here to visit gu.com/letters • Do you have a photo you’d like to share with Guardian readers?

"It was great to see Sonia Sodha highlighting the potential unfairness of carbon taxes and promoting the possibility of rationing as an alternative policy to combat climate change (“Sin taxes on meat or flying won’t change a climate hypocrite like me. Rationing might”, Comment). In relation to what Sodha calls climate hypocrisy, it is worth noting that, according to a wartime Home Intelligence report from May 1942, the British public showed “a complete and expressed unwillingness to make voluntary sacrifices, but an apparent readiness to face compulsory sacrifices without undue grumbling”. However, Sodha suggests that we modernise rationing, introducing a market and allocating “polluting credits” allowing people to buy and sell rations. But would this be an improvement? Arguably, the rejection of markets, and a commitment to fair shares, is precisely what made rationing attractive to the general public in the 1940s. A report from 1941 stated: “As long as people believe that all classes and sections are suffering and enduring equally, they will put up with very great hardship. It is ‘unfairness’ that people resent.”Either way, Sodha’s suggestion that rationing would be better than a carbon tax is supported by the historian Mark Roodhouse, who argued that rationing would be more effective than a carbon tax if a government needed “to reduce carbon emissions quickly and dramatically”.  Rob LawlorLeeds Michael Savage has only considered the UK’s need for additional nurses, not whether poorer countries can afford to lose their nurses (“Plan to hire thousands of foreign nurses for NHS is axed”, News). I lived and worked in South Africa, mainly in townships, and was shocked the first time I saw a full page ad from a private British medical recruitment company for doctors and nurses to work in the NHS. The vast majority of the white population in South Africa have medical insurance and are treated in state-of-the-art hospitals. The vast majority of non-white people live in townships and only the largest townships have a public hospital that does not demand money up front. The difference in medical treatment can be summed up by the fact that one private hospital in Johannesburg has more gynaecologists than the whole of the province of Limpopo. The depressing truth is that the UK does not train enough nurses or doctors and expects poorer countries to do the training for it.Michael GoldRomford, Essex I understand Kenan Malik writing of the risks if the law were to be the judge of the lies of canvassing politicians (“Democracy is the victim if the law starts to police politics”, Comment). But when is a lie not a lie? Only after a politician is elected? At some time, the law might be all we have. In an era when politicians have subdued our public broadcaster and we are alarmed at the dishonesty of overseas elected leaders, should we not be more careful about politicians here subverting their democratic licence?William SteeleBishop’s Stortford, Herts “Austerity” in the form of cuts in school budgets and to the school sports partnerships programme may have contributed to the reduction in the time pupils spend in PE (“Austerity cuts are blamed for 130,000 preventable deaths”, News). The evidence suggests, however, that by far the most significant cause is the increased pressure on schools to produce good exam results in the core subjects. Even in the more limited time that students are in PE lessons, there is a growing tendency to pull them out for extra tuition in core subjects. At a time when, due to their excessive use of electronic devices, young people lead a more sedentary lifestyle and childhood obesity is on the rise, it is a national disgrace that young people’s opportunity for physical activity at school has been so severely cut back. Chris PrattAdel, Leeds In his perceptive article on the historical amnesia that is creating a Britain that is an “unreal land of distorted memories”, David Olusoga refers to the “fog of historical amnesia” that hangs heavily over postwar history (“Britain can’t be reborn while we’re still lost in fantasies about the past”, Comment). However, it has to be said that planned ignorance of British history, including recent history, has also played a key role in producing so many amnesiacs and part of the blame for this lies at the door of Kenneth Clarke MP. When Clarke was secretary of state for education and science from 1990-1992, the National Curriculum Council history task group was trying to slim down the content of the curriculum. Clarke decided to make history optional beyond the age of 14 and to rule out the study of events in the previous 20 years from the history curriculum. He was doing the country no favours by building ignorance of history into the education system, for it has helped to form the fantasy view of British history that sustains the case for Brexit.David HeadPeterborough Unlike Richard Norton-Taylor, I was not born on D-day but 20 days later, my arrival precipitated by Mother’s shock at a V-1 flying bomb explosion in the grounds of her Croydon maternity hospital, which brought the ceiling down on her bed (“I was a D-day baby but at least I wasn’t called Dwight”, Comment). Six weeks later, she saved our lives by upending my pram in the porchway of a house as a Messerschmitt 109 pilot began strafing us. All this was happening while her husband was away serving in the RAF.David J SavageSouth Ockendon, Essex The UK government’s biased immigration policy is undermining “global Britain’s” reputation and efforts to tackle challenges including climate breakdown, poverty, disease outbreaks and conflict. As leaders of organisations, institutions and programmes that are striving to strengthen the UK’s position as a science, research and development world leader, we continue to be extremely concerned that growing numbers of African partners are being refused entry to the UK. A recent report from the All Party Parliamentary Group on Africa highlighted that the number of UK visa refusals for nationals of African countries is twice the rate of those from any other part of the world. The UK Government International Research and Innovation Strategy states: “The importance of global co-operation to find solutions and to drive our long-term prosperity has never been greater.” TThis co-operation must extend to all countries and regions. It is vital to delivering life-saving work such as helping to bring an end to the current Ebola outbreak in the Democratic Republic of Congo, to ensuring that taxpayers’ money makes a tangible difference and to promoting the UK as a venue for cutting-edge global debates. We must have a fair and equitable visa system that promotes and protects the essential collaborations that mean we can tackle today’s global challenges as well as the unknown challenges of the future.Professor Melissa Leach, director, Institute of Development StudiesProfessor Christopher Adam, head of International Development, University of OxfordProfessor Tim Allen AcSS, director, Firoz

"A city in western Alaska has lost a huge stretch of riverbank to erosion that may turn it into an island, amid renewed warnings from scientists over the havoc triggered by the accelerating melting of the state’s ice and permafrost. Residents of the small city of Akiak were alarmed to find the Kuskokwim River suddenly much closer to housing after about 75-100ft of riverbank disappeared over the course of just a few hours.  The erosion, which occurred late last month, stripped away the riverbank for the entire length of Akiak, which has a population of around 340. “We got about three houses in imminent danger, and the rest of them will be coming along pretty quickly,” said David Gilila, Akiak’s city administrator. Gilila said he was appealing for funding to relocate some homes, warning that the water could soon surround the city. “We’ll still be here, but we’ll probably become an island,” he said. The drastic reshaping of Akiak is probably down to thawing permafrost, the frozen organic matter held within soils. Alaska is heating up twice as quickly as the rest of the US as a result of human-driven climate breakdown, increasingly causing this permafrost to thaw and destabilize buildings and cause roads to buckle. “The changes are really accelerating in Alaska,” said Susan Natali, a scientist and Arctic expert at the Woods Hole Research Center in Massachusetts. “It’s pretty likely this riverbank in Akiak was lost because of thawing permafrost, given where it’s situated and the warm winter and spring they’ve had. It’s not a problem that’s going to go away.” Alaska has just experienced its warmest spring on record, breaking a record only set in 2016. Since the 1970s, springtime in the state has heated up by around 2.2C (4F), double the global temperature rise of the past century. Springtime in Alaska isn't what it used to be. This is the 3rd time past 21 years we can say"" warmest spring of record"". 1998 was the warmest to date, exceeded in 2016 and now 2016 exceeded in 2019. Trend +4.0F (+2.2C) since the 1970s. #akwx #Arctic @Climatologist49 @IARC_Alaska pic.twitter.com/Y1XaPVB3zy The breakneck speed of Alaska’s rising heat is having cascading consequences, with vanishing sea ice exposing coastal communities to storms, altered wildlife and plant patterns that make it harder for people to find food. There is also a growing wildfire threat putting communities at risk. Unless it causes buildings to topple, permafrost thawing is often a more obscure feature of this warming, although it could prove to be among the most significant. As the frozen ground across the Arctic melts, it releases a huge amount of methane, a potent greenhouse gas. Scientists recently found this process could trigger a dangerous acceleration of global heating that would cause tens of trillions of dollars in climate-related damage. A separate study found that parts of the Canadian Arctic are experiencing a rate of permafrost thaw six times the long-term average. In Alaska, there are dozens of towns that the federal government has identified as being in potential need of relocation due to the damage caused by the climate crisis. The village of Newtok in western Alaska was granted $15m last year to start shifting homes to safer ground but the vast majority of communities have no pathway to do likewise. “It’s a real challenge because in the US there isn’t the precedence to deal with this and there isn’t the political framework to deal with it either,” said Natali. “The numbers needing relocation will grow, the costs are going up and people’s lives and cultural practices will be impacted. “Every year there’s a new temperature record, it’s getting worse and worse and you feel like a broken record saying it. This should be the number one urgent conversation happening right now because it’s not just going to be Alaska, it’s going to be other communities all over the US,” Natali added."
"In a new attempt to tackle climate crisis, the government is pledging to cut carbon emissions to net zero by 2050. It’s seen as Theresa May’s bid to create a permanent legacy in her final weeks in office. While this target is still too slow, it’s a step in the right direction. Yet just days ago, her chancellor, Philip Hammond, raised concerns about the plan. In a leaked letter to May, he said the bill for moving to a zero-carbon economy would be upwards of £1tn. To caution about costs is a standard Treasury response to anything. But Hammond’s intervention, since he’s on the centrist wing of a party that appears to be moving ever further to the right, is particularly disquieting. If even he doubts that saving the planet is money well spent, what about the rest of his party? It calls into question whether this government can be relied on to reach its green targets.  The Committee on Climate Change says cutting greenhouse gas emissions to zero by 2050 is necessary, affordable and desirable. Here are some of the actions needed to make that happen: • Petrol and diesel cars banned from sale ideally by 2030 and 2035 at the latest. • Quadrupling clean electricity production from wind, solar and perhaps nuclear, plus batteries to store it and connections to Europe to share the load. • Connection of new homes to the gas grid ending in 2025, with boilers using clean hydrogen or replaced by electric powered heat pumps. Plus, all homes and appliances being highly efficient.   • Beef, lamb and dairy consumption falling by 20%, though this is far lower than other studies recommend and a bigger shift to plant-based diets would make meeting the zero target easier. • A fifth of all farmland – 15% of the UK – being converted to tree planting and growing biofuel crops and restoration of peat bogs. This is vital to take CO2 out of the air to balance unavoidable emissions from cattle and planes. • 1.5bn new trees will be needed, meaning more than 150 football pitches a day of new forests from now to 2050. • Flying would not be banned, but the number of flights will depend on how much airlines can cut emissions with electric planes or biofuels.  So, on what grounds is his scepticism based? The £1tn is based on official estimates that reaching net zero would cost £50-70bn a year by 2050 – about 1-2% of GDP. However, this number includes the investment that would come from both the public and the private sector. So the impression that government would foot the entire bill is just wrong. What’s more, the Committee on Climate Change – the government’s emissions watchdog – is clear that, due to the falling cost of low-carbon technology, reaching net zero would cost no more than the 2008 Climate Change Act had committed us to. Yet there is no mention of this in Hammond’s letter. Ultimately, the Treasury must be the linchpin of the green transition, but this letter shows that this department just does not get it. There was no sense of urgency, no recognition of the imperative to decarbonise and asking whether we can afford to do this misses the point. Yes, there will be costs associated with reaching net zero. We must be honest and open about this. But the key question is whether we can afford not to reach net zero. If the science is right, then the answer is no. The more that global temperatures rise, the more chaos in the system: more devastating hurricanes, record droughts, extreme floods, disappearing coastlines, loss of crops. Climate-related poverty will spread across the world at a scale we can’t even imagine. The cost of this, not just in cash but in human suffering, will far outstrip the cost of transitioning to a zero-carbon economy. Therefore the choice is whether we take action now to achieve the change we need, or sleepwalk into a crisis and throw money at the problem when it will be too late.  The green transition presents a huge opportunity. Reducing carbon emissions across the world could unlock up to £2.8tn of investment a year. The global market for low carbon electricity generation is due to expand rapidly in the next 10 years. And the market for low emissions vehicles alone is set to grow even faster each year. The potential to take a slice of this growing pie is clear. Why not invest in taking carbon out of our economy in a way that creates millions of good jobs and lifts living standards?  But all of this will require significant government action – from large-scale investment in infrastructure and technology, to incentives to bend markets towards the climate imperative. This simply won’t happen without the government, and the Treasury, making the green transition its core mission – with investment paid for by progressive taxation and effective borrowing. It will mean shifting the mandate of the Bank of England so it can play its part in directing finance away from dirty to clean investment, with fiscal and monetary policy working hand in glove. And it will mean focusing every chancellor’s budget for the foreseeable future on emissions cuts. So whatever Hammond thinks, if the government is to deliver on its 2050 target date, his successors will have to abandon his complacency and get 100% behind it. • Miatta Fahnbulleh is chief executive of the New Economics Foundation"

Share this...FacebookTwitterMarch was an extremely cold month in Europe, especially in the southern part of eastern Germany. Veteran meteorologist Thomas Globig of MDR television gave us the March data for that region in the following video:

Meteorologist Thomas Globig on MDR German television. Hat-tip: www.readers-edition.de/
In the video Globig tells the viewers that in the city of Jena, March/2013 was the coldest since 1853, i.e. in 160 years!
Uncharacteristically for German television, Globig, an old pro in meteorology, someone who has been looking at weather patterns for decades, took some hard shots at the latest theory that claims low Arctic sea-ice in late summer causes extreme cold in late winter. At the 2:35 mark:
I’ve been hearing from some media that it’s all because of the ice melt in the Arctic. That is when the Arctic gets warmer, here it gets colder. Naturally that’s all nonsense! Back then [in 1853] there was no large summer ice melt in the Arctic. Therefore the whole thing has nothing to do with a trend. It is simply just plain weather!”
Readers Edition writes:
That’s a clear declaration of war aimed at the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research (PIK) and climate scientist Stefan Rahmstorf, who here attempts to construct a relationship between the cold March and the sea ice melt in the Arctic.”
Thomas Globig adds: “It looks like we are going to have to discard some of the climate forecasts into the dustbin”.

Share this...FacebookTwitterHans von Storch, Director of the Institute for Coastal Research at the Helmholtz Research Centre in Germany, interviewed with the Austrian online kleinezeitung here. In the interview the renowned German professor looks at the proposed causes of the recent cold winter, his new book Die Klimafalle, and global warming in general.
The interview focused on a number of climate-related topics, but what follows are mainly his comments on the explanation that a warm Arctic in late summer causes cold in Central Europe in the late winter. Also included are some comments he made on climate science in general.
On the warm Arctic causing cold winters:
HvS: Here I’d be careful. With climate activity, countless factors interact with each other, and lots of explanations are possible. Using models it has been shown that this special mechanism could function that way. But that does not mean in any way that it is the deciding factor.
Can the cause of the cold winters be identified?
HvS: One has to ask why are such explanations first found after the event appears. It indeed would have been much nicer if someone had said already in the year 2000: By the way, you have to expect harder winters in Europe because the Arctic ice is retreating in the summer. This claim today then would have been far more convincing. But it was the other way around: We noticed that something strange had happened, and then an explanation was constructed. Other explanations would also be possible.
Does the cold spring justify global warming skepticism?
HvS: No, I wouldn’t say that. But it is understandable that people are casting doubt and questioning things. In the past lots of sins were made in the communication surrounding climate change. The impression was aroused that there would no longer be cold winters, that snow was a thing of the past. If things had been clearly communicated right from the start, there would be less distrust today.

Why do you say the climate debate has reached a dead end?
HvS: In a kind of co-production, science and politics have generated the impression that certain political actions have to be taken based on resilient scientific results. Here citizens and society have no say in this, and are expected to just sit there and listen to the clever scientists explain how the situation is and what policy has to be implemented. This is almost a Medieval political understanding.
But isn’t the science good enough to base policy on?
HvS: Of course it is; the findings today are very sure and for the most part undisputed. But that doesn’t mean this applies to all the other claims that we’ve heard in the media and also from scientists. For example that hurricanes are getting worse, or that there will be hardly any snowy winters here. These embellishments are being presented as undisputed. Then the debate proceeds so that either you buy the whole package with all the exaggerations, or be labelled a skeptic who denies everything. It’s either you’re with us, or against us – as George W. Bush said.
How seriously can one really project climate development?
HvS: Actually nothing can be projected. What we offer are scenarios, i.e. possible developments under certain conditions. The results are scattered over a relatively wide range because of the uncertainties.

"Theresa May is doing her best to grab some good headlines in the closing weeks of her premiership. Setting a target for net-zero greenhouse gas emissions is vital, but her government’s plans are too little too late.  Yes, Britain may be the first G7 country to set a net-zero emissions target by 2050, but others have shown greater ambition. Finland committed to be carbon-neutral by 2035, Norway has a 2030 target and eight EU countries have asked for all members of the bloc to commit to net-zero by 2050 and dedicate a quarter of the EU’s next budget to projects fighting climate change. Britain wasn’t among them. What really matters is action, not words. For all her claims of leadership on climate, May’s record in office has been pitiful: support for fracking (against the wishes of local communities), blocking onshore wind (the cheapest renewable energy source) and displaying unlimited enthusiasm for new roads and runways. As a result, it’s not surprising that the government’s official adviser, the Committee on Climate Change, has repeatedly warned that the UK is not on track to meet its near-term carbon targets in the 2020s and 2030s. Legislation will only deliver what’s intended if it is watertight, and this law falls well short. For example, there was no mention of aviation or shipping in the government’s announcement, and it’s not clear if they will be included. Yet aviation is one of the fastest-growing sources of UK emissions, doubling since 1990. Moreover, there is a very clear “get-out” clause after five years, giving the UK the option of abandoning the target if other countries are not taking similarly ambitious action. The justification for this is that UK industries would face unfair competition if others continued with their carbon emissions. This is wrong on two counts. It undermines business certainty, which will affect long-term investment decisions. And it fails to give the spur to the UK’s low-carbon sector. The CBI has already said some sectors will need clear pathways to enable investment in low-carbon technologies. This law doesn’t provide them. But the more egregious loophole is the decision to retain the ability to use international carbon credits to offset Britain’s emissions. This goes directly against the recommendations of the Committee on Climate Change, which said only last month that it was “essential that the commitment [to net-zero] was comprehensive [and] achieved without use of international credits”. Using international credits allows Britain to carry on emitting greenhouse gases while offsetting those emissions by planting trees in other countries or helping pay for low-carbon energy projects. These things need to happen but they should not be instead of cutting greenhouse gas emissions in the UK, they should be in addition. The UK cannot claim credit by grabbing the low-hanging fruit of easy wins in the global south, particularly when it slows the rate of decarbonisation in Britain. If we are really serious about net-zero emissions, they must not be achieved with dodgy loopholes and cynical greenwash. I am also left with the suspicion that, for all the declarations of a climate emergency, the government’s approach is still incremental, based on making green-tinged tweaks to business as usual, in the vain hope that we will somehow creep towards our target of net-zero. We won’t. A carbon-free economy must deliver climate justice, focus on deindustrialised communities, provide good quality jobs for workers up and down the country, and support the global south. This law may give us the destination. What really matters is how, and how quickly, we get there. • Caroline Lucas is the Green party MP for Brighton Pavilion"
