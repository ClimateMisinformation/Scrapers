"The president of the United States openly mocked a teenage girl. After dismissing the 16-year-old climate activist Greta Thunberg in person and earning her ire, he tweeted to his 65 million followers: “She seems like a very happy young girl looking forward to a bright and wonderful future. So nice to see!”  Dismissive. Sarcastic. Mocking. Utterly typical. Is anyone surprised? The Republican party has a teenage girl problem. And Thunberg knows what’s up. On Monday, she gave an impassioned and emotional speech at the climate summit in New York. “You have stolen my dreams and my childhood with your empty words,” she said. “The eyes of all future generations are upon you. And if you choose to fail us, I say we will never forgive you. We will not let you get away with this. Right here, right now is where we draw the line.” Trump took it personally – hence, his tweet. On Tuesday, Thunberg fought back, changing her Twitter bio to read “a very happy young girl looking forward to a bright and wonderful future”. She’s fierce. And she’s not the only one. Just last year, a 13-year old Canadian water activist named Autumn Peltier told the United Nations it was time to “warrior up” on World Water Day. “Our water deserves to be treated as human with human rights. We need to acknowledge our waters with personhood so we can protect our waters,” the Anishinaabe girl from Wikwemikoong First Nation told the diplomats gathered in New York City. Greta Thunberg and Autumn Peltier will join the pantheon of teenage girls who changed everything. Girls like Anne Frank, a young teen when she wrote her diary. Or Joan of Arc, who led an army. Or Malala Yousafzai, who won the Nobel peace prize for her work securing education for girls in Pakistan and around the world at the age of 17. It’s no wonder men like Donald Trump are shaking in their boots. Because hell hath no fury like a teenage girl who is awake and aware and done with your bullshit. The fears of men like Trump have made mocking teenage girls a favorite American pastime. We mock their trends. In the 1980s, it was the Valley Girls. Their big hair. The way they spoke. The way they pegged their jeans and chewed their gum. The accessories they carried. Today, newspapers and parenting magazines are full of hand wringing over “VSCO girls”, the modern day Valley Girl, most of whom are in their early teens and some even younger. All the things they enjoy – Fjällräven backpacks, HydroFlasks, Birkenstocks, scrunchies. It’s all fodder for their elders’ mocking. We dismiss their water bottles, their fashion choices, the words they use. We mock their selfies (narcissists!), their clothing (cheap and too much skin!), their makeup (too much in general! Be natural!). What would happen if teenage girls were actually allowed to feel good about themselves? What if we allowed them to have their interests with no shame? They might rise up and change everything. And that scares a certain kind of man. The Fox commentator Michael Knowles called Thunberg a “mentally ill Swedish child who is being exploited by her parents and by the international left”. Knowles issued an apology. But he wasn’t the only one. The conservative pundit Dinesh D’Souza compared Thunberg’s image to ones used in Nazi propaganda. He posted a photo on Twitter of Thunberg, with her long braids, next to an illustration of a young woman with a similar hairstyle standing in front of a swastika flag. As the mother of a teenage girl myself, I know how hard they are to manipulate. They are strong and smart and know themselves in ways big and small. They can’t be forced by anyone – not teachers or parents – to say things they don’t mean at a school assembly, let alone on world stage. Thunberg doesn’t need anyone to push her. She pushes herself. She’s well-informed, brilliant, and unafraid to take on all the leaders in the world. Like so many other teenage girls. Like Anne Frank. Like Peltier. Like Joan of Arc. Republicans are due a reckoning. Where do they really stand on 16-year-old girls? Are they children, manipulated by George Soros and their parents, when they are saying intelligent things? Or are they women? They certainly seem to be treated as “women” when it’s time to hang with the likes of the convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein or former Alabama chief justice Roy Moore, who was accused of sexual misconduct by numerous women and girls and still had many Republican supporters. It’s no wonder so many Republicans are scared of teenage girls. If teenage girls can accomplish so much and live so powerfully even as they are mocked, condescended, demeaned and shamed, imagine what they could do if we just shut up and got the hell out of their way."

Share this...FacebookTwitterOne way to indoctrinate children on living green is to teach them in a green passive school that requires little energy consumption. This is what they are attempting in East German Schwarzheide, as reported at the online Lausitzer Rundschau daily.
 There’s only one small problem: The lesson in living repsonsibly to protect the climate has backfired. The school’s ventilation is so bad that it is making students and teachers get ill by the score. Hat-tip: EIKE.
In general, a passive building typically has very low air infiltration from outside and is heavily insulated to ensure low thermal heat loss. Indeed heating requirements can be as low as 15 kwh per square meter of occupancy space per year. In the wintertime air intake is heated, and in the summertime the building uses the cool night air along with lots of shading for cooling. These types of buildings, at least in north Germany, are not equipped with air conditioning.
Unfortunately at the Schwarzheide SeeCampus school in Niederlausitz, the climate system in the school building doesn’t work like the architectural models thought it would. According to the Lausitzer Rundschau:
Pupils and teachers dread every school day at the SeeCampus. If the deodorant of just one person fails to work, then half the classroom goes into a coma. The ventilation in the exemplary passive building is a catastrophe. There’s an extreme lack of fresh air on hot days. Because of concern over the health of the children, who complain about headaches and fatigue, parents are threatening to stop operation of the school through legal action.
The school building SeeCampus in Niederlausitz becomes completely overheated on summer days and is badly ventilated. Headaches and cardio-respiratory problems with pupils and teachers are the result. The number of sick days is climbing rapidly.”

According to the website of the proud window and door supplier, Wiegand, the 3-storey €23 million school was built in 15 months and was dedicated during a party-like ceremony in February 2011 by Brandenburg State Minister President Platzeck, and State Council member Heinze accepted the Certificate from the Passive Building Institute.
Pupils and teachers being used as human guinea pigs to test the green experiment. Despite all the complaints, authorities have taken no action and are playing down the problems. According to teacher and administrator Andrea Eisenblätter:
 The air is dry. Because of the lack of oxygen, many students constantly have headaches. Concentration is near zero. How is anyone supposed to get proper grades?“
Parent Frank Klonowska from the town of Lauchhammer says:
It is suffocatingly warm, you can hardly breath. I was completely drenched in sweat after just 3 minutes. It is simply incomprehensible that the technical design of the ventilation system at the SeeCampus even got approved.”
In the end expect hundreds of thousands of euros more to be spent on proper ventilation and climate control, and expect much more than the ballyhooed 15 kwh/m²/year to be consumed. Or, in the worst case, expect the place to be taken over by the weeds soon.

Share this...FacebookTwitterIn a press release here, the German Weather Service, DWD, announces the release of its so-called interactive Climate Atlas, which projects what the German climate will be like up to the year 2100. They’ve got some real prophets over there.Needless to say, the climatically correct DWD’s Climate Atlas projects many barbecue summers in the decades ahead for Germans, especially after 2050, when many of us will be gone and climate change hysteria will be something in the history books.
The DWD uses a composite of up to 21 climate crystal balls simulations for generating it’s climate projections.
Sorry for the sarcasm, but for me these 90-year projections are pretty much hocus pocus…just colourfully packaged PhD guesses. Can anyone tell me what the sun will be like in the year 2060? Oh sorry, I forgot.  The sun is only a backseat climate driver.
No barbecue summer this year, July 2011 was too cool.
In another press release, the DWD reports that July, 2011, in Germany refused to cooperate with the models and was colder than normal. So Germans will have to wait at least another year for hopes of the next barbecue summer.
Germany had a quite gray, cool and wet July according to the preliminary results of the DWD’s approximately 2000 measurement stations. Compared to the long-term mean, July 2011 came is at 16.1°C, 0.8°C cooler than normal. The coolest areas were the southwestern parts of Germany. The highest recorded temperature was 33.8°C on July 12 and the low was 2.0°C recorded on July 16. In Münsingen-Apfelstetten light frost was even recorded. Sea temperatures of the North and Baltic Seas remained below 20°C (last year they were up to 23°C).
July in Germany was also wet. About 114 l/m² fell on average – well above the normal of 78 l/m².  The wettest area: the town of Barth recorded 291 l/m² of rainfall – doubling its previous record.
July in Germany also recorded less sunshine, with an average of 162 hours, or 22% less than the normal of 209 hours. This made it the 8th grayest month since 1951.

Share this...FacebookTwitterToday whenever a North Sea storm blows over a tree, floods a basement, or knocks over a bistro table,  the media screams global warming climate change – proof that storms today are harder and more frequent, they claim. The reinsurers echo that and jack up their premiums.
Hamburg storm of 1962
Today is the 50th anniversary of the great storm of 1962, which with winds peaking at 200 km/hr hit Hamburg, Germany particularly hard. More than 50 dikes burst as the tide surged and submerged one sixth of the city. Imagine if that heppened today!

In total, the homes of about 60,000 people were destroyed, and the death toll amounted to 347 in Hamburg alone.
The European storm of 1953 – the worst in 500 years
It caused floods that took 2,000 lives. Holland was worst hit. Dikes gave way and flooded towns all across Europe.

Other great European storm disasters (when CO2 was 280 ppm):
17 Feb. 1164: Julian Flood, 20,000 dead.
16 Jan. 1219: 1st Marcellus Flood Reportedly 36,000 dead
14 Dec. 1287: St. Lucia’s Flood 50,000 dead
16 Jan. 1362: 2nd Marcellus Flood 100,000 dead.
1 Nov. 1570: All Saint’s Flood over 20,000 dead

Share this...FacebookTwitterHere’s the kind of green propaganda that poor Germans have to endure from their obviously panicked and hysterical Green government.
The German Environment Agency has put out a booklet advising citizens on how to achieve a Climate Neutral Lifestyle, in a bid to avert imminent catastrophe. This is really spooky. The guide communicates that it is Germany’s collective, ethical duty to save the planet from the scientifically proven “climate catastrophe” and that all citizens need to mobilize.
It defines the morality and ethical standards that citizens are to adopt. The guide first starts off by warning citizens:
We are all aware of the importance of climate protection. We are also aware that time is running out.
Scientific evidence on the imminent danger for humans and nature and the resulting cost has been increasing dramatically over the past decades, as has the knowledge about possible action to avert it.”
and:
What is needed is a political and economic U-turn in favour of climate protection.
Social commitment (such as membership in environmental groups) could further the introduction of more environmentally friendly legislation.”
5 examples of living green
So if you are a good citizen, care about the planet, and want to assure that future generations will have a happy planet, then it is your duty to live like one of the following 5 example persons. How you cut CO2 emissions is a “difficult ethical question,” the guide says.
Sabine P.
1. lives in a well-insulated flat
2. participates in car sharing
3. uses bicycle for short trips
4. buys green electricity
5. buys organic produce
6. buys energy-efficient household appliances (A++)
7. supports environmental organisations
She has no car, but “has a clean conscience as well as a lower electricity bill. However, Sabine’s commitment does not end with consumption. ‘I am a member of various environmental organisations and donate on a regular basis.’”

Or you can live like Peter B.
1. lives in a passive house
2. has a solar panel on his roof
3. drives an economical car (3.5 l/100km)
Peter B. says: “It is fantastic to shower with water heated by the sun.” I never knew you could tell the difference.
Check out Katharina C.
1. limits consumption by limiting work hours and salary
2. lives in a small flat
3. turns the heating down
4. lives close to her workplace
5. participates in car-sharing
6. uses the bicycle for short trips
7. avoids long-distance travel
8. buys green electricity
9. buys energy-efficient appliances (A++)
10. cooks vegetarian dishes
11. buys organic food
12. looks out for ecolabels such as the Blue Angel
13. buys CO2 certificates from the EU emissions
By now you are getting the feeling this is communist central planning economy that will fail quickly. Soon Germany and Europe will look like North Korea. Or how about:
Sybille B.
1. has a season ticket for the railway and no car
2. invested money in wind energy (€ 30,000)
3. invested money in sustainability funds (€ 20,000)
The keep telling where to invest. Someone is getting awfully rich from this scam. This is not trickle down, but gusher up economics. Finaly we have
Linus L.
A successful executive, always on the go. His CO2eq emissions come to 18 tonnes per annum. Clearly, this is not a sustainable lifestyle, and he knows it. No problem though: He donates 420 € per year to a reputable carbon offsetting service provider. Hence, his money only goes to UN-certified projects that fulfil the Gold Standard. He sees it as part of his global responsibility – helping other countries to build low-carbon industries.
Some of you may ask what Pierre G. does to reduce carbon emissions. Answer: Not a damn thing. I leave lights on, eat steak, own 2 cars, drive instead of walk, leave windows open etc.
Result? The planet has not warmed in almost 15 years. Screw the green religion, take your hysteria and get out of my house.
Personally I’m going to put a copy of this booklet in the safe so that my children one day can look back and marvel at the degree of collective madness and hysteria that is capable of gripping a society when science runs totally amok. It is truly scary that some societies today are led by institutions seized by such hysteria.
Surely this will be another case study (and again from Germany) for the historians of the future.

"A sample group of 150 French citizens — from unemployed people to pensioners and factory workers — will this week begin advising the French president Emmanuel Macron on how France can cut carbon emissions to tackle the climate emergency.   The panel was chosen by selecting people, aged from 16 to over 65, from towns and villages across France. More than 25,000 automatically generated calls were made to mobile numbers and landlines to find a representative “sample of national life”. Coming from various backgrounds and professions, the citizens are not experts on environmental issues but are expected to have views on the difficulties of combating the climate change and to offer ideas. They will be asked to consider the role of individuals, and society as a whole – covering housing, work, transport, food, shopping and methods of production — and suggest solutions for cutting emissions, which will be put before parliament. Julien Blanchet, who is overseeing the process, said the citizens would represent “the diversity of the French population”. Environmental campaigners said the process, which will run until February, should not be used as an excuse to delay urgent climate action. Macron, the French president, had promised to appoint a citizens’ consultation body after he faced a crisis in climate policy last year when the anti-government gilets jaunes (yellow vests) protesters took to the streets against a new carbon tax intended to urge motorists to change their behaviour. People in the countryside said it was deeply unfair to raise taxes on fuel use where there was no alternative transport to private cars, and while vast corporations were not doing enough. The tax was later abandoned. Macron has presented himself as a world leader on the climate emergency. But despite France’s ambitious promises to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, in reality the country is far from delivering its goals, the French independent advisory council on climate has warned. Everyday life in France does not match political promises – particularly with regard to transport, car use and building renovation – and the government is seen as not doing enough to meet a net-zero emissions target for 2050. The citizens’ panel will advise on how France can cut carbon emissions by 40% before 2030, in terms of building construction and housing, transport methods, food production and consumption At their first meeting, the participants will be briefed by climate experts and will then meet over several weekends until the end of January. Of the thousands of French people contacted by phone to join the consultation, 30% quickly expressed interest, 35% asked to consider the idea, and 35% refused."
"Lily Cole has backed calls for UK banks to “radically transform” and take the climate emergency much more seriously. The actor, model and activist is the latest high-profile name to emerge as a customer of the ethical bank Triodos, which has a current account which can be managed online and via a mobile app. Other famous customers include the actors James Norton and Sir Mark Rylance.  Cole says: “I’ve long believed in voting with your wallet for the change you want to see in the world – for example, supporting Fairtrade and organic food and fashion. Yet there are other subtle and powerful ways that our money shapes the world, such as the investments made by our banks, pensions and the institutions we work with.” She says as soon as Triodos offered a current account in the UK, “I immediately joined the bank, as I didn’t want to be accidentally investing in the arms trade and fossil fuel industry”. Triodos says that according to the organisation BankTrack, the top UK banks have poured nearly £150bn into financing fossil fuels since the Paris agreement on climate change was adopted in late 2016. It says banks should be using the money deposited with them in their customers’ long-term interests. “We want more people to know that switching banks is one of the most powerful environmental changes you can make as an individual… You can choose to prevent your money from financing arms, pesticides, plastic packaging or fossil fuels.” Triodos’s current account comes with an eco-friendly contactless debit Mastercard overdraft of up to £2,000 is available, but there is a £3 monthly account fee."
"Tough Is Not Enough seemed an apt title. When I was very young, playing cricket with a tennis ball seemed more sensible to me than the hard one that hurt. But something happened when I started playing rugby league at school: something deep inside me rebelled at any weakness in my character. That was the start of wanting to prove to myself that I was tough, but nothing was ever good enough until I was 54 years old.  It was 2007. I sold our manufacturing business and set off on a kayaking trip from Brisbane to Adelaide through the Murray Darling basin. There is a mountain range to cross on the way but the kayak had wheels and a pulling harness. As an engineer I was confident in the design, but concerned whether it was possible to drag 70kg up the mountain. An added problem was that 10 months before setting out I had shattered the ribs and clavicle on the right side of my chest. My scapula was displaced through the glenoid, making my shoulder dislocated by more than a centimetre. I needn’t have worried. The big hill was difficult but possible. My shoulder got better, and after two months on the journey I could wash my left armpit with my right hand. The trip wasn’t easy because the country was in drought and I ended up dragging the kayak for 1,080km out of 3,050km. I have since met a fellow Australian who has paddled the Mississippi, Amazon, and Volga Rivers who said that the Darling was by far the hardest. Talking with him was when I started to feel like I might be a real adventurer. My passion has always been water, but it had to come second to the threat of the climate emergency. Nothing else matters if we can’t get that right. I had intended to paddle North America from north to south, but discussing this with a friend, it quickly became south to north extending to Paris for COP21, the 2015 climate summit. Eventually the trip became Canberra to Paris and then back to Canberra. There was no question in my mind that it would happen, that I was tough enough to complete it one way or another. Well on the wrong side of 60 I also knew that I needed to seize the opportunity and not put it off. Paddling up the Mississippi was the hardest physical thing I have ever done. It was during a flood. You paddle in treetops with land at the levees behind the trees, meaning there is nowhere to stop for hours at a time. Barges line the shore for the first 800km necessitating long hard slogs out in the current. Log jams at bends coincide with underwater walls causing whirlpools and strong currents that are almost impossible to paddle through. Many times per day you risk your life in very difficult circumstances. And you are on your own – supporters are not on your journey. They have their own lives to lead. This feeling of abandonment can attack your core, a rot eating at your heart. On my first trip I managed to overcome such demons and on the river my thoughts stayed positive. Eventually the great river beat me and I resorted to buying a cheap bicycle from Walmart, riding 1,400km from Memphis to Greenville and then paddling up to New York. Paddling into New York was huge. I was so proud, almost overwhelmed. Then I paddled across England, through London, across the channel and up the Seine to Paris. As I sat under the Eiffel Tower I tried to make sense of the world. I wrote: The trip is now very clear to me. It is the same as the fight for climate change resolution, a tough hard slog with huge mental challenges. It will be won not by celebrities, and not by the rich and famous. There will be no accolades for the warriors. It will be won by ordinary people determined that the future of the human race is paramount, who will do whatever they can in their power to bring about the changes in our society that must come if we are to survive.” I had made it. Although I hadn’t realised it at the time, I had cheated death, taxed my body to the limit, and tortured my mind, but I had made it. It was nearly time to drag my kayak from the Eiffel Tower to COP21. Then the terrorists attacked. It shocked Paris, it shocked the world and it meant that my kayak would not be allowed on the streets. I was exhausted, numb and ready to just go home. It took two years to get my mind back together and complete the circle back to Canberra. This was different. It was uplifting. Even dragging Old Yella, the new name for my kayak, over a mountain range was fun. In the end, with the support of many dedicated people, we made a difference. I’m still a climate warrior but Old Yella has retired. I paddle for fun now and fight for the future through speaking engagements, my professional work as an engineer and through writing. I am finally content. • Steve Posselt is a civil and water engineer. He set off from Canberra to drag and paddle his kayak through three continents and attended the Paris climate conference COP21.

"Michael Mobbs has triggered an important conversation by “coming out” as a climate survivalist. He expects “societal collapse … a total breakdown within the next three to five years”, so he’s selling his ground-breaking and beautiful off-grid sustainable home in Chippendale and planning to move to the New South Wales South Coast. Mobbs has contributed an enormous amount over many years, but this latest intervention is deeply problematic. It is wrong in fact and wrong in approach, and could contribute to making an already bad situation worse.  While climate breakdown is well under way, and societal collapse is a very real possibility within my lifetime if not necessarily his, there is no serious projection to justify a timeframe as short as three to five years for total breakdown. And the approach of running for the hills (or the coast) is neither sensible nor helpful. It only makes societal collapse more likely, by curtailing action and dividing the community even further. And, in that scenario, it won’t even help you survive. Far be it from me to criticise Mobbs’ personal choice here. His exhaustion and lack of hope is completely understandable. He has been actively working for solutions to ecological destruction for decades, leading whole communities towards action, while being ignored by the vast majority. Some of the responses to his declaration, suggesting his approach has been an individualist one ignoring the need for collective action, are ignorant of his work. Mobbs has been working for collective action, using his own personal action as an inspiring example to support others to follow suit and work together for systemic change, as all effective collective organising does. In this way, he has driven vital shifts in building regulations, and more important shifts in understandings of how we humans can and should live as part of the natural world rather than trying to separate ourselves from it. Ecological thinking teaches us that all collective action is made up of interwoven and interlinked individual action. As Greta Thunberg says: “We need system change rather than individual change, but you can’t have one without the other.” Which brings us to why talking of literally burning bridges is not helpful. If we’re to survive in the far-less-hospitable world that two centuries of institutionalised greed, selfishness and short-sightedness have bequeathed us, it will only be together. It will only be by using the coming years to cultivate resilient, cohesive, cooperative, equitable communities, embedded in the natural world. That’s why, while Mobbs is of course entitled to choose to retire with our thanks for what he’s achieved, the criticism of his public declaration of survivalism as embedded in a culture of white supremacy and the right of wealth is also entirely legitimate. Survivalist retreat shuts off the possibility of action. It assumes that there is no longer any chance of preventing catastrophe, that there is nothing left to be done, that no action to reduce our impact will have any effect. While the scientists whose research I read and who I speak to are increasingly desperate, none condone this view. All argue that, even if we were to pull out all stops now and drive the fastest and largest transition in human history, we will still face severe impacts for generations to come. We will almost certainly lose all corals, including the Great Barrier Reef, for example. Fires and storms and droughts will continue to get more intense and frequent. Make no mistake, things will be bad. But, if we act fast, it doesn’t have to mean extinction. The worst thing to do right now would be to cut off that option and give in to those who want to keep milking profits out of the destruction of our only home. That only makes it less likely that any of us will survive. Retreat, of course, by definition, is only available to a select few. This is why the focus of the responses to Mobbs’ declaration from the left, in particular Amy Gray’s searing critique, attack it as inequitable and racist. My addendum is that just as survivalism makes extinction more likely by cutting off the option of action, dividing our society even further makes societal collapse even more likely. This would be the worst outcome of all. At this point in history, now that we have locked in ecological disruption on a scale our species has never known, we must learn the lessons of ecology. And the number one lesson is that resilience is the key. Resilience, not dominance, is the real strength, especially in hard times. And the secret to resilience is connected diversity, cohesion, cooperative coexistence. That means that in many ways our most important task right now is to build social cohesion while learning to live within natural limits. Luckily, there are ways of making sure that the two go hand in hand. Whether it’s urban community agriculture or local sharing and repair groups; whether it’s models of participatory democracy like Voices for Indi or community renewable energy cooperatives; whether it’s stripping corporations of the rights of legal personhood unless they properly respect social and environmental norms, supporting worker- and user-owned cooperatives to compete with them, or prioritising the long-term interests of traditional owners and workers over the profits of fossil fuel corporations; all these point the way towards holding off the worst ecological impacts of climate disruption while building the resilience to avoid the societal collapse it could trigger. If, at this moment, we turn even more against each other, we have no future. The strongest will survive for a while. Then they, too, will be lost. In reality, Michael Mobbs’ solution of urban living in harmony with the natural world, brought together with deep democracy and cultivating social cohesion, is the only path to survival. • Tim Hollo is executive director of the Green Institute"

Share this...FacebookTwitterI got a CFACT newsletter from Marc Morano about the EPA. It reads as follows:
Dear Pierre,
Last week dawn broke on marble head. Obama woke up and killed EPA’s new ozone rule before it could start killing jobs. 
Businesses, job seekers, taxpayers and electric ratepayers all raised a cheer. For the radical Greens, who have grown used to having their every whim met, not so much. 
There’s a full on hissy fit going on in left field.

MoveOn said, “This is a decision we’d expect from George W. Bush.” 
Natural Resources Defense Council wrote, “Obama has come down on the side of the polluters and those extreme forces who deny the value of government safeguards.”
Greenpeace wrote, “Corporate polluters don’t have to worry about dismantling the Clean Air Act, it appears that President Obama is doing it for them.” They announced Greenpeace will use its tremendous financial resources to launch a campaign to pressure Obama to reverse course.
The Sierra Club said that they were “appalled” by Obama’s decision and with temerity declared it would “literally cost lives.” They too are spending what it takes to put on the pressure.

That’s just a sample of the tooth gnashing going on. Obama’s EPA surrender was like a warning siren for every radical Green pressure group out there (and there are plenty). They are organizing right now to push their man back into line and keep him there.
CFACT is working just as hard and fast to debunk the coming propaganda wave with 
hard facts. 
Help us compete and win. Let’s start with this cogent analysis by CFACT Senior Policy Analyst Bonner Cohen. Please forward it to as many people as you can. Ask them to keep it moving. Let’s email, post to Facebook, tweet on Twitter and not neglect good old word of mouth.
Hard work, solid facts and good sense can carry the day.  We are reminded again that sunlight is a powerful disinfectant.
So send the “hard facts” link to as many people as you can. Don’t let the EPA start interfering with every aspect of your life and property.

Share this...FacebookTwitterSome of us may have had suspicions in the past. Now it’s confirmed – some parts of the green/climate movement are so radical that they are now attracting neo-Nazis and extremists.
The online German leftist daily TAZ has come out with an article that describes a disturbing phenomena, namely: the green movement is being infiltrated by these psychos. The TAZ piece is titled: Nazis against coal.
The TAZ opens with:
Green. That’s the color that is inseparably linked to the environmental movement. But behind the appearance that there are lots of left-wing folks behind it, there are often ‘brown environmentalists’ who spread their extreme right wing ideas via their environmental friendliness. A new report by the Heinrich-Böll Foundation now shows that environmental initiatives are being ever more frequently infiltrated by Neonazis.”
Don’t get mad at me, I’m just the messenger. I don’t want to label the true green movement and environmentalists as brown by no means. But sometimes you have to admit that some of the features of the radical climate movement are strikingly similar. The most radical among them want to 10-10 the climate science skeptics, depopulate the planet down to less than a billion people, and dictate to the rest of the world how to live.

The 6 Heinrich-Böll Foundation authors of the 112-page book titled Brown Environmentalists examined extreme right activities within the environmental spectrum in the Mecklenburg region of East Germany. Unfortunately the book is not available in English. The activities included nationalistic protests against Polish plans to build nuclear power plants and extreme right wing parties providing legal advice on environmental issues. Makes you wonder who funds who.
Anti Americanism – protect the homeland!
The Heinrich Boll Foundation is concerned that organic food farmers in the far eastern part of Germany are taking on ultra right wing behaviours and so advises organic shops and individuals to “closely examine the backgrounds of organic farmers who they buy from.” The green brown radicals also were the first to appear at the founding of a citizens initiative called “Say no to coal!” in the town of Lübtheen in 2005. Apparently Udo Pastörs, a honcho in the quite brown NPD party led a protest against the American coal corporation with the intention of spreading radical anti-Americanism.
This ought not be a surprise. Indeed much of the green agenda is aimed against American ideals, and thus it is little wonder that it appeals broadly to haters of Americans. And how often have we heard radical warmists and environmentalists refer to the human race as parasites? That’s only one step away from picking up a spray can of Raid. There are things they seem to have in common. My suggestion to true greens is that you really ought to tone down the rhetoric against those who do not agree with you. Just look at the company you’re getting. It’s disgusting.
The organic farmers mentioned above have roots that go back a long time. Back in the 1920s in Koppelow near Krakow the Volks Nationalistic Movement of the so-called Artamanen started their grand settlement projects. Among the Artamanen, who were dedicated to a Blut und Boden (blood and soil)-inspired ruralism,  were the infamous Nazis Heinrich Himmler and Auschwitz commandant Rudolf Höß. According to the TAZ report, extreme right wing ecological movements go far beyond the “68” generation, and are focused on defending the homeland and preserving the environment.

Share this...FacebookTwitterHere I don’t mean models like Claudia Schiffer.Hans von Storch’s blog Klimazwiebel here brings up an interview by the University of Hamburg with climate scientist Eduardo Zorita, whose insights I always appreciate. The interview is well worth reading.
The following are two parts that stand out for me (emphasis added):
Klimazwiebel: What would be your advice for young researchers who want to work on climate simulations?
Zorita: …there are two dangers that a student should avoid. One is to get stuck in a daily routine of programming and launching simulations, and slowly forgetting that simulations are performed to answer some previous question. [… }The second danger is to fall in love with your model and lose sight of the real observations out there. Models are in this sense dangerous and climate models even more so.
Klimazwiebel: What would you do with an additional million Euros for your research?
Zorita: …I would set up a project to understand the behavior of tropical clouds in the Late Maunder Minimum, at the height of the Little Ice Age 300 years ago, from proxy records and model simulations. This could give us hints about cloud cover changes in climates a bit different from the present and thus help us say something about the future climate change.

"It has been more than 10 years since a plump, crudely drawn and partially coloured-in blue whale, with an exaggerated and perhaps mildly offensive cartoon New Zealand accent, discovered he was in a spot of bother and exclaimed, “Oh no, I’m beached, bro. I’m beached az!” Time flies when you’re a giant aquatic mammal stuck on the sand, pondering the hopelessness of your circumstances. Created by Australians Nicholas Boshier (of the Bondi Hipsters), Jarod Green and Anthony MacFarlane, the first episode of the viral series cost just $16 to make and has racked up almost 10m views since it landed on YouTube in 2008. And now, after two initial series on the ABC and YouTube, Beached Az is back for a third. The gentle mockery of Kiwi vernacular continues – but in 2019, the whale and seagull have gotten more political, and more surreal. The first episode, which launched on Facebook on Tuesday, offers a glimpse of where it’s going. The two lead characters meet with the god of the sea, Poseidon, who shows them what the future holds in an increasingly desperate attempt to alert them to the ocean’s demise. But the seagull and whale – perhaps stand-ins for us all – are distracted and delighted by the cool tech instead. Each of the 10 new weekly episodes will be accompanied by an educational series, Teached Az, which expands on the ideas explored. If the word “educational” makes you want to run for the hills, fear not: directed by Jarod Green, these episodes hold true to the show’s deadpan tone, as the animated, climate change-denying seagull sits down to interview a range of Australian marine experts and conservationists. In the accompaniment to that first episode, for instance, the seagull asks Greenpeace Australia’s Jack Ballhausen about what the future of the ocean will actually look like. The answer? Less blue. More acidic. Toxic for birds. “That’s pretty shit,” the seagull says. “What are we talking here? Are we talking like a million years?” “We’re talking about 11 years.” “At least it’s still something I don’t have to worry about immediately I guess.” In another episode, the blue whale takes the form of bleached white coral – and the seagull character is now a seahorse. They interact with each other in the expected way: in furious agreement about the coral’s predicament. “Bro, you’re heaps bleached, ay?” “So bleached! I’m bleached az!” The seahorse announces his plan to save his friend: he’ll take a photo of the bleached coral and publish it to Facebook. As the coral politely explains that in fact he needs a real solution, the seahorse brags that the picture has racked up “six likes already!” and “a sad face emoji with a little tear on it!” “That looks like traction, but I actually need you to do something,” insists the dying coral. “What’s the systemic change at the end of it?” In his book The End of Protest: A Playbook for Revolution, the Occupy co-founder Micah White describes clicktivism (which includes writing social media posts and signing online petitions) as a form of political protest that “propagates a false theory of social change” and “encourages complacency”. The message, in this context, is simple: get away from the keyboard and take direct action. The episodes are self-contained, with no narrative through-line. Some revolve around the seagull and the whale, while others follow an assortment of fishy characters. It’s clear the budget is bigger than ever, and the creators seem to have been given carte blanche to expand the universe and take crazy detours – the connective tissue generally being a political point about the climate and ecological crisis. There’s an episode about overfishing that satirises conspiracy theorists; another that follows the seagull as he spreads pro-fossil fuel propaganda and befriends David Koch; and then Dolphins, the weirdest of all, which runs for an epic 10 minutes involving tripped-out dolphins on a psychotropic adventure. Yep. It’s pretty weird. But beached, bleached or teached, it’s still good az. • New episodes of Beached Az and Teached Az land on Facebook every Tuesday."

"Three days prior to Greta Thunberg’s surprise visit to Iowa City on Friday, the organizer and local climate activist, Massimo Biggers, a 14-year-old Iowa City high school student, was preparing to strike – as he has done every Friday, sometimes on his own, since the Global Climate Strike day Thunberg inspired on 15 March. Out of the blue, a message arrived from the Swedish teen activist, with whom he had been in touch, asking him if he was planning to strike again this Friday. “Of course!” he replied, and for the last 48 hours, according to his father, Jeff, neither had slept. “This was truly a miracle to have the town pull this together,” he said.  More than 3,000 people gathered at short notice in the shadow of the University of Iowa on Friday afternoon to hear Thunberg speak. “Wow” said Thunberg, squinting in the sun, as the crowd chanted her name. “It’s just so many people I don’t think any of us expected this many people. This is real hope, so many people gathering on a weekday at such short notice. This is real hope to me,” she said. Biggers has spent the last six months mobilizing fellow students to pressure the city council into adopting more stringent measures to address climate change. “At the time our specific goal was to get the school board to pass a climate resolution,” he said in an interview with the Guardian. “But then it was pretty easy to get the school board to get a climate resolution so we went to the city council and now we’re trying to get the coal fired [power] plant shut down,” he added. The University of Iowa burns coal at its power plant, providing a clear target for the young activists who lead the crowd in regular chants of “End Coal Now!” “To be part of a global movement and especially at this stage, it’s just an amazing, amazing opportunity to see a global leader,” said Abbey Jordahl, a freshman at UI from Ankeny, Iowa. “Honestly I couldn’t believe it when I read that Greta was coming here, I was like … Iowa City?! What?! I’ve been following her for a while, honestly I can’t believe I’m here!” Thunberg rallied an enthusiastic, young crowd, flush with high school and university students, many of whom had made their own signs to greet her. “Right now the world leaders keep acting like children and somebody needs to be the adult in the room,” she said, referencing her speech at the United Nations in New York the previous week. Thunberg said afterwards that she doesn’t like being the centre of attention. “It’s very hard to get used to,” she admitted, “but it’s something I have to do and I can’t really complain. I just kind of shut off the brain,” she said. Explaining why she believes she is now on the receiving end of criticism from world leaders like Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin, she suggested: “They do it because they see something that is threatening and they want to silence that and if they don’t have anything else to say, if they can’t criticize the science, which is all we are saying, then they start attacking us personally and sending threats and hate and so on so maybe they can’t cope with it. “It could definitely be they feel threatened by a new generation,” she added “There is a lot of young people especially young girls in this movement who are leading and maybe they don’t like that, I don’t know!” Claire Carlson, a senior studying geoscience, environmental science and business at UI from Ottumwa had joined friends from the Environmental Science Club at the rally. “Its nice to finally see a large group of people come together and address the problem,” she said. “I think Greta’s done a really good job of bringing a voice to that especially at a really young age. I think it means that more people are starting to understand the need for impactful legislation with regards to climate change.” Carlson, like her friend Emma Hartke, will be able to caucus next February for a Democratic candidate. “I think Elizabeth Warren has a really good plan for climate change,” said Hartke. Carlson favours the young mayor from South Bend, Indiana, Pete Buttigieg, but Warren is the name on most people’s lips when asked which way they’re currently leaning. “There are still some centrists who like to play both sides on climate … such as Joe Biden,” said Derek Torres who has moved to Iowa City from Atlanta. “They always speak in terms of jobs … but if there’s no air or water there’s no jobs,” he reasoned. Thunberg has become adept at using Twitter to spread her message, but does she enjoy using it? “Yes and no,” she said. “A lot of it is just meaningless. And people wanting to brag about themselves or whatever, lots of hate, trolls, anonymous people who have separate accounts.” But she admitted she does enjoy updating her tagline. “You need to have fun as well,” she joked."

Share this...FacebookTwitterHave you ever been to a dinner party with lots of people when suddenly a mouse runs across the room and someone yells “mouse!” Most people simply ignore the intrusion, while others may ask “where?” But you can always count on someone flying into a fit of hysteria, jumping up on a table screaming and shaking violently until the medics arrive and shoot the person up with a massive dose of tranquilizers before wheeling the sedated patient to the nearest hospital for overnight obsevation. Irrational? Yes.That was pretty much how German politicians and media reacted in the wake of Fukushima. As the rest of the world watched with concern, and had their reactors checked over for good measure, Germany flipped out and plunged into a wave mass panic not seen since Orson Welles’ radio adaptation of War of the Worlds by H. G. Wells on October 30, 1938. After Fukushima, Germany immediately shut down 8 of its older reactors and then rammed through a law ordering the remaining 9 reactors be shut down as soon as possible.
That bout of total irrationality and panicked decision-making is now going to cost Germany a bundle, so estimates engineering giant Siemens AG here. Hat-tip Benny Peiser.
According to Reuters:
Germany’s exit from nuclear power could cost the country as much as 1.7 trillion  euros ($2.15 trillion) by 2030, or two thirds of the country’s GDP in 2011,  according to Siemens (SIEGn.DE),  which built all of Germany’s 17 nuclear plants.”
If that does not bankrupt something, nothing will. Germany wants to switch over to renewable energy. How much will that impact global temperatures? A few hundreths of a degree?
The estimate from Siemens makes some assumptions. Reuters writes:
The estimate of 1.7 trillion euros assumes strong expansion of renewables, with feed-in tariffs as the biggest chunk of costs. The cost would be lower — at about 1.4 billion euros — if gas was one of the major energy alternatives, Suess said.

The estimates given by Siemens factor in feed-in tariffs — costs that utilities have to pay to generators of renewable energy — investments into power transmission and distribution, operations and maintenance as well as technologies to store renewable energy and carbon dioxide.”
Siemens’ estimate is much higher than the 250-300 billion euros estimate given earlier by power plant executives. In the end, the price increase will be paid by the consumer, both private and business. This will hardly make Germany an attractive place to work (which is an activity that requires energy).
So it’s little wonder that businesses are calling it quits in Germany and moving to places that are more business friendly and energy is cheaper.
Don’t take my word for it. According to CO2 Handel here, comnpanies now see Germnany as a risk:
Rising energy and raw material prices are the top risks for Germany as a place to do business. Also 58% of companies fear that power outages. Since switching off 8 nuclear power reactors, power plants are have to switch on and off faster than ever before.”

The Germany-based European Institute for Climate and Energy (EIKE)has a piece called: First The IPCC and Now The DWD: Tricked Series With Alleged Warming After the Year 2000. The piece alleges that both the IPCC and the German Weather Service (DWD) are playing it loose with temperature data sets to produce the illusion of global warming for the last 10 years.
========================================
First The IPCC and Now The DWD: Tricked Series With Alleged Warming After the Year 2000
By Josef Kowatsch, for EIKE
In February 2007 Working Group I of the IPCC released its Summary for Policymakers (SPM) on the status of the global climate for political leaders. It was already false at the time it was published and it certainly hasn’t gotten more correct since then.

Fig. 1 shows the B1 scenario with a CO2 increase to 600 ppm, A1B to 850 ppm, and the pessimistic A2 of 1250 ppm. The year 2000 scenario illustrates the optimistic case of CO2 remaining stable at 390 ppm.
Although the IPCC computer graphic appears colorful and pretty, it is completely remote of reality, and is a science sham.  To explain why, let’s begin by dividing up the graphic in 2 parts.
Part 1: 1900 to 2000
From the year 1900 to 2000, i.e. the left half, this part is made up of real measured data, even if the IPCC does not cite a data source.  According to the curve, there is a detectable temperature increase. No one disputes the fact that it has gotten warmer since the end of the Little Ice Age.
Here one has to consider the fact that the global warming was for the most part driven by the urban heat island effect (UHI), which was caused by man over the last 100 years. Measurement stations, which earlier were mostly located outside of built-up areas, are located today in the middle of built-up areas. The thermometer themselves don’t know whether the warmth originates from the climate or from built-up infrastructure, and so they record the error along with the measurement. Out in the open countryside, or out to sea, these temperature increases do not occur.
If one cleans up the temperature records to account for the UHI effect, then the alleged temperature increase becomes much less obvious.
Also see: “Wärmeinseleffekt täuscht Klimaerwärmung vor“ (UHI masquerades as climate warming).

Fig. 2: In the last 100 years, temperatures in Germany have remained more or less the same. There have been warm years and cold years – even decades. We had an increase just before the millenium ended. After 2000 we had a decline.

Part 2, 1900 to 2000
After the year 2000, is the above curve headed for reality? According to the IPCC the C02 concentration increased 15 ppm over the last 10 years. And the temperatures? Contrary to the tricked IPCC curve, they’ve fallen. The curves of the IPCC should have gone downwards. Therefore all 4 shown scenarios are false. In Germany the temperature drop since 2000  is 2°C. This was confirmed by the German Weather Service (DWD) in Offenbach (by E-mail dated 6 September 2010):
…globally 1998 is the warmest year and in Germany it is 2000. That’s no secret, and anyone can know this …“
The real temperature drop is not shown in the IPCC curve from Figure 1. Shown are only the false projections beginning in the year 2000. Neither politicians nor the media (and forget the Umweltbundesamt [German Federal Department of Environment]) have bothered to take the time to examine the data for the IPCC and at the DWD for the years 2000 to 2010, which show average temperatures of:
9.9/ 9.0/ 9.6 / 9.4 / 9.0 / 9.0 / 9.5 / 9.9 / 9.5 / 9.2 / 7.8.°C
This is how the easily duped, like the media and our politicians, become victims of a climate propaganda and then act to further propagate the fantasy of ongoing warming. 
From the entire course of the original DWD values, we now consider only the last 12 years.

Fig.3:  Original curve of the DWD: The section of the first 6 years up to 2004 is 9.4°C. The section of the following 6 years up to the year 2010 is 9.15°C. Strangely, this curve was on the official DWD website for only a few weeks.
Summary
The IPCC is playing around with tricked data. The temperature curve of the IPCC shown in Fig. 1 still keeps popping up in the media. Here the first part of the curve is not correct, and the computer forecast second part is completely false for the first 10 years. Nobody really knows what will happen in the next 10 years. And as far as the year 2050 is concerned, absolutely no one can know.

Share this...FacebookTwitterWith another financial crisis flaring up, the green energy sector this time is taking a hit. This is being reported today in the German language Technology Review here.
Hat-tip: reader Jean
No wonder Al Gore blew a fuse a few days back. With this news and the Chicago Climate Exchange shutting down, the poor bloke is probably taking a real hit. Might want to have a skyscraper watch.
The article starts with the introduction:
Innovative companies of the finance-intense sector of renewable energy risk are getting their supply of cash cut off. Investors are opting for lower risk projects.”
Almost everywhere globally governments are scaling back programs that support renewable energies.”

And so it’s only normal that venture capital companies are now opting out. Investment strategies are changing. Technology Review writes:
Germany, Italy and Spain are reducing subsidies, in America the money from the 2009 stimulus package is slowly running out.”
According to Technology Review, people want quicker returns and less risk. Well who doesn’t? Technology Review writes:
During the last years many finance companies began, however, to invest in long-term projects with high capital requirements. That only worked mainly because they were able to expect subsidies from the state. Thus hundreds of millions flowed into start-ups in solar technology, which first had to build expensive plants to get the technology ripe for the market. The profits came later, if at all.”
Now the state subsidies are shrinking and new startups will have little chance of competing against the already established companies – too risky. The bubble has nowhere to go but to implode. So watch the politicians soon scramble and start blaming “speculators” and “greedy finance companies” for the mess they themselves created, and then start calling for more financial regulation. Technology Review sums it up:
David Victor, expert for solar and wind energy support at the University of California in San Diego fears the worst: ‘Innovation in the energy sector could slip into a major crisis’.”

A quite recent headline in our news warned that “Regions must brace for weather extremes: UN climate panel”. Apparently this will be the after-effect of global warming caused by man-made greenhouse gases. We can expect more frequent extreme events such as the drought in Texas and the Thailand floods because of global warming, they said.
Figure 1
 
It is strange that the IPCC panel should link recent extreme weather events to global warming because quite simply there has been no global warming to speak of for 10-15 years now based on the official climate data from the governments of the world [US /NCDC, ENVIRONMENT CANADA and THE EUROPEAN ENVIRONMENTAL AGENCY. Recently US meteorologist Anthony Watts showed that the continental U.S. has not warmed in the last 10 years, and in fact has grown cooler in the summer and colder in the winter. The climate data numbers come from the National Climatic Data Center.
Not only have the US temperatures been flat for the last 10-15 years, but a similar pattern is happening in Canada. The Canadian national annual, summer and winter temperature departures from the 1961-1990 averages have been flat for 10-14 years when measured on Excel linear trend and based on Environment Canada’s own data. Comparing today’s winter temperature departure with that of the period 1961-1990 can be misleading since the 1961-1990 period was low or cool phase of the planet’s 60 year cycle and any comparison will always show warming not due to man generated global warming, but due to natural and regular changes (30 years of cooler weather followed by 30 years of warmer weather) in the planets climate pattern. It is like comparing summer temperatures with winter temperatures, the summer will always show warming.
Regionally 7 of the 11 regions reported by Environment Canada showed declining or flat winter temperature departures over the last 10 years. The average winter departure was about 2°C between 1998-2011. Only the Atlantic Coast, Northeastern Forests and Arctic Tundra, Mountains, and Fiords showed rising winter temperature departures. But the North Atlantic Ocean heat content is dropping and so is the Arctic Ocean’s heat content.
The Northern Hemisphere, North Atlantic, North Pacific and East Pacific SST Anomalies are all dropping. It will not be long before the Atlantic Coast and the Arctic regions will show similar cooling as the AMO goes cool or negative. North America is more likely see much cold weather during the next 20-30 years rather than global warming of 3-6°C as predicted by the IPCC. The recent severe winter weather along Alaska and the US east coast was just a sample of what may lie ahead. This cooling has been building for a decade now. So how can global warming be causing current and future extreme weather events when global warming as predicted has not been happening for a decade and is unlikely to happen during the next 30 years since the world 60-year climate cycle is heading for colder weather due to changing ocean surface temperatures and changes in deep ocean currents?
Ocean SST as measured by PDO, AMO, ocean heat content and ENSO cycles and pressure changes as measured by AO and NAO are all pointing to a future cooling planet. AMO has gone negative in November 2011 for the first time since early 2009. Time will tell whether this is just the normal seasonal dip or a long-term pattern. This cooler AMO, if sustained through the winter, could signify cooler weather for the US east coast and Western Europe. Several severe storms have already happened this fall on both sides of the Atlantic.
Here are two web references to support the above evidence of global cooling in North America: http://wattsupwiththat.com and http://ca.news.yahoo.com/blogs.
So why are we pouring all this taxpayers money to solve a the non-existing problem as currently defined when the world is near financial collapse and there are so many more pressing problems in our world today? Any prudent leader should see we need to change our priorities.
Further evidence of global cooling 
The five following graphs illustrate the lack of global warming in US and Canada.

North American snow extent as reported by Rutgers University 
The North American snow extent has been increasing for 5 years in a row since the Pacific Ocean SST pattern started to show cooler water as measured by PDO. Already the 2011-2012 winter snow extent is greater than that of 2010-2011 winter by some 60% by week 45. Snow extent levels are approaching the record levels of the late 1970s.

Canadian winter, summer and annual temperature departures from 1961-1990. Averages for the years 1998 -2011
The annual trend of the departures as shown below indicates a flat or slightly cooling trend, and not global warming at all. Yes they fluctuate but that does not mean the trend is warming.

Canadian winter temperature departures from 1961-1990. Averages for the years 1998-2011

http://ec.gc.ca/adsc-cmda/default.asp?lang=En&n=4A21B114-1
The winter cooling is especially apparent in the Canadian bread basket, namely the Prairie Provinces and their north half or the Northwestern Forests. Environment Canada reports in their Trend, Extremes and Current Season Ranking, 1948-2011[64 years] that the warming trend in these areas is 3.2 and 3.7 degrees C over the last 64 years. What is far more meaningful and not stated in their bulletins is that this area has been cooling for 10 years and very rapidly since 2006. The winter temperature departures dropped some 7°C between 2006 and 2009 alone and have been below or at the 1961-1990 averages for the last 3-4 years (see below). No wonder we are having all the spring floods from the extra melting snow in this area.
The cold winters are likely to continue and so are the floods for the next 20-30 years as the 60 year planetary climate cycle goes into its cold phase. We are having the winters like the previous cold cycle 30 years ago. Yet Environment Canada only talks about continuing global warming . on their web page. There is absolutely nothing about possible global cooling or warning to the Canadian public and businesses about possible flooding again, crop losses, infrastructure disruptions, etc from the pending weather.

PDO 
In November, the Pacific Decadal Oscillation or PDO dropped to its lowest level since 1961 at -2.33. The 1961 level was -2.69. PDO  is an after effect of the ENSO signal and reflects a spatial pattern of the amount of cooler water in the north Pacific. Negative levels are accompanied by much cooler weather in the Northern Hemisphere especially in North America. This index started to go negative in 2007 and based on historical patterns, it could be negative for the next 20-30 years, signifying cooler weather for the same period. This has already been apparent the last four years in the North American weather – especially the winters.

Share this...FacebookTwitterThe excellent SOLARKRITIK.de here  brings our attention to a very recent clip of Hans Schellnhuber in an interview with ZDF German Public television (July 3, 2011). Note how master-planner Schellnhuber just cannot control his itch to rewrite international law.

Again climate lies from Professor Schellnhuber
He now claims that the 2°C limit of global warming, which is the invention of Schellnhuber’s own junk science at the alarmist Potsdam Institute for Climate Crackpots (PIK), is “Völkerrechtlich anerkannt“, i.e. in English: “recognized by international law”. Here’s what the man Schellnhuber said:
The emissions of the global greenhouse gas, CO2, must again start to sink globally at the latest by 2020, otherwise we will have no chance of reaching the 2-degree C limit recognized by international law – the Earth’s warming must be limited to 2°C.
At the 19 sec. mark, the video repeats “das Völkerrechtlich anerkannt 2°C”  a number of times just so listeners can be sure they heard it right.
That the 2°C is recognized by international law is a flat out lie, a fantasy of Schellnhuber’s growing desperation. It is not international law. The 2°C limit is, however, one of the cornerstones of his masterplan to transform society.

"The activist Greta Thunberg has urged Justin Trudeau and other world leaders to do more for the environment as she led half a million protesters in Montreal as part of a global wave of “climate strikes.” The 16-year-old Swede met privately with the Canadian prime minister but later told a news conference with local indigenous leaders that he was “not doing enough” to curb greenhouse gases responsible for global warming. “My message to all the politicians around the world is the same. Just listen and act on the current best available science,” she said. Thunberg generated headlines around the world earlier this week with her viral so-called “How Dare You?” speech at the UN climate summit, accusing world leaders of betraying her generation. The teenager has inspired millions of youths, drawn to her cause by her passion and a mature, committed rhetorical style that belies her young age. She has also drawn mockery from some, including Donald Trump, who tweeted sarcastically that “she seems like a very happy young girl looking forward to a bright and wonderful future”. Without naming the US president, Thunberg said she didn’t “understand why grown-ups would choose to mock children and teenagers for just communicating and acting on the science when they could do something good instead”. “We’ve become too loud for people to handle so people want to silence us … We should also take that as a compliment.” Trudeau and other Canadian party leaders took a breather from a tight election campaign to join Thunberg at the Montreal rally – along with around 500,000 protesters, according to organizers. Walking with his wife and children, Trudeau mingled with a boisterous crowd that brandished placards reading “Respect Mother Earth” and “Make America Greta Again” – a riff on a campaign slogan popularized by Trump, a noted climate change skeptic. One man was tackled by security when he appeared to lunge at the prime minister, while 13-year-old Annabelle Vellend broke out in tears when she spotted Thunberg, telling AFP: “I really believe in Greta’s movement.” “She is doing amazing things and it’s great that she’s able to press politicians to act on climate change, during an election,” she said. In his first term, Trudeau cast himself as a champion in the fight against global warming, but his green image was tarnished by his nationalization of an oil pipeline to salvage the construction project after years of delay. The prime minister said after meeting Thunberg and pledging to fund the planting of 2bn trees: “I agree with her entirely. We need to do more.” Earlier this week, the Liberal leader vowed that Canada would reach net-zero carbon dioxide emissions by 2050, joining 66 other countries that have already signed on to the pledge. Last Friday, more than 4 million youths – and adults – rallied in “climate strikes” around the world. Turnout at events a week on was smaller, but still vocal. In Italy, hundreds of thousands of young people took to the streets while an estimated 40,000 protested outside New Zealand’s parliament. In Canada, events also attracted huge crowds in the capital, Ottawa; in Toronto; and in several other cities. In the heart of the giant Montreal march, Alexanne Lessard stood out in her tree costume. “I’m here for our future, to show our government that we the majority want to do something and that they can take big steps that will an impact,” she said. Daphnee Choquette said she came out for her baby girl, whom she carried with her. “It’s too late for us [older people], but not for them. We need to bring about change now,” she said. • This article was amended on 30 September 2019 to remove a reference to the Montreal climate marchers being predominantly children."

Share this...FacebookTwitterRemember how greeny two-shoes EU thought it could implement the EU Directive requiring all airlines that start or land in Europe to participate in its costly emissions trading scheme beginning in 2012  – all to rescue the planet?
EU airline emissions directive meets reality. (Photo credit: NASA)
In the system greenhouse gas emissions would have a price and the airlines would have to buy emissions permits. And the EU meant business. Any airline that refused to play along with its let’s-pretend-to-rescue-the-planet-game would be restricted from flying to and from Europe. Yes, it was time to tell the rest of the world how to behave and to bow to its demands.
Well, reality has a way of catching up with obscene and absurd green ideas. In this case it isn’t taking long.
Today the German CO2 Handel.de reports here that the EU has decided to back off.  Hey, we were just kidding. The EU will now accept pledges from countries to cut emisions at home. Yeah, we know what that’s worth. It needs to be pointed out that airlines in EU countries can forget about getting out of buying certificates…it appears the concessions are for non-EU airlines only.
Gee, I wonder why the tune is changing. According to CO2 Handel:

There was massive resistance from outside. More than 20 countries, among them Russia, India, Brazil, China and USA, threatened to revoke landing and air space rights for European airlines if the EU stuck to its plan. Behind the scenes, China warned that it could cancel billions of euros in orders for French and German Airbus planes.”
Well hey, maybe climate is not really that serious after all. A promise to cut somewhere else will do.
Humiliated, EU Climate Commissar Connie Hedegaard sent out her spokesman to deliver the message on Thursday in Brussels:
We’re flexible.”
Economics and reality have a way of focussing the mind, don’t they?

"Your article (Just 1% of passengers take one-fifth of all flights from England, 25 September) included a discussion on the option of applying a frequent flyer levy to help reduce emissions from aviation. It should have mentioned that precisely this proposal was adopted by the Liberal Democrats at our recent conference. As we said in our policy paper, Tackling the Climate Emergency, we would “reform air passenger duty for international flights to target the most frequent flyers. The duty level would be set at zero for the first flight and increase progressively for each subsequent flight in a given year … Everyone currently flying would still be able to afford to fly for occasional holidays, or for family reasons, but wealthy frequent flyers would pay more.” Any serious plan for reaching net-zero emissions has to tackle emissions from aviation. The omission of any mention of flying (and other sources) from Labour’s plans for reaching net zero by 2030 raises major question marks over their feasibility.Duncan BrackVice-chair, Liberal Democrats’ federal policy committee • Your report makes much of the growing contribution of the aviation industry to the climate crisis. What a shame, then, that so many Guardian Holidays – including river cruises, railway journeys and holidays in Scotland and the Isle of Man – involve at least one flight.

"Prince Harry has said the science on the climate crisis is undeniable as, led by Greta Thunberg, the “world’s children are striking” to force action. The Duke of Sussex is in Botswana helping to create a new forest habitat after decades of deforestation because of locals gathering firewood and through elephant activity.  Speaking on the banks of the Chobe River, he referred to the speech by the UN secretary general, António Guterres, at the UN general assembly in which he warned that the world had seen unprecedented temperatures. “This week, led by Greta, the world’s children are striking. There’s an emergency. It’s a race against time and one which we are losing. Everyone know it. There’s no excuse for not knowing that,” he said. “And the most troubling part of that is I don’t believe there is anybody in this world who can deny science, undeniable science and facts. “Science and facts that have been around for the last 30, maybe 40 years, and it’s only getting stronger and stronger. “I don’t understand how anyone in this world, whoever we are – you, us, children, leaders, whoever it is – no one can deny science, otherwise we live in a very, very troubling world.” Prince Harry, whose use of private jets has led to criticism and accusations of environmental hypocrisy, was working with a conservation organisation helping locals to create a nature and cultural park for the community. He shared the strain with a group of men to get a 10 metre (32ft) baobab tree into the ground, then joined young schoolchildren planting mahogany saplings. He was accompanied by Dr Mike Chase, conservationist and founder of Elephants Without Borders, which will manage the new reserve with the aim of creating a thriving riverbank forest. Harry also met youth leaders from his Sentebale charity, which supports young people affected by HIV, at a health centre in Kasane. On a highly personal note, Harry spoke of how Botswana had offered him a place to escape following the death of his mother, Diana, Princess of Wales. “Fifteen years I’ve been coming here, it’s a sense of escapism, a real sense of purpose … I have some of my closest friends here over the years. “I came here in 1997 or 1998 straight after my mum died, so it was a nice place to get away from it all. “I feel deeply connected to this place and to Africa,” he said."

Share this...FacebookTwitterSometimes I don’t know whether to sympathize with the protesters, or to tell them “I told ya so, stupid”. This industrialization of Vermont’s landscape is happening because these environmentalists originally spurred it all on with their ridiculous protect-the-climate nonsense, led by kook, dimwit senators like Bernie Sanders.

This is Green Energy? Let’s call it the Bernie Sanders Environmental Rescue Reserve.
Now the protesters are horrified at the consequences of their earlier stupidity and climate folly. Vermont has already ruined the Sheffield heights ridgeline, and now they are busily doing the same to the ridgeline of the Lowell Mountains, both are just a few miles from my boyhood home.
The protest is small but gathering in size and momentum. But I’m afraid it’s all a little too late though. You just don’t spend millions in planning, permitting and site preparation only to abandon the project. It’s definitely going to happen. At this point all we can hope for is that it’ll put the brakes on the other landscape desecration projects slated for elsewhere. I know the next time I’ll be driving there I’ll be seeing a massive industrial complex where once a beautiful mountain ridgeline once stood.
Sure you get more wind on a mountain-top. But I know the climate of Northern Vermont, and it aint that windy. Nobody can honestly say that they are going to reach anywhere near 20% capacity for these 450-foot windmills. There just isn’t that much wind there – look at the video. See any wind?
What’s really stupid is that 95% of Vermont’s energy was CO2-free to begin with. But who cares, let’s blast the mountain tops off and industrialize them, and pretend we’ve rescued the planet like real heroes.
As far as the protesters are concerned, I have to wish them the best of luck. I encourage them to do whatever it takes to stop this true environmental crime now taking place in Lowell. I’d trespass in a minute if I were there. James Hansen and Greenpeace do it all the time; get right in their faces. If the law fails, then you have to force it until it works again. I’m not advocating violence, just a peaceful protest. Readers ought to donate whatever they can, at least write a message of support. What’s happening here is not law, it’s the law selling out.
The protesters have started a blog, and updates are being provided. http://lowellmountainsnews.wordpress.com/
I really don’t want to write about this – it’s just too difficult.

Some British-accented girlie-guy, tree-hugger warmist ocean acidist (Felix von Geyer, Platts Emissions Daily) demands to know “who-the-hell” funds CFACT, and that CFACT comment on ocean acidification.
Lord Monckton gives the yuppie retread more of an education in 2 minutes than he probably ever got during all his years as an undergraduate student.
You can watch the entire CFACT press conference here.

I wonder if von Geyer is ever going to realize what a fool he made himself out to be. The guy could have spared himself all the embarassment had he just changed his tone a bit and his words. But oh no. he had to come in there, filled to the nose with arrogance and conceit, and act like he has to lecture everyone else.
Some advice: If you’re a pathetically ignorant soul on a particular subject, then it is a good idea not to run around a pretending to be informed. People see right through it.  In this case we got a full body scan of von Geyer.
Worse, for the students, the guy teaches at Concordia University, Department of Political Science, in Montreal (when he isn’t busy globe-trotting). They’re going to learn from this guy?
If von Geyer’s question signfies anything, it is that the movement has abandoned CO2 gas and has now moved on to Co2 acid.

"George Monbiot (Rewilding will make Britain a rainforest nation again, Journal, 25 September) makes a timely call to reforest large areas of Britain. However, he is rather dismissive of tree-planting schemes which, based on our experience in Devon, do not have to be as he describes. Instead he wants to allow natural regeneration. Leaving aside the fact that it is slower than planting trees (and for the climate’s sake we need some speed here), there are also problems with promoting regeneration. As shown by the excellent work of Jed Kaplan and others, deforestation in northern Europe, including Britain, started as long as 3,000 years ago. By the time of the Norman Conquest, different areas of southern Britain had between 0% and 40% of the original cover. Many of the deforested areas in Britain today are not under agriculture or grazing, nor kept bare for shooting. Undoubtedly woodland or forest would be the climax vegetation in these areas, but they are still not wooded. One of the main reasons is wild grazing animals that are part of the current ecosystem. If we really want to reforest by “natural” means then we will need to deal with this in some way.John BryantTopsham, Devon  • I share George Monbiot’s misgivings about tree-planting and plastic, but I wish he would treat the 200 generations of humans who have left evidence of their life and work in our uplands with some respect. They mostly had a gentle and symbiotic relationship with nature, being part of it themselves. Their tangible relics are our cultural heritage, of equal importance to us as sentient thinking beings as the so-called natural heritage. Burning and grazing are essential to keep such heritage visible and accessible for the inspiration of present and future generations. Julian Glover’s Landscapes Review is remarkable for its almost total lack of discussion about cultural heritage. Until this is given equal weight with “natural capital”, serious errors will continue to be made regarding management of national parks and other uplands.Tom GreevesChairman, The Dartmoor Society, 1998-2019 • While in general I have a lot of admiration for George Monbiot, and his recommendations regarding regeneration of native woodland and rewilding, I do not think people, especially young people, should be discouraged from planting trees. I belong to the Woodland Trust, which both encourages new tree-planting, and helps preserve old and threatened woods and forests throughout Britain. I have taken part in several such activities, and have never helped plant trees in straight rows. While plastic tree guards are used, they protects the young trees from predatory rabbits and deer, and are removed when the trees are big enough to withstand such attacks. These mass tree-planting events encourage children (and adults) to get out into their threatened countryside, and relevant areas near towns, and to take action to help mitigate against climate change. The trees that they and we plant now will be mature when the rest of us oldies are dead. I don’t want my grandchildren to look back and say “they knew what to do but they didn’t do it”. Join the Woodland Trust’s Big Climate Fightback on 30 November and plant some trees for the future of the planet.Rose HarvieDumbarton, West Dunbartonshire • George Monbiot shouldn’t scoff at individuals’ “tokenistic” efforts to reduce their carbon footprint. Without them we would all still be walking around clutching plastic carrier bags and single-use drinks bottles. I can only imagine the opprobrium that would be heaped upon us by him then.Julia DraperBath • Join the debate – email guardian.letters@theguardian.com • Read more Guardian letters – click here to visit gu.com/letters • Do you have a photo you’d like to share with Guardian readers?

Share this...FacebookTwitterSome of you may be wondering what happened to the video clip of Prof. Dronskowski which I had put up 2 days ago. This video was first put up by our friends at Science Skeptical here.
Unfortunately some Green thugs are still unable to learn tolerance and the lessons of history, and felt they had to threaten and harrass “thought criminals” who dare to question the Greens’ uncompromising vision of the future. Rudolf Kipp, who runs the Science Skeptical blog, had to take the video down. He left his reason as a reader comment (emphasis added):
For those of you who wonder where the video has gone. Remember, this is still Germany. We tolerate everyone’s right to free speech, so long as he shares our opinion…I have put the video off-line since the lecturer has been molested by mails and defamation and has received anonymous phone calls in private and his family has been affected as well.”
For those of you inclined to dissent, let Dronskowski be an example to you. Keep marching in lockstep – don’t ask questions, or else.
This is not the Germany I’ve come to know over the last 20+ years. I wonder what is becoming of the country. Dissenters are being labelled criminals. Professors can no longer speak up. Who can remember the last time this was so?
My view is that these green thugs are hardly different than the brown crap who allegedly murdered a number of Turks whose only crime was to dare to live a different culture in Germany. Germany’s intelligence services sat on their thumbs, not taking the threat seriously, read here. Obviously they are also not taking the threat of the greenshirts seriously either.
And some say we are living in an age of enlightenment. Well, all this is starting to enlighten me.

COPENHAGEN – One of the world’s biggest green-energy public-policy experiments is coming to a bitter end in Germany, with important lessons for policymakers elsewhere.
Germany once prided itself on being the “photovoltaic world champion”, doling out generous subsidies – totaling more than $130 billion, according to research from Germany’s Ruhr University – to citizens to invest in solar energy. But now the German government is vowing to cut the subsidies sooner than planned, and to phase out support over the next five years. What went wrong?
There is a fundamental problem with subsidizing inefficient green technology: it is affordable only if it is done in tiny, tokenistic amounts. Using the government’s generous subsidies, Germans installed 7.5 gigawatts of photovoltaic (PV) capacity last year, more than double what the government had deemed “acceptable.” It is estimated that this increase alone will lead to a $260 hike in the average consumer’s annual power bill.
…
To put it another way: by the end of the century, Germany’s $130 billion solar panel subsidies will have postponed temperature increases by 23 hours.” Continue reading…
For all you others countries out there considering the German model – think about it! What more do you need to be convinced it’s a folly?

================================================================

Record Breaking High Temperatures – What’s Really Behind It?
By Paul Homewood
America’s Public Broadcasting Service (PBS) is keeping track each day of the number of high temperature records being set in the USA. As at 30th August they reckon the year-to-date total was up to 4779. The clear message is that “temperatures must be getting hotter”. But is this so? Are matters as simple as they appear? We need perhaps to start by looking at the methodology employed.
PBS are using data collected by the NCDC from official stations only (not volunteer stations). They go on to say: “In order to make it into our count, a recorded temperature must either tie or exceed a previously recorded temperature on that date in a previous year”. In other words they are not just recording all time highs or even highs for a particular month, just highs for that particular day. So, for instance, a heat wave that lasts 2 days could set 2 records even if the second day was not as hot.
PBS also state – “NCDC records go back for many stations as far as the mid-19th century”. To the extent that this is true, very few record low temperatures would be set given the fact that the 19th century was a particularly cold era. However, as we shall see later, this is such a misleading statement that it borders on being dishonest.
USA 2011 35th warmest – nothing unusual
Before we look more closely at PBS’s numbers we should have a quick look at the overall temperature record for the USA in 2011. From January to July, 2011 ranks only 35th warmest in the last 100 years according to NCDC data.
However this year has perhaps been slightly unusual, with the Northwest being relatively cool and the South and East being warmer than unusual, so averages do not tell the whole story.
Out of the total of 4779 record highs so far, 718 occurred in July, a figure slightly above the average monthly figure of 597. I have broken down this July number and find that 42 record highs are in Kansas. Again this seems to be a representative sample. According to the NCDC map, Kansas July temperatures were “much above normal” but not as hot as Texas and Oklahoma, see here.
Double counting in Kansas
The mean July temperature for Kansas was 84.8°F this year. This ranks 5th warmest in the last 100 years with 1934 the hottest at 86.7. 1936, 1954 and 1980 also had hotter Julys. In other words, although this July has been very hot in Kansas, it is certainly a long way from being the hottest, see here.
What do the 42 record temperatures for Kansas tell us when we look at them more closely? There are 20 official weather stations in Kansas of which 19 appear to be at airports. Record temperatures, however, have only been set at 8 of these. All of these 8 stations are airport based. Two of these are in Topeka and so are arguably double counted! These are listed below:
Location – Year first operational
Dodge City Regional AP – 1942
Emporia Municipal AP – 1950
Garden City Regional AP – 1939
Hill City Municipal AP – 1948
Olathe Johnson Co AP – 1978
Topeka Billard Municipal AP – 1948
Topeka Forbes Field AP – 1942
Wichita Mid Continent AP – 1953
http://www4.ncdc.noaa.gov/cgi-win/wwcgi.dll?wwDI~GetCity~USA
Many “record setting” stations do not even go back to the 1930s
We can see immediately that the claim that “many stations go back to the 19th century” certainly does not apply to Kansas. More importantly none of these date back to the mid 1930s when July temperatures were much higher than now. (Topeka Billard is listed as starting in 1932. However the actual records start in 1948), see here.

Although none of these stations go back prior to 1939, there are earlier records available at other locations that are very close to some of these stations. These records show that in most cases higher temperatures were recorded either in 1934 or 1936. These alternate stations are typically less than 4 miles from the current station and the metadata show similar conditions such as altitude.
Out of the 23 “record highs” set at these 5 stations in 2011, 16 were lower than previous highs set before the station became operational. Only 30% were genuine highs or 1.4 per station. (It is possible of course that some of these records were also exceeded in years prior to 1934).
When we analyse the July temperature for these stations further. It is clear from this analysis, regardless of the parameters used, that July in both 1934 and 1936 were significantly hotter than July 2011.
Siting effects
There is one further matter to look at. What effect have airport siting or other UHI effects had on the long term temperature trend at these sites? Taking Topeka as an example, I have identified 4 other weather stations nearby which are not based at airports and are in smaller towns. They are all certified USHCN COOP stations and have continuous records dating back to 1936. Their metadata and geography are summarised below.

TOPEKA
No station changes since 1932.
Station situated 410 ft from runway
Topeka has a population of 127,000 but the airport is 4 miles out of town.
HORTON
The station is based at a water plant and has been in the same location since 1983.
Population of 2000.
Horton is 42 miles from Topeka.
PAWNEE CITY
The current station is within a mile of its site in 1936 with no significant change in altitude.
Population of 1000.
77 miles from Topeka. (Pawnee City is actually in Nebraska, but is closer to Topeka than most other comparable Kansas sites).
LAWRENCE
The current station is 2 miles from the 1936 site. Both sites are within the town.
It is also now at an altitude 145ft higher than in 1936 which will have a small effect on temperature differences.
Population is 66,000.
Lawrence is 40 miles from Topeka.
LEAVENWORTH
The current station is within 1 mile of the 1936 site and both were situated in the centre of town. As with Lawrence there has been a slight altitude increase of 80 ft.
Population is 38,000.
41 miles from Topeka.
Temperature comparisons between 1936 and 2011 show:
 
In other words, Topeka has become significantly warmer relative to the “rural” sites at Horton and Pawnee City. Both maximum and mean temperatures show a divergence of between 3°F and 4°F. Interestingly the medium sized towns appear to be consistent with Topeka in terms of maximum temperatures (particularly when the slightly higher altitudes are factored in), which suggests that the UHI effect in these towns is similar to the airport effect at Topeka. (As the airport is 4 miles outside town the UHI effect of Topeka’s larger size is probably not significant). There does not appear to be any logical reason, though why mean temperatures at Leavenworth and Lawrenceare relatively cooler.
So what can we conclude?
1) Over the US as a whole, 2011 has so far been barely warmer than average. In no way can it be remotely described as “hot” as implied by PBS.
2) As forKansas, July, although much warmer than average, is only the 5th warmest in recent years and 1.9F cooler than 1934.
3) The only stations in Kansas where records were set in July are all airport based and date back no earlier than 1942. Alternative stations confirm most of these “records” are lower than previously set in 1934 and 1936.
4) Where records are available back to 1934, they show that temperatures in both 1934 and 1936 were considerably higher for the month as a whole than 2011. This is true for average maximum, average mean and high maximum.
5) Comparison with rural stations suggest that airport siting and possibly UHI have had an upward effect on temperatures since 1936 of as much as 4F.

Note and References
1) The following alternate stations were used to establish temperatures in 1934 :-
a) Emporia1S – 4 miles N of airport.
b) HillCity1NE – 2 miles SW of airport.
c) Olathe3E – 4 miles NE of airport.
d) Topeka2 – 4 miles W of airport.
2) All individual station data has been obtained from the Individual Station Original Forms available from NCDC. http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/oa/mpp/freedata.html#FREE
3) The comparison between rural and airport stations is unaffected by any TOBS considerations.  Temperatures at all stations used for this exercise were logged around sunset in the 1930’s and all 2011 ones at 7.00am. Therefore any TOBS adjustment will be essentially the same at rural and airport.

Germany has put the shutdown of all its nuclear reactors on the fast track since the Fukushima accident. Finally, Germany’s Renewable Energy Revolution to rescue the planet from nuclear power and climate-killing CO2 emissions appears set begin in earnest, at least that’s what the climate rescue heroes would like to believe.
Unfortunately for the renewable energy cheerleaders, and the enemies of fossil fuels, things are in reality developing quite differently globally and even in Germany. For example, China is putting one brand new coal power plant online every week, and will do so for the next 40 years. Now, suddenly, Germany looks poised to crank up its coal power capacity too. Edgar L. Gärtner at eigentumlich frei has a commentary called: Energy Revolution” – The New Age of Coal“. The climate fantasy rescuers aren’t going to like it.
Since Germany has taken 8 of its nuclear reactors out of operation since April, 2011, its energy supply now stands vulnerable. To keep the lights from going out, which is a real prospect should a very cold winter day befall Germany, old coal plants are now being brought back to operationability in order to serve as “cold reserve capacity”. Gärtner writes:
This confirms what independent specialists have been predicting since the ‘energy revolution’ was announced by Chancellor Angela Merkel: Instead of the rise of the promised “Age of Renewable Energies“, the nuclear phaseout will lead to a Renaissance of coal and (to a small extent) natural gas.”
Indeed, even ultra-green Germany is going back to coal. And Gärtner adds:
There are lots of signs indicating the age of coal as a resource for electrical power generation is actually just getting started.”

And anyone who doesn’t believe this is probably listening to too much German public media news, or is in chronic denial. Gärtner explains:
According to the most recent Statistical Review of World Energy of oil company BP, one of the most reliable sources of energy market data, coal consumption has increased by almost 50% over the last 10 years alone.”
And during those same 10 years, global temperatures have plateaued, or even fallen slightly, depending which data-set you’re looking at. Gärtner continues (emphasis added):
Such a rash increase has never been seen before. China and India alone account for 90 percent of this increase. Coal’s share of global energy generation has almost reached 30% and is now as now at 1970 levels. At 48.2% almost half of the world’s coal consumption is by China. Plans by China’s leadership provides for a coal power expansion of 600 gigawatts by the year 2035. Also in western countries coal consumption increased in the year 2010 by 5.2%, the most since 1979.
So why is coal burning gaining so fast? The answer is economics and science.
Global coal reserves are huge, enough to last an estimated 1000 years according to some estimates. Moreover the fuel is easy and cheap to extract, transport and use. And because there are now 7 billion people on the planet to sustain, its low price means that it is a real life-saver, one that can be relied on and does not depend on the weather. Thus only the most ignorant, or most tyrannical, of politicians would sit on mountains of coal and allow citizens to freeze to death in the wintertime.
Now that climate science is uncovering that CO2 is indeed a minor climate driver, the use of coal should be allowed unabated. Indeed science is showing more and more that coal is by no means a climate killer, but a human life-saver.

Share this...FacebookTwitterGerman scientists have made a spectacular find. Near the Bavarian city of Augsburg they found a 14-million year old fossil of a python.
What’s interesting is that pythons like very warm, tropical weather, and not the cool, crappy stuff Germany has to offer. That means Germany (Central Europe) had to have been a balmy place 15 million years ago. In fact it was about 10°C warmer than it is today, the fossil indicates. German scientists published a paper in the journal Geodiversitas (DOI: 10.5252/g2011n3a2), which the online Frankfurter Rundschau here reports on. The FR writes:
Never before has such a find been discovered this far north. The remains give us clues on the climate back then.
Because pythons prefer warmer temperatures, today they live in the tropical regions of Asia and Africa. About 15 million years ago the predecessors of the today’s giant snakes also felt at home in Germany.”
How warm was it 15 million years ago in Germany? The Frankfurter Rundschau quotes the leader of the study, Madeleine Böhme of the University of Tübingen:

We gather that temperatures had an average of 19°C, otherwise the snakes would not have felt comfortable here.“
Currently the average annual temperature for Augsburg is about 8°C. So why did the pythons disappear? Climate change, says the Frankfurter Rundschau.
Climate change did the pythons’ ancestors in.
In any case the giant snakes found optimum living conditions in Germany for only a very short time, the scientists write. After the warm-subtropical temperatures of 14 million years ago, it got cooler and drier.”
So much for the claim the planet only changes when man lives on it.

"On Monday, the activist group Extinction Rebellion will begin a week of global protests. In Brisbane, home to the grassroots organisation’s first Australian chapter, activists are preparing to stage protests around the city. At the group’s headquarters in Woolloongabba, a busy training schedule is under way. It is hosting introductory sessions at local libraries planning two large-scale marches, with a litany of other “non-violent disruptive actions”.  Since the group conducted its first action in Australia in April, there have been more than 170 arrests, with penalties ranging from a warning to a $1,500 fine. When new laws designed to target the tactics used by Extinction Rebellion pass parliament, those penalties will escalate. The use of a purpose-designed “dangerous attachment device to disrupt lawful activities”, referring to the Extinction Rebellion tactic of locking on to railways and roads, will attract a $6,500 fine or two years’ imprisonment. Peaceful protest, the Queensland government says, is only acceptable if it does not disrupt people going about their ordinary business. But disruption is the point. “We are using civil disobedience to cause economic disruption and a disruption to business as usual,” Extinction Rebellion south-east Queensland member Emma Dorge says. “Without disruption, our voices are not being heard.” She is not deterred by harsher penalties. “We are fighting against extinction,” she says. “People are doing what’s necessary in the face of complete inaction from governments on climate change.” Queensland has proposed two new amendments this year designed to clamp down on protests: increased trespass penalties aimed at animal welfare protests, currently going through a parliamentary committee, and the lock-on laws. It has also introduced biosecurity regulations with on-the-spot fines for entering an agricultural premises. New South Wales has also introduced new $1,000 on-the-spot penalties through biosecurity regulations and is considering draft laws with broad new trespass penalties. When the Western Australian premier, Mark McGowan, was opposition leader in 2016, he ceremonially ripped up anti-protest laws proposed by his predecessor, but his government has also said it will increase penalties for trespass. The reforms are aimed at animal welfare protesters described by the attorney general as “mushy-headed vegans”. Victoria is holding a parliamentary inquiry to determine if it ought to strengthen trespass laws, following uproar about a $1 fine levied against an activist who stole a goat from a Gippsland cheese cafe. The Law Institute of Victoria has suggested the government instead introduce laws promoting greater transparency in the agriculture industry. Tasmania, still bruised from a 2017 high court decision that struck down its anti-protest laws, is working on amended legislation to reintroduce the laws. That high court ruling – that environmental protests are political and protected under the constitutional implied freedom of political communication – could potentially apply to Queensland and NSW laws as proposed. “When we see the positioning that’s been coming out of the government we tend to look at it through two filters,” the Wilderness Society national director, Lyndon Schneiders, says. “One is: is what they are proposing actually legal? And secondly, what are they trying to achieve politically?” The NSW Nature Conservation Council chief executive, Chris Gambian, says the NSW legislation is framed as a narrow provision supporting farmers but could actually work against their interests by penalising almost all protest actions. Farmers have been heavily involved in environmental protests in Australia, particularly against coal seam gas. The Bentley Blockade, a seven-year protest in the Northern Rivers region which successfully halted gas exploration and is cited as inspiration by Dorge and other Extinction Rebellion members as an example of successful activism, was underpinned by farmers. And when more than 300,000 people join climate strikes around Australia, can protesting still be considered a fringe activity? “There is a culture war going on that is trying to pit those people that care about the environment against other people, and I think that’s incredibly worrying,” Gambian says. Take these comments from Peter Dutton. “People should take these names, and the photos of these people, and distribute them as far and wide as we can so that we shame these people,” said the home affairs minister in his regular spot on Sydney’s 2GB radio. “Let their families know what you think of their behaviour … We should push back on it because these people are a scourge, they are doing the wrong thing. If you want to protest, do it peacefully.” In this context, “peaceful” can be taken to mean “unobtrusive”. Dutton also suggested protesters should face mandatory minimum sentences and murmured support for host Ray Hadley’s suggestion that the welfare payments of protesters be restricted. In the world of talkback radio, the Venn diagram of ordinary working Australians and people who protest are two circles that never meet. Reality has more overlap. Gambian is a spokesperson for a loose coalition of environment groups, Unions NSW and legal groups that have banded together to oppose the proposed NSW anti-protest laws, which would result in protesters facing fines of up to $22,000. A similar coalition of 80 organisations, from unions to religious groups, staved off the most recent anti-protest laws in WA and is waiting to see the draft of the new proposed laws. “It was a matter that brought together a really broad cross-section of society,” Perth-based public advocacy lawyer Kate Davis says. “I don’t think any laws that are targeted at restricting the right to protest have a place in our democracy.” The proposed NSW laws, like new federal laws passed in August, are targeted at “farm invasion” protests from animal activists who have targeted abattoirs, factory farming operations and family-run farms in the past 18-months. They make use of the Inclosed Lands Protection Act and are “breathtakingly broad,” says Gambian, and would capture protests on environmental grounds, including anti-mining protests. That act was amended in 2016 to introduce a $5,500 penalty for aggravated unlawful entry to enclosed lands. It was up for review next month, but that review has now been superseded by the proposed Right to Farm Bill. The proposed amendments would increase the penalty for aggravated trespass to $13,200 or 12 months’ jail. If a person was accompanied by two or more other people, or taken to be interfering with the conduct of the business, they would face a $22,000 fine or three years’ jail. “Enclosed land is any land that has a fence around it,” Gambian says. “Including a temporary fence. Including a temporary fence erected while the protest is going on.” It includes public land, such as state parliament. Emily Howie, legal director for the Human Rights Law Centre, says the proposed laws could run afoul of the same constitutional provisions that allowed the former Greens leader Bob Brown to win his high court challenge against the Tasmanian anti-protest laws. If the laws were found to be denying Australians their constitutional freedom to talk about things that are politically important, Howie says, they could be found to be invalid. Moves by governments to protect businesses from disruption are legitimate, Howie says, but they must be “reasonable and proportionate”. “The last thing that we want is for laws that are meant to be protecting business to in fact be deterring people from engaging in peaceful and lawful protest and our concern about this bill in New South Wales is that is exactly what it does,” she says."

"Australia’s central bank has delivered a clear warning that climate change is exposing financial institutions and the financial system more broadly to risks that will rise over time if action isn’t taken. The RBA’s financial stability review, released Friday, concluded that while climate change is not yet a significant threat to financial stability in Australia, it is becoming increasingly important for investors and institutions to actively manage carbon risk.  The bank notes Australian insurers are the most directly exposed to the physical impacts of climate change, and points out that inflation-adjusted insurance claims for natural disasters this decade are more than twice what they were in the previous 10 years. It notes “this impact is likely to grow over time”. “An increase in the frequency and severity of natural disasters will increase the incidence of damage to, or destruction of, physical assets that are insured or used as collateral,” the RBA said. “Assets that are exposed to increasing physical risk – such as property located in bushfire-prone or coastal areas – could decline in value, particularly if these risks become uninsurable. “Climate change could also reduce certain types of business income that is used to service loans. Examples include changing rainfall patterns that result in lower or less predictable income from agriculture, more frequent storms disrupting supply chains and therefore sales, and damage to natural assets that reduces tourism income.” The RBA says banks and other lending institutions are also exposed to physical risks because climate change can result in a decline in the income or value of collateral that they are lending against. It says Australian financial institutions that have exposure to carbon-intensive industries – such as power generation and mining, or to energy-intensive firms – “will also be exposed to transition risk”. “Transition risk will be greatest for banks that lend to firms in carbon-intensive industries and to individuals or businesses that are reliant on these firms,” the bank said. “Other financial institutions investing in carbon-intensive industries, such as superannuation and investment funds, are also exposed to the risk that climate change will diminish the value of their investments. This could occur both through direct investments in carbon-intensive industries, or indirect investments in banks that lend to these industries”. It warns financial institutions “also face reputational damage if they are seen to be contributing to climate change or failing to manage climate risks”. The RBA concludes that climate change poses a clear systemic risk, but it is not yet an imminent threat to financial stability. But it warns this could change. “Climate change could emerge as a risk to financial stability if it is not properly managed, or if the size of climate-related losses increased materially. “Rising climate-related losses could also erode confidence in an institution or the financial system, leading to a withdrawal of funding. This would be more likely if the physical impacts of climate change are more severe or occur sooner than currently projected, or if the transition to a low-carbon economy occurs in a disruptive and costly manner.” The RBA notes that both the banking regulator Apra and the corporate watchdog Asic have become proactive in managing carbon risk, and the Council of Financial Regulators has established a working group on the financial implications of climate change to help coordinate agencies’ actions. Friday’s analysis builds on a warning by the Reserve Bank deputy governor, Guy Debelle, who said in March climate change posed risks to Australia’s financial stability. Debelle said policymakers needed to consider warming as a trend and not a cyclical event. He said policymakers and businesses needed to “think in terms of trend rather than cycles in the weather”. “Droughts have generally been regarded, at least economically, as cyclical events that recur every so often. In contrast, climate change is a trend change. The impact of a trend is ongoing, whereas a cycle is temporary.” The deputy governor said there was a need to reassess the frequency of climate change events, and “our assumptions about the severity and longevity of the climatic events”. In March, Apra flagged an intention to increase scrutiny of how banks, insurers and superannuation trustees are managing the financial risks of climate change to their businesses. Last year Asic said climate change was “a foreseeable risk facing many listed companies in the Australian market in a range of different industries” and warned directors and management of listed companies “to understand and continually reassess existing and emerging risks including climate risk that may affect the company’s business”. In that same assessment by the corporate watchdog, 17% of listed companies in the Asic sample identified climate risk as a material risk in their operating and financial reviews. The RBA noted on Friday, according to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), it will take significant effort to limit global warming to 1.5C above pre-industrial levels, as targeted in the Paris agreement. “Even if targets are met, this level of warming is likely to be accompanied by rising sea levels and an increase in the frequency and intensity of extreme weather including storms, heatwaves and droughts,” it said. “Some of these outcomes are already apparent. These changes will create both financial and macroeconomic risks”."

Share this...FacebookTwitterPortuguese blog Ecotretas here reveals how the IPCC completely botched its forecasts for East African rainfall in claiming the Horn of Africa should expect more precipitation. With severe drought now ravaging the region, the IPCC forecasts and models are beginning to look like a complete farce.
Deadly drought and famine hit East Africa (Chart source: USAID)
Lately we have all been hearing about the serious drought that has been causing misery in impoverished East African countries – especially Somalia with tens of thousands of deaths, and some 750 000 expected to die in the next four months, Ecotretas points out that “one would imagine that the IPCC would have predicted it” with their multi-million dollar super computer models and “leading scientists”. Well, it turns out they indeed made forecasts back in 2007, but today just the opposite is occurring, i.e. instead of getting more rainfall, as was forecast by the IPCC, rainfall has all but disappeared.
Ecotretas looked up what the IPCC projected for Eastern Africa in its 4th Assessment Report of 2007. For example in Chapter 11 of the Executive Summary:
There is likely to be an increase in annual mean rainfall in East Africa.”
On page 869, in Chapter 11.2.3.2 (emphasis added):
The increase in rainfall in East Africa, extending into the Horn of Africa, is also robust across the ensemble of models, with 18 of 21 models projecting an increase in the core of this region, east of the Great Lakes.”

So much for the ensemble of models. Surely one can only conclude that the claims made by the IPCC’ models concerning global temperatures for the next 100 or 200 years simply can no longer be taken seriously. Read more at ECOTRETAS here.
 
A host of other institutes parroted the IPCC bogus forecasts
It was not only IPCC scientists who were completely wrong with East African rainfall projections, but also a number of other institutes and organisations got it all wrong – probably because they only parroted the junk scenarios put out by scientists like Mike Hulme.
Ecotretas presents a collection of more rainfall for the African Horn here, which includes Christian Aid in the UK in 2009, International Livestock Research Institute  in 2010, The World Bank in 2010, the Institute for Environmental Security in January 2011, and the Grantham Institute for Climate Change in 2009, which claimed:
In eastern Africa, including the Horn of Africa, and parts of central Africa average rainfall is likely to increase.”
When are people going to stop listening to these charlatans?

From Steven Goddard, sea level rise drop.

Der Spiegel reports today how the UN has just come out with a new report claiming the big threat now is local heat waves and freak storms.
That’s quite a change from global-wide warming and sea level rise.

Remember how for years and years UN scientists, armed with their mighty models, warned the planet faced massive hurricanes, rapid sea level rise and global-wide warming? Funny how we’ve been hearing very little about that lately. We’ve gone from “global warming” to “spot heating” with local storms sprinkled in.
Maybe the change in narrative has something to do with the hard statistics showing no real hurricanes hitting the USA in over 3 years or so. In fact it’s been yet another year with not a hurricane hitting the coast. Indeed tropical cyclone activity looks everything but out of control, and has been taming big time for 20 years! See: Ryan Maue. Can’t dupe the public with that anymore.
Even worse (if you’re an alarmist) is that sea levels are dropping! See Steve Goddard’s site here. They’ve been showing a declining trend over the last couple years. Oh dear! oh dear! The models never predicted that.

These disappearing horrors, once their favorites, have turned into shock and awe over the warmist camp. It’s panic time for them. How on Earth are they now supposed to spread fear and panic when all their old horror scenarios are dissolving before their very eyes?
The answer of course is to trot out new ones, this time they’re using horrors where the statistics are incomplete, thus making it difficult to disprove alleged increasing trends. Not only that, their models have suddenly begun to show they’re coming! And we all know how flawless their models are.
Der Spiegel reports today on how a new UN study has now just come up with local extreme heat waves as the next man-made climate disaster. It’s perfect – man-made heat waves are now lurking somewhere out there, waiting to pounce on unsuspecting regions and fry unprepared citizens. It could happen anywhere, and you may be next! The UN cites Russia and Texas as compelling evidence. Also waiting to ambush locally are storms and flash floods, so says the UN.
But even Der Spiegel is not so convinced and adds:
This year other studies show no increase in weather extremes: Winter storms in the northern hemisphere have been trending less, report scientists in the magazine ‘Tellus’. The same goes for river flooding in USA. That US rivers are being influenced by man-made climate change cannot be discerned, the US Geological Service summed up in October.”
Global sea level rise and global-scale warming are obviously dead. Looks like a tough road ahead for warmists and their desperate efforts to keep the climate Halloween party going.

The European Environment Agency recently (March 2011) updated their European temperature data by adding the data for the years 2010 and the winter of 2011. The data can be found at EEA 2010, KNMI (http://climexp.knmi.nl), based onClimate Research Unit (CRU) gridded datasets HadCrut3 (land and ocean) and CruTemp3 (land only) from http://www.cru.uea.ac.uk
WINTER TEMPERATURES 1948-2011
European winters seem to have gone through an alternating warm-cool –warm- cool cycle since the 1940s and now appear headed for a cooler cycle like the 1962-1987 period.

A LOOK AT THE MORE RECENT WINTER TEMPERATURES 1998-2011
European winter temperatures have been cooling more recently since 1998, and especially 2009-2011.

European annual temperatures warmed from 1998-2007 but have started to cool over the last 3 years in a row since 2008.

SUMMER TEMPERATURES 1998-2010
On the surface, European summers seem to be getting warmer since 1998. However the higher warming summers of 2003, 2006, and 2010 were all preceded by or affected by an El Nino, just before or as the El Nino partly happened during these summers. So the extra warming may be due to a natural El Nino cycle. If one discounts these  El Nino years, the summer temperatures are quite flat and show no real base warming  due to global warming. For more detail information on El Nino years see the NOAA site http://www.cpc.ncep.noaa.gov.

HISTORIC MEAN WINTER TEMPERATURES FOR BERLIN, GERMANY – IMPACT OF THE NORTH  ATLANTIC  OSCILLATION
For those Europeans who still believe that their climate is primarily affected by human generated carbon dioxide, the graph below illustrates that the NAO level seems to be a much more significant cold winter factor affecting temperatures in Berlin, Germany. The temperature data is from GISS Station Temperature Data and NAO data is from CGD’s Climate analysis Section of Jim Hurrell http://www.cgd.ucar.edu. According to the NOAA:
The NAO consists of a north-south dipole of anomalies, with one center located over Greenland and the other center of opposite sign spanning the central latitudes of the North Atlantic between 35°N and 40°N. The positive phase of the NAO reflects below-normal heights and pressure across the high latitudes of the North Atlantic and above-normal heights and pressure over the central North Atlantic, the eastern United States and western Europe. The negative phase reflects an opposite pattern of height and pressure anomalies over these regions.”

FINAL COMMENTS
There is nothing in the above graphs and figures that would warrant the drastic reductions being planned for carbon dioxide emissions and the extremely expensive green energy options being planned by Europe in light of the most difficult economic environment that exists in Europe and the globe. Surely there are much more pressing problems that confront the world and Europe than solving an apparently non-existing problem that is only speculated to exist 100 years from now.

"It is heartening to read that arts organisations are choosing to sever their links with fossil fuel companies following public pressure (National to cut ties with Shell as theatres bow to pressure on climate action, 5 October; RSC bows to pressure from climate crisis protest by cutting short BP sponsorship, 3 October). Of course, similar ethical choices had to be made in the past regarding financial support from tobacco companies. Thankfully that was long ago consigned to history. But was it? In fact, the London Symphony Orchestra still receives sponsorship from British American Tobacco. The LSO, like the NT and RSC, takes its work with schools and young people seriously, and it is therefore unfortunate that the orchestra retains this anachronistic relationship. Perhaps the threat of a boycott of the LSO by performers and audiences could deliver a similar positive result.Dr Dominic HorneLedbury, Herefordshire  • Join the debate – email guardian.letters@theguardian.com • Read more Guardian letters – click here to visit gu.com/letters • Do you have a photo you’d like to share with Guardian readers?

"A majority of Australians believe Scott Morrison was wrong to snub the United Nations climate summit while on a high-profile visit to the US, but have otherwise backed the prime minister’s handling of the relationship with Donald Trump. The latest Guardian Essential poll, taken in the wake of Morrison’s trip to the US last week, shows that most Australians believe it is important for the prime minister to have a good relationship with the US president, “whoever they might be” for the good of the nation.  While 15% of people disagreed with the statement, 77% agreed, with men and Liberal voters most likely to back a strong relationship. The survey of 1,097 people was taken before Tuesday’s revelation that Australia had agreed to help investigate the genesis of the Mueller inquiry into alleged Russian meddling in the 2016 US election, which Trump has suggested was a “hoax” to bring him down. But while 57% of those surveyed agreed that Morrison had shown “good diplomacy skills” during his official visit to US, 70% said that he should have joined other world leaders in attending the UN climate summit in New York, which was attended by foreign affairs minister Marise Payne rather than Morrison. About 40% of people strongly agreed that Morrison should have fronted up to the climate summit, with a further 31% saying they somewhat agreed. A breakdown of voting intentions of those who believed the prime minister should have attended the summit – where Swedish teenage climate activist Greta Thunberg delivered an impassioned speech to world leaders – shows that 78% of Labor voters thought he should have shown up, compared with 64% of Coalition voters. Morrison defended Australia’s record on climate change at a separate speech to the UN, but observers at the summit said his failure to attend despite being in the US had eroded goodwill for the country on the issue. Voters were also asked whether a good relationship between Morrison and Trump “reflects badly” on Australia, a sentiment that 38% of people agreed with, with 48% disagreeing. Greens voters were most likely to be critical of the relationship forged between Morrison and Trump, with 60% saying it was a bad look, compared with 27% of Coalition voters and 48% of Labor voters. But while most people were supportive of the US alliance and Morrison’s handling of Trump, just 32% believe his presidency, which has sparked global geopolitical uncertainty, has been good for Australia, with 49% of people disagreeing. Australia’s recent decision to assist the US in the Strait of Hormuz, in what it said would be “modest, meaningful and time-limited” commitment, was supported by 51% of those surveyed and opposed by 35%. But more people were concerned (57%) that the engagement could plunge Australia into another conflict in the near future as a result. Liberal voters were more supportive of Australia’s engagement in the Middle East and less concerned about future conflict in the region. The Essential poll also gauged voter sentiment on the state of the Australian economy ahead of Tuesday’s decision by the Reserve Bank to cut interest rates to a record low 0.75%. Views were mixed, with an equal third believing the economy was in a good state (32%), poor state (33%) or neither good nor poor (32%). Compared with May last year, more people felt the economy was in a poor state, up nine percentage points and edging closer to the December 2016 high of 36%. Liberal voters were more likely to be positive in their assessment of the economy, with 45% saying it was in “very good” or “quite good” shape. When asked which indicators were most important in assessing the health of the economy, most people pointed to the unemployment rate, which increased to 5.3% in August from 5.2% in the previous month, as well as the cost of household bills. Half of those who think the national budget surplus is the best indicator for economic performance believe the economy is in a good shape, whereas those who look at household bills to gauge economic strength were the most pessimistic."
"Next week thousands of Extinction Rebellion protesters will descend on Westminster, the latest example of direct action in a year when committed women, men and children across the world have pushed climate change to the top of the global agenda, where it belongs. Although London will again be the focal point, the movement mustn’t overlook the committed activists in places such as Bolton, Wigan, and Sunderland who are also spreading the message across the country. For the climate movement to succeed we have to build a broad coalition that covers our nation’s towns as well as our cities, and reaches out across class divides. Calls for individual action can’t just be modelled on the lifestyles of middle-class city dwellers. Telling people to get out of their cars can’t be the solution in those parts of the country where decades of chronic underinvestment have left us without public transport. In towns such as Wigan, jobs have disappeared as investment flowed into cities, creating lengthy commutes on public transport for most working-age people. Trains are overcrowded, deeply unreliable and ceased to function entirely for a large part of last year, while the buses are few and far between, and often more expensive than getting a taxi. Demanding people abandon their cars isn’t realistic if the alternative is a round trip of 42 miles a day on foot or by bike, just to get to work. Campaigns to tackle climate change need to link up with campaigns for better transport and fairer funding for it, particularly for buses.  Rooting calls for action in the reality of people’s lives is essential if the battle against climate change is not to become a battle against each other. It is galling to be lectured on not eating meat when you and your family are struggling to get by and relying on help from friends and local food banks. It isn’t fair to ask families to forfeit the one foreign flight they have saved for all year, while we have global corporations whose business models rely on frequent air travel and governments that refuse to tax them for it. Climate activists must also rethink their language. Phrases such as “dirty coal” are profoundly condescending to communities in which generation after generation did dangerous, backbreaking work down the mines to build the country’s wealth and influence at great cost to themselves; pneumoconiosis victims are still fighting for justice decades after the mines closed. We are owed new clean energy jobs, and the infrastructure to create them. In Wigan and Barnsley, the desire for good jobs that provide a sense of purpose is palpable. Positive movements for change, such as the One Million Climate Jobs trade union campaign, provide an antidote to the stark warnings about climate scenarios that often leave people feeling powerless to act. We must not let the climate crisis become a further source of division in Britain. The last Labour government’s decision to load the cost of clean energy subsidies on to energy bills left the poorest people paying six times as much of their disposable income on energy bills as their wealthy counterparts. If climate change becomes a major cause of migration it may prove fertile ground for the far right looking to exploit disillusion in towns that have experienced rapid, relative decline. Instead, let’s seize this as an opportunity to rebuild our towns so they can play a major and significant part in our national story once again. Fighting for a better environment was always part of socialist tradition, as working-class people living among the smoke and soot of industry fought for parks, protection of the countryside, wildlife conservation, clean air and fresh water. The first Bolton Extinction Rebellion meeting saw people queueing out of the door on a hot summer evening, and I get more letters about the environment from my constituents than any other single issue. Building an environmentally sustainable future will require the talent, intellect and hard work of the whole of our society – so it’s time for the climate movement to break out of the cities to make itself a movement for the many, not just the few. • This is an abridged version of an essay in a special climate change edition of the latest HOPE not hate magazine. • Lisa Nandy is the Labour MP for Wigan"

Share this...FacebookTwitterWe keep hearing various stories about sea level rise. Some alarmists even claim that it’s accelerating and coastal locations could be drowning in water by the end of the century, if not sooner. So I decided to make quick check of the data myself.
I took a sampling of 21 randomly selected locations scattered all over the globe and checked their respective sea level trends (not satellite data) to see what is happening. The following map shows the locations:

As you can see, the points are scattered all over the globe. The idea is to take a random representative sampling – much like a quality engineer who takes a random sampling of raw material from a bulk tanker truck arriving at a factory.
What follows is the corresponding list of the locations with the sea level trends measured by the NOAA.
Location  –  rate in mm per 100 years  –  observed most recent rate trend
1. Ketchikan, Alaska  (-19 mm/100 yr) – steady drop
2. San Francisco, CA. (+201 mm/100) – slowing down
3. Honolulu, Hawaii (+150 mm/100) – slowing down
4. Kwajalein, Marshall Is. (+143 mm/100) – speeding up
5. Piladelphia, PA (+280 mm/100) – steady rise
6. St. Petersburg, FL (+236 mm/100) – slowing down
7. La Libertad, Ecuador (-122 mm/100) – steady drop
8. Cristobal, Panama  (+141 mm/100) – slowing down (last 10 years)
9. Cananeia, Brazil (+420 mm/100) – speeding up
10. Argentine Is, Antarctica  (+172 mm/100) – slowing down
11. Newlyn, UK (+171 mm/100) – steady rise
12. Tenerife Spain (+153 mm/100) – steady drop
13. Walvis Bay, Namibia (+33 mm/100) – steady drop
14. Simons Bay, S Africa (+159 mm/100) – speeding up
15. Karachi, Pakistan (+48 mm/100) – steady drop
16. Cochin India (+137 mm/100) – steady rise
17. Legaspi, Philippines (+522 mm/100) – slowing down
18. Sydney Australia (+59 mm/100) – slowing down
19. Fremantle, Australia (+148 mm/100) – slowing down
20. Wellington, New Zealand (+241 mm/100) – slowing down
21. Hosojima, Japan (-53 mm/100) – steady drop
For example San Francisco sea level is rising at a rate 201 mm per 100 years and the latest trend shows that sea level rise is slowing down.

Here are the results
– Steady drop: 6
– The rise is slowing down: 9
– Speeding up: 3
– Rising steadily: 3
Do you see any red flags? The average of the 21 NOAA measured trends is 147 mm/100 years (6 inches). This is a far cry below the IPCC projected 22 inches for the next 100 years.
Most of the sampled locations are dropping or the sea level rise is slowing down. Only at 6 locations is the rise steady or speeding up. The Marshall Islands show a speeding up, but Pago Pago, American Samoa shows a decline.
Clearly this random sampling of locations shows no signs of any accelerating disaster. To the contrary, it indicates that sea level rise is most likely slowing down.
This is a preliminary check only, and of course much more data would need to be crunched to make a final conclusion. But from the preliminary check, we can safely say that anyone who claims that SLR is accelerating is probably just a charlatan who is trying to get more funding.
Concerning satellite data, someone really ought to check the calibration of the satellites.

Global Cold Season Temperature Trend
by Ed Caryl
In Figure 1, the continents are cooling already. So are the oceans.

Figure 1 above depicts the NH cold season temperature trend over the last ten years. The global trend is zero! (the number in the top right corner). Source: GISS.
Figure 2 below depicts the oceans only. The NH cold season ocean surface cooled 0.04 degrees C in the last decade, or 0.4 degrees C per century.

So, where’s the warming? Wasn’t it supposed to result in warmer winters?

The scam is falling apart, bit by bit like a cake out in the rain. Hat-tip: http://climatedepot.com/. No wonder some “climate science” characters are resorting to desperate acts. I wonder how the media feels about all this. They used to view themselves as so high and mighty, and now nobody is listening to them.
According to the UPI here, emphasis added:
Three-quarters of Americans say natural disasters are on the increase, but fewer than ever believe the climate is heating up, a new poll finds.
Only 44 percent say they ‘believe the theory‘ that carbon dioxide emissions are warming the Earth, down from 51 percent in 2009 and 71 percent in 2007, but most movement has been into the “not sure” column.”
That means the number of people who believe the theory has dropped a whopping 27% in just 4 years. After all that indoctrination and disinformation, this is their result. And to think that us skeptics are only getting warmed up!
The hoax is over folks. Stop acting like it aint.

Share this...FacebookTwitterThe UN just released its summary report on how we should all expect extreme heat in the future. Well forget all that.It’s all nonsense coming from unrealistic models that do not even take the cycles of the sun (source of 99.9% of the Earth’s surface heat) and cycles of the oceans (which cover 70+% of the Earth’s surface) into account. Garbage in, garbage out. Simple as that.
And a few days ago German climatologist Mojib Latif spewed out more nonsense, claiming Germany would soon experience Sahara-like summers – also based on the same completely bogus climate models that ignore 99.999% of the Earth’s energy systems (sun and oceans).
Alaska gets a taste of the ice age, -40°F in mid November!
Alaska is just the latest example of how glaringly deficient the models are. Not long ago the models said global warming was supposed to be especially pronounced up in the Arctic – in places like Alaska. Someone forgot to tell the climate that.

Fairbanks, Alaska set a new low temperature record on Thursday the second time in three days with a temperature of 41 degrees below zero. That broke the old record of 39 below set in 1969. Fairbanks also set a new record of 35 below on Tuesday, and hit 39 below on Wednesday, two degrees shy of the record. The last time Fairbanks saw 40-below temperatures in November was in 1994, when temperatures of 45, 43 and 45 below were recorded on Nov. 24, 25 and 30, respectively.
“This sort of thing is certainly more common in December and January than November,” meteorologist Dan Hancock at the National Weather Service in Fairbanks said. “We can go through an entire winter and not get this cold.”
Several record low temperatures set more than 40 years ago were broken in the Fairbanks area. Eielson Air Force Base had a low of 43 below early Thursday morning, which broke the previous record of 40 below in 1969. It was the second day in a row a new record was set at Eielson. It was 42 below there on Wednesday morning.
The coldest temperature reported Thursday morning was a record 54 below in Manley Hot Springs. A temperature of 49 below was recorded at KNJP radio station in North Pole, also a record. Thursday morning saw lows of 46 below in Fort Yukon, 45 below in Nikolai, 42 below in Nenana and Tanana and 40 below at Bettles.
Worse, there’s a chance even colder air could move in early next week. How cold it gets will depend on how much cloud cover there is. Meteorologist Julie Malingowski said. “If it does clear out, we’re doomed.” …read all about it here!

Share this...FacebookTwitterDer Spiegel reports today that scientists have identified soot (black carbon) as one of the major global warmers out there.
According to Science Journal here, a team of 24 experts led by NASA scientist Drew Shindell looked at 400 emission control measures and identified 14 measures targeting methane and black carbon (BC) emissions that would reduce projected global mean warming.
Source: http://atmoz.org/blog/2007/06/12/global-melting-big-thaw/
Recently scientists and activists have been frustrated by the slow progress and dogged reluctance by countries to cap CO2 emissions, which are thought to be causing global warming. So Shindell looked for alternative ways to avert warming. Suddenly, lo and behold, soot (BC) and methane have emerged as major global warming factors. The amount they admit soot and methane contribute to warming is in my view astonishing.  The abstract states (emphasis added):
We considered ~400 emission control measures to reduce these pollutants by using current technology and experience. We identified 14 measures targeting methane and BC emissions that reduce projected global mean warming ~0.5°C by 2050.”
This equals the total amount of warming we’ve seen in the last 40 years!
Now scientists are telling us that soot and methane will have the same effect that CO2 is claimed to have had over the last 40 years? Whatever happened to the assertion that man-made CO2 has caused 95% of the warming over the last decades? Obviously CO2 as a driver is seriously getting cut down to size. Throw in the emerging solar effects and there isn’t much left for poor old CO2.

The abstract continues:
This strategy avoids 0.7 to 4.7 million annual premature deaths from outdoor air pollution and increases annual crop yields by 30 to 135 million metric tons due to ozone reductions in 2030 and beyond. Benefits of methane emissions reductions are valued at $700 to $5000 per metric ton, which is well above typical marginal abatement costs (less than $250). The selected controls target different sources and influence climate on shorter time scales than those of carbon dioxide–reduction measures. Implementing both substantially reduces the risks of crossing the 2°C threshold.”
No need to worry any longer about a doubling of CO2 concentrations. Indeed CO2 as a driver and its hypothesized positive feedbacks simply aren’t materializing. We haven’t seen any warming in 15 years. Now scientists are realizing that soot is a big league player.
Der Spiegel writes:
About 3 billion people prepare their meals over open fires that burn wood, dung or coal, and thus emit huge amounts of soot. However attempts to get people in Africa and Asia to get interested in other cooking devices have often proven to be difficult.
Of course it has been difficult. When idiot bureaucrats attempt (and are successful) to slow down progress, people remain poor and all they have left to burn is wood. But if they promote growth, free markets and development so that poor countries can attain western standards of living, then they will be able to afford to burn cleaner fuels like gas and oil. And if someday they should get really rich, they too will be able to afford wind and solar energy.

"Hallam was arrested in 2017 for criminal damage when he and another person spray-painted “Divest from oil and gas”, “Now” and “Out of time” on walls at King’s College London, using water-soluble chalk-based paint. Both were cleared of all charges by a jury in 2019 after they defended their actions as being a proportionate response to the climate crisis. People joining Extinction Rebellion (XR) are trained in how to conduct themselves peacefully when participating in direct action. According to Hallam, direct action has several aims and objectives. One is to cause disruption and financial costs to the state to build pressure for political change. Another is for individuals to show their commitment – that they are willing to sacrifice their liberty for the cause. Increased disruption and more people arrested creates a bigger impact. The training explains the possible legal implications of getting arrested. Once people have been informed about this, it is up to them to decide if they are willing to get arrested or not. If they sign up, they become part of the growing list of arrestables.  “I got to London and joined the rebellion at lunchtime Thursday [during protests in April], and I was looking for my affinity group in Oxford Circus by the pink boat when I saw a guy I know from Bristol. I told him, ‘I have just arrived and I am willing to be arrested.’ “A police officer behind me heard me say that and he tapped me on the shoulder and said, ‘I think I can arrange that. Are you aware this is a section 14? Please leave the area. I am officially asking you to move away or I will have to arrest you.’ “I told him I was not going anywhere and he then read a caution and my rights. I sat down to make clear I was not moving. He was on his own so he had to go away to get more police and came back after a while with three colleagues who picked me up and carried me away. There was a lot of clapping and cheering as they carried me down the road to the van. We were four in the van and they took us to West End Central where there was a long queue of people waiting to get processed. “I was then searched and had my fingerprints and DNA taken, and was put in a cell. Everyone was very nice and polite and at 9pm I was given a toothbrush and paste and was fed twice, vegetarian food. The cell was very bright so I had to pull the blanket over my face to get some sleep and I read a detective novel given to me by the custody officer. I was let out at 2pm. “I feel my time is running out and the world’s time is running out and what energy I have got left I will spend on fighting climate change, not just for my children and grandchildren but also for the non-human world.  “I am very happy to be able to use my privilege as a white elderly woman this way and I will be back in London in October.” Radford was charged under section 14 and was given a conditional discharge with a £70 fine.  In February,  Osborn, who is also a city councillor and press officer for a Green MEP, and eight other XR activists walked into the county council chamber in Norwich. Osborn says he felt peaceful direct action was the only way to stop a proposed new road, the Norwich Western Link. For four hours, the activists sang and stood arm in arm wearing T-shirts that read: “NCC guilty of ecocide – care not cars.” The councillors first asked them to leave, then switched the lights off and left, pretending the meeting was over, and later played Rule Britannia through loudspeakers to drown out the singing. Osborn was arrested and charged. He accepted a caution and was released without further action. His conviction was later quashed. “I just want to take action that is more commensurate with the seriousness of the situation we are in,” says Jarman, who has been arrested seven times. “I want to know I have done everything I can – when you are in a police cell, you know there is nothing more you can do but pray. And you then have plenty of time to do that.”  “Civil disobedience seems the only moral choice. When the laws and policies of the land are actively destroying what God has made and my children’s future, when ordinary campaigning has failed, when all we need to do to allow climate breakdown is for everyone to carry on their lawful daily business, civil disobedience seems the only moral choice. “The theory shows you need arrests, you need people prepared to go to prison – someone has to be those people. Why shouldn’t I be one of them?” Parfitt was arrested in April at Oxford Circus. “I was very well treated during my arrest,” she says. “Being part of XR I realised being elderly is a great privilege and we have to offer ourselves as arrestables and be on the frontline. We get our pensions and have no jobs or careers to worry about. “The moment when you become most vulnerable, putting yourself in the hands of the state, is when you have most power.” Parfitt is not aware of any court summons and is planning to take part in this week’s action in London. “It was on the last day of the occupation of Waterloo Bridge during the international rebellion in April … we listened to a Brazilian indigenous woman speaking about how she and her fellow activists in the Amazon faced violence and death in their struggles.  I felt the need to stand with her in solidarity and was inspired by all the women around me on the bridge, so later as the police were clearing the road I decided to join in and stand my ground, refusing to move on.  “I was with my husband and we had decided only one of us should be arrested, so he was with me but on the pavement, and he waved goodbye. I was arrested at 8.30pm and held in custody for 21 hours. I tried not to make too much fuss, apologised to the police for taking up their time and made a ‘non-comment’ interview. I still do believe I did the right thing in the light of what we are facing, and when I was in court I read out a prepared statement on that which got me a round of applause.” Lindo was was fined £100 and given a conditional discharge. Kingston was arrested for his part in a protest disrupting the DLR at Canary Wharf in April. “It’s really very hard for many elders to break the law, because of the culture we have been brought up in – unlike younger people now,” he says. “The things I do, I do for my grandchildren and other lifeforms and future generations. Whatever the future situation, I hope we will learn to live a very different way of life to what we have learned under capitalism.” Kingston is facing a crown court trial in early 2020. “I was standing alone on the pavement near Parliament Square outside the supreme court building,” says Goodchild. “I wanted to test the law. I was approached by two police officers. The male officer suggested I go to Marble Arch, ‘where I could have fun’, or words to that effect. I felt this advice to be insulting, because I was protesting against something seriously dangerous: the UK government’s lack of action against climate change. “I replied: ‘Three hundred of my colleagues have been arrested already – why should I be any different?’ “One of the officers patted me down and found an open pin badge in one of my pockets, which was her reason for handcuffing me.  “After a night in a cold cell with noisy ventilation I had fingerprints, photos and DNA taken for processing and was then released with a letter saying I was under investigation. The police have sent me an invitation for interview. I’ve ignored it, but they’ve taken no further action.” Goodchild has since been given a nine-month suspended sentence and must pay a total of £640 in costs. Raven was arrested in April in Parliament Square. “I had slept overnight on the roadblock we had created across Parliament Street with about seven students from UEA and Leeds, as well as the guy who had been up the tree,” she says. “We knew the police were intent on clearing all the road obstructions, and had cleared the one closest to the Houses of Parliament the previous evening . It had been a highly moving experience. The police were visibly moved by the singing, cheering, and peaceful supportive conduct of all present. “The students were already lying together linked by hands in a metal tube, another had glued his hand to the outside of the tube. I said I would like to join them, lay down and glued my right hand to the other end of the tube. A legal observer was present. “I was told that my hand was going to be unstuck by a special PC who used acetone and a soft toothbrush. He did this very gently, finger by finger and then the palm, releasing my hand. “Four officers organised themselves to carry me. I was totally limp. They had to put me down twice before they got to the police van. They were careful and gentle. “I can’t fault the police in their handling of the situation; I hope their exposure to peaceful protest has gone deeper than their uniforms. Nor can I praise XR enough for providing such a supportive, caring network for all arrestees and for modelling a different way of doing things so well. “I was thanked so many times by complete strangers for being arrested. I feel humbled by this, and glad that I have been able to use my freedom and privilege to act in a small way to stand up and be counted. My grandson calls me gangster gran.” Norton was arrested in November after a protest at the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy. “I got into the lobby where I was arrested for spray-chalk painting six XR symbols on the glass walls,” he says. “I got in at 1.30pm and was arrested and taken out at 6pm. I was taken to Charing Cross station where they asked me to fill in forms and when they saw my age they told me to go home. I was later officially charged by letter with damage to the tune of £5,000. “It was a long time after my arrest and two witnesses said the paint had been wiped off straight away so no damage was done. At the first court hearing we pleaded not guilty. We were then given a court date but our solicitor told us other defendants in a similar case had their case discontinued. A few days before we were due in court the CPS let us all know our case was dropped. “We have been called dangerous anarchists, but that is obviously not true. What we want is our government to do what is required to control the change in the climate for the safety and security of the country and the world at large.” Photograph: Tomm Morton/Extenction Rebellion Eastburn joined XR as she became increasingly concerned about the trajectory of the climate crisis and lack of action from the government. Until that point, she had never done anything similar and initially joined in a supporting role, but soon decided to become an arrestable. “Putting myself in harm’s way and risking arrest is really not a big deal compared with what other people are going through around the world and compared with what is coming for our children,” she said. “I feel a very strong sense of duty and that it’s my turn to step up.” In February 2019, Eastburn took part in her first direct action, during an oil conference attended by the then trade secretary, Liam Fox. In April, during the widespread London protests, Eastburn superglued herself to the roof of a DLR train. She is facing a crown court trial in December for her DLR protest."

In a piece titled Under Deniers, science publicist Dirk Maxeiner writes about how dissent over any politically touchy topic in Germany is increasingly being suppressed lately: by applying the label “Leugner” (denier).
Especially when one considers what Germany went through during its history, I find it appalling that a person’s right to speak up and to exercise dissent here would be suppressed in that particular manner. Sadly, that is exactly what is happening now whenever someone expresses a “different opinion” on any politically sensitive topic, especially climate change.
So just how are climate dissenters being regarded here in Germany? Among some: like criminals. Maxeiner describes how:
Whoever even quietly doubts this or that aspect of catastrophic global warming finds himself in no time at all in the company of those on the dock of the Nuremberg trials, or of Bishop Williamson and Ahmadinedschad. It is as if the denial of a crime in the past could be compared to the doubt over a feared future catastrophe.”
Well, this is pretty much what’s happening in Germany. How often does we hear the term “climate change denier” in the “debate”?
In Germany it was just on the anniversary of Kristallnacht last November when a group of leading German Green Parliamentarians (Dr. Hermann Ott, Bärbel Höhn, Hans Josef Fell, Sylvia Kotting-Uhl, Jürgen Trittin etc.) sent a brief query to Chancellor Angela Merkel demanding that she explain how someone in her party could have the gall of meeting with “climate change denier” Fred Singer.
The query contained the term “denier” at least 7 times, once in the title, 3 times in the introduction (once even personally calling Fred Singer, who is Jewish, a “climate change denier”), once in point no. 6, once in point no. 10 and once in point no. 11 (see here). It is all documented.
But to Germany’s credit, for whatever it’s worth, this brand of science bullying was not it’s own invention, but more so appears to be of American origin. The German Greens seem to be content to use it for all it’s worth. Maxeiner tells us how the real groundwork was prepared:

To do this, it was first necessary to equate modern industrial societies with the Holocaust. For the climate protection apologist Al Gore ‘the evidence of an ecological Kristallnacht is as clear as the shattering of glass in Berlin.’ For well-known American climate scientist James Hansen one has to ask the question when one views the calving of glaciers: ‘Could the the sound of breaking ice masses serve as a Kristallnacht to wake us up?’ Regarding coal trains, he found it appropriate to comment: If we don’t succeed in stopping the construction of new coal power plants, then these are death trains that are no less gruesome than the trains that rolled into the crematoriums.’ For the last remark, he at least apologized.”
And let’s not forget Dave Roberts (of Grist) and his notorious comment:
When we’ve finally gotten serious about global warming, when the impacts are really hitting us and we’re in a full worldwide scramble to minimize the damage, we should have war crimes trials for these bastards — some sort of climate Nuremberg.”
In the end, all this rhetoric has served to label climate science dissenters as criminals on par to Holocaust deniers. In Germany the term “denier” has lately become the fashionable weapon of the politically correct in attacking opposition, and so it is no surprise that it is being widely used here for a number of other issues, like the recent shooting spree in Norway and criticism of Islam. Maxeiner writes:
Claudia Roth of the Green Party speaks of ‘denying the reality of Islam’ when addressing critical views of Islam. Magazine Der Spiegel, always one to use the latest word-trends and to not miss a single beat, concocted the magic term: ‘Islam-denier”.
And today anyone who expresses criticism of the euro now risks being labelled a “euro-denier”.
So speak at your own peril. To dissent is to “deny”, which is now being associated with crimes of the worst kind. One has to remember that in Germany there is little debate on climate change. The dissenters are an extremely small minority and have very few resources. The risks of speaking here up are very real.
As for me – the more they try to shut us up with this kind of bullying, the more I’m going to bring up their crude examples.

"Australia’s biggest superannuation fund, the $170bn AustralianSuper, has warned the Minerals Council its position on the climate crisis was not good enough and the peak mining body needed to do more. AustralianSuper’s head of environmental, social and governance issues, Andrew Gray, told Guardian Australia the council was a good example of a group of industry associations that had made a general commitment to the principles of the Paris agreement, designed to limit global heating to 2C, but had failed to say how their members would do so. “They’ve got a very high-level statement about alignment with Paris but I want to see them do more,” he said. The substance behind its statement needed to be developed. “A high-level statement like that was probably where people were at a few years ago, but people need to keep evolving,” he said. Over the coming year, tackling industry associations whose climate agendas did not match the stated goals of member companies would be a priority for Climate Action 100+, a global group of investment funds including AustralianSuper that control more than $35tn in assets. Other members of the 370-strong group include Australian fund manager BT, global bank HSBC and California’s state pension fund Calpers. In its first progress report, the group – which was set up in December 2017 – said many companies were making progress but more needed to be done. Gray, who sits on the Climate Action 100+ steering committee, said the initiative was still in its early days. “I’m not disappointed about the progress to date but that’s not the same as saying much more doesn’t need to be done,” he said. “I think these achievements are really significant and we’ve got a lot of momentum.” The Minerals Council’s position on the climate has already caused significant pain for the peak body, with its chief executive, Brendan Pearson, leaving the organisation in November 2017 after clashes with BHP and Rio Tinto, who were unhappy with its advocacy for coal. Despite changes at the council, activists and investors have continued to pressure the big miners over their continued membership. Rio Tinto threatened to quit if the council made statements contradicting the Paris agreement, and BHP is reviewing its membership of all industry organisations. On Tuesday, after lobbying from Climate Action 100+, BHP released new guidance that broadened the issues it would examine when deciding if it should be a member of industry groups. “I think it’s very good steps in the right direction,” Gray said. In its report, Climate Action 100+ said 77% of companies clearly assigned responsibility for climate to the board of directors, but less than 8% ensured their positions were consistent with those of industry associations. “It’s important that industry associations of which companies are a member have consistent positions with their members,” Gray said. “If that’s not the case that represents a business risk for us.” This was because any inconsistency was “potentially undermining the company’s position”, he said. “Generally speaking the climate policy positions of industry associations aren’t where they need to be, they’re not as strong as they need to be,” he said. “The Minerals Council, I think, is a good example.” The Minerals Council’s chief executive, Tania Constable, said it “welcomes AustralianSuper’s endorsement of our public policy position on climate change and agrees with them that there is more that the industry can do, and is doing, to improve environmental outcomes”. She said the Australian minerals industry supported the Paris agreement and claimed the industry’s direct emissions “might have peaked already”. “Australian mining businesses are working together to make our contribution to lowering emissions,” she said. “This includes reducing the emissions from minerals extraction and processing, investment in low emission technology such as carbon capture and storage, energy-efficiency initiatives and increasing the use of renewable energy in operations.” Gray said although AustralianSuper did not screen out companies based on their environmental performance, it was an issue that fed into how they valued potential investments. “The size of ownership or whether we own it or not will be affected,” he said. Companies had to deal with both the physical risk global heating posed to their businesses and with the risks associated with moving the world to a low-carbon future. “I think it is inherently a difficult issue because we are dealing with a) the weather and b) a wholesale economic transition,” he said. But this was not much different to working out the risks associated with other changes, such as technology, he said: “A lot of things investors have to forecast for the long term are inherently difficult.”"

Share this...FacebookTwitterThe English Der Spiegel presents a blistering report on the solar energy debacle in Germany this week in a piece titled:
Solar Subsidy Sinkhole, Re-Evaluating Germany’s Blind Faith in the Sun.
The costs of subsidizing solar electricity have exceeded the 100-billion-euro mark in Germany, but poor results are jeopardizing the country’s transition to renewable energy. The government is struggling to come up with a new concept to promote the inefficient technology in the future…continue reading at Der Spiegel here.
Some bits of reality:
Solar farm operators and homeowners with solar panels on their roofs collected more than €8 billion ($10.2 billion) in subsidies in 2011, but the electricity they generated made up only about 3 percent of the total power supply, and that at unpredictable times.
Until now, Merkel had consistently touted the environmental sector’s “opportunities for exports, development, technology and jobs.” But now even members of her own staff are calling it a massive money pit.

If all commitments to pay subsidies so far are added together, Frondel adds, ‘we have already exceeded the €100 billion level.'”
Read about the entire dismal mess at Der Spiegel, see link above.
Yet, the Greens in Germany are proud of this debacle and cannot get enough of it. Green Party leader Jürgen Trittin says here at CO2 Handel (emphasis added):
‘We are experiencing a concentrated campaign against renewable energy over the recent days,’ Trittin thinks. ‘It is being led by the coal lobby at RWE and Eon, but it is also being incited by the Federal Ministry of Economics.’ Trittin said, the Feed-In Act is by far the most inexpensive way of expanding renewable energies. ‘That’s why it has been copied by over 50 countries.’ “
50 countries that are ruining their energy supply. It should be clear just how detached from reality people like Trittin are.
But with such handouts, I really ought to start thinking about having a system of my own installed on our house. If you don’t jump through the hoop, then you pay through the nose. But on the other side of the hoop, you get rewarded. So it’s stupid not jump through it.

Share this...FacebookTwitterA new paper here on the Jorge Montt Glacier at the Chilean Patagonia is out in Climate of the Past journal. What’s interesting is that this glacier is located in Chile – in South America, far away from the North Atlantic region.
Jorge Montt Glacier, Southern Patagonian ice field. (Photo credit: NASA - public domain photo)
A team of scientists studied tree rings from old trees recently exposed by the retreating Patagonian glaciers. Samples of these trees were dated using radiocarbon methods, yielding burial ages between 460 and 250 years ago.
Well guess what! The study confirms that the Little Ice Age existed in Chile too. Now remember how the high-sticking hockey team kept trying to have us believe that the Medieval Warm Period-Little Ice Age thing was a local phenomena, and not global? That claim is looking more and more like a real joke with every passing study.
The person who brought my attention to this paper is an expert geologist, and wishes to remain anonymous. He wrote me in an e-mail:
Amazing how globally widespread the ‘local North Atlantic’ Little Ice Age was in fact.”
And he quoted the paper’s abstract:
The dendrochronology and maps indicate that Glaciar Jorge Montt was at its present position before the beginning of the LIA, in concert with several other glaciers in Southern Patagonia, and reached its maximum advance position between 1650 and 1750 AD.”
No misprint there. It’s correct. Before the LIA the Chilean glaciers were at the same spot as the present position. Send a copy of that paper to Michael Mann and the rest of the climate clowns.

Share this...FacebookTwitterMatthias Iken has written a piece at the online German daily Hamburger Abendblatt here on Germany’s reaction to Fritz Vahrenholt’s and Sebastian Lüning’s climate skeptical bestselling book “Die kalte Sonne“. His piece is titled: The Intolerant Society.
Germany deals with its climate skeptics (Public domain work)
Needless to say, the reaction to Germany’s bestselling skeptic book has been brutally harsh. In his piece, Iken reminds us of three rules in Germany:
1. Never praise the Pope!
2. Never doubt the multi-cultural society!
3. And do believe in climate change!”
Violating any of the above will get you into serious trouble. Since Vahrenholt’s and Lüning’s skeptic book has hit the bookshelves, the two authors have been met with a storm of outrage from the much of the media, numerous zealot activists and the political establishment. Vahrenholt’s own party comrade Michael Müller even labelled him a “climate denier”.
Germany stomps “skeptic physics“
As Die kalte Sonne website mentions, Iken writes:
It is best kept silent that Vahrenholt is the director of RWE subsidiary Innogy for alternative energies. The same applies to the fact that the former environmental politician fought as a pioneer for the ecological movement, as the author of the book Seveso ist überall [Seveso is everywhere} and that he was the manager of the wind power company Repower. He has earned the right to be taken seriously. No one has to agree with him, but he needs to be discussed with.”

Die kalte Sonne website writes that one has to wonder about the massivve blind trust placed in the keepers of the unchallenged IPCC climate truth. Instead of entering into a fruitful discussion, brimstone and fire has rained down. Numerous scientists who agree at least with parts of the book’s argumentation are keeping silent for fear of being chastised by colleagues and loss of grant money. Unfortunately Germany has seen similar days some decades ago. The only difference today is that the science that challenges climate orthodoxy now gets called skeptic physics.
No. 14 on bestseller list
Critics also unfairly claim that the book was not written by real climate scientists. However, not only is Vahrenholt a professor of chemistry, he is also an expert in renewable energies – something the media keeps burying. One critic scientist even made the mistake of claiming that Lüning has not authored any real peer-reviewed papers. However, it turns out that he has authored or co-authoredover 30 publications, and, since two weeks, is the author of a bestseller: “Die kalte Sonne”, now ranked No. 14 on Spiegel’s bestseller list.
On the other hand, warmist Mojib Latif, a fierce critic of Vahrenholt and Lüning, has also just released a climate book. It’s ranked number 31,500 at Amazon, making it a real loser. Latif obviously is seething with envy and so has resorted to petty back-biting.  
Die kalte Sonne also includes 4 guest authors who are distinguished experts and pioneers in their respective fields: Nir Shaviv, Henrik Svensmark, Nicola Scarfetta and Werner Weber. Scientifically, it’s as solid as can be.
Ikes reminds us:
As Francis Picabia once said: Our heads are round so that we can think in all directions. In Germany we often act like blockheads.”

Share this...FacebookTwitterWe’ve all heard about Hans Schellnhuber’s masterplan for the Great Transformation of society, from one powered by “climate killing” fossil fuel energies to one powered by gentle, earth-healing renewable energies.
Well, it turns out that the Great Transformation would likely end up being the Great Transfer-mation – of private wealth!
The online Die Rheinpfalz here  reports that if Germany succeeded in shifting to renewable energy, it would cost each German household €800.00 per month, or almost €10,000 ($13,000) per year, this according to calculations by physicist Gerd Ganteför of the University of Konstanz.
What benefit would all that money possibly lead to? Firstly, lots of government interference in private lives. Secondly, maybe a few undetectable hundredths of a degree Celsius of less warming. Indeed no endeavour in human history would cost so much and yet deliver so little to society as a whole. Thirdly, it would make (and has made) a few people outrageously rich.
Online Die Rheinphalz writes:
Covering the entire German energy demand of 2500 billion kwh per year – that includes heating, transportation and a large part of industry – with green technology would be impossible says the expert of the University of Konstanz. That would entail additional costs of 800 euros per household per month, and that is unaffordable,’ says Ganteför.”
But that’s not the way a group of green zealots see it. They actually believe we can’t afford not to take the unaffordable path of green energy, otherwise the earth will burn up. And a lot of interest groups and industries are just salivating over the prospects of such a massive transfer of wealth. Indeed many slimy European politicians from all parties have vested interests in green energy.
Ganteför points out that these extreme costs would not be bearable, and so they would lead to massive reductions in the use of electricity by private and business consumers, and so lead to a…:
…considerable change of lifestyle for every individual. Individual transportation and business production would have to be massively scaled back.”
But this is precisely what these green zealots want (IMHO). They want humankind to move back into the mud, to be completely humiliated – and to get very rich while inflicting the pain.

Share this...FacebookTwitterI must admit that over the last record-breaking 10 days here at NTZ, it’s been interesting to watch the climate activists and the end-of-the world whackos hyperventilate about Fritz Vahrenholt’s and Sebastian Lüning’s questioning of climate science.
So over-the-top have some of the attacks been that readers are beginning to question the very sanity of some of these obsessive Armageddonist.
At Germany’s version of moveon.org, www.vorwaerts.de, the mouthpiece of Germany’s socialist SPD party, to which Vahrenholt himself is a member, party honcho Michael Müller unloads. Müller’s rambling diatribe runs over an exhaustive 5 pages. Strangely on the surface, his screed appears like a book review of Die kalte Sonne, but after going through Müller’s rant, one finds almost nothing about the book itself!
Müller obviously has never read it.
So it’s good that the very first and only reader comment makes a point, one that hopefully will remind Müller what a raving public fool he looks like. Reader Gerhard v.d. Straten left the following comment:

Do you think that’s okay? Climate denier, irresponsible, climate-Sarrazin? Indeed that goes too far. We really have not gone back to the Dark Ages where everyone who questions the faith gets stoned to death. Vahrenholt and Lüning don’t even do that. They are only bringing into the discussion the point that global warming is 50% caused by man. How would it be to first read the book before first foaming at the mouth, Herr Müller?
Yours,”
That’s good advice for any mouth-foaming end-of-worlder. Obviously discussing anything with the closed-minded basket cases we’ve seen over the last few days is a waste of time. All they’re interested in is finding the closest tree to carry out their political lynchings. I suggest to Müller that he take steps to have Vahrenholt booted from the SPD Party. Go ahead and try.
Unfortunately, Mr Straten, the end-of-worlders like Müller are indeed back in the Dark Ages. I wonder how much longer your comment will even remain. Here’s the original German in case it should disappear:
Finden sie das in Ordnung. Klimaleugner, verantwortungslos, Klima-Sarrazin. Das geht doch nun wirklich zu weit. Wir sind doch nun wirklich nicht im Mittelalter angekommen und müssen jeden steinigen, der eine Glaubensrichtung in Frage stellt. Varenholt und Lüning tun das noch nicht einmal. Sie bringen nur die These, dass die globale Erwärmung 50% menschgemacht ist mal wieder in den Blickpunkt. Wie wäre es mal mit Buch lesen und nicht gleich Schaum vor den Mund kriegen, Herr Müller.

Share this...FacebookTwitterMay 2011 - SLR = 3.1 mm/yr
Portuguese skeptic website Ecotretas sent me the following story about rising sea levels awhile back. Seems the more sea level rise slows down, the more the alarmists claim it is accelerating (Sorry about the poor visual quality of graphics).
More hiding the decline
by Ecotretas
The University of Colorado has done it again! Despite the fact that sea level has been going down for the last year, they are saying that sea level rise rate is going up! You can see it with your own eyes in the graphics below.
In the first graph above, was generated last May and shows sea level going up 3.1 mm/year (sorry about the fuzzy quality). I debunked that at the time, because the University of Colorado introduced an artificial correction of 0.3 mm/year.
The second graph that follows was produced in July, just 2 months later, and they have applied more adjustments corrections. Note that all the newly introduced points are below the trend-line, so it should be diminishing… But no! It went up from 3.1 mm/year to 3.2 mm/year!
July 2011 SLR= 3.2 mm/yr
They give a reason for the correction: Although the latest Jason-2 GMSL estimates (cycles 95-102) are well below the trend line, most likely due to the recent La Nina (we plan to add a sea level/ENSO comparison page shortly), the rate increased slightly from 3.1 to 3.2 mm/yr due to the improvements to the TOPEX SSB model and replacement of the classical IB correction with the improved DAC correction, as noted above.
So, once again it’s about the models, and not the real data! To figure out this nasty science, I’ve graphed the difference between the two first graphs.
Plot of the difference
Clearly, all data points are pushed up. Big differences appear until 2002, which get below 10 mm between 2002 and 2005, and get even bigger after 2005.
The black line, which is a linear regression trend for all the data points, clearly shows that the correction introduces a rising trend!
The sea level rate measured by satellite should now be somewhere near 2.8 mm/year, and that is still clearly above what is being measured by tide gauge stations. One more example of hiding the decline!

Share this...FacebookTwitterThe woes in the renewable energy sector continue unabated. We’ve heard a number of headlines of jobs being lost in the solar industry – now jobs are being lost in wind as well.
According to news reports, the world’s largest wind tuirbine manufacturer, Vestas,  will lay off another 2300 workers worldwide, along with a possible additional 1600 jobs in the USA.  The reason is sluggish demand. The company also announced the closure of a number of facilities. Last year the company had laid off 3000 employees.According to the German language CO2 Handel, 1300 jobs will be lost at the headquarters in Aarhus Denmark.
The wind turbine manufacturer had again lowered its forecast for sales turnover for 2011 and now expects 6 billion instead of 6.4 billion euros in turnover.”
The company no longer believes it’ll make a profit. CBS News writes:
…a potential slowdown in the United States could also result in the layoff of an additional 1,600 employees there.”
and
Last year, Vestas laid off 3,000 workers after posting a 24 percent drop in the third quarter.”
According to Global Winnepeg, job losses in the USA will depend on whether or not the company will get more handouts from the taxpayers:
It said the U.S. layoff plans would mainly depend on whether the Production Tax Credit — which gives a favourable low tax rate to makers of renewable energy — would be extended or not. In 2010, Vestas was awarded about $51 million in tax credits through the U.S. federal stimulus program.”

That means start kissing German green jobs good bye. Yet another Soviet-style propped up industry begins to bite the dust.
According to co2-handel.de here, rising raw material prices on the purchasing side, falling prices on the sales side, falling market demand, and reduced subsidies are spelling big trouble for the once booming German solar industry.
Solarworld, based in Bonn, did better than most other German solar companies. For the first 6 months of 2011 it recorded a profit of €22.4 million, but that was down significantly from €34.8 million for the same period last year. Half-year sales plummeted 12% to €535 million.
Hemorrhaging red ink – production moving to Asia
Konstanz-based Sunways AG’s 2nd quarter sales collapsed from €64.6 million to €38.7 million during the first half of this year, posting a loss of €2.5 million euros.

Things were even worse for Conergy. According to CO2-handel.de, the Hamburg-based company lost €41 million in the first 6 months of this year compared to a profit of €5 million for the same period last year.
Bavaria-based Phoenix Solar extended its losing streak, posting a loss of €21.1 million compared to a loss of  €18.7 million for the same period last year. Sales plummeted 61% to €140.8 million.
Q-Cells in Bitterfeld-Wolfen plans to shut down a large portion of its solar cell production at facilities in Bitterfeld-Wolfen and shift it to Malaysia in a bid to stem the hemorrhaging red ink. CO2 handel.de writes about Q-Cells:
Production capacity in Germany is to be scaled back by 50%.”
Asian manufacturers are now flooding markets with cheap modules. Solarworld director Frank Asbeck expects 8 gigawatts of over-capacity from Asia.
The flood of red ink is occuring despite government subsidies, which however have been scaled back this year. Face it without the still generous subsidies, the figures would be much worse. And despite the low-priced cells coming from Asia, it’s still a lousy way to produce energy – especially in gray and rainy Germany.

"Stella McCartney would be on trend this season whatever she put on her catwalk. Two decades after the designer launched her brand, the climate crisis is forcing the fashion industry to accept the principles of sustainability and respect for the environment that are central to her beliefs, and McCartney finds herself promoted from fashion’s fringes to a leadership role. “It’s been an incredible fashion week for me, seeing how the climate crisis has become so explosive in this industry. Suddenly everyone is talking about it,” she said backstage at Paris fashion week. This season, instead of a note explaining the inspiration behind the collection, she gave each guest a timeline detailing innovations in sustainable fashion over the past 19 years. “I hope the timeline shows that some progress is being made. Things need to change immediately, but we also need to stay positive and hopeful. If you scare people so much that they are absolutely terrified, you can’t engage them. They need to feel they can make a difference.” The night before the show, McCartney hosted a roundtable discussion on sustainability at the Palais Garnier show venue. Members of Extinction Rebellion and a founder of Bolt Threads, a Californian biotechnology company producing lab-grown silk and other fabric, took part in a discussion alongside environmentalist Yann Arthus-Bertran, and animal rights activist and actor Maisie Williams. Her years of attempting to enthuse the industry about the environment before it became fashionable have made McCartney a dab hand at sexing up sustainability. The catwalk show was accompanied by grainy video footage of zebras and hippos having sex, to a sultry soundtrack of Donna Summer singing Love to Love You Baby. The Stella vibe being very much on trend, it made good business sense for this collection to focus on the looks for which the brand is best known. So there was soft-power tailoring, a staple since McCartney’s days as a trainee on Savile Row, in shades of peach, toffee and soft, unbleached white. There were 1970s-bohemian denim skirts, and silk blouses with scalloped edges. Amber Valetta, who had taken part in the previous evening’s sustainability discussion, wore a moss-green silk trench, while the wildflower prints on silk dresses came from photos McCartney took on bike rides through the English countryside. With recycled polyester, organic cotton, regenerated cashmere and handbags made of sustainable raffia or second-life plastics, it marked the brand’s most sustainable collection to date. “But I hope that when you watch the show you don’t even notice that, actually,” the designer said backstage. “I hope that it’s just desirable and beautiful and luxurious.” The brand has partnered with resale company TheRealReal in a deal which incentivises McCartney’s designer shoppers to participate in the circular economy by reselling their purchases. “We spend a lot of time on fabric technology, but the circular economy is another huge part of the story,” said McCartney. “The youth of today, really they should be wearing vintage and secondhand clothes, and looking at renting clothes - and they are absolutely doing that. Fabric innovation, combined with this youth culture - it’s exciting.” But despite her championing of the circular economy, McCartney is expanding the brand. Backstage after the show, alongside her father, Sir Paul, and fellow fashion designer Vivienne Westwood, she was joined by her new business partners, the Arnault family who control LVMH. In July, one year after having bought back full control of her brand from her initial backers, Kering, McCartney announced that she was partnering with LVMH, the world’s biggest luxury house. She remains majority shareholder, but the deep pockets of LMVH, the owner of Louis Vuitton and Christian Dior, bring the opportunity for accelerated growth. As part of the agreement, McCartney holds the role of special adviser on sustainability to Bernard Arnault. Natalia Vodianova, longtime favourite model of McCartney and wife of LVMH scion Antoine Arnault, did not appear on the catwalk this season but sat front row in a new-season Koba coat. Made from recycled polyester blended with a corn byproduct, Koba is a breakthrough in faux fur, a process that previously relied on environmentally damaging petroleum-based products."

Share this...FacebookTwitterIt’s official: the Alfred Wegener Institute Antarctic Neumayer-Station III is a meteorological observation station that’s been measuring air temperature and other magnitudes in Antarctica for 30 years, which is the period of time used to define climate for a region. The results are clear and indisputable. The AWI writes in its press release:
At the Neumayer Station it has not gotten warmer over the last 30 years.”
Note they avoid saying it got cooler. If the trend had been the opposite, the results would have been blasted out to the world in the most vivid terms. Annual mean temperature for the years 1982 to 2011 measured at the Neumayer-Station (all graphics come from the Alfred Wegener Institute):

Mean annual temperature plot at the Neumayer Station shows cooling. (AWI)

According to the press release, the temperature station uses instrumentation that makes US climatological measurement system look like a meteorological junkyard. The Antarctic station uses a special type thermometer that is protected from the sun’s rays and has a sensitive platinum wire. The thermometer is 2 meters above the surface. Whenever a measurement is made, the surrounding air is set into turbulence and the measurement is then input into a computer. According to Director Gert König-Langlo:
We check the stability of the measurement system on a regular basis using calibration thermometers.
At the station the annual mean temperature over the last 30 years was minus 16°C. The year 1996 with a mean temperature of minus 14.3°C was the warmest of the last 30 years and the year 2000 was the coldest with a mean temperature of minus 17.8° Celsius.”
With all the concern over global warming gripping Europe, you’d think this would be all over the news. Nope! Not a peep of this cooling trend has appeared anywhere in the German news as far as I can tell. Unfortunately, the AWI did not offer any explanation as to why they have measured cooling. But it is quick to add:
This development is however a regional change and the measurement data from the Neumayer-Station III  is in no way representative for global climate changes. ‘Only at the centre of Antarctica has it not gotten warmer. On the Antarctic peninsula on the other hand, the mean temperature has risen up to 3°C. We also observe a similar warming in the Arctic,’ says König-Langlo.”
I’ll now take the liberty to offer the AWI scientists a clue: perhaps ocean cycles and currents have something to do with it?

The Neumayer station also shows a powerful upward trend for the amount of sunshine:
Amount of sunshine at the Neumayer Station of the AWI.
Here, however, König-Langlo doesn’t hesitate to offer an explanation:
Our weather data shows that the part of Antarctica where our station is located is increasingly influenced by high pressure. We have clear skies more and more often. And wherever cloud cover is missing in polar regions, heat gets radiated out and the lower air layers cool.”
More and more high pressure resulting in clear skies. (AWI)
Polar temperatures depend a lot on cloud cover? A couple of days ago it was soot. Sometimes it’s aerosols. Other times it’s all CO2.  I wish these scientists would make up their minds for once! But it’s never the sun, never the oceans (though without them there would be no climate to change). We keep hearing of different warming drivers, but the numbers never add up because nobody dares to scale back CO2 is as a driver. In the end the scientists look absolutely untrustworthy with their explanations – in layman’s terms they make themselves look like they’re FOS.
When you add their numbers up, the result says they absolutely are.
Near the end of the press release comes the pitch for more funding to conduct more research.
Why the temperature curve of the Neumayer-Station differs so much from the other research stations on the Antarctic peninnsula is still the object of current research. “Further measurements and research efforts are necessary to clear up the matter,’ says Gert König-Langlo.”

"I was delighted to read Daniel Boffey’s article on hitchhiking (Hitchhiking revival given the thumbs up to cut emissions, 28 September). I do hope this may catch on in the UK. I have been thinking for some time that we need a campaign to bring back hitchhiking. Many years ago (before the death of Castro) I had a holiday in Cuba. There was a severe fuel shortage, due to the US blockade. There, we were told, it was an offence not to pick up hitchhikers. Travellers could buy a token which they gave to the driver who redeemed it to help to pay for the petrol. Could such a system, or the Brussels one, catch on here? We could make a start if we all began hitchhiking, and revealed why. Perhaps we could carry a sign with our desired destination and “cutting emissions” clearly on it?Mary BrownStroud, Gloucestershire  • Join the debate – email guardian.letters@theguardian.com  • Read more Guardian letters – click here to visit gu.com/letters • Do you have a photo you’d like to share with Guardian readers?

Share this...FacebookTwitterTough day for the German press yesterday, reporting the story about the Kaufmann et al 2011 paper, which looks at what’s behind the 10 years of no global warming. Read more here at WUWT . The day before that, signs of warming were everywhere, the media said. Then a day later they all say there hasn’t been warming in 10 years. Go figure!
Here’s a look at what some various newspapers and weeklies have written:
Der Spiegel writes:
China’s sulphur emissions put the brakes on climate change
Climate paradox: The atmosphere contains more and more carbon dioxide, but the temperatures did not go up to 2008. Scientists explain it with the phenomena of burning dirty coal in China. Foremost the sulphur contained in the coal compensates for the greenhouse effect.”
But Der Spiegel then warns of the consequences of China cleaning its emissions!
This is no reason to cancel the alarm for the future. The earth could be facing a phase of especially rash warming: when solar activity picks up again and emerging countries like China reduce their emissions of air pollutants like sulphur.”
Die Welt writes:
Why global warming has not occurred up to now
Climate scientists repeatedly warn of global warming – but: So far it hasn’t shown up.
Scientists warn everywhere of global warming. But today there is no trace of it.”
Die Presse writes:
Is warming taking a break?

A renown scientist says the stop in temperature increase can indeed be explained. The enormous increase of the emitted CO2 since 1998 has come for the most part from coal power plants in China. Starting in 1998, there was no global warming for 10 years, from 2005 to 2008 it was even 0.2°C cooler.”
Die Zeit writes:
China’s coal gives global warming a break
Despite the immense CO2 emissions, the greenhouse effect took a break from 1998 to 2008. Sulphur emissions, La Niña and a tired sun are responsible.”
The Financial Times Deutschland writes:
Solar cycles and coal power plants cooling the earth
China as the climate rescuer? Indeed the increasing coal consumption – in addition to other effects – has contributed to making global warming weaker than feared earlier. But the future temperature increase could be that much stronger.”
The Handelsblatt writes:
Environmental pollution puts the brakes on warming
Despite the increasing CO2 emissions into the atmosphere, the earth has hardly warmed over the last 10 years. Scientists say various factors are responsible, among them dirty coal and the solar cycle.”
Right! Now coal causes cooling. And the sun has an impact, too. I wonder if these scientists are ever going to make up their minds.
Most of the leftist papers simply ignored the story, and so their faithful readers will continue being completely stupid and oblivious.

By Ed Caryl
“No place on Earth is warming as fast as Greenland,” we keep hearing. Or: “Greenland is approaching a tipping point!”

The Arctic is known as a desert, with little rain or snow, winter or summer. When I was at Thule AFB in 1962 – 63, snow accumulation was a few inches each winter, and most of that was blown in from the ice cap. In more recent years, however, the snowfall at Thule has increased.

Over the recent years we have been inundated by media reports that Greenland is losing ice at a rapid rate, raising sea-levels, etc, etc. But what is really happening? To find out, look at the following chart from Rutgers University:

Figure 3: Greenland snow cover from Rutgers University Global Snow Laboratory website. ww.climate4you.snowcover.htm
The plateau at the top of the chart depicts complete snow cover, 100%. Note how the trend is clearly steadily up.
Greenland is approaching a condition of year-around complete snow cover.
Is this getting reported in the media? I wonder what condition triggers an ice age?

"Scott Morrison has made his first visit to the United States as prime minister. It was a trip that included a close encounter with the unpredictability of the Trump White House, a foreign policy pivot, and a backlash about a lack of climate policy action. Guardian Australia’s political editor, Katharine Murphy, travelled, with the prime minister. Here is what she witnessed:  We’ve been positioned at the White House since 5am, watching the sun creep over the American capital. Security is as laborious as you’d expect. Dogs sniff bags, then the secret service guys have a good look, passports are collected, checked and returned, White House passes and pins are distributed, and then at last we clear the metal detectors. Eventually we make it to the press briefing room, the small blue one, famous through several presidential administrations but now abandoned by Donald Trump. The modest proportions don’t fit his presidency. Now it’s just a transit zone. We are greeted by a blond woman in a broad-brimmed hat. June, a self-described southern belle, is receiving visitors in the briefing room, although it’s not clear why. She identifies herself as a fellow scribe working for Christian radio and television in Nashville. When she’s not reporting on the Trump White House, she’s rallying Christians for the president. This seems something of a line cross for a reporter with White House press accreditation – but we’ve been on the premises for about 10 minutes and it’s clear that we’re not in Kansas any more. On the other side of the building, visitors are streaming across the South Lawn to grab prime positions to witness The Donald receiving The Scott at the official welcome. Flags, American and Australian, are held aloft on a glorious summery day. Eventually we are permitted to wander down to the lawn as well. The Donald’s grass is lush and slightly dewy, making me regret my choice of footwear. The daylight is now dazzling but the bucolic scene is disturbed by Austin rebuking Steve in the media pen. The confrontation happens just before the splendidly peppy pipe band strides across the lawn for the ceremonial welcome. I’ve never met Austin before this moment but he looks about 30, buttoned down and watchful as a raptor – a White House wrangler who looks as though he hasn’t sat down, eaten anything apart from a protein bar, or slept more than four hours straight a night since early infancy. Steve has transgressed and Austin convenes a short, sharp show trial in front of me. I’ve nabbed a prime position on the fence in the media pen right in front of the entrance, and I don’t intend to move unless the secret service guy standing beside me gets feisty. “You left the media area to make a call,” Austin says, voice appropriately low so as not to disdain the Wonderful Occasion swelling around us. Steve is older than his accuser and possesses the rumpled look of a longtime print or news wire reporter. I’ve never seen Steve before either, but he’s clearly part of the White House press pool and looks like a man disinclined to small talk. My guess, from my quick scan of the body language, the suppressed inner sigh, is that Steve has seen a number of Austins in his reporting lifetime, perhaps a small production line of them, and is not much gripped by this power play. Steve says nothing. Austin persists. In a minute we are going to go full Veep. “The secret service told me you left the media area to make a call – is this correct?” Steve, at the end of his tolerance for J’Accuse now, delivers his mic drop. “Yah,” he says. “One of the secret service guys held back the rope so I could get out to make the call. I needed to take the call.” I suspect Austin doesn’t really know where to take this from here. The aide returns to the front of the fence, shoulders back, eyes front. It’s showtime. Trump strides out of the White House with Melania. From my vantage point they look like a pair of Easter Island statues. This is my first encounter with the current leader of the free world and my curiosity is intense. How will Trump look uncut? Will he look how he does on television, with that weird affect – the pursed lips, narrowed eyes and nose and chin set to an upward inflection, indicative of defiance and displeasure? Or is this a posture he adopts only after he pulls on the presidential onesie every day and heads for Fox News, purring “ready for my close-up Mr DeMille”? I discover this is how Trump looks all the time, or at least all the time he is in open space. He’s striding to the podium with exactly that look, with Melania, who is a dignified presence yet strangely devoid of life force. Perhaps she laughs and sings and dances in her track pants like no one is watching in her private domain but, in public, Mrs Trump looks like a perfectly proportioned doll in a doll’s house. Over the next little while, Trump will lavish praise on Melania for her crack presidential spouse skills. The first lady, Trump reports over and over during the course of Friday, “worked so hard” on the table settings for the state dinner, pondering every detail. The flowers, the centrepieces, so wonderful, so beautiful. The best table decorations anyone has ever seen. It’s hard for me to imagine the reality of the first lady’s life, what it must be like to agonise over centrepieces for state dinners amid the sound and fury of her husband’s bitterly contested presidency. Given her reserved public presence, it feels like an impertinence to wonder. There’s no time for whimsy in any case, because the Morrisons are now on the premises, ready for their induction into the Trumpiverse. In comparison with the Trumps, Scott and Jenny Morrison, from the Sutherland shire, Australia – more latterly of Kirribilli House – look like a well-to-do couple from the suburbs. They are earthed in this big moment, respectful of the tradition they are now associated with, the tradition of Washington’s special friends being drawn to the nation’s bosom. Presumably they are buzzing with anticipation and anxiety, given that the unofficial White House weather forecast for Friday is clear skies, a light breeze and a high probability of catastrophic cyclone once their delegation reaches the Oval Office. Looking normal in this environment takes some doing, but the Morrisons manage. The troops march, and are duly inspected; the visitors clutch their flags, which flutter gaily in the breeze. The anthems are played. The two couples appear content with each other and the scripted remarks they share with each other and the crowd. Just before the conclusion of the formalities, Austin is back working the fence line to move us, lickety split, to the holding pen outside the Oval Office. Fortunately, the war with Steve seems to have subsided. I wash up near Steve and the other White House wire reporters. One of the group explains to me that Steve is the man if they want to get a question to the president. Trump will answer Steve. It’s unclear why that’s the case, and I don’t ask. She also gives us tremendously helpful advice: Trump will be on for a rave when we get in there. We are surprised by this. Our assumption was we’d be in and out in a matter of minutes. Our river guide shakes her head. Trump, she says, is in an expansive frame of mind. Best we prepare some questions. She also predicts that Trump will struggle to understand our accents. If he doesn’t understand, the president will say: “Say it.” This means ask the question again, she says. I assume this is some sort of weird in-joke until I hear Trump do just that. “Say it,” Trump says, narrowing his eyes and curling his lip. It’s utterly peculiar, but it’s an earworm. Once you hear it, it’s hard to get the locution out of your brain. Say it. The door of the Oval Office swings open and we are thrust into pure madness. The media scrum feeds off the static electricity in the room. It heaves like a wave. Our questions crash on the shore. Thud, thud, thud. Mr President. The Americans in the pool want to know about Joe Biden and the Ukraine controversy – a story that will spiral towards impeachment during the week of our visit. No American journalist gives a crap about Australia, and Morrison, and the second state visit to Washington of this febrile presidency. Fun fact: Emmanuel Macron, back when he imagined he had a talent for Trump whispering, was the first to be afforded the honour. But who cares? Conventions are devalued in the coarseness of politics in 2019. No one pretends to care. Everyone just has to emerge with what they need. Once we realise this is going to be nuts – a small blazing blitzkrieg at the seat of American power with no rules of engagement – Australian reporters also start hurling questions across a range of topics. Trump looks delighted by the disorder. It’s where he thrives. Morrison shifts in his seat. The president lays into the media. We are hopeless, finished, friendless. But Mr President, what about the call? Did you speak to Ukraine’s new president? It was a beautiful call. Next question. Say it. The Morrisons sit tight as the stiff westerly blows. The prime minister isn’t visibly alarmed but he’s hyper alert. Jenny Morrison composes her face into a placid mask – until Trump suddenly raises the spectre of nuclear weapons and Iran. I catch her eye at that moment and she startles, ever so slightly. Her eyes, to me, say “help me”. I catch Morrison’s eye a couple of times and the corners of his mouth crinkle. I am a spectator at this circus but the prime minister isn’t permitted the luxury of distancing. Morrison is a peer of the president, a leader of a respectable middle power who has chosen, as the New York Times columnist Maureen Dowd puts it with just the right squeeze of lemon during our visit, “to play ball with the Mad King” – to give friendless Donald a friend. The prime minister, unlike us, enjoys the benefit of knowing what Trump really thinks on a range of fronts; he has that baseline to keep him tethered through the rhetorical turbulence. But back in the nosebleed seats we lack those insights. During our 33 minutes in the Oval Office, Australian journalists are on a rollercoaster, hanging upside down, while the president indulges a dialogue with himself about whether to launch a military strike against Iran, or whether restraint is the better course. He lands eventually at restraint but the disorientation is so profound it takes me a while to process that’s where we’ve landed. Eventually Trump stops feeling all the feelings and we are herded out. I ask one of my fellow travelling reporters whether the president just raised the prospect of nuclear attack, because I fear the sleep deprivation might be messing with my cognition. He’s as knocked around as I am. Yes, he thinks so, but he needs to listen to the recording. TV reporters are wondering out loud how on earth they are going to distil what just happened into a package. How do you do this in a minute and a half? At the height of my disorientation, I spot Paul Murray from Sky’s Fox News lite after-dark crew at the back of the room. As we are guided out, Morrison beckons Murray forward and introduces him to the president. This introduction yields an exclusive interview with Trump which includes the simpering question: “What do you want to say to your many Australian supporters who wish you nothing but the best in November 2020?” I suppose it could have been what was his favourite colour. Paul Murray gets his exclusive with ⁦@realDonaldTrump⁩ but talk about not asking the hard questions. pic.twitter.com/5QnxMW5cHh The madness persists. The day ends with wranglers trying to facilitate some access to the state dinner, which is al fresco, in the Rose Garden. As we are herded through the South Lawn accompanied by the lilt of violins serenading guests and the murmur of clinking glassware and small talk, a secret service guy in night goggles, with foliage in his helmet, suddenly materialises from the bushes and sprints across in front of us. Shortly after this our White House wrangler declares this walk off the record, which generates considerable confusion among the scribes. How can a walk to a pool position be off the record? Which bit is off the record? This walk never happened? How do we explain our capacity to bear witness to events at the state dinner? Did we parachute in? We resolve not to overthink this and press on, and eventually get close enough to see the guests drifting around the Rose Garden: the Australian billionaire box maker Anthony Pratt is hard to miss with his shock of orange hair; the younger Murdochs are there, Lachlan and Sarah, I reckon I’ve spotted the mining magnates Twiggy Forrest and the generally reclusive Gina Rinehart, who appears to be floating. I rub my eyes, fearing a fancy. Perhaps Rinehart is not floating, more likely I’m swaying, peering through a large shrub, sleep deprived and smacking the mosquitos that threaten my ankles, questioning my life choices. I see Rinehart again the next day, floating (she is definitely wafting like a cloud, because I know I’m no longer swaying) into a soiree at the Australian ambassador Joe Hockey’s residence, in a white dress with sequins and what appear to be pom poms trailing at the back. Morrison’s old chief of staff and new department head, Phil Gaetjens, by contrast, is wandering around in a Wallabies rugby jersey with cut-off sleeves. While the grandees mingle, Rinehart sets up court with her entourage in a shaded corner of the garden on what looks like a sedan chair, but is actually just a garden settee. The visual cue is Ms Rinehart is receiving guests, as long as they are not journalists. The media mogul Kerry Stokes is also said to be mingling but I don’t clap eyes on him. In Hockey’s garden I strike up a conversation with an expatriate pub owner who is now the mayor of Annapolis and is campaigning to tighten gun control. Gavin Buckley, formerly from Western Australia, is an avuncular Democrat at a Republican knees-up, a fish out of water who can’t quite believe his luck. Buckley tells me he hugged Hockey for the great honour bestowed upon him. The whole scene is F Scott Fitzgerald meets the pre-woke capitalism of the 1980s, and the humidity is sending us all bonkers. Servers hand out party pies and sausages with disturbing names like cheese and Vegemite, and bald men in linen sports jackets compete for shade. One of our travelling media pack then proceeds to conduct a mock interview of a new magnolia tree which has just been planted to celebrate the Morrison state visit. With the Magnolia, this is Brett Mason, SBS News. It’s a joke, hijinks to help us stay alert when we are hitting that hour of the day when jetlag threatens to take your legs out. But we’ve crossed the sense barrier and we haven’t even hit the Trump rally. What could possibly go wrong? It’s a voyage with billionaires, this American excursion with Morrison. I confess that this is new territory for me. The cashed-up and politically connected drifted past us during the pomp and circumstance in Washington, and now we are closing in on Anthony Pratt as we speed to Wapakoneta, first airborne and then jammed in Morrison’s motorcade with police cars racing past, sirens blaring, to stop traffic on the freeway. Morrison, who will be thriving on all this hard work and energised by the thought that he might be called upon to pull things back from the brink, is upbeat during a quick amble down the back of the plane. He wonders what we have made of the Oval Office. “Two words,” I shoot back. “How good?” The gaggle of Morrison staff tumbling in and out of black vans in the motorcades, and standing glassy eyed at midnight in hotel foyers, clutching their phones and wondering what day it is, look in reasonable shape despite the fact that most of them won’t have slept much. Team Morrison and senior bureaucrats drift in and out of our orbit, leaving us mostly in the hands of a crack team of departmental minders. These officials, particularly the logistics people, are always the unsung heroes of these trips. The wranglers on this trip are outstanding. The pace is punishing – at times it feels like early in the Kevin Rudd era. The transitions are down to the second and there are no screw-ups, at least none that are visible to us. One of Morrison’s press secretaries, Nick Creevey, has joined us for the sprint to Wapakoneta on the commandeered Dayton school bus. We’re all practising the pronunciation of Wapakoneta. Wah-pa, Christ, how do you spell this bloody place again? Katina Curtis, the meticulously prepared Australian Associated Press reporter, is patient with the spelling drills. Hey Katina. How do you spell … There are few female journalists on this trip, and overseas voyages, in my experience, tend to take on an Aussie barbecue dimension. This is a generalisation but, as generalisations go, not an unfair one. Male correspondents largely herd together, socialise together, crack jokes together, reinforce one another’s insights, and women run on a parallel track. It’s a strange dynamic at times; stranger because the blokes who engage in the behaviour would be entirely unconscious that’s what’s happening. It’s just custom, or muscle memory. Hashtag road trip. Hashtag dudes. Dayton to Wapakoneta is flat and rural. The billboards we pass are a combination of fast food temptations and Jesus Christ, saving the born and unborn. I’m both fascinated to learn what we are driving into and mildly apprehensive, given that Trump rallies can be hostile to the media covering them, and hackles in the base must be raised by the latest mainstream media pursuit over Trump and Ukraine. The president loves a persecution narrative with him at the centre of it – it fuels the righteous rage of his supporters. Everyone can be aggrieved together. Nobody in the PM’s entourage expresses any apprehension at all about Ohio, not even a hint of it. But my instinct suggests they are also worried about the unknown. There are risks in the look of this thing. Should Morrison really be at a Trump rally (even though the Ohio event is more complicated than a 2020 campaign whistle stop with Morrison attached). Apart from the possibility of any bizarre, indefensible off-piste business, there is also the risk of Trump banging on and on and on. It is entirely possible scheduled remarks at the opening of a box factory could stretch into a Castroesque monologue that kills our logistics stone dead. Morrison’s crew had expected the Oval Office encounter to last for a few minutes and instead it stretched, putting them behind for the remainder of the day. I filed a column describing our arrival into Wapakoneta and the rapturous welcome the locals gave Trump, but there were some other memorable moments behind the scenes. When Trump and his entourage finally blow in to town in a blaze of police sirens and secret service agents, we are reunited with the same White House press pool we met on Friday outside the Oval, grinding through another event. I clock Steve in the distance, kicking on. Trump engages Pratt the minute he’s in the factory. The two billionaires exchange lavish compliments as they amble towards the gaggle of reporters. Presumably the box maker is explaining recycling to Trump as they go. Rubbish in, box out, cash in. The president then tracks towards where the journalists are corralled behind the fence, straining to get an iPhone snap for Twitter. He’s looking for Steve, the Trump whisperer, because he’s got exciting information to share. “So that’s 100% recycled paper into a really, fine finished product,” the president enthuses on the fence line. “It’s really amazing, Steve. They start off with …” Trump pauses delicately … “can I use the word ‘garbage’?” Pratt is entirely comfortable with the word. Pratt Industries, Ohio, is proudly euphemism-free. Trump picks up the story: “They start off with waste, garbage, and they end up building it into a – making it into really great cardboard and paper.” “A hundred per cent of the plant”. As I mentioned earlier, I’ve never seen Steve before these couple of brief encounters, he is a complete stranger to me, and what follows is pure speculation, but I’m going to hazard a guess that he knows what recycling is. I reckon Steve does know about it. Trump is another story. Possibly this impromptu recycling-for-dummies tutorial is just the president being performatively didactic, or perhaps he is inoculating himself from cable TV hysterics who might associate reuse with One World Government. Or perhaps this is the first time in his life he’s encountered recycling. Trump continues to roll this newfangled Pratt magic around in his mind, and engage journalists enthusiastically along the fence line. “That’s really some equipment. The finest equipment in the world. And more and more people are going this way. “Normally, you take down trees and you make the paper. In this case, Anthony does 90, 95% out of waste, out of garbage, and they make incredible final product through a very – through really a very – a really costly but efficient process.” He could be describing the interface between tycoons and politicians but let’s not be caustic or labour the metaphor. We need to continue with our story. Emboldened by this level of engagement from the president, one of the Australian journalists calls out: “Do you want more businessmen like Mr Pratt, Mr President?”. Trump is confused. Say it. (Implied, not stated: louder visiting freak, take two.) Say it. “Do you want more businessmen like Mr Pratt to invest in America like he has?” Trump narrows his eyes. “Yeah, well, we have some good ones. But this man is number one in Australia, they say.” Number one of course, being the highest Trump accolade. That and apex predator. Pratt returns the favour before we leave America. He tells the Australian newspaper Trump is going to win in the 2020 election. Lest this just appear guesswork, or another shovel load of obsequiousness, history shows that Pratt has a sharp eye. In the last presidential contest the billionaire box maker bet $100,000 on Trump to win against Hillary Clinton. Asked whether he’d make the same bet again, Pratt reports that he’s raised the stakes. There is now $2bn on the table – investments in new paper operations in the US. “I told the president we want to continue to invest and fulfil our pledge,” Pratt tells the paper. “It was very gracious of him to come to our Ohio plant opening. I was fortunate to spend some time with him. He was as gracious as ever.” Gracious indeed. As another wealthy entrepreneur, Malcolm Turnbull, was once fond of saying. What. A. Time. To. Be. Alive. By the time we roll out of Chicago – a whistle stop characterised by a serious foreign policy pivot from Morrison, and an unfortunate photo opportunity in front of a McDonald’s smart board that built a visual bridge to Engadine for people familiar with the infamous internet meme (let’s just leave it at that) – and on to New York, the drumbeat is cacophonous, literally and figuratively. It is leader’s week at the UN general assembly, and the area around the headquarters is locked down. The streets teem with protesters and delegates, and groups of Africans gather on Forty-fourth Street to drum and sing. The UNgeneral assembly circus drives New Yorkers bonkers, the streets are gridlocked and the eateries overflow, but the vibrancy of it is quite wonderful: the convivial murmur of languages on the east side of Midtown, the colour and style of the clothing, the downing of late-night whiskey amid animated conversation. Trump declares theatrically, with Nancy Pelosi closing in, during his address to the UN national assembly, that this is the time for patriots, not globalists. It’s a soundbite crafted for Breitbart or Fox News, potent with his rusted-ons, but a hollow slogan in the world of facts and evidence. Did I miss the bit of history where globalisation became optional? For what it’s worth, New York categorically ignores him. On the streets, in the stores, in the financial district, globalisation prevails. It’s not even a contest. Beyond the literal, the figurative drumbeat is for Trump. Impeachment is closing in on the president. Some commentators say he looked subdued at the UN, which would be a rare lapse in self-confidence. The mood at the start of the week in Washington was come and get me suckers. But I’m out of the presidential orbit now so I have no first-hand observation to report. Morrison, comprehensively overshadowed by movements in the tectonic plates of the major powers, ploughs on diligently with his UN program and seems unperturbed by the misfortune of his two mates, Boris Johnson and Trump, hitting some serious turbulence. If the prime minister had any regrets about taking hospitality from Trump and aligning Australia’s diplomatic language precisely with the president on some thorny geopolitical issues, he certainly didn’t show it. A certain defensiveness did creep in on climate change, though. Morrison wasn’t cranky but there were persistent pesky questions from the travelling media about Australia’s lack of policy ambition, and about his decision not to attend the UN climate summit on Monday. Even Trump called by. Why didn’t Morrison? There was the sound of prime ministerial teeth being gritted. Interestingly, Morrison’s speech to the UN general assembly, which was billed initially as being an address about practical environmentalism, not climate change, drifted back into climate. There was a significant chunk defending his government’s policies, and some umbrage at the media for feeding false narratives – not fake news, mind you, but stoking prejudicial sentiment. In New York we meet our final billionaire, Mike Cannon-Brookes. The final piece of my triptych, the next gen mover and shaker, moves in different circles to Pratt and Rinehart. MCB didn’t make the cut for the state dinner at the White House, evidently, but he made a bit of a splash at the UN. The Atlassian founder went to the climate summit to commit his company to a target of net zero emissions by no later than 2050. Cannon-Brookes nudged Morrison on Twitter: “Please give us a future we can believe in tomorrow. Inspire us. Lead us. Don’t bullshit us. I’m happy to help, as are millions of Aussies.” I meet Cannon-Brookes at the Flower Shop, a hipster bar on the Lower East Side. His minders invited us down for a beverage. Most of my colleagues are punctual but I’m late, because the traffic is terrible, and the bearded tech entrepreneur lobs late as well. There is an overwhelming smell of weed that eddies through the bar as we settle in, which I stress is not connected to anyone in our group or Atlassian’s. I don’t know who is responsible for this licentiousness and don’t intend to investigate, frankly – but it’s surreal, meeting a thirty-something billionaire in a bar as the bookend of this bonkers week, and having the bar reek of marijuana – that I find it hard to stop laughing at the unlikeliness of it all. It caps off the Through the Looking Glass sensation of the US odyssey. The evening is convivial and, unsurprisingly, there is much impassioned talk about climate change and energy policy and a fair sprinkling of acronyms – a bunch of Aussies jousting good naturedly about the future of the planet in a bar in Manhattan. I leave Cannon-Brookes downstairs shooting pool with a few stayers, settling in to welcome the dawn, and head uptown, clearing my head by walking up Forty-fifth Street as the dumpster trucks and the street sweepers move into high gear for the pre-dawn cleanse. I engage a cop at a checkpoint just to make sure I haven’t veered wildly off course in a desperate bid for oxygen. “The Roosevelt is just up here,” I inquire, “right?” The cop smiles and sips his coffee. “I’m from Brooklyn, m’am.” Support our independent journalism with a one-off or recurring contribution"

"A Swedish newspaper has announced it will stop taking advertising that promotes fossil fuel-based goods and services with immediate effect. The editor of the daily Dagens ETC said the decision was “crucial for our credibility”. He urged other media outlets to consider doing the same.  The ETC, which launched in 2014, is a daily paper and online newspaper. Its editor-in-chief, Andreas Gustavsson, said the decision was taken by the owner, the board, the marketing department and the 25 editors and reporters on its staff.  He said the decision would hit the paper’s finances. “But I am also convinced that this will prove to be a wise decision in the long term,” said Gustavsson. “I am very aware that the media industry is extremely tough and it is difficult to survive financially. However, the climate crisis affects every single one of us.” He added: “How far can journalism go when it is bankrolled by forces that have everything to gain from blocking large-scale action to address our climate crisis?” Dagens ETC, based in Stockholm, has about 10,000 daily subscribers and more than 60,000 unique readers a week, according to Gustavsson. Its funding comes from a mixture of reader subscriptions, advertising and the government support offered to papers across Sweden.  Gustavsson said the paper’s revenue from advertising amounted to more than 1,000,000 Swedish kronor (£85,000), of which 15-20% had previously been from advertisements they will now decline. The decision comes after the biggest mass climate protest in history took place around the world last Friday, with further demonstrations expected this Friday. The UN climate summit in New York met in an effort to inject urgency into governments’ pledge to restrict the rise in global temperatures to 1.5C above pre-industrial levels, as agreed under the 2015 Paris agreement. In May the activist group Extinction Rebellion wrote an open letter to advertisers and agencies urging them to use their powers to tackle the climate emergency. Some agencies responded this summer by setting up the Creatives for Climate movement, pledging to avoid working on fossil fuel briefs."

A recent news clipping on the research of an international climate scientist claimed rising temperatures during the other three seasons are actually cooling off winters in North America –all because of snowfalls in Siberia and an atmosphere pressure pattern in high latitudes called the Arctic Oscillation (AO).
The argument that is being made is that the recent warmer summers (due to global warming) are causing more negative Arctic Oscillation, which in turn causes colder winters in North America and Europe. This is totally opposite to what the IPCC predicted.
Here is what the actual abstract to an article called Arctic Warming, Increasing Snow Cover & Widespread Boreal Winter Cooling by Judah L. Cohen et al 2012 in the Environmental Research Letter said:
The most up to date consensus from global climate models predicts warming in the Northern Hemisphere (NH) high latitudes to middle latitudes during boreal winter. However, recent trends in observed NH winter surface temperatures diverge from these projections. For the last two decades, large-scale cooling trends have existed instead across large stretches of eastern North America and northern Eurasia. We argue that this unforeseen trend is probably not due to internal variability alone. Instead, evidence suggests that summer and autumn warming trends are concurrent with increases in high-latitude moisture and an increase in Eurasian snow cover, which dynamically induces large-scale wintertime cooling. Understanding this counterintuitive response to radiative warming of the climate system has the potential for improving climate predictions at seasonal and longer timescales.”
I like the words ”most up to date consensus from global warming models” and “recent trends in observed NH winter surface temperatures diverge from these projections”. In plain English the AGW scientists are finally admitting that even their latest climate models are wrong with respect to global warming. I give the above authors credit for finally admitting what most of us have known for some time.
Also the statement “For the last two decades, large-scale cooling trends have existed instead across large stretches of eastern North America and northern Eurasia “seems overstating the cooling. There has not been large-scale cooling for 2 decades, only the last 10 years in North America – as noted below-  and in Europe only the last 4-5 years.
As has been recently reported by this writer on this blog and at Anthony Watts on WUWT, the summers in both the contiguous US and Canada have not warmed but have actually cooled in US and the trend is quite flat in Canada over the last 10 years. Therefore warmer summers cannot be causing more negative AO and colder winters.
The colder winters are more likely due to changing spatial pattern of more cooler water in the North East Pacific than in the Central and North West Pacific Ocean, especially since 2007 (see PDO) and more recently the slow cooling of the Atlantic Ocean (see AMO) here.
While it is true that a negative AO can result in cooler winters, what causes the AO to cycle unpredictably is not yet clearly understood. Scientists have been unable to predict AO levels for more than a week or two. Whatever has been causing AO to cycle or to be negative, it has been causing this for at least a century and probably much longer – our records only go back to about 1899. This not a new phenomena caused by recent global warming. Below is a plot of winter AO provided by Jiaso.Washington.edu for the years 1899-2002.

Final Comments
It would appear that the Winter AO Index has a significant impact on global winter temperatures. During recent two 30 year global warming phases there were more positive (warm) AO winters than negative (cold) AO winters and almost twice as many. During 30 year global cooling phases, there are more negative AO winters than positive AO winters and about 50% more. During individual peak warm decades (1920s and 1990s) there were 2 to 4 times as many positive AO winters as negative AO winters. During individual peak cooling decades [1940s, 1950’s and 1960s, there were 50% more negative AO winters.
Clearly the recent negative AO winters are not new phenomena caused by warmer summers due to global warming but is a continuing natural climate process that has been ongoing for centuries. A recent extreme cold spell in Canada during January 2012 was happening with mostly positive AO, so we have a lot to understand about our climate. There seems to be no end to some climate scientists trying to tie every climate phenomena, however small or varied, to global warming.

"Jonathan Safran Foer published Eating Animals in 2009. I didn’t read it until 2015, because I had a feeling that it would be persuasive and I would have to stop eating meat, which I found delicious, especially buttery, white-bread ham sandwiches and chicken shish kebabs. It took a long time before I was ready to have my last pepperoni pizza, but in choosing to pick up a book that I knew laid out the horrors of mass meat production, it was clear that I was almost there. And when I’d finished reading it, I simply stopped eating meat. The trade-off no longer seemed worth it. Safran Foer now aims to repeat that trick with We Are the Weather: Saving the Planet Begins at Breakfast. Rather than focusing on the grotesque scale and inhumane practices of factory farming, he talks about the environmental impact of meat and dairy and offers practical suggestions for reducing our consumption of animal products instead. We hear again and again that in the US and the UK, to have any hope of slowing the climate emergency, we need to cut down on meat by 90% and dairy by 60%. Safran Foer’s idea is that we eat meat and dairy only in the evening. Easy.  Last week, though, steak fans everywhere were excited by a new study that concluded there was insufficient evidence that red meat is bad for our health. The problem is that, at this stage, it’s not really about us: cows are beautiful creatures and when farmed en masse to meet our enormous appetites, their methane-filled burps (not farts, contrary to popular belief) are awful for the planet. Even so, it seemed to stand as symbolic green light for filling one’s boots at the bovine buffet. The hunger for even a hint of permission shows that there is a long way to go. Safran Foer’s new approach, measured and moderate, gives me hope. I know people who won’t read Eating Animals, because they simply like meat too much. This is stealthier. Guilt and shame are not effective tactics for changing anyone’s minds, in any field, and neither is absolute rigidity. He admits that, even after Eating Animals, he craved meat and ate burgers at airports, because they were comforting and easy. He knows this makes him sound like a hypocrite, but that kind of honesty is realistic. The vegan accounts I follow on Instagram are funny and open to people who are interested in what vegans are doing, even if they aren’t doing it themselves. They are not didactic, they are not judgmental, and those qualities, rather than shame, offer the best chance of the shift in habits that we need. It has been a long, arid, laughter-free 18 months without it, but at last Dear Joan and Jericha is back. The Vicki Pepperdine and Julia Davis comedy has the pair playing terrible agony aunts who shouldn’t be allowed anywhere near a problem, even the problems as awful as the gruesome ones they tackle. It’s recorded in Davis’s kitchen and improvised, which gives the added bonus of trying to work out which of them is trying not to laugh and who is egging the other on. Friends are already quoting this new episode to one another, as they did with the first season, and it makes Davis’s recent series Sally4Ever look positively PG. However, as a podcast, it is totally unfit for podcast purposes. I usually listen to them when I’m out walking or on public transport. After the last season, I realised I had to clear the decks for this one and put it on only in private. The sight of me snorting uncontrollably in the park is dangerously close to my own version of Joker, only instead of getting beaten up in an alley, I’ll have been bludgeoned with outrageously filthy gags. It should come with a warning: only suitable for listening in the safety of one’s home. As always, literary feuds prove to be as gripping and action-packed as any Real Housewives franchise, rap beef or tabloid-fuelling celebrity spat. Last week, John le Carré found himself was on the receiving end of sharp words from the former head of MI6, Sir Richard Dearlove. “He is so corrosive in his view of MI6 that most professional Secret Intelligence Service officers are pretty angry with him,” Dearlove told the Cliveden literary festival, explaining that he found Le Carré’s work to be nihilistic and cynical. “Intelligence organisations are based on trust between colleagues. His books are exclusively about betrayal.” Dearlove follows Metropolitan police commissioner Cressida Dick in grumbling that an imaginary version of something invented by a writer with the purpose of entertaining people lacks realism. For her, police corruption in Line of Duty was an outrage; for Dearlove, it’s the idea that spies might betray one another. I look forward to a wave of dramatically inert stories about well-behaved police officers and trusting spies working together pleasantly and without event. The wait, I’m sure, will be more than worth it. Still, it gave Le Carré the opportunity to respond with fantastic acidity. Writing in the Times, he said he doubted that senior professional intelligence officers were angry with him, because at least a couple of them had told him they were not. He then went for the jugular, criticising Dearlove’s role in the Iraq war, reminding readers that “raw, single-source, unchecked MI6 intelligence was being passed to Tony Blair, and presumably to George Bush as well, on a regular basis. And that Sir Richard was instrumental in causing this to happen.” And then, in a sign-off so tart that it would have been right at home on RuPaul’s Drag Race, he thanked Dearlove for all the extra publicity. Gorgeous. • Rebecca Nicholson is an Observer columnist"

Speaking of falling standards, Al Gore and the IPCC got a Nobel Peace Prize for a crackpot movie and flawed climate reports respectively. So Schellnhuber is now in good company. Who is next? James Hansen?

"One of Britain’s and northern Europe’s rarest and most elusive mammals has been discovered living in the east of England for the first time in 115 years. The return to Kent of the greater horseshoe bat has delighted and astounded conservationists, who are now examining whether climate change is shifting the species’ range. The bat is normally found only in Wales and the west of England.  This secretive, buff-coloured, creature (Rhinolophus ferrumequinum) is one of Britain’s biggest bats. It frequently evades and challenges pursuers, fluttering unseen through shadows and hiding underground in caves, tunnels and occasionally buildings. The animal hunts and navigates by screaming out high-frequency echolocation whistles through flaps on its horseshoe-shaped noseleaf, but the calls are beyond the human hearing range. The bat often navigates in silence or changes the shape, width and direction of its sonic beam, along with the intensity of the pulse, which means ecologists searching for it can easily miss it. The creature’s distinctive, alien-like, ultrasonic warbling signals were recorded at two locations near the coast during May and June by two separate teams of bat ecologists. Joe Nunez-Mino, spokesperson for the Bat Conservation Trust, confirmed that the unusual recordings had been verified by national experts. “It is possible that an individual bat was blown off course or has travelled over from France, or that a bat has dispersed across the UK from strongholds in the west of England or Wales. “It is also possible that the species is now able to expand its range into Kent due to climatic changes. The habitats in the area that the recordings were made are not dissimilar to those in its western strongholds.” No one has yet found the bats’ roost, and it’s not known whether this is a breeding population or how they arrived. These bats do not typically venture beyond a range of about three to 20 miles from a roost, and Britain’s 12 known isolated greater horseshoe colonies and 35 breeding roosts are all much further west. The news is a further sign that the greater horseshoe’s fortunes are turning round. Britain has lost more than 90% of this bat’s population and half its range over the last 100 years; numbers have fallen from an estimated 300,000 individuals. However, the Mammal Society says the animal’s numbers have roughly doubled in the last 10 years, from an estimated 6,500 to about 13,000 individuals. Recent evidence suggests climate change is driving up the numbers of greater horseshoes, bringing more insects in warmer springs, earlier bat births, spring rainfall and better temperatures when the animals emerge from hibernation. The Bat Conservation Trust says good farm and landscape management can mean huge potential for greater horseshoes. They need woodland, a lack of light pollution, pesticide-free grazed pasture with chemical-free dung harbouring dung beetles, as well as moths, cockchafers and flies, plus tall continuous hedgerows that are not trimmed for up to 10 years.

Share this...FacebookTwitterGerman solar skeptic website SOLARKRITIK.DE here provides the background on the rundown, weed-covered solar facility in former communist (and now “green”) East Germany, which I presented in my last post here.

Solar panel field near Markranstaedt, Germany. Photo taken by Prof. Knut Löschke on June 26, 2011. Source: http://www.eike-klima-energie.eu/
It’s much worse than we thought. The story behind the above photo and the project itself appears here at the online Leipziger Volkszeitung newspaper. The facility is sprawled over an area of 20 acres. The Leipziger Volkszeitung newspaper wrote just before the facility went into operation:
‘The park is finally realized,’ beams mayor Carina Radon (CDU) nowadays, and praised the 7.5 million Euro investment. 36,300 modules will be installed in the weeks ahead. It will generate an annual amount of 2.7 million kilowatt-hours. The facility will produce a peak amount of 2722 kilowatts.
Wow! With that kind of performance, you’d think the facility would be well-maintained so that it could continue to generate cash – and so save the planet. Letting such investments go to hell is usually the last thing one does with a money making machine like that. The Leipziger Volkszeitung article writes:
The solar park saves the environment an emission of 34,500 tons of CO2 and one expects it will be in operation 20 years.”
20 years? As the date of the article shows, the park was set up in December, 2009 – much less than two years ago. Now it is already overgrown with weeds and on the verge of being useless. Your subsidies at work, folks. The green economy – Germany’s job engine!

This photo also shows that the solar park in no way delivers electricity maintenance-free, as the green lobby likes to claim.
The author of the photo provided the following information along with the photo:
‘A rather large, obviously run down facility, which as one sees is overgrown everywhere. I took this photo on June 25, 2011 shortly before 6 pm as I happened to be driving by (and concerning our ‘renewable’ energy world, it certainly opened my eyes). Exect location: Markranstädt, intersection of Schkeuditzer Str. / Nordstraße.’
It goes to show you that nature cannot be controlled by man. They can’t even get weeds under control, yet they would have us believe they can regulate the climate? In my view, the above facility borders on criminal neglect.
Meanwhile Europe is planning a $600 billion monster solar facility in the SAHARA called Desertec. At least there it won’t have to worry too much about weeds. But what about dust storms, wind and other elements?
A clue of what can happen is provided by Solarkritik.de, which shows us a solar plant on top of an elementary school at Haltern-Flaesheim, Germany taken on 25 April 2011.

The panels on the above pictured elementary school are coated with a heavy layer of pollen and dust. I guess there’s a lesson here for school kids.
And here is another beauty of a solar facility in northern Germany. This is what they really look like after 20 years, photo from Solarkritik.de. Take a look at its condition. Everywhere cells are missing. Now it is out there decaying and its dangerous elements are likely leaking and poisoning the ground by now. Photovoltaic-park from 1989.

"Tens of thousands of children and adults in New Zealand have stopped work and school on Friday to take part in the country’s third climate strike, billed as the biggest yet and the first display of “intergenerational” action. More than 40 towns around the country were holding marches with 260 businesses involved, including most of the country’s tertiary institutions. New Zealand’s strike was being held a week later than hundreds of thousands took to the streets in other parts of the world, including Australia, Britain and the US, because some high school students had exams last Friday. A open-letter signed by 11,000 New Zealanders was delivered to parliament on Friday morning calling on the government to declare a climate emergency – following the lead of numerous councils around the country. “Our representatives need to show us meaningful and immediate action that safeguards our futures on this planet,” School Strike 4 Climate national coordinator Raven Maeder said. “Nothing else will matter if we cannot look after the Earth for current and future generations. This is our home.” North Island organiser Sophie Handford, 18, told RNZ she hoped 50,000 people would march. “There’s way too much at stake to let it pass by. We’ll be at the doors of parliament many more times until we see the action that is necessary.” The prime minister, Jacinda Ardern, has taken a leading role on the global stage in the fight against the climate crisis, calling it her generation’s “nuclear-free moment”. Look at this massive wave of people in Dunedin, New Zealand! #ClimateStrike pic.twitter.com/8hFMAvRTGf In the keynote address of the Climate Change Summit in New York, Ardern took a characteristically optimistic tone, saying pessimism led to apathy. “You may well argue that, based on our current trajectory, now is not the time for optimism,” Ardern said. “But if we only talk about the loss of glacier mass or sea level rises we run the risk of a society that believes all is lost and that it is simply too late … it is not”. Under Ardern’s leadership New Zealand has set a goal of making the country zero carbon by 2050. Christchurch, NZ. #FridaysForFuture #ClimateStrike https://t.co/k6252xPI2y In New York on Wednesday night she announced climate trade initiative that would remove tariffs on green technology and cut fossil fuel subsidies. It was announced along with leaders from Fiji, Iceland, Norway and Costa Rica at the United Nations, with formal talks expected to begin next year, with the hope of eventually achieving treaty status. “There’s an urgent and critical need for increased global action if we are to limit global warming to 1.5C above pre-industrial levels,” said Ardern. She added: “The case for using trade rules to eliminate fossil fuel subsidies is particularly compelling.” However, Ardern was criticised this week for failing to raise the topic of climate change in her first bilateral meeting with Donald Trump. New Zealand lags behind many other OECD countries in basic climate-friendly action such as recycling and dependence on petrol and diesel vehicles."

In the news Poland is holding firm against all the EU-climate rescue nonsense. According to the German site http://klima-der-gerechtigkeit.de/ (Climate of Justice!), climate protection is going to be increasingly problematic with Poland, who are now suing the EU Commission because of the EU’s conditions that will mean charging emitters for rights to emit greenhouse gases. After 2013, companies will have to pay for certificates. 95% of Poland’s electricity is generated using coal, and the country plans to build an additional 13 coal-fired power plants in the future, READ HERE, which writes:
Its heavy dependence on coal for electricity production is highlighted by a plan to build 13 new coal-fired power plants, for which the country obtained free “carbon permits” from the European Commission the day before it assumed the Presidency. ClientEarth, an environmental NGO, is reportedly attempting to bring the matter to court, arguing that such free allocations under the EU-ETS are not legal.”
Let’s hope Poland sticks to its guns and doesn’t cave in to the green suicide energy-pact that is being rammed through in Europe.

Share this...FacebookTwitterIt appears the tactics of Stefan Rahmstorf are truly beginning to catch up with him. What goes around, comes around.H/t: Lubos Motl
Der Spiegel today has a story on IPCC bigwig and ultra-alarmist Stefan Rahmstorf, who is also a lead scientist at the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research and elite member of the Hockey Team. For those of you who may not recall, Rahmstorf is the outlier oceanographer that projects a sea level rise of about 1.4 meters, even when the rest the world, including real observations, all point to something that is about 1/7 of that.
It’s a bit late at night here and so the main points only. Der Spiegel starts:
Renown climate scientist and German government advisor Stefan Rahmstorf was found guilty of a blog attack against a journalist.  According to the opinion of a state court, he made untruthful assertions. Also the ‘Frankfurter Rundschau’ has come under fire.”
A State Court says he’s guilty of making untruthful assertions. Interpret that how you wish. The Frankfurter Rundschau is a sort of daily that former East German comrades lean towards. On the Rahmstorf ruling by the court, we reported about it here.
To make a long story short, journalist Irene Meichsner wrote a critical report about the IPCC, which appeared in the Frankfurter Rundschau daily, to which Rahmstorf reacted quite nastily. He asserted at his blog that the journalist had been dishonest, sloppy, had never read the IPCC report, and that she even lifted text from another source (Richard North and Jonathan Leake). For a journalist, such accusations are of course career threatening and thus deadly serious.
Meichsner didn’t stand for it, took the case to court, and won.
The Original text of the Court Judgement is here.
That should have been the end of it but, according to Der Spiegel, the PIK (Rahmstorf ‘s employer) has gotten into the fray. The PIK you’ll recall is run by German masterplanner Hans-Joachim Schellnhuber, who chairs the WBGU and directly advises Chancellor Angela Merkel. If you ever wondered where Merkel comes up with all these brilliant climate policy ideas, e.g. like the 2°C warming limit, then look no further.
Der Spiegel tried to contact Rahmstorf directly for comment on the Cologne State Court ruling, but received only a statement from the PIK which attempted to play down the incident. The statement was also posted at the PIK site. According to Der Spiegel the statement claimed:
‘Mistakes can happen.’ This involves ‘interpretation questions’ and ‘misunderstandings’.”
and that:



<!--
google_ad_client = ""ca-pub-3545577860068042"";

google_ad_slot = ""6412247007"";

google_ad_height = 200;
//-->




“The PIK asks his colleagues to understand that it is the duty of a scientist “to inform the public about errors”.
Der Spiegel, citing the Cologne Court Ruling”, calls the PIK published statement:
An amazing interpretation”.
The State Court ruling against Rahmstorf is a cease and desist order that requires Rahmstorf to refrain from making the false assertions about the journalist. Yet at the PIK website the statement (on behalf of Rahmstorf?) again was clearly implying there had been “errors” in Meichsner’s report when in fact there weren’t. Talk about defying a court order! According to Der Spiegel, the PIK has since revised the text at its site. Obviously it’s not the journalist Meichsner that’s sloppy and loose with the facts. The Court was very clear on that.
Der Spiegel reminds readers that this is not the first time that Rahmstorf has maliciously taken on people who do not share his opinion and speak out.
Time and again he has not only gone after journalists, but also after scientists who have openly expressed views that Rahmstorf didn’t like.”
Der Spiegel cites the Franfurter Rundschau daily as an example, who according to Der Spiegel:”played an unusual part in the affair. The editors at FR distanced themselves from Meichsers critical piece two months after they had published it” after Rahmstorf had intervened and then published a full two-page story on how “the IPCC had been the target of an awkward campaign.” In plain English, the FR went down on its knees before a group of elite scientists.
That is disturbing. Der Spiegel was unable to obtain any comment from the FR.

// ]]&gt;Hans von Storch of the Helmholtz Center in Geesthacht Germany was also once a target of Rahmstorf. According to Der Spiegel, today he keeps a copy of the original State Court Ruling up at his private website.
At his blog Rahmstorf in the meantime gripes that “in the classical media you no longer have any control over the end product.”
The ice under Rahmstorf feet is getting awfully thin, and it’s not because of global warming.

"Scott Morrison has defended Barnaby Joyce’s performance as his drought envoy, saying he was not asked to “write a book”, but provide “candid feedback” and any criticism was from people caught up in “semantics”. Morrison, who hopped off the plane from the United States following his official visit and on to another one to visit a drought-stricken Queensland community to announce a further $100m in drought funding, said Joyce had done his job and the issue had been “over-analysed”.  “Well Barnaby, when I appointed him to this role, provided constant reports I mean, I didn’t ask him to write a book, I asked him to give us some advice on what he was hearing from farmers and that is what he did, and he did that through quite a bit of correspondence with me, and regular meetings with me and he presented all of that to cabinet,” he said, while batting away flies in Dalby. “And that was his job. It wasn’t supposed to be an author and a publisher, it was candid feedback from drought-affected communities around the country, and he did his job and he did it well and I thank him and so I think people are getting a bit caught up in the semantics of a final report. “There were many reports, I can assure you of that, as there was from the national co-ordinator general, and we are working our way through that for a response to his suggestions as well. So I think people have over analysed that issue.” According to his own travel records, Joyce spent less than three weeks on the ground in drought-affected communities outside his own electorate while engaged as the prime minister’s special envoy on drought, including charging tax payers $2,600 for a charter flight to open a machinery field day, 300km from Melbourne. After David Littleproud confirmed he could not provide the parliament with Joyce’s report, as requested by Labor, as “he did not prepare a final report, and as such, no document exists,” the opposition went on the attack, declaring Joyce’s role to be a farce. Joyce angrily defended his work, and said he had sent regular text messages to the prime minister reporting what he had found. That seemed to surprise Morrison, who responded to a journalist’s question asking about the text messages with “well, you said text message, not me, I said he wrote to us, he presented reports . ..” before pivoting when told it was Joyce who had referred to text messages. “Well he did,” Morrison said, barely skipping a beat. “And Barnaby is a master of all forms of communication. He spoke to me on the phone, he spoke to me in my office, he presented to cabinet, he wrote me letters about this issue, which is what I asked him to do, so it was a pretty comprehensive set of advice that we received, and I was happy to receive it and it has informed much of what we have done.” Morrison would not say when any information on what Joyce reported would be provided, saying it was part of the normal processes of any other cabinet document. He said the parts of the additional drought package announced on Friday were crafted following Joyce’s advice, including the extension of the drought communities program, and additional funding for rural financial councillors and addressing weeds and pests, adding “I would say he was pretty optimal”. The additional drought funding was timed for Morrison’s arrival back in the country, with the prime minister having made reference to his Queensland trip in his final press conference in the US, in response to a question about what he had learnt about America during his visit. The PM was asked today what the most surprising part of his time in the US was and he answered by saying he is going to visit drought affected farmers In Australia ASAP. pic.twitter.com/l41DSt8YTZ Just over half of the $100m package will go to the Farm Household Allowance, which has been subjected to incremental administrative changes since Littleproud took hold of the portfolio governing it. The latest changes aim to continue to simplify the process, which enables assistance to be paid to eligible farmers, at the Newstart rate. Another $33m of the latest package will extend the drought community support initiative, which sees charities, including St Vincent de Paul and the Salvation Army, provide emergency financial support of up to $3,000 to eligible farmers. Charities are often used during natural disasters to administer funds, to ensure the money is provided as quickly as possible. The number of local government areas able to access federal government assistance for infrastructure, including for water, as well as provide mental health support for residents, was also increased. Anthony Albanese said while the latest support from the government would be welcomed by communities it was “too little, too late”, from Morrison. “He cut $3.9bn from the Building Australia Fund, and now he’s announcing that $100m of that $3.9bn is to be brought forward,” Albanese said. “We said at the time that [drought] legislation was being debated … that the $100m per year should not start in a year’s time. It’s not like the drought has just happened, it has been here for years, under this government’s watch and this is too little too late. But we welcome any assistance for our farming community. They’re doing it tough and it’s about time the government recognise that and act.” The National Farmers’ Foundation did welcome the government’s announcement, but said communities needed a “new approach”, repeating its calls for a national drought policy. “We need a comprehensive and enduring national approach to drought that focuses on preparedness and resilience measures. We need an approach that mandates the assessment of the effectiveness of drought measures and allows for improvements when measures fall short,” NFF head Tony Mahar said.“It’s absolutely crucial that we have a coordinated approach that ensures all voices are heard and that the responsibility of managing drought is shared across government, industry and community.” "
"More than 20 people were arrested by police in New York City’s financial district after Extinction Rebellion climate protesters poured fake blood over the famous Charging Bull statue, a symbol of American capitalist might. The protesters launched a wave of disruptive protests in the city on Monday. A smaller number of arrests were made at a “die in” outside New York’s stock exchange, with protesters subsequently blocking a nearby road to traffic. Protests are also taking place in other US cities, including Washington DC and Chicago, as part of a global week of action by the UK-founded activist group, which is seeking to make its first major mark in America. Extinction Rebellion organizers expect several thousand people will congregate in New York’s Washington Square Park for a week of protests and speeches that are expected to involve actions that will prompt further arrests. “There will be broad disruption of business as usual,” said a New York-based Extinction Rebellion spokesman. “Frankly we don’t have time to wait for an opportune moment. Climate breakdown is under way and we can’t afford to wait.” Extinction Rebellion has a philosophy of nonviolent direct action aimed at pushing governments to confront the climate crisis. A key demand is that planet-warming carbon dioxide emissions are reduced to net zero within six years. The activist network has gained a high profile in the UK, following successful attempts to shut down parts of central London. Activists are hoping for a similar impact in the US, despite concerns over a more aggressive style of policing and an unsympathetic federal government, led by Donald Trump, that actively promotes fossil fuels and is regularly derisive of climate science. “We need to account for the damage caused by fossil fuels because we have the chance of losing it all,” said Jim Navarre, a protestor from New York’s Long Island who help up a sign reading “You can’t comb over climate change” with a picture of Trump’s hair atop the globe. Yana Landowne, also from New York, said she was inspired to join the protests by British friends. “I see this as a movement I need to get behind, I realized I had to bring my whole being to this movement,” she said. The stock exchange protest featured a mock funeral with people strewn on the ground, covered in blood. Tombstones mentioning hurricanes and fires made worse by the climate crisis were held aloft, along with a coffin with the words “Our future” written on the side. A New Orleans-style funereal band played for the several hundred protestors. “It’s a powerful message,” Landowne said. “But more than death I fear living amongst the terror of people killing each other for water and food.”"

Share this...FacebookTwitterBitter conflict with climate skeptics has moved to the newspapers and media. Earlier this year, German science review magazine WPK Quarterly published a report here on how one scientist dealt with a skeptic journalist, hat-tip here and here.
It’s front page cover bears a full page photo of Stefan Rahmstorf along with the headline:

Independent Scientist or Poltical Agitator?
 A journalist defends herself against the malice of Stefan Rahmstorf”

The feature story, written by Markus Lehmkuhl, starts on page 4 and is titled:

Ideology and Climate Change or:
 How to shut up journalists
A freelance journalist becomes a target of of renown climate scientist Stefan Rahmstorf, who in the fight for the alleged truth doesn’t hold back using personal defamation.”

Stefan Rahmstorf of the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research (PIK) is an IPCC lead author, advisor on Hans Schellnhuber’s WBGU, and one of Germany’s most influential climate scientists. Today it is widely known that journalists and scientists who express doubt over man-made climate change or criticism over the science and the IPCC often find themselves attacked by the Potsdam professor via the press or his Internet blog.
For German science journalist Irene Meichsner, it was in the wake of Climategate when she penned an unflattering piece about the IPCC and the slew of errors and false assumptions in its Fourt Assessment Report. Her story was published on February 8, 2010, in two German dailies: the Kölner Stadtsanzeiger (KStA) and the Frankfurter Rundschau (FR). Sticking to the facts, Meichsner’s damning piece cast the IPCC’s credibility into serious doubt.
Rahmstorf, who acts as sort of a gatekeeper and watchdog when it comes to guarding the global warming hypothesis and the institutes that propagate it, responded by publishing 2 pieces at his blog, the first on 20 February and the second on 26 April 2010. He also had a letter published at the FR on March 25, 2010, where he called the accusations made in Meichsner’s story false and made up. He attacked Meischsner, implying that she played loose with the facts, and that she had even lifted part of her text from skeptic blogs.
Rahmstorf even convinced the FR to publish a 2-page retraction on April 30, 2010, which, according to the WPK Quarterly, claimed that Meichsner’s accusations aimed at the IPCC were “part of a campaign by skeptics” designed “to discredit the IPCC”.
According to the WPK, Rahmstorf wrote in his February 20 blog piece that Meichsner’s story represented:
…a media scandal where a few journalists mislead the public with completely exaggerated or freely made up pseudo-scandals. Too many among them are naive and go along without seeing through the farce.”
Rahmstorf also aimed harsh words at the journalist’s integrity and credibility, suggesting that she never bothered to read the IPCC report and that she did things that never happened. For example, the WPK Quarterly writes:



<!--

google_ad_height = 200;
//-->




He accused her of uncritically copying text from [Richard] North and [Jonathan] Leake.”
As credibility and reputation are especially important for the survival of a free-lance journalist, and based on that she had stuck to the facts in her article, Meichsner felt Rahmstorf had obviously ventured too far in his response to her story, and so took the matter to court demanding that Rahmstorf be forced to cease and desist making the untrue claims.
So what judgement did the State Court in Cologne hand down? WPK Quarterly provides that (my English legal translation – you’ll forgive me for not being a lawyer):

In the name of the People, 9 February of this year,
a judgement was issued and entails: The Defendant is
judged by the 28th Civil Chamber of the State Court
of Cologne “to (…) cease and desist from
arousing the impression that
a) the Plaintiff copied from bloggers Richard
North and journalist Jonathan Leake;
b) the Plaintiff had the defendent
informed through the editorial board of
the Frankfurter Rundschau that he should
remove the name of the Plaintiff from the
blog story of the Defendant ‘FR Retracts
Article Against IPCC’ and to name only
the Frankfurter Rundschau. Furthermore,
the Defendant must pay the plaintiff
511.58 euro plus interest and bear
two thirds of the costs of the legal dispute.
The Chamber determined that the grounds
were untrue allegation of facts that
violated her personal rights.”

WPK Quarterly wrote at length about this story and featured it in its up-front editorial, deeming the overall case merits special attention because:
“…a free journalist was able to successfully defend herself against the malice that a renown scientist who had dumped on her.”
Although Rahmstorf lost in court, he was able to chalk up an off-court victory. When asked if she would report more on climate change, the WPK writes:
For now she has had enough of climate science. She doesn’t write about it any more.”
Indeed it’s not a topic for those with thin skin and people who can’t afford to put their careers on the line. Expressing skepticism over a politically correct issue in Germany indeed leads to malicious attacks. Like the old saying goes: Sometimes it’s much more dangerous to speak up against wrongdoing than it is to commit it.

"Environmental activists from around Britain are converging on Westminster on Monday morning in an attempt to “shut down” the heart of government with two weeks of disruptive protests. Extinction Rebellion (XR) had earlier said its members are planning to blockade “every single road” into the central London district and plan to maintain the protests for at least 14 days, or until their demands are met.  Each site will be taken by groups of activists from different regions of the UK or with different political priorities. Activists started to stop traffic from around 9am. Planned sites around parliament included Trafalgar Square, Horse Guards Parade, the Mall, Victoria Street, and Westminster and Vauxhall bridges, among others. Throughout the week activists plan to take action around Westminster at government departments, to blockade Smithfield market, then later move on to London City airport, where they intend to stage a three-day protest. However, even senior members of XR say they do not know the full scale or extent of intended protests as many are being organised autonomously. Independent solidarity actions under the banner of international XR groups are also expected in about 60 cities around the world. XR UK claims to have recruited five times as many activists as during the last major protests in April, when more than 1,100 were arrested at blockades of four major London sites that lasted about a week. Metropolitan police commanders – after coming under fire for not ending those protests sooner – have said they are planning to be more proactive and agile in their response. Specialist police teams have been drafted in from around the country to remove protesters who try to lock or glue themselves in place. However, the activists believe their decentralised command structures and weight of numbers will overwhelm the police response. “Everyone will be like water and move to more disruptive locations if [police] don’t let them take the sites,” one told the Guardian. Activists have also been instructed to refuse bail when arrested, in the hope they can fill up all of the Met’s holding cells and prevent police from making more arrests. On Saturday, officers from the force’s territorial support group raided a building in south London and seized equipment that activists had planned to use. Seven women and three men were arrested for conspiracy to cause a public nuisance Officers used a battering ram to force their way in. However, a source within XR said that while officers were breaking in through the front door, activists were smuggling “a whole pile of stuff” out of the back."
"Young environmental activists in Italy are planning to miss school as thousands join climate crisis protests in major cities on Friday. Some 475,000 people took part in the first global climate strike in Italy on 15 March and a similar number are expected to join the latest demonstrations in cities including Rome, Milan, Turin, Florence, Naples, Bologna and Bari. But only if they are allowed to skip school. Earlier this week the education minister, Lorenzo Fioramonti, urged schools to consider as “justified” the absence of children taking part in the mobilisation against the climate emergency. He said on Facebook the climate strike was “essential” for students’ future, which was “threatened by environmental devastation and an unsustainable economic growth model”. However, many schools are only obliging after receiving a letter requesting permission from parents and if the child has maintained good attendance throughout the year. David Wicker, a representative of the Turin branch of Fridays for Future Italia, is planning to miss school regardless. Despite the high expected turnout, he worries that environmental issues are not yet a major concern for children and adults alike. “I would urge adults to join the movement too,” he said. “Unfortunately, it is not recognised as an official strike by labour unions. One day off work won’t change your career but it will change your future.” It comes as world leaders wrap up the UN climate action summit in New York. The Italian prime minister, Giuseppe Conte, urged his counterparts against “indifference” as news emerged that a massive portion of a Mont Blanc glacier was in danger of collapse. “It must shake us all and force us to mobilise,” he said. Conte promised to make environmental action a priority in a speech before the new left-leaning government, a coalition of the Five Star Movement (M5S) and Democratic party, was voted into power earlier this month. Although M5S had long prioritised the environment in its campaigning, the subject appeared to take a backseat during the party’s 14-month coalition with the far-right League. Sergio Costa, an M5S politician who kept his role as environment minister in the new alliance, has been more proactive, saying in New York this week that “courageous and revolutionary” policies were needed. The ministry is drafting a range of measures, including giving shoppers a 20% discount on supermarket goods that are sold loose in an attempt to cut back on plastic waste. Some 2.2m tonnes of plastic wrapping is discarded in Italy each year and in 2016 less than half of that was recycled, according to WWF figures. Pollution is also a major issue, especially in Italy’s northern cities. And while Italy’s greenhouse gas emissions have been decreasing over the past decade, the country was criticised this year by the European Climate Foundation for failing to provide an adequate plan to further reduce emissions and dependency on fossil fuels. “We hope the new government recognises the climate emergency and declares it so at the summit,” said Wicker. “We want them to divest in fossil fuels and invest in green energy resources, while improving public transport and make it more affordable.” The biggest climate strike in history took place last Friday, with several million people across an estimated 185 countries taking part. More than 2,400 separate strikes are expected globally on Friday, according to the group Fridays For Future. As well as Italy, especially large turnouts are expected in India, New Zealand, Sweden and the US."

Here’s another “glittering jewel of colossal science ignorance” at the German online Frankfurter Neue Presse. It is titled: Experiments Show Hesse’s Climate in the Future. Hesse (in German: Hessen) is a state in Central Germany, which puts it in the middle of Europe. Its largest city is Frankfurt.
Scientists of the University of Gießen and the State Department for Environment and Geology (HLUG), also in the state of Hesse, studied jointly at the Environmental Observation and Climate Impact Station, whatever the hell that is.
In a nutshell, a bunch of obviously misguided scientists and politicians, with lots of taxpayer money to waste, got together and pumped a bunch of CO2 over a 4.5 hectare plot of land for years to see how the plants there would react.
Now, with the results, they think can deduce the future climate of the planet. Yes, things really have gotten that bad. By now I’m sure you are all just dying to hear the results. Here they are, reports the Frankfurter Neue Presse (drumroll):

They presented some of their results on Thursday. Hard times are coming for fruit trees and Riesling wine. ‘It’s going to get warmer, the summers drier and the winters wetter’, says HLUG President Thomas Schmid. ‘In South Hesse we are going to have Mediterranean conditions by the end of the century.’ The Riesling grape, which doesn’t like it so warm, could get problems under certain circumstances, so could fruit tress. According to the findings from the scientists, the blossoms will be earlier and earlier. Nighttime frost will then have a greater chance of destroying the fruit blossoms and thus the fruit itself.”
More warming, more frosts. That’s logical. Hesse Minister of Environment Lucia Puttrich (Conservative Party) in Linden said:
The project opens a window to the future.”
That’s not a window that you are looking through, Madam. It’s a hallucination – one induced by being all drugged up in Green religion and junkie science. How about getting an education? It’s the only known cure against such chronic hallucinations. I’m doing all I can to hold back with the words.
How much worse can all the madness possibly get? Truly the Modern Dark Ages have befallen Europe once again.

Share this...FacebookTwitterI really hate doing this, because I know that the poor scientist will probably be summoned to some office somewhere for an earful, or just suddenly disappear in some big ice crevice. We all know that in Germany terrible things happen to climate scientists (and journalists) and who don’t say the right things.
Our friends at here at Science Skeptical bring us this clip, which is a snippet from a report that appeared on NDR German public TV last Friday evening.

In the clip Prof. Heinrich Miller is working down at the Antarctic Neumayer III station and is interviewed by NDR. Miller is deputy director of the Alfred Wegener Institute (AWI) in Bremerhaven and has been researching the Arctic and Antarctic for decades. He’s a true old hat of polar research who really knows what he’s talking about. Science Skeptical writes:
There’s hardly any other climate scientist that knows the polar regions as well and as long as Miller does.”
In the above clip, NDR asks Miller about the trend in Antarctica and what climate-related changes have been noticed? Miller says (emphasis added):
Here almost nothing has changed. At least not near the surface. The average annual tempertures have remained the same. There are of course large fluctuations from year to year. If anything over the last 30 years we have a slight cooling trend. And this flies in the face of what is always immediately claimed: ‘The climate is warming and the Antarctic is melting’.”
There it is, right from the horse’s mouth, from someone who really knows: Antarctica is cooling.

Share this...FacebookTwitterQuaternary Science Reviews has published a new paper: Combined dendro-documentary evidence of Central European hydroclimatic springtime extremes over the last millennium by authors Ulf Büntgen et al.
Photo credit: Hannes Grobe/AWI
See abstract here.
Anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions and associated effects on the Earth’s climate system are supposed to be causing more frequent and severe weather extremes and thus having terrible impacts on ecosystem function, agricultural yield, and human health.
Well, this new study says it aint quite so. The abstract of this paper states it plainly (emphasis and spelling correction added):
Documentary evidence independently confirms many of the dendro signals over the past millennium, and further provides insight on causes and consequences of ambient weather conditions related to the reconstructed extremes. A fairly uniform distribution of hydroclimatic extremes throughout the Medieval Climate Anomaly, Little Ice Age and Recent Global Warming may question the common belief that frequency and severity of such events closely relates to climate mean stages.”
The main highlights:
11,873 living and historical fir ring width samples were compiled across Europe. The world’s largest tree-ring composite continuously spans the AD 962–2007 period. Tree-ring extremes were triggered by April–June precipitation anomalies. Documentary evidence independently confirms dendro signals over the past millennium. Reconstructed extremes may constrain climate model simulations over long timescales.
So yet another climate myth debunked. If anything, it shows that it’s the media and alarmist hysteria that’s extreme, and not the weather.

================================
From: Ivar Giaever [mailto:giaever@XXXX.com]
Sent: Tuesday, September 13, 2011 3:42 PM
To:kirby@aps.org
Cc: Robert H. Austin; ‘William Happer’; ‘Larry Gould’; ‘S. Fred Singer’; Roger Cohen
Subject: I resign from APS
Dear Ms. Kirby
Thank you for your letter inquiring about my membership. I did not renew it because I can not live with the statement below:
Emissions of greenhouse gases from human activities are changing the atmosphere in ways that affect the Earth’s climate. Greenhouse gases include carbon dioxide as well as methane, nitrous oxide and other gases. They are emitted from fossil fuel combustion and a range of industrial and agricultural processes. The evidence is incontrovertible: Global warming is occurring.
If no mitigating actions are taken, significant disruptions in the Earth?s physical and ecological systems, social systems, security and human health are likely to occur. We must reduce emissions of greenhouse gases beginning now.
In the APS it is ok to discuss whether the mass of the proton changes over time and how a multi-universe behaves, but the evidence of global warming is incontrovertible? The claim (how can you measure the average temperature of the whole earth for a whole year?) is that the temperature has changed from ~288.0 to ~288.8 degree Kelvin in about 150 years, which (if true) means to me is that the temperature has been amazingly stable, and both human health and happiness have definitely improved in this ?warming? period.
Best regards,
Ivar Giaever

Share this...FacebookTwitterNot long ago I wrote about how German solar cell manufacturers are drowning in a sea of red ink, read here and here.
The latest to bite the economic bullet are a biofuel plant in Freiberg, and Germany’s E10 ethanol blended fuel.
Merkel’s Solyndra – Choren Industries GmbH goes insolvent
The online leftist TAZ reports here that Choren Industries GmbH located in Freiberg, Saxony is now insolvent. The plant was designed as a pilot for future plants in producing “sun-diesel” from wood waste and biomass. It was designed to produce 18 million litres of the “climate-friendly” fuel, the TAZ reports. It employs 300 workers.
Even Chancellor Angela Merkel visited the plant along with a substantial entourage, before cameras, in April 2008. Unfortunately, the plant was never able to make a profit. The TAZ writes:
Indeed neither the manufacturing costs nor the technology appear to be controllable. Shell opted out already in 2009. Then VW and Daimler followed in July, and so insolvency was unavoidable. Approximately €100 million have been invested so far, €30 million of which were subsidies.”
It turns out that the entire project is not financially feasible and naive calculations had been made. Such a plant requires huge quantities of wood and biomass to operate. All the handling, power, equipment and effort needed to process the raw material ended up consuming much of the energy that was produced. The result: an economic fiasco. Your government masterminds at work.
Still, Germany does not allow itself to be easily deterred by a few green follies and failures. Indeed it is now building a 60 million euro pilot plant in Karlsruhe, insisting that more development is needed. But not everyone is convinced. The TAZ writes:
Biologist Stefan Klotz of the Environmental Research Centre in Leipzig is doubtful when it comes to the production of biofuel. The sun energy stored in biomass via photosynthesis is used with an efficiency of less than 1%. To grow extra plants and then to burn them is a ‘dead-end’.”

Germany’s E10 fuel debacle
Now add the E10 debacle. Awhile back Germany mandated that petroleum companies must blend in 10% bio-ethanol with regular fuel and to offer this so-called E10 fuel to consumers at petrol stations – all part of reducing CO2 emissions. Unfortunately, the government forgot to ask consumers if they had any interest in buying the low-grade stuff to begin with. As the online DIE WELT reports here, few people are interested in filling up with E10 fuel because of concerns the fuel could damage sensitive engine parts and lead to premature wear and expensive repair costs. DIE WELT writes:
The ADAC made headlines with a long-term test of an Opel Signum, which was rated as not being able to handle the E10 fuel. The conclusion: ‘E10 can be damaging’. After 27,000 kilometers of driving, according to ADAC Motorwelt magazine, the driver noticed an intense gasoline smell. The wall of the fuel pump was completely corroded.”
So adamant was the government about petrol stations selling the “environmentally friendly” fuel that it threatened to levy massive fines on companies who did not fulfil sales quotas. DIE WELT writes:
In the industry it’s already clear that the biofuel quota of 6.25% will never be reached.”
For Holger Krawinkel, energy expert of the Federal Association of Consumers:  it is already clear:
E10 is factually dead.“
And these people want to rescue Greece?
The more that Angela Merkel and the Greens try to take over and manage Germany’s energy industry, the more of a laughing stock they are becoming.

Share this...FacebookTwitterMore about More. Below is a short interview with Austrian rapper Kilez More.
More, 22, recently released a rap song/video called Climate Change (Climate Lies, Climate Swindle…), which features the IPCC, CRU and the hockey stick. Now how does a young rap artist know so much about such a complex issue, let alone write a skeptic rap song about it for the youth?
The song indeed is mobilizing the youth, not in masses, but it is a budding challenge. For that Kilez is becoming a sort of enfant terrible, persona non grata in Europe – who dares speak truth to power. I’ve since translated the German text to English, and Kilez has added the English subtitles to his Youtube video:

Of course it doesn’t rhyme in English – but it gives you the gist of what he’s rapping about.

Interview
The following is an interview with Kilez, about what motivated him to “take on the establishment”. He is an environmentalist fighting for cleaner air and water, eradication of poverty, animal abuse, etc. Some of his positions may be off the wall for some of us, but most of us will agree with his position that authority needs to be questioned, and that we ought not be complacent – especially young people on the subject of climate change.
————————————————————————————-
INTERVIEW
NTZ: Most young people your age aren’t interested in climate change. What sparked your interest?
KM: Like with many issues, I approached it by questioning the “official stories”. I do my best to research and make sure I get both sides of the story. When I did this with “climate change” I realized it’s mostly a hoax.
NTZ: When did you have your first doubts?
KM: It was years ago I think when I read a few lines about it in a book – and this increased my attention. It was written that the “Club of Rome” decided a long time ago already, before anyone ever heard about it, that “climate” would be the thing for the future. So I started to search for answers on my own and this quickly got me really to what I think is now the truth. We had scares before in Germany and Austria – like with acid rain and forests dying. Here the scientists and mass media said all forests would die by the end of the century. Now it’s 2011 and everybody knows they were completely false.
NTZ: What led you to write a rap song about climate change?
KM: The topic is everywhere around and it’s crazy what’s going on, so I decided to do something, because no alternative story gets shown. Also in the school-books the children are learning this stuff. I think music is a good way to reach young people – so they maybe start to question the world around them and not to take everything implicitly. Up to now, I’ve read books about the climate-topic, and I pursued the “climategate” story. It all guided me to make a song about it.
NTZ: How does the public in Austria and Germany view climate change? Are people questioning it?
KM: I dont know how the situation is in your country, but in Germany and Austria different opinions don’t exist – it’s really weird how everyone thinks the same – everywhere it is accepted as a fact without any doubt.
That’s why people look at you as if your an idiot (or whatever) when you question it – but yes, critical thinking is increasing here. I recognize it myself, through my music and the resonance I get from listeners.
The music also leads me to very interesting people, journalists, politicians, and so on, and they all try to do their best to get people to think critically.
Kilez More
NTZ: When you perform, what is it you want your listeners to do? Why should they believe you?
KM: I always say with my songs I don’t want the listeners to believe everything I say – no,
that’s the wrong way. That would be the same wrong way as believing everything the newspapers or TV-shows are saying. The message is to think on your own, to search the truth by yourself and to speak out loud against unfairness and lies.

Share this...FacebookTwitterA scan of the larger German online dailies such as DIE WELT, Bild, Der Spiegel, FAZ, etc.  here in Germany shows absolutely no interest or any coverage of Al Gore’s 24 Hours of Reality.Maybe the old continent is losing interest in a movement that once appeared to be scientific, but has long since been reduced to childish name-calling and data manipulation.
The AFP here put out a news blurb, but little else is out there. It could be that editors will print something later, if space allows. But in general the silence is deafening.
Gore’s long losing streak
Objectively speaking, Al Gore is on serious a losing streak. His book sales have hit rock bottom, the Chicago Climate Exchange is dead, so is the Kyoto protocol successor, skepticism is growing, and his new Climate Reality Project is getting few visitors after a brief jump right after it opened. Indeed the global warming issue is out – totally passé.
A big problem is how Gore combatively frames the issue. For him it’s either you accept the science of climate catastrophe, or you are a despicable denier. Gore simply doesn’t grasp that most people are somewhere in between.
Even the warmist/alarmist sites in Germany are not even bothering to report on Gore’s senseless rantathon. One gets the feeling that he is appearing more and more washed up with every passing month. And with every emotional outburst, he is being regarded more and more as an embarrassment to the movement rather than a bonus.

Share this...FacebookTwitterWith summer officially about to begin, a number of weather services are making seasonal forecasts for Germany and Central Europe. Read here.
The English-language The Local writes:
Donnerwetter.de meteorologist Karsten Brandt said odds were ‘high that the weather will turn out sunny with a tendency to be dry.’
Wetter.net meteorologist Dominik Jung also predicted a warm, albeit changeable summer.
‘Short heatwaves of a few days will be followed quickly by cooling in the form of fierce storms with heavy rains,’ Jung said, adding that tornadoes were possible.”
Surprisingly the DWD German Weather Service, like the Met Office, refuses to make a seasonal forecast, though their forecasts have been better than those of the Met Office (that requires getting it right only once). Interestingly the DWD doesn’t have much faith in forecasts that go beyond 10 days – even with all them fancy super computers that can crank out global warming forecasts 100 years out. The Local writes:
But the official German Weather Service’s (DWD) Helmut Malewski said in a statement that predicting more that 10 days ahead is like ‘reading tea leaves’.”
Clearly Germany is now in a period of unsettled weather, one that looks set to stay for a few more days, but not until June 27 – which is so-called Siebenschläfer Day, which is like St. Swithins Day in the UK. The saying goes: If on St Swithins day comes the rain, for forty days it will remain.
Unsettled weather in Germany on June 27 would mean the chances are about 66% that the summer will be unsettled too – that’s what the statistics show. But right now the forecast for next week (June 27) looks sunny.

At least in Germany,  that is if the current string of harsh winters doesn’t stop. And according to Dr Karsten Brandt’s latest winter forecast for 2011/12 at donnerwetter.de, this coming winter is projected to be yet another harsh one. No let-up in sight.
That would make it Germany’s 4th consecutive harsh winter in a row. Brandt already calls 3 harsh winters in a row “unusual”.
The bulk of the cold will occur in December and January, with both months being interrupted by brief mild spells. November will start off mild, but will then fall sharply into a cold spell, with snow likely. Brandt reminds us that this a probable forecast. Things of course could develop differently.
As Brandt mentions, energy prices in Germany have surged over the years, and so many households are going to be taking another real battering with the heating costs.
Indeed today much of Germany’s inflation is driven by spiralling energy costs, due in large part to Germany’s mandatory energy feed-in laws, which require power companies to buy up renewable energies at fixed, sky-high prices and to sell it to consumers as “green” power. Power companies have no choice but to pass the high prices along to the defenceless consumers. Gas, heating oil and electricity prices are are all coupled. The only consolation consumers get, ironically, is the false belief they are helping to keep the planet from getting warmer.
Some power companies figured out creative ways of exploiting the system. According to one story I’ve heard, one Swiss or Austrian company was buying cheap French nuclear power for 3 cents a kwh, used the power to pump water in to a high-elevation pump-storage reservoir, then ran the water through hydroelectric turbines and sold the energy as green power at exorbitant prices. I have no idea how true that story is, but it would not surprise me. After all, we do know that there is no shortage of climate scams.

Share this...FacebookTwitterThings are so bad for the warmists in the USA that they now have to hope that radical German papers will carry the day for them. This is really quite pathetic.
Yesterday German left-wing online Die Zeit, a favourite among German “intellectuals”, attempted to bring the hockey stick back from the dead by granting washed-up climate scientist Raymond Bradley an interview.
The following are excerpts of the interview. I think Al Gore or moveon.org provided the answers for Bradley.
“The curve is robust”
Die Zeit poses the question: “Does the hockey stick chart need to be corrected?” Bradley answers:
No, the curve is robust. It was only one of hundreds of charts in the IPCC report. But the climate deniers in the US industry tried to bury the credibility of the IPCC by casting the curve into doubt. Some US Congressmen, who are marionettes of the oil industry, demanded that we provide detailed information about all financial information for the last few years. It hasn’t been easy with them breathing down our necks.”
I don’t know what the aim of all this is. Of course the German public hardly sees the other side of the science, which is usually in English and rarely filters through the German media. Citizens have to rely on their one-sided media, like Die Zeit.
Germany is a bit like the North Korea of climate information. Warmists are hoping Germans will remain oblivious nd keep believing in the coming doomsday. Obviously Bradley is hoping that the many duped Germans are somehow going to rescue him from the mess he and his team are in. It’s not easy being one step away from permanent disagrace.

Die Zeit then asks: “Since then, several comissions have confirmed your climate diagram. Has anyone apologised to you?” Now what does that tell you about Die Zeit and Die Zeit readers? I guess they’ve never heard of “Climategate” or the Medieval Warm Period.  (Now readers outside of Germany are probably getting an idea of just how far from reality German has drifted). Bradley answers:
No, instead the attacks continue. Michael Mann, the lead author of the curve, is still under investigation. In mid November he had to fight to keep all his e-mails during his time at the University of
Virginia from being made public.”
I’ll refrain from comment here. Bradley then goes on to say that at this stage he no longer feels threatened. But he did some years ago, as “people used the power of the state to intimidate the scientists”.
Bradley also does not expect any progress in Durban. As far as the future of US politics, he is not too optimistic, and warns:
Only when Obama gets re-elected and is supplememnted by a new majority in Congress will anything change. As long as the Tea Party dominates, it’s going to be difficult for Obama.
Die Zeit is regarded in Germany as a leading “intellectual” paper. And, if you linked to their article, you’ll notice they’re still using the old disgraced hockey stick, and believe oil companies are behind the skeptics, that sea level rise is accelerating and all the other myths.
This all reminds me of an old lone Japanese soldier marooned on a desert island, still hiding because he thinks WWII hasn’t ended yet.
Really – I’m not kidding when I say Die Zeit is an intellectual paper in Germany. Now you know the sorrowful state of German “intellectuals” (and Ray Bradley).

"Extinction Rebellion seems to have cracked using protests to transform public debate. But as it starts another major rebellion this week, it might find the challenge ahead is even greater. Extinction Rebellion’s April protests were an enormous success. Together with the BBC’s Attenborough documentary and the school climate strikes, they created a surge in public concern about the environment. The climate emergency is now established in the top five most important issues facing the UK today, at around the same level as the economy. Since the April protests, the government has legislated for net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050 and Labour is moving towards a much more ambitious target. Few people could have predicted that a two-week blockade of central London would be met with so much support or have such political impact. So the natural question is whether a new round of protests can repeat the success. The fact this month’s rebellion won’t be such a novelty could make things harder. It’s the difficult-second-album problem: repeat your material and you’re boring; innovate and you may lose the magic. And with the police preparing to move faster against protesters this time, it’s inevitable that opponents of climate action will call for tougher law enforcement. But difficult though it will be for the protests to recapture the novelty and public support of the April protests, that is far from the biggest problem. Ironically, the greatest threat to the movement is its apparent success over the past six months. If the public believe the protesters have already won, continued street blockades could look unnecessary. It’s here that public opinion turns from being helpful to being a problem for Extinction Rebellion. The overwhelming majority want action to limit climate change and support a net-zero target; most even support bringing that target forward from the government’s current date. But most people’s attention stops there. Few people pay attention to the details or punish politicians who don’t have a plan. This means there’s not much incentive for politicians to go beyond simply pledging to tackle the climate crisis with ambitious-sounding targets. Take the government’s net-zero law. It would just about make the UK compliant with the Paris agreement’s goal of avoiding dangerous warming (although it is too slow for that if you consider the UK to have a responsibility to clean up faster than less- affluent countries). But the government wasn’t even on course to meet its old, weaker target; we are nowhere near meeting the new one. Or take Labour’s conference motion to meet the net-zero target by 2030. This is close to Extinction Rebellion’s demand, but the party shouldn’t get much credit for environmental saviourhood until it shows how it would deliver. Scrapping its support for Heathrow expansion will be hard enough for Labour – with the party’s union funders firmly behind more tarmac and more planes – and that would be among the simplest of the policy switches needed to decarbonise in 11 years. So apparent allies of the protesters can actually be a threat to faster climate action. Emission-cutting pledges can be useful – but if they aren’t combined with a plan they can undermine the cause by making it seem like the battle has been won. The next wave of Extinction Rebellion protests will be a success if it forces climate-friendly politicians to show their proposals. When a politician says they will stop the climate crisis from escalating, the first question that needs to be asked is: “how?” Answering that question requires politicians to expose the fact that avoiding dangerous warming will be disruptive and difficult. Many people will look for reasons to find a way out and so the debate may return to “why?” But this is Extinction Rebellion’s specialist subject: its explanation of the climate emergency may be terrifying but it is well-evidenced. This challenge – to force apparently “green” politicians to come with a plan – is daunting. But few people would have imagined that a climate change protest could occupy central London and be met with widespread public backing. The protesters might just be the people who can do it. • Leo Barasi is the author of The Climate Majority: Apathy and Action in an Age of Nationalism, published by New Internationalist"

Here in Germany the Greens and activists are constantly bemoaning the strong undercurrents of climate skepticism one finds in that “backward country” USA, and claim it’s all fanned by “hack” scientists, like Fred Singer, who are funded by Big Oil, or Koch Industries.
Well guess what? Climate skepticism is spreading way way beyond North America. Not long ago, Portuguese site Ecotretas put together an impressive list of skeptic blogsites and websites that are “in other languages” with “a few in English from non-native English speaking countries”.
ECOTRETAS LIST OF SKEPTIC SITES

Don't despair! Skepticism - the essential element that makes science work - is alive and well in climatology, and spreading! Big blue dots represent the number of skeptic blogsites (not to scale, for illustration only). 
Most of us have long been familiar with sites like Climate Depot, Watts Up With That, Real Science, Climate Audit, etc., but now we see there are many others out there all over the endangered planet.
I counted over 100 on the Ecotretas list.
Skepticism is spreading around the globe faster than Hansen’s phony red warm spots. How many of these foreign sites do you suppose are funded by Big Oil, Big Coal or Koch Industries? Yeah – we wish!
I can’t speak for others, but I can tell you I have not received a single cent of funding from anyone so far. I’m operating solely as a concerned citizen. I’m sure many on the list find themselves in similar situations.
The Ecotretas site is really worth bookmarking as many of these sites offer different perspectives on the issues. But there is one thing that is common to all: They suspect the science underpinning catastrophic man made global warming is a multi-billion dollar heap of rubbish…a scam that is disgracefully defrauding the public.
We’re on to you.

Share this...FacebookTwitterWe’re hearing about clandestine evil deals being made in Durban and that the UN may indeed emerge as the global Führer soon. Rubbish!
Der Spiegel reports here that Durban threatens to sink into chaos.
According to Der Spiegel, a new paper had been drafted overnight and included things like “warming will be limited to 2°C, even 1.5°C” and that “by 2050 greenhouse gas emissions will be cut back 50 to 85 percent compared to 1990” and that developing countries “will be obligated to cut back projected emissions growth by 2020 by 15 to 30 percent”.
Rumours are out claiming they’re closing in on a deal and that our liberty is about to end. But fear not. Der Spiegel, who have well-embedded reporters in Durban, writes:
In any case, a deal will not happen. In paragraph 47 of the paper, which looks at financial aid for developing countries, it is stated: The payments will be ‘equal to the budget that the industrial country has for defence, security and war.'”
We all know that Europe does very little in defence and military. That would mean the US would have to pay just about everything. If Obama accepted this, it would be a Jonestown-scale political suicide by the US Democratic Party. Even the biggest leftists in the US could hardly fantasize such a massive transfer of wealth by a single country. The condition is a set-up to force the USA to reject it – and thus take the blame again.

Der Spiegel writes:
That passage will certainly be deemed as completely unacceptable by the US: The country would not only have to make the money it spends on defence available, but also additional billions that it spends on war. Just the Afghanistan operation costs the USA 100 billion per year.”
Dear readers – Durban has moved to Kooksville, and they just want to end this circus, blame the US, and go home. You’ll hear about a little something here, of a little deal there, some commitment here, etc. But in the end it’s all nothing.
Every year it’s the same. They draft something so unfair that the US can’t accept, then they all blame the US for the failure. I wonder why the US even bothers showing up at all.
The clowns are headed back home and the circus is moving to the next town.

"Last week, a report by US campaign group the National Task Force on Rule of Law and Democracy, compiled by ex-government officials, concluded that under the Trump administration that there were now “almost weekly violations” to the impartiality of scientific research.  In April the Trump administration withdrew funding for the Landscape Conservation Cooperatives, a large and successful conservation programme that tackled issues such as the climate crisis, species extinction and energy security. Sixteen of the original 22 research centres have now been dissolved or are on an indefinite “hiatus”. This was in defiance of instructions from Congress, which had approved $12.5m of federal funding for the cooperatives. Donald Trump’s government has refused to publicise dozens of studies from the US Department of Agriculture that examine the impact of the climate crisis. Agriculture secretary, Sonny Perdue, has previously expressed scepticism about climate change, believing it to simply be due to “weather patterns”. In June, it was reported that the White House had tried to stop Dr Rod Schoonover, a senior intelligence analyst, from discussing climate change when delivering congressional testimony. The reason given was that the science was not aligned with the views of the Trump administration. James Reilly, the director of the US Geological Survey (USGS), has ordered that scientific assessments produced by USGS use climate models that only track the possible impact of climate change until 2040, rather than until the end of the century, as they had done previously. The second half of the century is likely to see the most dramatic impacts of global heating."

Share this...FacebookTwitterThe online Der Spiegel yesterday published a piece by Hans von Storch, Director of the GKSS-Research Center in Geesthacht, Germany and Nico Stehr of the Karl-Mannheim-Professur for Cultural Sciences at the Zeppelin University in Friedrichshafen. The title:”The world of the the world-saving professors has failed”
Their conclusion on Durban: “The conference in Durban was a disappointment; environmental policy is stuck. Climate scientists are to blame because they are fixated on conceitedness and missionary zeal for reducing CO2 emissions.” They add:
The UN Climate Conference in Durban was a swan song.”
The attempt by scientists to guide a successful climate policy has failed. […] The cause for this is a false understanding of the role of climate science and the simplification of the climate change problem.”
For years, science professors had taken on the role of saving the planet, their arrogance exploding faster than CO2 emissions in China. It wasn’t long ago that everything appeared to be in order for the climate scientists. Physicist and chancellor Angela Merkel even allowed herself to be advised by leading scientists of a renowned institute, one was even allowed to use the title: “Advisor to the Chancellor”. Von Storch and Steyr write:
 Their views were accepted throughout the world as fact and their suggestions taken as correct.
Politics was to be guided by science – the science of a few men. Since then climate policy has failed, and CO2 emissions have risen unabated.
They led to failed climate policy. The leading figures in climate science are now suffering from withdrawal syndrome because no one wants to listen to them any longer, let alone celebrate them.”
Citing James Hansen, von Storch and Steyr are calling for a new direction in climate communication policy, pleading that policymakers move away from “Hollywood scientists”, who are naively portrayed as playing the lead roles as “world rescuers”.

What’s needed, the two authors say, is a more open discussion and not “autocratic government forms as solutions to the climate problem” or “great transformations of society” backed by the authority of scientists.
Von Storch and Steyr write that all the scare-mongering has had a devastating impact. Claims that climate change will lead to climate wars, death, disease, refugees, etc. are “not only perceived as attempts by single groups of scientists to gain recognition and financing, but also lead to perceptions that everything is connected to climate change.” Von Storch and Steyr write:
This either gets understood as absurdity or leads to the acceptance of an inevitable fate.”
Von Storch and Steyr cite recent US surveys that show society no longer trusts scientists.
Factual discussions hardly take place between climate science, civil societal organizations, and politics. The acceptance of climate science as a competent, objective interpreter is disappearing.”
They conclude:
It’s time for scientists to devote themselves to science once again. The societal climate debate has to open up.”
If anything else can be concluded, it is that something has gone terribly wrong and that major overhauls of the entire process are long overdue and in dire need. And when Der Spiegel, who started this whole mess 25 years ago, starts bringing it up, then you know something is afoot.

"Four teenage girls are among dozens of protesters demanding government action on climate change to be arrested in Sydney on Monday. The Extinction Rebellion climate protests movement has planned a “spring rebellion” from Monday to Sunday, including marches aimed at blocking traffic. The protesters in Sydney were arrested and bundled into a mobile “custody unit” on Monday afternoon after they allegedly failed to move on when asked to do so by police. Some 30 people were arrested, including four girls aged under 16, organisers say. “Alleged offences committed range from obstructing traffic to disobeying reasonable direction,” New South Wales police said in a statement. The assistant commissioner Mick Willing said police respected the right of groups and individuals to protest, but “we have a responsibility to the community and local businesses to ensure they can go about their normal activities without being impacted on or put at risk”. “Unfortunately, despite the warnings issued by local police and our colleagues from across the country, this group continue to set out to break the law and put themselves and others at risk,” Willing said in a statement. Monday’s rally saw hundreds of people march from Belmore Park to Sydney’s CBD via Pitt Street. Among those walking were sisters 10-year-old Luka and 12-year-old Maddie Brett-Hall alongside Ember Henninger, also 10, from the Blue Mountains. The march was their second protest after they attended a flash mob at Echo Point earlier in 2019. “I feel like we need to make a difference,” Maddie told AAP. Young voices weren’t being listened to enough, Ember said. “The government tells us to just be kids ... and this makes me feel angry,” she said. Earlier in the day the Victorian activist Miriam Robinson said the group must “get right up in people’s grills” to convince governments to take firm action on climate change. “We always apologise for causing inconvenience,” the retired public servant told AAP on Monday. “But this is nothing compared to the inconvenience that is going to start happening when we start to run out of food and water.” The week’s events got off to a relaxed start in Melbourne with about 20 people attending a day-long meditation session on the steps of Victoria’s parliament. About 100 people were at the movement’s base camp at Carlton Gardens, where some people discussed the group’s values. But things are expected to ramp up in the evening, with protesters intending to make their presence known in the city by blocking an intersection. There was a notable presence in Canberra on Monday morning, when nearly 300 people marched across Commonwealth Bridge, blocking traffic. A march was also held in Brisbane, where people made their way across Victoria Bridge. In Hobart about 30 people crossed the Tasman Bridge, though they were on a public walkway, with another handful stationing themselves outside state parliament. In Perth, activists focused on the perspective of traditional owners and an Indigenous Welcome To Country ceremony. Police have warned they will intervene if there is violence, significant disorder or if a safety risk is identified. Extinction Rebellion specifically wants governments to “tell the truth” about climate change by declaring a climate and ecological emergency. It also wants them to prevent biodiversity loss and reduce greenhouse gas emissions to net zero by 2025, and let the public drive decisions on climate change through a Citizens’ Assembly."
"Australian politics has never felt as far out of step with the rest of the democratic world. While other major democracies openly confront existential crises, politicians in Australia carry on apparently without a care in the world. Nothing symbolised this gulf more clearly than Scott Morrison in New York last week. As international leaders gathered to debate the acute threat of climate change – and to be eloquently berated by Greta Thunberg – the prime minister decided to give the UN’s climate summit a miss and went to inspect a newly automated McDonald’s instead. But it is not just the sitting government that appears to be sitting out the crises engulfing the rest of the world. Ever since their shock defeat in May, the ALP has been effectively silent. Whereas most incoming political leaders are now eager to display their authenticity with bold speeches on their core values and motivating ideals, Anthony Albanese has chosen a different path. He is waiting for the results of Labor’s internal review into the party’s electoral failings before he decides which fundamental identity to disclose. Some here find this stability reassuring. Few want to cope with the daily chaos of American impeachment, British Brexit or French gilets jaunes. But scratch beneath the surface and the challenges that animate those movements elsewhere are alive in Australia too. An intensifying divide between rich and poor, the threat of climate catastrophe, the erosion of stable stories of national identity, racial and ethnic hatreds – each of these issues shape the 21st century in every part of the world. They are our realities, whether we live in Athens or Adelaide, Seattle or Sydney. Australia cannot then continue with the politics of denial forever. We will have to face our own momentous moments of political decision, just as the rest of the democratic world is doing right now. And the longer Australia puts that moment off, the more intense our difficulties will be. It does not take too much excavation to see that. Social division and distrust in established political institutions – parliament, parties, politicians – as the potential agents of change, are deepening by the day. And each make the task of responding to the challenges of our times harder not easier. So what is to be done? We can be certain the politicians will not change course by themselves. That is expecting too much, even of the good ones. Democratic politicians almost always have to respond to agendas set by others. The short-termism engendered by three-year election cycles makes that all but inevitable. Nor will it come from those who have done well out of the economic order of the last four decades and have most to lose from policy change, like many of the multinational corporations. The job of confronting the future, therefore, must fall to the rest of us. It is for everyday citizens – from all backgrounds, all walks of life – to set the new agenda. Like many people, I used to think that was impossible. I thought there was no way the established powers in modern democracies would cede their agenda-setting role to anyone else. But not any more. Because the lessons of the last decade are that breathtaking political change is possible and that it is more often driven from outside the system than from within. Sometimes this is presented as a phenomenon only of the far right. Nigel Farage’s United Kingdom Independence party (Ukip) came from nowhere to revolutionise British politics, probably for generations. Donald Trump’s toxic mix of celebrity television and white nationalism has done the same for the United States. But in fact, as research by my Sydney Policy Lab colleagues Amanda Tattersall and Kurt Iveson shows, progressive forces have been gathering internationally too, especially in cities. In Spain, new citizen-led movements have taken over the governance of Barcelona; in South Africa’s Cape Town, everyday citizens have proposed radical new solutions for affordable housing; in London, charities and young migrant campaigners have worked hand in hand with the mayor, Sadiq Khan, to transform the debate on race and immigration; and, of course, in Hong Kong, citizens have challenged one of the mightiest political powers of all. All of us eager for change have much to learn by listening to those who lead them, examining their ideas and organising tactics. When we do, we see they are almost always broad coalitions. Their success depends not on the efforts of one small group but on collaborations between sections of society, many of whom have not worked together before. We see too that these are rarely just protest movements, vital and inspiring though protests can be, as the climate strike has shown. Instead, these are groups that present real, concrete practical solutions and who often get to work on delivering those solutions straight away. Most importantly of all, though, these are movements of people who realise that wherever we choose to put our energies, we simply do not have time to wait. They know that if established politicians will not act – and the evidence is they will not – then the rest of society must lead. These international movements, in other words, are united most of all in appreciating what Martin Luther King called the fierce urgency of now. It is time we in Australia show that we understand that too. • Marc Stears is director of the Sydney Policy Lab at the University of Sydney"

"The drought and water resources minister, David Littleproud, has acknowledged he “totally” accepts that worsening droughts are linked to climate change, as he signalled more taxpayer support for regional communities was coming as Australia’s big dry “escalates”. Littleproud, who stumbled last month by first telling Guardian Australia he did not know if climate change was manmade, then later clarifying he had always accepted the science on the role humans play in the climate changing, told the ABC on Sunday he understood the link between global warming and drought because “I live it”. The minister said the government had a responsibility to deal with climate change by facing up “to try and reduce our emissions”. But he said adaptation was now the main game. “This drought in my electorate alone has been going for eight years”. “The reality is, we can’t run away from that. We simply have to get on with it and equip our farmers and communities with the tools to be able to adapt as best they can”. Despite the fact emissions are rising, and have risen every year since the Coalition scrapped the carbon price legislated by the Gillard government, Littleproud said the government was living up to the commitments made under international climate agreements. He was also positive about the role of renewable energy. “We’re going to see 33,000 gigawatts of renewable energy put on in the next year or so. Most of that will happen in my own electorate. “We actually want to become the renewable energy electorate. Western Downs shire is screaming at me to become the renewable energy shire of the country with solar and wind,” the minister said. Asked whether he accepted that global warming meant some farms in Australia could become unviable, Littleproud said there was a market-led transition already under way. “We’ve seen farmers change their practices from being broad-acre back into grazing as the climate’s changed and as that’s taken its toll on its landscape.” He said farmers were already shifting with an eye to long-term viability and the question before government was how to assist people remaining on the land to adapt to changing conditions. Pressed on what the government’s drought strategy was, because the bulk of a $7bn package the Morrison government points to regularly has not yet been spent, Littleproud said the government was in the process of refining the package with input from significant stakeholders, such as the National Farmers Federation. The minister said he wanted the NFF to provide its strategy so he could “put that in front of cabinet” along with a report from the Joint Agency Drought Taskforce, which was established within the prime minster’s office and led by major general Stephen Day. He said the government was already acting on the recommendations from Day and would continue to work with state governments. Littleproud said what came next needed to extend outside his portfolio to a “whole of government” response, including health, education and infrastructure. The minister said drought was complex, impacting farmers but also on whole communities. “It’s not just farmers, it’s the small business owners – building that infrastructure to build the resilience into the future.” Labor last week asked the auditor general to investigate the government’s claimed $7bn in drought assistance, saying the drought response to date had been “ad hoc, confusing and lacking in direction”. The former Nationals leader Barnaby Joyce has declared the Coalition risks “political annihilation” in the bush if the drought worsens and it does not start building dams – but there has also been controversy about the quality of Joyce’s own input as special drought envoy. Sign up to receive the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Littleproud was also asked about recent comments from the home affairs minister, Peter Dutton, who declared protesters who disrupt traffic should have their welfare payments cut and be subjected to mandatory jail sentences, part of a rhetoric offensive by conservative MPs against climate change protests. Littleproud responded in low-key fashion but broadly backed Dutton’s arguments on Sunday morning. “Everyone wants a cause these days. They become angry and impose their will on the Australian people. What this should be is about respect. “I get everyone wants a cause. Everyone’s got to be angry these days. But for Christ’s sakes, respect your fellow Australians,” the minister said. He said the Morrison government had taken action against animal activists “that impinged on the rights of farming families, and we passed legislation. “But a lot of this comes back to the states. We wouldn’t have to do the heavy lifting if the states got in there and imposed higher penalties for these activists so that the magistrates had nowhere to go but to slip into them.”"
"Our diets can have a big environmental impact. The greenhouse gas emissions involved in producing and transporting various foods has been well researched, but have you ever thought about the water-scarcity impacts of producing your favourite foods? The answers may surprise you. In research recently published in the journal Nutrients, we looked at the water scarcity footprints of the diets of 9,341 adult Australians, involving more than 5,000 foods. We measured both the amount of water used to produce a food, and whether water was scarce or abundant at the location it was drawn from. The food system accounts for around 70% of global freshwater use. This means a concerted effort to minimise the water used to produce our food – while ensuring our diets remained healthy – would have a big impact in Australia, the driest inhabited continent on Earth. We found the average Australian’s diet had a water-scarcity footprint of 362 litres per day. It was slightly lower for women and lower for adults over 71 years of age. A water-scarcity footprint consists of two elements: the litres of water used, multiplied by a weighting depending on whether water scarcity at the source is higher or lower than the global average. Foods with some of the highest water-scarcity footprints were almonds (3,448 litres/kg), dried apricots (3,363 litres/kg) and breakfast cereal made from puffed rice (1,464 litres/kg). In contrast, foods with some of the smallest water-scarcity footprint included wholemeal bread (11.3 litres/kg), oats (23.4 litres/kg), and soaked chickpeas (5.9 litres/kg). It may surprise you that of the 9,000 diets studied, 25% of the water scarcity footprint came from discretionary foods and beverages such as cakes, biscuits, sugar-sweetened drinks and alcohol. They included a glass of wine (41 litres), a single serve of potato crisps (23 litres), and a small bar of milk chocolate (21 litres). These foods don’t only add to our waistlines, but also our water-scarcity footprint. Previous studies have also shown these foods contribute around 30% of dietary greenhouse gas emissions in Australia. The second highest food group in terms of contributing to water-scarcity was fruit, at 19%. This includes whole fruit and fresh (not sugar-sweetened) juices. It should be remembered that fruit is an essential part of a healthy diet, and generally Australians need to consume more fruit to meet recommendations. Dairy products and alternatives (including non-dairy beverages made from soy, rice and nuts) came in third and bread and cereals ranked fourth. The consumption of red meat – beef and lamb – contributed only 3.7% of the total dietary water-scarcity footprint. These results suggest that eating fresh meat is less important to water scarcity than most other food groups, even cereals. Not surprisingly, cutting out discretionary foods would be number one priority if you wanted to lower the water footprint of the food you eat, as well as the greenhouse gas emissions of production. Over-consumption of discretionary foods is also closely linked to weight gain and obesity. Eating a variety of healthy foods, according to energy needs, is a helpful motto. Aside from this, it is difficult to give recommendations that are relevant to consumers. We found that the variation in water-scarcity footprint of different foods within a food group was very high compared to the variation between food groups. For example, a medium sized apple was found to contribute a water-scarcity footprint of three litres compared with more than 100 litres for a 250 ml glass of fresh orange juice. This reflects the relative use of irrigation water and the local water scarcity where these crops are grown. It also takes more fruit to produce juice than when fruit is consumed whole. Two slices of wholegrain bread had a much lower water-scarcity footprint than a cup of cooked rice (0.9 litres compared with 124 litres). Of the main protein sources, lamb had the lowest water-scarcity footprint per serve (5.5 litres). Lambs are rarely raised on irrigated pastures and when crops are used for feeding, these are similarly rarely irrigated. Consumers generally lack the information they would need to choose core foods with a lower water-scarcity footprint. Added to this, diversity is an important principle of good nutrition and dissuading consumption of particular core foods could have adverse consequences for health. Perhaps the best opportunities to reduce water scarcity impacts in the Australian food system lie in food production. There is often very large variation between producers in water scarcity footprint of the same farm commodity. For example, a study of the water scarcity footprint of tomatoes grown for the Sydney market reported results ranging from 5.0 to 52.8 litres per kg. Variation in the water-scarcity footprint of milk produced in Victoria was reported to range from 0.7 to 262 litres. This mainly reflects differences in farming methods, with variation in the use of irrigation and also the local water scarcity level. Water-scarcity footprint reductions could best be achieved through technological change, product reformulation and procurement strategies in agriculture and food industries. This is the first study of its kind to report the water-scarcity footprint for a large number of individual self-selected diets. This was no small task, given that 5,645 individual foods were identified. Many were processed foods which needed to be separated into their component ingredients. It’s hard to say how these results compare to other countries as the same analysis has not been done elsewhere. The study did show a large variation in water-scarcity footprints within Australian diets, reflecting the diversity of our eating habits. Water scarcity is just one important environmental aspects of food production and consumption. While we don’t suggest that dietary guidelines be amended based on water scarcity footprints, we hope this research will support more sustainable production and consumption of food.

"Twenty of the UK’s leading universities have struck a £50m deal to buy renewable energy directly from British windfarms for the first time. The collaborative clean energy deal will supply electricity from wind farms across Scotland and Wales to universities including Newcastle University, University of Exeter and Aberystwyth University. The landmark deal, known as a “power purchase agreement” or PPA, is the first time that UK public sector energy users have clubbed together to buy clean electricity. The PPA was arranged by deal brokers at The Energy Consortium and Squeaky Clean Energy to fix the price of renewable electricity from a portfolio British windfarms for the next 10 years. The universities will be guaranteed clean energy by the windfarm owner, Norwegian energy giant Statkraft, which will issue certificates matching the output of the windfarms. James Rolfe, the chief operating officer at Anglia Ruskin University, which is part of the deal, said the university has joined others in declaring a climate emergency, and plans to be climate neutral by 2030. “To support this commitment we aim to source all of our electricity from zero carbon sources by 2025, and this power purchase agreement makes a significant contribution towards this goal whilst delivering financial savings and budget stability,” he added. Richard Murphy, the managing director of The Energy Consortium, said the “groundbreaking deal” would help universities reduce their carbon emissions and save money by accessing the power purchase market for the first time. Murphy helped arrange one of the first major corporate energy deals in Europe in 2008 to supply supermarket giant with renewable energy. Since then the PPAs have remained the preserve of larger, multi-site corporations because most renewable energy developers require hefty deals over long contract periods, according to Murphy. One of the UK’s largest deals was struck last year between Budweiser brewer AB InBev and solar developer Lightsource BP to build 100MW of solar power, without subsidy, to help power their nationwide operations. Last month, Google revealed the company’s $2bn plans for the biggest renewable energy deal in corporate history. It is made up of 18 separate agreements to supply Google with 1,600MW of electricity from wind and solar projects across the world. Murphy said that collaborative energy purchase deals mean that even small institutions are now “able to navigate a previously inaccessible market” too. “The combined challenge facing the wider public sector is to secure reduced carbon emissions whilst saving money and I am delighted that these universities have secured both,” he said. • This article was amended on 10 October 2019 to clarify that this deal was the first between public sector energy users in the UK "

Share this...FacebookTwitterHow many billions of euros has the EU spent on renewable energy in order to reduce climate killing CO2 emissions? How many billions have been spent on research, institutes, think tanks, government, NGOs, etc., for the purpose of educating and regulating the public to curb CO2 emissions?
How many pages have been written and words spoken preaching that CO2 has to be reduced rapidly, or else the Earth will burn in hell?
How many light bulbs have been changed?
No continent on the planet has pontificated so incessantly to the rest of the world about the evils of CO2 emissions like Europe has.  The ultra-green continent even demands emissions be cut by 30% by 2020, and 80% by 2050.
So wouldn’t you think that Europe would be cutting its emissions every year?
In reality, Europe is like the chronic alcoholic who goes around telling everyone that he’s gone dry, only to stagger through the door hours later every evening.
The religious tree-hugger site klimaretter reports on the EU’s latest CO2 binge. EU emissions rose 2.4% in 2010. Ironically, the cause of the rise is reported to be a healthier economy, and a cold winter!

So let’s give Obama credit where credit is due. With his focus now returning to jobs and economy, he is slowing getting on the right path. Still, right now, his formula for job creation looks like it comes from a playbook written in the 1930s.

"For years, when the climate movement called for “connecting the dots,” they meant linking extreme weather to the broader story of human-caused climate breakdown. In the age of the Green New Deal, our job is to connect the dots in a different way: between the climate crisis and the crises of economic and racial inequality that afflict us every day. And we have an opportunity to get concrete – literally – by showing precisely how targeted green investment in racialized and working-class communities can slash carbon emissions. One truly radical and intersectional approach? Tackle the United States’ housing and climate crises at the same time – with a Green New Deal for housing.  Of course, the centrist climate wonks hate how expansive the Green New Deal idea is. They think every piece of its social policy is an expensive distraction. But they forgot to follow the carbon beyond their tidy little graphs. In the real world, you can’t separate the carbon causing the climate emergency from our physical and economic systems, any more than you can separate windows, furnaces, and air conditioners from your monthly rent bill. And you can’t separate voters’ – and political organizers’ – desires for a safe and affordable home from their commitment to a stable climate. In aggregate, the United States’ 138m housing units cause over 15% of the country’s greenhouse gas emissions, more than all commercial buildings combined. Housing inequality is also the biggest driver of the country’s horrifying wealth gap, with the median black family owning just $11,000, compared to the median white family owning over $135,000. And housing costs are destroying Americans’ budgets. Nearly 20m households spend over half their income on rent or mortgage payments. Another 20m pay over a third. While the climate movement flexes its muscles by holding climate strikes and blocking pipelines, housing movements all around the country are racking up wins, with campaigns like the Homes Guarantee putting national rent control on the mainstream political agenda. Anyone hoping to become the Democratic nominee should be able to answer the question: what will your climate plan do for the housing crisis? Or, to flip it around: What can your housing policies do for the climate emergency? Either way, a good answer should be the same: a lot. After all, the stories of inequality and energy converge. Homes’ carbon emissions are a reflection of something more visceral: brutal energy costs. Over a third of US households can’t readily afford their monthly utility bill, with people of color disproportionately burdened. One study found that the single main reason that people take out payday loans is to cover utility bills. The third most common reason? To make rent. So far, Bernie Sanders’ mammoth Green New Deal and Housing for All platforms go furthest in tackling these two crises together. Sanders’ plans call for building nearly 10m units of no-carbon, publicly funded housing. And his plans call for massive investments in green upgrades for existing public housing, and doing a massive energy efficiency retrofit program for other homes and buildings, with a focus on low-income residents who cannot afford their own upgrades. And Sanders’ plan calls for universal rent control and zoning changes to facilitate apartment building in affluent neighborhoods; together, these measures would greatly increase affordable density, the cornerstone of no-carbon urbanism. If you were wondering how a jobs guarantee would find work for everyone, now you know: making every home in the country safer, more comfortable, more affordable, and more climate-friendly. Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez has also spoken about how beautiful, sustainable, and resident-friendly affordable housing complexes, with social services like childcare facilities on the ground floor, exemplify the conjoined social and ecological promise of a Green New Deal. We can push all this ambition forward, and make it even more specific. Here’s where the progressive group People’s Action’s Homes Guarantee campaign comes in. (Full disclosure: I was on the campaign’s policy team.) The Homes Guarantee plan’s headline demand is, to echo Bernie, yuge: 12m new units of social housing, built to emit net zero carbon emissions, include a mix of incomes (with the priority going to very low-income households), and built in a way that pioneers low-carbon and sustainable construction methods. Indeed, Sanders’ more recent housing plan explicitly echoes People’s Action’s proposal, from specifics like its Green New Deal tie-ins to its all-encompassing ambition. Sanders’ plan states outright that “we need a homes guarantee”. Yes, it’s counterintuitive to call for a big homebuilding program when we need to emit less. But here’s the thing. In the decades ahead, upwards of 13 million people living in the US could be displaced by sea level rise. Tens of millions of immigrants could – and should – come live in the US. Tens of millions of people will need new homes in the years ahead. It’s precisely through public regulation and public building that we ensure that new homes are net zero carbon. This will vastly reduce overall energy demand, making it much easier to reach zero carbon in our energy system fast. Projects of new and retrofitted affordable housing in the US and around the world are already pioneering green housing techniques. And it’s through those policies that we will develop the skills to slash the ecological footprint of new construction, through more efficient techniques of homebuilding, and by driving sustainable innovations in building materials, like no-carbon concrete. In this way, a Green New Deal for housing would have benefits that go beyond directly affected residents, by driving down the costs of going green for everyone. At the neighborhood level, Sanders and the Homes Guarantee call for making every social housing complex a resiliency center to keep people safe during disasters and heat waves. Our choice is private inefficiency, waste, and injustice, or equality and sustainability through public action, finally providing everyone with a decent home. The Homes Guarantee platform also calls for national rent control and pro-apartment zoning changes. And it calls for green upgrades to existing public housing, getting rid of natural gas and toxic mold. And the platform calls for massive investment into racialized communities to lift up households of color and tackle environmental injustice, through a vast array of careful policies, from energy retrofits to facilitating community land trusts to increasing access to clean transit to universal rent control to protecting families from displacement. A Green New Deal for Housing would be an effective and efficient lever for decarbonizing the economy, creating good jobs, and increasing social, economic, and racial justice. And its core components are already popular. Over the last year, polling by the think tank Data for Progress, where I’m a senior fellow, found majority support for many of this plan’s most crucial elements long before it was put together. In one poll, majorities of both Democrats and Independents – and an overall majority of 57% of total respondents – said that green investments should be prioritized in frontline communities, namely the working class and racialized neighborhoods that have suffered most from pollution and disinvestment. Majority support holds up even when respondents are told this green investment would require tax raises. This past April, Data for Progress also found majority support for the idea that the government should fund enough non-profit and public housing units to ensure that every American without a home should get one (60% support, 23% opposition, 17% no opinion). They found majority support for a policy creating a $50bn fund to weatherize all low-income homes (58% support, 23% opposition, 19% no opinion). And they found strong support for the idea that there that smaller, low-cost housing should be built in middle- and upper-middle-class neighborhoods (49% support, 25% opposed, 26% no opinion). Is it really so impractical to link climate policy and housing policy – the climate movement and the housing movement – around solutions that would tackle both crises at once? With the climate emergency, everything is connected. We know why that’s dangerous. It’s time to talk about the benefits of all that intersectionality: we can – indeed must – solve our most pressing crises at the same time. Daniel Aldana Cohen is assistant professor of sociology at the University of Pennsylvania, where he directs the Socio-Spatial Climate Collaborative, or (SC)2. He’s also a senior fellow at Data for Progress, and a member of the Homes Guarantee policy team"

Share this...FacebookTwitterGermany’s media is sick and intolerant at times, seemingly continuing a once infamous tradition.
Yesterday NDR German public television had an interview with Fritz Vahrenholt, co-author with Sebastian Lüning of the bestselling book Die kalte Sonne now sweeping through Germany. The NDR piece is dubbed: “Vahrenholt and the ‘CO2 lies'”. The clip first introduces the climate topic and reminds viewers that “that man is causing global warming and storms.”
Established climate science is indignant about the scrutiny
NDR first questions Hartmut Grassl and Jochem Marotzke, both of the Max Planck Institute for Meteorology. Grassl, obviously agitated by Vahrenholt’s skeptical book, crossly replies:
Ach, actually I have no desire to comment on such nonsense.”
If you listen closely, you’ll hear a burst of laughter from some hyena in the background. Jochem Marotzke also takes the same snobby attitude: No one should question AGW. Why the indignant reaction from Marotzke and Grassl? One can only speculate.
Suppressing open debate
Perhaps they feel that a chemistry professor (Vahrenholt) and a geologist (Lüning) have no business doubting their science. But my guess is that they are completely embarrassed, and thus terrified, about having been duped by what is turning out today to be a really dumb and simplistic hypothesis: climate trace gas CO2 rules the climate and other factors play no role. These two scientific men bought into the global warming end-of-the-world catastrophe hook, line and sinker. They have absolutely no desire to have all this exposed by an open debate.
And as Lüning writes at the “Die kalte Sonne site here:
One gets the sense they are now trying harder than ever to suppress debate.”

NDR could not resist delivering a low blow to Vahrenholt. The used old footage of him when he was Environment Senator for Hamburg over 20 years ago. The footage shows the young Vahrenholt climbing down through a manhole while the reporter says: “He has opted to descend into another world.” NDR’s message to the viewers is clear: “Skeptics belong in the sewers.  Now you know how nasty things can get in Germany.
Critics should first read the book
The NDR interview with Vahrenholt on the other was well handled.
During the interview, Vahrenholt’s calls out the major error made by the IPCC, not properly taking the sun and ocean currents into account, and falsely assigning all the warming to CO2 from 1980 to 2000. ARD asked Vahrenholt to respond to Mojib Latif’s recent criticism, also indignant. Vahrenholt replied.
“He really ought to first read the book.”
They all should read the book. From their comments, it’s clear that they haven’t, and they seem stunningly ignorant of the latest science – or they simply just don’t want to talk about it.
Good news! The book is selling like hot cakes – no. 14 on bestseller list
Here’s a little anecdote. I live in a small town and four weeks ago I ordered two copies of “Die kalte Sonne” from our local bookshop here in town – one for myself and one for the bookshop display window, which the owner kindly allowed. I told the owner that the book was highly controversial and politically incorrect. “What do you mean?” he asked. I told him “the book doesn’t believe in the climate catastrophe!” He just laughed.
Today the bookshop owner sent me a message to let me know that “Die kalte Sonne” is now on the Spiegel bestseller list and that customers have been snapping them up, and that he’s been ordering more copies.Then he told me on the phone that once a book is on the Spiegel bestseller list, then sales pick up.
So expect tens of thousands of copies to be sold nationwide!

"Lucie Morris-Marr, the first journalist to reveal that Victoria police were investigating George Pell over allegations of child abuse, has detailed in her new book what she endured at the Herald Sun after breaking the story on the tabloid’s front page. In Fallen: the inside story of the secret trial and conviction of Cardinal George Pell, Morris-Marr says elation over her scoop quickly turned sour, and she ended up suffering from severe stress after attacks from Pell and her colleague Andrew Bolt.  “My suspicion that News Corp was doing a U-turn seemed to be confirmed by Monday morning when Andrew Bolt described my scoop as a ‘witch hunt’ and a ‘smear’,” she wrote. So touched and honoured to see so many incredible and special people at the launch of my book tonight. Thank you to the remarkable @ChrissieFoster7 for launching the book and @paul4frankston for caring so much about the issue of clergy abuse. #fallen @AllenAndUnwin #pell pic.twitter.com/NGtzYj1U4J When Victoria police referred the story to the state’s Independent Broad-based Anti-corruption Commission, Morris-Marr asked the editor, Damon Johnston, to provide security in case her home was raided, which he agreed to. But her confidence was shaken when she turned up for a meeting with editors to discuss the Ibac probe only to come face to face with Bolt. He “drifted into the room asking ‘is this where the Ibac meeting is?’,” Morris-Marr wrote. “I was so angry I put my hand out towards him and said ‘no’.” Morris-Marr says Bolt turned up for the meeting because a joke that he should attend was “taken seriously by the editor’s secretary” and he was invited. Johnston later ejected Bolt from the meeting, she wrote. A complaint to News Corp HR that Bolt had breached the News Corp editorial code of conduct was not upheld. Morris-Marr alleges that News Corp deliberately chose not to renew her contract after the dispute between her and Bolt: “I was out and Bolt was in.” Bolt has always denied he had anything to do with her departure from the paper. Morris-Marr went on to report on the Pell trial for CNN and the New Daily and, when her book was published last week, it went to the number one spot in the true crime bestsellers on Amazon. Australian media identities lined up to attack the Swedish teenager Greta Thunberg this week for her scathing speech at the UN. From just one mention in the Australian media in September 2018, Thunberg’s prominence has grown to 2,848 mentions this month, according to Streem media monitoring. The more the 16-year-old has been mentioned, the more annoyed some commentators have become. There were the middle-aged white men who threw insults at the climate activist: the Nine footy personality Sam Newman, the broadcaster Alan Jones, the columnist Andrew Bolt, the Australian’s resident climate contrarians Chris Kenny and Graham Lloyd, and the Sky commentator Mark Latham. Then there were the middle-aged white women: the Tele’s Miranda Devine and the Sydney Morning Herald’s Amanda Vanstone. All very predictable. But it was the Nine broadcaster Karl Stefanovic whose intervention was a little surprising. “[Thunberg is] being managed and her stance is being used by activists,” Stefanovic told listeners while filling in as a shock jock on his friend Alan Jones’ radio station 2GB. “She was very fired up, wasn’t she? I thought, ‘What are my kids doing on school holidays next week? Not doing that.’” To be honest, I’m amazed that the UN hasn’t asked Karl to address them yet... https://t.co/fwS1OEhFpN Referring to the former Labor prime minister’s remark that Thunberg “represents the anger of that generation”, Stefanovic said: “Kevin Rudd, give it a rest. There’s anger out there – but there’s anger at this kind of activism as well.” “I’ll tell you what, I’m an incensed middle-aged white guy this afternoon.” Hang in there! Help is available. https://t.co/aenieXxVut For someone who is supposed to be rebuilding his reputation and credibility after the adverse publicity he received over a marriage break-up, Stefanovic is going about it the wrong way. The Australian set the tone for anti-Thunberg sentiment with a front page that screamed: “Deciphering Greta’s gobful.” Inside, the associate editor Chris Kenny described the climate warrior as “a hysterical teenager” while the environment editor, Graham Lloyd, said her speech was “heavy on rhetoric and threats but short on detail and facts”. Lloyd, who spends a great deal of time querying climate science, then analysed with his own take on the truth. In the Herald Sun Bolt said the “hysteria” of Thunberg – and women in general – was out of control. “There was Greta Thunberg, the child messiah of global warming, howling at the United Nations this week,” Bolt wrote. “You have stolen my dreams and my childhood with your empty words … People are dying. Entire ecosystems are collapsing.” “We see the same catastrophism here.” Then there was the ex-footballer Newman, who showed his true colours by tagging his post #ClimateChangeHoax. This annoying little brat addressed the UN on the so-called climate crisis. WHO lets this shit have a platform? Mendacious, inbred sycophants, that who. #ClimateChangeHoax pic.twitter.com/W1fvYdtFSW Devine, now enjoying the benefits of working for Rupert Murdoch with a stint in New York at the New York Post, called for someone to be “arrested for child abuse”. “It is grotesque that a child, already emotionally vulnerable due to her condition, has been so indoctrinated by adults,” Devine wrote. To round off the Tele’s coverage its blogger Tim Blair said Thunberg was a “teen climate queen” who had delivered a crazy, absurd and melodramatic speech. Vanstone, in the SMH, said: “The Thunberg circus has become a complete farce.” Jones has had a lot to say about Thunberg and the climate change protest, most of which is best forgotten. But he was given acres of space to defend himself in the Sydney Morning Herald and the Age on Friday, papers that are owned by Macquarie Media’s parent company, Nine Entertainment. Nine owns 54.5% of Macquarie and is moving to total ownership. In a friendly interview Jones demonstrated how caring he was to listeners – he bought $1,000 worth of chocolates from a failing chocolatier – and how he was not a misogynist: he was “unfailingly courteous to women”. “Now, I don’t run around bullying or shouting at people,” Jones told the paper. “Yeah, on air, every so often I’ll get a bit excited but I’m doing a million words a day. I just want people to be sensible and reasonable and balanced.” Speaking of climate change, our readers were a little confused with a post on Facebook, writing their postcodes on the comments on Facebook instead of clicking the link. Fortunately, Guardian Australia’s data editor, Nick Evershed, was on hand to help them out. Folks, I cannot 😂 pic.twitter.com/it4T2FGpuy The West Australian published an interview with a young Perth-based hacker who revealed how he had managed to hack entertainment giants including Disney, Intel and Microsoft and get away with it. Dylan Wheeler spoke at length about how he had pulled it all off at the tender age of 14. This journalist has not spoken to me... he listened to a podcast by @DarknetDiaries @JackRhysider and wrote an article? Journalism on point, also lmao that hair style hasn't been rocked in many many years. pic.twitter.com/LrfgTgZAff “I don’t think we had too much of a sense of risk. If we get caught it will be a slap on the wrist, right? “There was nothing we didn’t have or we couldn’t pivot to and that is where it became a big issue. “It got so big, it blew up so fast – we literally had everyone in the gaming industry.” But, according to the podcast newsletter Podnews, the reporter, Tim Clarke, didn’t speak to Wheeler for his full-page profile. “All 23 quotes with the ‘hacker’ in question were in a story from Darknet Diaries which was not credited in the piece,” Podnews reported. Soon Wheeler himself had confirmed he’d never spoken to Clarke. The paper’s readers’ editor, Alison Wakeham, told Weekly Beast an error had occurred in the production process. “Tim Clarke’s original copy had made it clear that he was quoting from a podcast, but the mistake was introduced when the page was being produced,” Wakeham said. “On being made aware of what had happened, we corrected the online copy, also adding a link to the podcast, and the digital version of the newspaper.” Sometimes reporting on fake news results in the spread of erroneous information even further. Some media reports on the hoax photo claims to show rubbish left behind by Australian climate strikers were so obscure they buried the fact it is a hoax and perpetuated the myth. “The Australian Youth Coal Coalition called out Sydney’s climate change protesters, sharing this photo – but they got one detail very wrong,” Seven News wrote on Facebook with the photograph of the rubbish strewn across a park. “Photo of plastic waste ‘left behind by Sydney climate protesters’ goes viral.” Only the single quotation marks around the words ‘left behind by Sydney climate protesters’ gave the reader a clue that the photo is a hoax. In another Facebook post Seven News Australia wrote: “Look at the mess today’s climate protesters left behind in beautiful Hyde Park. So much plastic. So much landfill. So sad.” Then there was the news.com.au story which did not make it clear until the 15th paragraph that the photograph was a hoax. “A climate change photo that has been shared more than 34,000 times has outraged Facebook users,” news.com.au said. “Tens of thousands of Australians marched against climate change on Friday — now one image has gone viral, for all the wrong reasons.” On Monday morning the Sydney radio host Alan Jones also repeated the hoax claim. “Why did climate protesters leave Sydney’s famous Hyde Park littered with tonnes of waste and plastic bottles?” Jones asked, reading out an ill-informed letter from a listener and failing to correct the record."

================================================
Heartland Institute’s 6th International Climate Conference Concludes
While climate tourists were meeting for the zillionth time to talk about rescuing the Kyoto Protocol and spreading a party-atmosphere at the taxpayers’ expense in Berlin, elite climate scientists met in Washington for the 6th time (privately financed), and agreed: The global climate is as normal as it has ever been – only the politics in a few countries (foremost Germany) is getting more and more out of whack.
 In Berlin concerned German Environment Minister Norbert Röttgen was doing his best to encourage the stalled and disappointed UN climate rescuers, and demanded they not relent in their attempts to avert the imaginary climate catastrophe. After all climate change is “a crisis for humanity”. For Röttgen and his Climadonna Merkel it’s nothing less. In contrast, everything at the 6th International Climate Conference in Washington was factual and based on science, and not fear and emotions. What follows are some impressions by EIKE’s President, Dr. Holger Thuss”
“About 250 participants and media representatives made their way to Washington to the 6th International Conference on Climate Change of the Heartland Institute (ICCC-6), a think-tank in Chicago. Organizers set out to challenge the so-called consensus on man-made global warming. The most important result of the conference which ended on the first of July was that such a consensus does not exist. 
The most important presentations were made by Dr. Patrick  J. Michaels (George Mason University / Cato Institute), Prof. Dr. S. Fred Singer (Emeritus of the University of Virginia) and Prof. Bob Carter (Queensland University, Australia). In his presentation Michaels concentrated on the historical background of the climate debate, where the organisational prerequisites were created already back in the 1940s. A big problem, says Michaels, is especially the existing combination of science funding with political-strategic planning by politicians. 
Prof. Singer introduced the updated progress report of the 2009/10 NIPCC Climate Report of the independent scientists. Prof. Bob Carter reported on the detailed study of the New Zealand temperature data, which also showed a strange upward jump in temperatures very similar to the famous hockey stick manipulations (Climategate), where experts were able to find major flaws. Also here raw data “disappeared”.
Special emphasis has to be placed on the contributions by Marc Morano (ClimateDepot.org and CFACT) and Anthony Watts (Wattsupwiththat.com), who run 2 of the most important skeptic websites globally. While Morano delivered a large quantity of new information on the status of climate policy, Watts provided the unmistakable many and wide range of error sources when recording and measuring of important weather data. Moreover Morano, Watts and other speakers emphasized that the politicization of the climate climate debate has continued to increase since the last conference. In all western countries it is being attempted to drive climate-change education into the minds of young children at schools by incorporating a binding curriculum – but only with minimal success. In contrast, there are questionable scientific facts which are being also legally challenged in countries like the USA and Australia. Also information on the status of this was provided.
The most problematic country in the west concerning the subject of climate change remains – this became clear during the conference – Germany. Especially during the breaks observers from Germany were again and again asked worried questions about the German “Sonderweg“, i.e. different path.”

Share this...FacebookTwitterA reader brings our attention to a paper published by the Quaternary Science Reviews, authored by Liang Chen, Karin A.F. Zonneveld, and Gerard J.M. Versteegh of the University of Bremen: Short term climate variability during “Roman Classical Period” in the eastern Mediterranean.This one is about a temperature reconstruction from Southern Italy going back 2000 years. The abstract states:
Climatic and environmental reconstructions based on a dinoflagelate cyst record from a well dated site in the Gulf of Taranto located at the distal end of the Po-river discharge plume have been established with high temporal resolution in order to obtain insight into potential forcing of short-term climatic and oceanographic variability in the southern Italian region during the “Roman Classical Period” (60 BC – AD 200).
So how much does the reconstruction say us humans and our CO2 emissions have warmed the planet since the Roman days? Here’s what the abstract concludes (emphasis added):
The dinoflagellate cyst association indicates that local sea surface temperatures which in this region are strongly linked to local air temperatures were slightly higher than today. We reconstruct that sea surface temperatures have been relatively high and stable between 60 BCeAD 90 and show a decreasing trend after AD 90.”
It was warmer back then!  Gee, did greenhouse gases cause the warming during the time of the Romans? What could it have been, we all wonder? Stop wracking your brains, the answer is:
Fluctuations in temperature and river discharge rates have a strong cyclic character with main cyclicities of 7 – 8 and 11 years.”
11 years? Now why does this number sound familiar? Could it have anything to do with a certain solar cycle that is very well known (at least outside of the IPCC)? The abstract continues:
We argue that these cycles are related to variations of the North Atlantic Oscillation climate mode. A strong correlation is observed with global variation in delta14C anomalies suggesting that solar variability might be one of the major forcings of the regional climate. Apart from cyclic climate variability we observed a good correlation between non-cyclic temperature drops and global volcanic activity indicating that the latter forms an additional major forcing factor of the southern Italian climate during the Roman Classical Period.”
Yet another reconstruction showing the sun at work. Today, however, the sun doesn’t do anything. At least that’s what the experts at the IPCC would like to have us believe.

Share this...FacebookTwitterUPDATE 8/20: For whatever reason, Frank Abel has completely taken down his post. Most likely it did not amuse some particular persons.
==================================We all know that seasonal forecasts looking 90 days or so into the future are not easy to make and have considerable uncertainty. But that hasn’t kept some bold meteorologists from going out and issuing 3-month seasonal forecasts that even include the week-by-week weather development for the period, and claiming up to 80% probability they will be right. I’m not aware of any technology that would allow that.
And who can forget the forecasts of “barbecue summers”?
Increasingly a number of serious meteorologists are now getting annoyed by these crackpot crystal ball forecasts, which are eagerly spread by the media and never turn out to be correct.
One vocal critic is German meteorologist Frank Abel here, who is a weatherman at MeteoGroup Deutschland GmbH in Berlin, part of the biggest private European weather company.
Abel took two prominent summer-2011 forecasts made by 2 popular German meteorologists back in March and May respectively, and tells us today how they panned out. Abel:
In summary what they did get right was (like with a horoscope) purely by chance.”
He then quotes the Institute for Weather and Climate Communication (IWK) in Hamburg concerning the forecasts made by the 2 meteorologists.
Frank Böttcher of the IWK told me what he thought: ‘What does that tell us? Their projections are worse than if they had been picked randomly.”
Indeed Abel and dozens of other meteorologists had gotten so fed up with the dubious seasonal forecasts that they banded together back in April and drew up the so-called Hamburg Declaration on Longterm Prognoses, which has since been signed by well over 100 meteorologists. Here it is in English (my translation):

We, the signers of the Hamburg Declaration, do hereby declare:
Long-term prognoses for approaching seasons are among the major targets of meteorology. Generating these prognoses are still at the very early stages of development. For producing such prognoses, research institutes are using super computers, without which, from today’s scientific perspective, it would be impossible to calculate the long-term developments. The results provide information on the monthly-basis anticipated deviations from the mean value and the probability of their occurrence. Such forecasts are currently possible only for very large extended regions.
Using today’s state of the art science, only the following type of forecast for June would be possible: ‘With a probability of 65%, it will be 0.3° to 0.5°C cooler than normal in southern Germany.’ Considerably more accurate forecasts for weeks and days for specific local areas, in the view of the undersigned, are not meteorologically and scientifically tenable and thus serve to damage the reputation of serious meteorologists. Thus the undersigned hereby request that making and publicizing of such prognoses, which give the public the incorrect appearance that it is possible to make accurate forecasts with our current level of knowledge, be avoided.
Signature
================================================
Well how about that – 65% probability a forecast for a period only 2 or 3 months into the future will be correct? Now what should that tell us about forecasts made for 5, 10, 20, 50 or even 100 YEARS down the road? Precisely – also just “horoscopes”, and them actually happening would be “purely by chance.”
Declaration On Climatic Forecasts
I now propose a Declaration on Climatic Forecasts. Serious meteorologists admit that seasonal forecasts are tricky and fraught with huge uncertainties. So isn’t it only appropriate that climatologists stop fooling the public and admit that their decadal and 100-year forecasts are also highly uncertain?
And please spare us the bullcrap that weather forecasts and climate prognoses are completely different. If anything, for obvious reasons, climatic prognoses are even far more difficult and thus uncertain.
One only has to consider that there is absolutely no agreement today among scientists on the strengths of forcings from the vast array of factors that act on our climate.
Science begins with honesty.

This will certainly be one of the major points of focus at this year’s conference.

That’s why distinguished speakers such as Prof. Dr. Jan Veizer, Prof. Dr. Nir Shaviv and Prof. Dr. Henrik Svensmark are slated to tell us more about it and the reaction from the scientific community.
I attended last year’s conference and I can tell you it was worth every minute, and I intend to go this year as well. A number of other bloggers were there too. Andrew Montford will also be a speaker.

Share this...FacebookTwitterHere’s a presentation by the past Chairman of the American Solar Energy Industry, Armageddonist Chuck Kutscher, another person who can only be happy if he’s convinced the future is filled with doom and gloom.

h/t: Chris Smith
This is Al Gore repackaged. This is really a sorrowful, populist presentation. How did Kutscher get a PhD! We will redebunk this point by point.
It’s getting late – and I’ve watched the first half. Will finish tomorrow.
I can tell you right now that Fritz Vahrenholt’s and Sebastian Lüning’s new book Die kalte Sonne, using the latest data and peer-reviewed literature, completely demolishes every single point Kutscher makes. Sheesh – Kutscher is still stuck on TSI!
I can’t believe there are so many gullible suckers out there like Chris taking this crap in hook, line and sinker.
Debunking the presentation:
1. 4:30 mark – “Well-heeled misinformation campaign.” That’s bogus. Most of the doubt arises from privately run blogs with little or no money (Climate Audit, WUWT, etc.) and a rapidly growing number of skeptical scientists who are finding loads of flaws in the science. From time to time some media outlets are reporting on this. Public observation has also failed to detect the occurrence of any of the horror predictions. The warmist movement on the other hand is funded by billions.
2. 5:00 mark – “Climategate e-mails show the scientists wanted to get the message out.” Oh, that’s why they defied the requirements of thr FOIA and refused to make the data public. Read The Hockey Stick Illusion

3. 5:30 mark – “Independent panels exonnerated the Climategate scientists.” It’s proven that these were whitewashes led by warmist hacks. McIntyre has gone through all that.
4. 9:15 mark – “Mann’s hockey stick was fundamentally correct.” The national Academy of Sciences said Mann’s hockey stick was rubbish. The new ones that were made to replace it were also shown by McIntyre to be flawed as well. Don’t worry, we will go back and dig it all up again. The 2007 IPCC report did drop it. The one they depicted on page 457 was buried under the updated ones, which brought back the Medieval Warm Period and the Little Ice Age.  Here’s the IPCC hockey stick history.

Share this...FacebookTwitterARD German public television presented a short clip of Fritz Vahrenholt  and the contents of his new book during its early morning show on Monday. ARD had an agitated Prof Mojib Latif on to respond.It is still unclear why Latif is agitated with Vahrenholt to begin with, as they both agree that CO2 is only half responsible for the recent warming.
Most likely it all has something to do with Latif’s love of being in the media limelight. He’ll say anything to get on TV.
Lüning responds to Latif’s TV comedy
Sebastian Lüning, co-author of the book “Die kalte Sonne” together with Vahrenholt, responds to Latif’s comments at his http://www.kaltesonne.de website, which I present in English as follows:
Early risers today were able see a report about “Die kalte Sonne” on the ARD-Morgen magazin. The report gave an overview of the book’s positions and of Fritz Vahrenholt. Then Mojib Latif appeared in the studio, and was visibly agitated with Vahrenholt. In addition to a tirade that is truly worth watching, Latif attempted to refute the book’s main assertions. According to Latif, it could be shown just by looking at the temperature development of the stratosphere that the sun has no big impact on the course of the climate, CO2 and the sun here would lead to completely different developments. Both of these competing climate factors would each have their own characteristic fingerprint, and so it would be possible to distinguish between the two. Latif: ‘Up there 30, 40, 50 kilometers in altitude we are measuring a massive cooling. And that is precisely the effect of of CO2. That can only be explained by CO2…” .
The audience, comprised mainly of laymen, probably were impressed by Latif’s every word. Latif then delivered the knockout punch, and summarized for the audience: ‘That means that I don’t need 400 pages to show it’s the sun. I need a full two sentences to show that it’s CO2.’

Unfortunately for Prof. Latif, stratospheric cooling cannot be in any way a strong indicator for a powerful climate impact by CO2 because:
1) The cooling of the stratosphere occurred mainly during the 1980-1995 phase, a time when the ozone layer was thinned out by FCKW emissions, as the following figure depicts:

Source: Ozone concentration/stratosphere (left) and temperatures/stratosphere (right): Avajon et al. 2007, also see webpage of Prof. Scott Mandia and webpage of Markus Gronotte.
The thinning out of the ozone led to a continuous decline in stratospheric absorbed solar energy, which led to a cooling in the stratosphere. In the 1990s, CFC emissions were cranked back by the Montreal Protocol and the ozone layer has been slowly recovering since 1995. Since 1995 there’s been no significant temperature changes – the values have been oscillating about a plateau.
For Latif, explaining why CO2 is the dominant driver can be done in only two sentences. Exposing these people for who they really are is turning out to be much easier than imagined. In the interview he says he did not even buy the book, and that he only read a few excerpts of it. Latif is not serious with his conclusion on the book.

"In the Mall, up Whitehall, or crossing Trafalgar Square early this morning, the climate activists looked like rush-hour office workers and civil servants – mainly 30 to 50-year-olds, with no dreadlocked tree-huggers, SWP banners or black-masked anarchists looking for a punch-up. Chanting about the climate emergency, frankly, they seemed a bit sheepish, not used to it. Their ordinariness makes Extinction Rebellion, or XR, especially effective: farmers, scientists, doctors, Cumbrians and other local platoons stand at the 12 key roadblocks. After their successful capture of central London in April, local cells or “affinity groups” all over the country have trained and planned for this protest. Deciding who would be “arrestable” for highway obstruction – and who wouldn’t be, because of jobs or young families – they were primed to expect a tougher police response after rightwing press complaints against the friendly policing last April, when officers were caught dancing at a blocked Oxford Circus. “I do wonder if protest makes a difference,” an office manager in her 40s from Hertfordshire said to me. “But what else can you do? My children really made me feel I must.” A steward in a pink gilet, a mother from south London, said the same: “It was my children who got me into this.” Thousands more are expected to join. For those who doubt the effect of last April’s XR protests, Ben Page of Ipsos Mori says: “In our polls in 2013, 59% said the planet was ‘heading for disaster’. This year it’s gone up to 78%.” He reckons Greta Thunberg, the school strikes and XR action played their part. What packs an extra punch is that London is just one of 60 global cities engaged in “uprising” at the same time. To those who say why bother, when the UK is too small for our carbon emissions to matter, this synchronised global action reaches all those leaders who attended last month’s UN climate change summit – where the UN general secretary warned: “We face a direct existential threat.”  I think few of these protesters read the rightwing press to know what they’re up against. In a double-page spread in the Mail on Sunday, Douglas Murray, Spectator associate editor and author of Neoconservatism: Why We Need it, launched a blistering attack on climate protesters and soft policing tactics. He writes: “Their refusal to acknowledge any view but their own deranged belief and their defiance of democratic norms is authoritarian, even fascistic … Despite the childish certainty these extremists promote, the science of climate change is deeply contested. Most scientists agree there are variations going on but they disagree on exactly what causes it.” So that’s where the climate deniers are now, ignoring Nasa’s survey showing 97% of global climate scientists agree that the five warmest years have been the past five, “extremely likely due to human activities”. Never mind the science: what free-market obsessives like Murray can’t bear is that solving the climate crisis requires state and international action. He would rather boil to oblivion, faithful to his free-market creed, than see the planet saved by means he regards as statist or even socialist. “Anarchists” and “warmed-over communists” demanding “draconian solutions”, he calls the protesters. His disgust spews out at Thunberg, “this privileged young girl … hectoring others on things she barely understands … delivering unhinged sermons to the credulous global elites”. Among the deadly weapons used against activists is that too many are middle class, and they are all climate hypocrites. Progressives are prone to self-flagellation, but being climate-pure is impossible. Do what you can, cast off the guilt. Murray’s is the blind rage of the losing side. David Attenborough is believed, not the Mail on Sunday. Even delivery drivers angry at the roadblocks weren’t denying the gravity of the cause. Weekly the news tells of sea ice and glaciers melting, species vanishing, the emergency evident: pollsters find people well understand it and trust the scientists who say humans are the cause. Murray accuses XR of wanting to “engineer the complete destruction of the global economic system”. But this highly democratic group is carefully nonprescriptive. All they ask is for politicians to accept the emergency, for a much tighter target than 2050 for net-zero carbon (the UK is already badly behind, our statutory Committee on Climate Change says) – and for a citizens assembly, such as President Macron has just set up with a sample group of 150 citizens to advise on how France can cut carbon emissions. That’s the task: finding solutions people will vote for. At the party conferences, the Tories barely mentioned climate, while Boris Johnson talks of fuel tax cuts. But Labour puts a green industrial strategy at the heart of its spending plans, building renewables in wind and solar, solar panels and insulation for a million social homes, £3.6bn on charging points and free loans for electric cars, nationalising the grid for a vast expansion of 37 offshore wind farms, tidal energy from Swansea Bay and no fracking. The UK may be entering a climate culture change that Page compares to the shift in our lifetimes from locking up gay people to a recent poll that found 66% would have no concerns about a same-sex marriage in the royal family. Flying, driving, eating beef may go the way of smoking – but only if the heavy lifting is done by the state. • Polly Toynbee is a Guardian columnist"

"Scientists are working to breed sheep that produce less greenhouse gases in order to reduce their impact on the environment. The Grass to Gas initiative will combine international scientific and industry expertise to measure two major factors affecting the environmental consequences of the livestock – feed efficiency and methane emissions.  Its goal is to develop ways to identify animals with a lower impact, which can then be selected for breeding programmes. Nicola Lambe, a sheep geneticist at Scotland’s Rural College (SRUC), said: “The reduction in greenhouse gas emissions is a global issue requiring a transnational and transdisciplinary approach. “The project aims to produce tools to measure, or accurately predict, feed efficiency and methane emissions from both individual animals and sheep systems, which will provide the international industry with the means to breed, feed and manage sheep with reduced environmental impact as part of genetic improvement initiatives. “It will also contribute towards addressing the argument about the effect of eating meat on global warming, with sheep making use of land often unsuitable for other agricultural production, except conifers – at least in the UK.” The first phase of the three-year project, which runs until September 2022, will test different methods for their ability to accurately predict feed intake and methane emissions from sheep. Using technologies that show promise, researchers will then investigate the relationship between these two factors from sheep housed both indoors and at pasture. Genetic control of emissions and feeding will also be looked at in the project, by assessing the differences due to breed, parent, genetic line or breeding values. The research led by SRUC will use lambs bred from male sheep – known as sires – sourced from the Texel Sheep Society’s Texelplus programme, to investigate the effects of sire and breeding values on these measurements. Data will also be analysed to quantify the economic and environmental benefits of improvements in feed efficiency and reduced greenhouse gas emissions. The UK part of the project will receive £250,000 in funding from the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, the Research Council of Norway and New Zealand’s Ministry for Primary Industries."
"Ridhima Pandey was just nine years old in 2017 when she filed a lawsuit against the Indian government for failing to take action against climate change. Pandey’s fierce, astounding passion for the environment is not accidental. Her mother is a forestry guard and her father an environmental activist; and the whole family was displaced by the Uttarakhand floods of 2013, which claimed hundreds of lives. In Kenya Kaluki Paul Mutuku has been actively involved in conservation since college, where he was a member of an environmental awareness club, and has been a member of the African Youth Initiative on Climate Change since 2015. Raised in rural Kenya by a single mother, Mutuku’s vigorous activism, like Pandey’s, was inspired by the direct challenges his family (and wider community) faced from the effects of climate change: “Growing up, I witnessed mothers cover kilometres to fetch water,” he says.  For years, young people across the world have been campaigning to draw attention to the crisis our planet faces, and to tackle it. Yet it seems the media is only interested in one young climate activist. Without doubt, the remarkable Greta Thunberg is a superstar. In just one year, she has gone from being an unknown teenager, living in the comfort of a middle-class home in Sweden, to being one of the most recognised faces on the planet. She is fearless, earnest, passionate about the planet and determined. But so are her peers. Born in a wealthy country, to parents who can afford to accommodate their daughter’s convictions, and in a culture where children are encouraged to speak up, Thunberg has intersecting privileges. She is aware of this and regularly mentions her fellow youth activists in her speeches, to remind journalists that there are others working alongside her. People such as the teenager Aditya Mukarji, who in March 2018 began a war against plastic straws. Within just five months, he had already helped replace more than 500,000 plastic straws at restaurants and hotels in New Delhi. “People listen more to children bringing up environmental concerns,” he says. Last year Nina Gualinga, an indigenous activist from the Ecuadorian Amazon since the age of eight, won the WWF’s top youth conservation award. At 15, Autumn Peltier from the Anishinaabe people of Canada, is a veteran clean water and climate advocate. And Leah Namugerwa is a 15-year-old Ugandan activist.  There are many more whose names we rarely, if ever, hear. Yet, frustratingly, these other activists are often referred to in the media as the “Greta Thunberg” of their country, or are said to be following in her footsteps, even in cases where they began their public activism long before she started hers – their own identities and work almost completely erased by a western media that rarely recognises progress outside its own part of the world. This tendency of the media to present Thunberg as the one who calls, and the others existing only to heed her call, is problematic, especially for those black and brown activists whose media invisibility leads to invisibility to organisations whose help they could greatly benefit from. This “white saviour” narrative invalidates the impact of locals working in their communities, and perpetuates the stereotype of “the native with no agency” who cannot help themselves. As an African I find these portrayals deeply offensive. It is insulting to present the members of the communities most threatened by climate change as passive onlookers who are only now being spurred on by the “Thunberg effect”. Why did it take a Thunberg for the UN to organise its first youth climate summit? Those most affected should not be exiled to the fringes of the conversation. These other activists are being told their works, their contributions, don’t matter. The privileging of one campaigner’s narrative over others creates a world where Namugerwa would mention a Swedish teenager she only heard about a year ago as inspiration, but not Wangari Maathai, the environmentalist from neighbouring Kenya who won the Nobel peace prize in 2004. One could argue that it is natural for Namugerwa to find inspiration in a young girl close to her in age, but it is also likely that Maathai’s Green Belt Movement influenced her and her friends’ decision to plant trees on their birthdays to help the environment. Planting trees. Collecting litter. Striking for the environment. I am in awe of all the young people calling attention to a very real and urgent problem. I applaud all of them for doing what they can, in big and small ways, to combat climate change. I must also acknowledge the young children in Kenya and Nigeria and other parts of the developing world who make toys out of recycled plastic and metal, and who would probably not know to call themselves climate advocates. I applaud Bangladesh for being the first country to ban plastic bags in 2002, and Rwanda for banning non-biodegradable plastic in 2008 (and Kigali for being named by the UN as Africa’s cleanest city). One day at a time, our collective efforts may yet save the planet. And while we continue to work towards that goal, the moral thing for western media to do is to also highlight the contributions of the black and brown saviours trying to make that happen so that when future generations talk of it, this will not be the story of a single narrative. • Chika Unigwe is a Nigerian writer.

"In the last week alone, members of Extinction Rebellion have been described as ecomaniacs (Daily Mail), ecoradicals ignoring our economic doom (Times), dangerous and a bloody mess (Daily Telegraph). They have been accused of “pulling 83,000 officers away from their normal duties” according to the police and costing Scotland Yard £16m. In London last week, dressed in funereal black, rebels tried to paint the Treasury red using 1,800 litres of fake blood and an old fire engine with a sign reading “stop funding climate death”. While its actions may seem controversial in some quarters, Extinction Rebellion’s rise and influence have undoubtedly been extraordinary, galvanising young and old across party lines. Last October, the journalist and activist George Monbiot introduced the group in the national press, a homegrown movement “devoted to disruptive, non-violent disobedience in protest against ecological collapse”. The hope was to turn a national uprising into an international one by March. In fewer than 12 months, Extinction Rebellion has become the fastest-growing environmental organisation in the world.  “We have seen protest movements on climate change before, but they haven’t attracted anywhere near as many people or had as much impact,” said Clare Saunders, professor in environmental politics at Exeter University. “For the first time, you have ordinary people engaging with radical action. It’s unique – I can’t think of any [protest movement] historically happening in that way.” There are now an estimated 485 Extinction Rebellion affiliates across the globe and, over the next fortnight, they are promising to shut down 60 cities, including London, New York, Buenos Aires, Sydney, Cape Town and Mumbai. Government buildings, airports and financial districts will all be targeted with protests aiming for maximum disruption to provoke urgent political action. In a bid to pre-empt the action, on Saturday police raided a warehouse in south London and arrested nine activists, charging them with conspiracy to cause a public nuisance and obstruct the highway. How did they come so far, so quickly? The Observer has watched the movement at work in city centres, at festivals and meetings across the UK to try to find out. “It’s maintaining hope in people because people are feeling so worn out by the inaction,” said Steven from Cardiff, who joined the summer uprising in the city in July. When the Observer met him, he and his partner Clare were sitting on the green outside the town hall, where Extinction Rebellion had set up base with a boat, an impromptu campsite and stalls serving free food to the public. “I’m not sure the damage to the planet is irreversible at this point – all the science points that way, it’s grim reading – but this is pricking people’s ears up more than any other group, and that can only be a good thing.” The Cardiff rebellion, staged over three days, saw a massive police presence deployed as a procession of families and activists marched through the city centre. Jules Bywater, a builder of eco-homes, had travelled from Powys to join the action. “People think going vegan, banning single-use plastic and recycling will stop climate change – it won’t. Government has to act, and it’s on us to cause these disruptions to force them to. This has to be a mass movement.” Alice Taherzadeh, a PhD student and one of the key organisers, was buoyant but exhausted. “We had less than a month to get this together,” she said. As a decentralised organisation, XR, as it is known, claims no hierarchy: it is open to all and operates a “regenerative culture”. In theory, this means responsibility and workload is designed to be a shared, collaborative effort with heavy emphasis on community, and mental and physical wellbeing. In practice, a hierarchy does still exist, albeit under the surface, where some people are in the loop, go to the pub together and have access to the latest comings and goings from HQ, while others volunteer more on the periphery. Still, to witness it across uprisings in London in the spring, and across the UK over the summer at festivals and meetings, the spirit of XR is warm and often moving. The culture it has fostered also allows for a surprising amount of internal criticism of its founders, Roger Hallam and Gail Bradbrook. “The movement and its principles are far bigger than both of them; they’re not these messianic figures they’re made out to be,” said Taherzadeh wearily. Hallam is a former organic farmer who went on to study civil disobedience at King’s College London after “the weather went weird” and caused his business to fail. He formed XR with Bradbrook, an academic involved with Occupy and anti-fracking protests, and the two have championed non-violent resistance and civil disobedience. Their methods, including advocating a shutdown of Heathrow, have been effective but divisive. “I don’t think Roger is the best spokesperson, necessarily,” said Taherzadeh. “Some of his tactics – drones at Heathrow for instance – have caused huge conflict. But the unity in the movement exists because of the three core demands: get government to tell the truth, get government to act now, and to draw up citizens’ assemblies.” There is a quiet desperation and sometimes despair at how hard and possibly futile any personal effort seems in the face of the climate crisis. But those touched by Extinction Rebellion find it impossible to ignore the ways in which they are contributing to global heating. This isn’t just about recycling, switching to bamboo toothbrushes and buying in bulk; people are re-insulating their homes, dramatically scaling back family holidays to eradicate air travel and, in increasing numbers, deciding not to have children at all. “I’m scared of my own future,” said Dahlia, a 20-year-old student at the Bristol uprising. “How could anyone think about having kids now? It’s not even just about the carbon footprint and population growth … what kind of world are you thinking they’re going to live in?” The summer rebellion in Bristol took over the city centre and installed a pink boat and white gazebos on the Bristol Bridge. Billy Bragg performed, and hundreds joined talks and workshops explaining how activism works, how to get involved and what legal rights might be for protesters who get arrested.  But it isn’t just for the loud and energetic, or those willing to go to prison for the cause. At a crafting session in Totnes, a dozen women quietly work on their “craftivist” skills; almost every one joined XR in the last few months, and they volunteer as behind-the-scenes environmentalists making flags, banners and the like. Some are put off by the noise and physical toll of being on the streets; others describe themselves as too introverted to protest in that way. Yet the zeal is still palpable. “We’ve just spent our family holiday in the UK,” said Sarah Strachan. “Once you learn about it, read up on it … I can’t countenance how we could fly somewhere. You just can’t, and it does consume you. But how can you not try?” Strachan works as an artist in Totnes and lives with her partner and their son and daughter. She began making tiny doll figures of the school strikers last year, as a casual distraction from the puppets she was already crafting in her home studio. Nine months ago, she had barely heard of Extinction Rebellion, but in the summer she joined the rebellion in Bristol and is working for the next one. At home and at work, the climate crisis has engulfed her; last month, Ghost, her biggest piece yet, went on display in a local church and is set to tour next year. In it, she assembled 1,000 donated and secondhand toy plastic animals, painted them white and installed them as an eerie-looking herd. “It came from the horrible realisation that these plastic animals will be around for hundreds of years and will outlive some, if not all, of the animals they’re modelled on. How have we let this happen?” Extinction Rebellion’s success goes beyond the efforts of its volunteers, known as rebels, who are determined, as they are often heard to say, to be on the right side of history. Business has also been under by pressure to respond to a shift in public opinion. A sustainable building designer, who asked not to give his name, said: “Extinction Rebellion have had a tangible impact. Would things be moving as fast otherwise? Shortly after [the spring rebellion], the UK government became the first to pledge to cut [greenhouse gas emissions] to almost zero by 2050. Every architectural and engineering practice has been or should be trying to work out how net-zero carbon can be delivered.” Since XR’s launch, the architecture, engineering and construction industries have all declared a climate emergency, committing to work together to reduce emissions and work in a sustainable fashion. At least 232 councils out of 408 across the UK have followed suit. Possibly as a gesture, 15 universities including Bristol, Newcastle, Manchester and Goldsmiths have done the same, as has the UK music industry and “Culture”, an umbrella group of more than 50 organisations and artists. The National Theatre and the Royal Shakespeare Company have severed financial ties with Shell and BP respectively. It remains to be seen what all this activity translates into: while some organisations have simply adopted the vernacular, many are actively working to force change in their industries. Either way, Extinction Rebellion has been credited as a catalyst – albeit not one without criticism within the environmental movement. “Some grassroots groups hate them because they’re not anti-capitalist [enough], they are for-profit and pro-arrest,” said one anonymous worker from a major environmental organisation. “The pro bono lawyers’ group Green and Black Cross [GBC] have been working with activists for decades and they’ve taken on so much casework for XR – for free, despite them raising so much money and the core crew being paid – that it’s taken away from other crucial activism work.” Earlier in the summer, GBC ended its relationship with XR, citing “serious concerns about the safety of both legal observers and those taking part in action associated with Extinction Rebellion”. Meanwhile, Wretched of the Earth, “a grassroots collective for indigenous, black, brown and diaspora groups and individuals demanding climate justice”, wrote an open letter to XR asking that their voices and experiences not be erased from the fight. “Making people feel guilty without offering anything else is a waste,” said Sylvia Kingston on the bridge at the Bristol rebellion, when asked whether XR could do better to engage marginalised communities. She described herself as a pensioner standing up for my grandchildren” who, like so many others at XR gatherings, claimed she wasn’t an activist, “or a hippy”, or particularly on the left. “You want people to feel energised, which is why things like this are so necessary. Perpetual despair will burn you out … My generation, people like me, can afford to be here – and they should be.” While the momentum behind XR shows no sign of slowing yet, answers for what happens next aren’t in easy supply. “We’re not claiming to have solutions,” said Bywater. “There are experts for that, there is a great deal of technology, there is plenty of knowledge to be harnessed. What we’re doing is telling government to listen to that. To act. And that pressure can only come from more of us being here.” It’s seen as good that minds are being changed, even if XR’s demands are not always perceived as realistic. “They must know what they’re asking for – net zero carbon by 2025 – is virtually impossible. I guess their statement is a calculated risk,” said the building designer. Saunders agreed. “There are very good reasons that Greenpeace and WWF will have to publicly distance themselves from XR – if you have more radical actions out there, your organisation’s demands might seem reasonable and palatable to a government taking steps to act.”"
"Teams full of similar people underperform. While sameness can create cohesion, cookie-cutter teams can’t successfully compete with diverse teams that can draw on a broad range of talents, perspectives and insights. At least that’s what empirical data from lefty organisations including McKinsey, Credit Suisse and the IMF have to say. But facts have a well-known leftwing bias, so maybe a sporting analogy will help. The Men’s Rugby World Cup is now being played in Japan. Being a men’s competition, the teams are comprised solely of blokes, but there is still an incredible diversity in the physical and performance attributes of players involved. The tallest player, Rory Arnold, is 6 foot 10 inches while the shortest player, Fumiaki Tanaka of Japan, is 5 foot 5 inches. Some players have more than a decade of representative experience, while others are new to the World Cup. Some are fast, some are strong, some can really kick and some can really jump. The only thing that can be said for certain is that the team that wins the Rugby World Cup will not be full of clones of the “ideal player”.  There are lots of reasons why our parliaments, our company boards and our media feed should be as diverse as the communities that we live in. The main one is fairness. Most Australians aren’t white men between 50 and 70 years old (though I almost am!) but many of our most important institutions are chock full of men who fit that bill. Indeed, there are more men named John who run big companies in Australia than there are women. And more men named Peter. And David. Given that there is no evidence that men or Caucasians are more intelligent, creative or strategic than women or people of other races, it is inconceivable that the current gender and racial distribution of powerful positions is based on merit. Fairness alone requires this problem to be fixed. And then there is performance. Lest I invite the full fury of the rightwing commentariat for talking beyond my expertise, it’s probably best that I simply quote the virtue signallers from the International Monetary Fund who concluded that: “Our analysis springs from the observation – supported by considerable microeconomic evidence – that women and men bring different skills and perspectives to the workplace, including different attitudes to risk and collaboration. Studies have also shown that the financial performance of firms improves with more gender-equal corporate boards.” Achieving diversity among our leaders isn’t a purely progressive objective. Even Scott Morrison agrees, in principle, that his party needs to recruit more women into parliament. But, much like his “in-principle” commitment to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, he simply hasn’t been able to achieve much progress on gender equity yet. The main reason that we need diversity in our leaders is that our leaders are more than the sum of the decisions they make on our behalf. Leaders, via their behaviour and their identity, say something important about the organisations they represent, and about our society. Which brings me to Greta Thunberg. There is no doubt that older white men have a dominant voice in the Australian media landscape. And there is also no doubt that some of the loudest of those white male voices expressed the most outrage that a young woman was given a global platform on which to speak. Much has been written about why so many old conservative men felt so angry that a young woman would speak truth to power. But what sticks out for me is that the Australian men who raged the loudest claim to do exactly what Thunberg dared to do. You’d think they would at least applaud her chutzpah. Alan Jones doesn’t let titles like premier or prime minister stop him tearing shreds off guests who are brave enough to come on his show but are not “good enough” to meet the standards he sets for them. Likewise, Andrew Bolt. Whether it was the Liberal prime minister Malcolm Turnbull or the Labor prime minister Julia Gillard, Bolt has felt free to let the world know whenever a politician or business leader doesn’t live up to his expectations. But how dare a young woman hold elected leaders to the same account. How dare a “child”, a “brat”, a mere “girl” have the same sense of entitlement to express her judgment as the old codgers? A former AFL player called Sam Newman asked: “WHO lets this shit have a platform? Mendacious, inbred sycophants, that’s who. #ClimateChangeHoax.” Who indeed. Maybe the 500,000 people who turned up at the march she led in Montreal? Maybe the 300,000 Australians who followed her lead and joined the climate strike last month? But let’s flip the question. Who gives former football players a loud voice in debates about climate change? Who gives Alan Jones the right to use violent language against female politicians? You guessed it, the boards and chief executives – who are overwhelmingly male. If corporate boards in Australia had a majority of young women setting organisational strategy and culture, it is hard to believe that men who repeatedly incite violence against women would remain on air. Similarly, it’s hard to believe that climate denial would be as common on boards dominated by younger people as it is in Australia today. Leaders matter. As former army chief Lieutenant General David Morrison once said: “The standard you walk past is the standard you accept.” For decades, Australian parliaments and corporate boards have accepted climate denial, racism, sexism and even violence against women as “the price we pay to live in a free country” or even “just the way people are”. But the world – and Australia – is gradually changing, even if the loudest voices are not. It took 119 years to overturn the New South Wales law against abortion and, when it finally happened, conservative Coalition MPs complained that the process was “rushed”. Similarly, it was conservative Coalition MPs who thought we “rushed” the equal marriage decision too. And, unsurprisingly, it’s the same group of people who believe we shouldn’t “rush” into reducing greenhouse gas emissions either. One of the most important roles our leaders play is to decide which problems are urgent and which can wait. Scott Morrison’s Coalition wants to prevent the use of the term “almond milk” and inquire into discrimination against men in the family courts. Greta Thunberg thinks we should stop building new coalmines and urgently increase investment in renewable energy. But who is she to say what’s important and what’s not? Doesn’t she know? We have parliaments, boards and a media full of older men to tell us what’s important. That’s why diversity really matters. • Richard Denniss is the chief economist at the Australia Institute"

Share this...FacebookTwitterThere’s been lots of disingenuous criticism from the CO2 end-of the world warmists and Armageddonists aimed at Fritz Vahrenholt’s and Sebastian Lüning’s new best selling skeptic book Die kalte Sonne. Much of it attacking Svensmark’s theory of solar amplification via cosmic rays.
Again. none have really read the book, they simply repeat the same old debunked arguments.
Henrik Svensmark hits back at the skeptics at the Die kalte Sonne site (scroll down to the English version):
Prof. Henrik Svensmark, Danish National Space Center (Copenhagen) on the criticism aimed at his solar amplifier via cosmic rays: 
Some people, including your critic Florian Freistetter on ScienceBlog, seem to think that physics is a democratic process and what matters is to count how many papers favour or disfavour each hypothesis. That of course is nonsense. All that really signifies is the evidence from observations and experiments, and how a theory stands up to attempts to falsify it. Remember Einstein’s comment on the pamphlet Hundert Autoren gegen Einstein (1931) – “If I were wrong, one would be enough”.
The hypothesis that cosmic rays strongly affect the climate offers a serious challenge to the more fashionable hypothesis that man-made greenhouse gases have been the main cause of climate changes. So it does not surprise me that many people try to falsify it. In fact it’s quite flattering that they go to so much trouble, when one good outcome (for them) should be enough, and in my opinion no such paper has been produced so far.
Freistetter suggests that all the recent papers say I’m wrong. That shows he is not very familiar with the climate physics literature. I think he has gone to some trouble to select papers against the cosmic-ray theory and ignore the favourable ones. Continue…
For the climate end-of-worlders  and critics like Freistetter, it would help to first climb out of the holes of ignorance before spouting off. Try reading for once. Freistetter admitted to ramming his head into the sand: “I never read the book. I didn’t want to buy it.” He doesn’t want to deal with arguments he can’t beat.
In his recent Blog-Artikel, Freistetter provided 1001 reasons why Prof. Svensmark is wrong about his solar amplifier via cosmic rays theory. Unfortunately for Freistetter, CERN’s results and historical correlations between sun and climate are ignoring his junk science.

Share this...FacebookTwitterUsually warmists screech that humans are 95% responsible for the recent warming, and that huge positive water vapor feedbacks will get involved in the future. So it’s not very often you hear a warmist admit that humans perhaps could be just half responsible for the warming of the last 100 years.This is what German climate expert Professor Mojib Latif said in an interview this morning with NDR public radio.
AUDIO HERE!
Forget all the obligatory “we’ve got to cut our emissions soon” stuff. When you look past that, Latif had a few surprises in his interview, mainly he’s keeping the door open that human GHG emissions may not be such a big problem after all. Call it the Great Disappearing Crisis.
1.15 mark: Latif says he sees no positive aspects coming out of Durban, thus confirming it was a failure (warmist point of view).
1.45 mark, Latif:
Durban failed. Durban was the 17th conference of this type, and one now has to ask if such conference make any sense.”

Interesting is at the 3:15 mark. The moderator even now admits that the seriousness of the greenhouse gas problem is actually disputed. This shows that even the media is repositioning. The moderator asks Latif what his view on climate is. Latif replies:
The fact is that there is climate change. The fact is that man is also at least 50% responsible for the warming over the last 100 years.”
50% responsible? If warming has been 0.7°C over the last 100 years, then according to Latif man’s share would only be about one third of a degree Celsius°. That would make a doubling of CO2 look awfully benign.
Latif is now a lukewarmer. Politically, he’s hot on renewable energy. But that’s a different topic.
Some readers will accuse me of twisting Latif’s words. Sorry, but 50% of 0.7°C is about a third of a degree. That’s major back-pedaling.

But once you sink your teeth into it, you find out it isn’t. In fact you wonder if they even put the mixer to the batter. That’s the Durban “deal”.
The TAZ comments:
…that countries will talk until 2015 and that they will obligate themselves beginning in 2020 to legally reduce emissions. Emerging countries like India and China have recognized this, but have gained time and sufficiently expanded the paragraphs to allow the real binding obligations to be undermined. The USA does not have to deal with anything until 2020.”
Der Spiegel writes:
“Greenpeace was disappointed. ‘The watered-down compromise coming from pressure by India and USA will not lead to an international binding climate treaty, but rather to a loosely binding agreement,’ said  Greenpeace climate expert Martin Kaiser. ‘The conference created a last-second loophole for the USA and fossil fuel industries with the help of India.’ Now another protracted negotiation process threatens.

…the result can be interpreted according to one’s own preference. For those who stayed up late into night they can claim that at least a paper everyone can agree on resulted in the end. But the critics point out, and correctly so, that as far as content is concerned, no agreement that would actually limit the emission of CO2 was reached. The appearance of an agreement is preserved.”
The FAZ writes:
Now a new global climate treaty will be negotiated that will include for the first time climate targets for the United Nations and emerging countries such as China and India. Environmentalists complain about the too many loopholes in the agreement.”
Die Zeit writes:
By the year 2015 a legally binding contract is to be drawn up to limit warming to 2°C.
The circus will go on.

Share this...FacebookTwitterFritz Vahrenholt gives a comprehensive interview with leading Austrian daily KURIER here.
Why is it cooling? H/t: Real Science
The interview covers a number of areas. But a few points I found particularly interesting. On the lack of warming since 2000, the KURIER asks if it’s too short of a time period.
Of course it is. But we still need an explanation on why CO2 emissions, which the IPCC says is responsible for global warming, and which rose continuously since 2000, has not caused any warming. There has to be natural causes: the sun and the 60-year ocean cycles –  they were the reasons why we wrote the book.”
Vahrenholt also has words on Germany’s current attempt to move to renewable energy:
We’ve  gone into a hectic rush and today in Germany we are converting wheat into bioethanol, and installing 50% of all the world’s photovoltaic systems in a country that gets as much sunshine as Alaska – namely Germany.  This uncoordinated mad rush is rooted in fear: It’s our fault, we could trigger a climate catastrophe.”
On the IPCC filtering out the sun and other factors:
It is indeed interesting that of the 34 members of the IPCC editorial team that wrote the summary report, one third are connected to the WWF and Greenpeace. That is legitimate, but that has to be made transparent. Imagine just the opposite and the editorial team were one third Exxon supporters. Wouldn’t people say: ‘Hello! Is that really necessary?'”

Vahrenholt on why the climate debate has inquisitorial undercurrents:
Because it has long since not been about a purely scientific issue,  rather it is about how to run society. Some are saying that we are entering an uncontrollable situation, and so claim any means against it is justified.”
Like throwing democracy overboard, as some are advocating. Here Vahrenholt specifically singles out Schellnhuber’s WBGU and his Great Transformation of society masterplan, which calls for:
…changes in consumption behavior, changed trade behavior and that non-sustainable living styles be stigmatized by society.”
On the success of the book?
It’s no. 14 on the Spiegel bestseller list. Of course I hope the book will be read. The worst thing that could happen would be a spiral of silence, a discussion that never gets held. In five or ten years, we’ll know who is right.”
Overall, a solid and convincing interview by the KURIER. This will push book sales in Austria, Switzerland and Bavaria. Readers can visit the “http://kaltesonne.de/” site, which has an English translation button.

Dr. Horst Malburg at the Gegenwind [Counter Wind] Conference at the German North Sea island of Sylt. A translation of the entire interview follows the video below:

Mueller: We are here on the island of Sylt at the conference “Gegenwind” and I have with me Professor Dr. Malberg from Berlin. Professor Malberg, what do you say about wind power with regards to the climate discussion?
Prof. Malberg: Wind power plants cannot be justified by the climate issue. I examined in detail what drives the climate and I looked at all the available data, from Europe, from USA, from Japan –  all data were evaluated, and naturally the global data. It clearly shows that the climate is dominated by the sun, and then on top of that by the oceans, and then a little bit by the CO2 effect. I would estimate it has a magnitude of 10%, for Co2, and not more. More than 80% of the climate change is driven by the sun. That means relative to natural climate change, the influence by CO2 is very small, and so it does not justify any action for climate protection, where wind parks are built in order to save CO2. Sure you can do it, but it won’t have any impact on our climate, at least no real impact.
Mueller (1:33): Germany is a leader in installing wind-parks, and so are the German efforts sensible?
Prof. Malberg: It’s naturally a political decision, that’s clear. But it is also an economic decision because we know it is very expensive. And when we have to transmit the power from wind parks at the coast and into the country all the way to south Germany. Then it is going to be a very expensive transmission. Here at the conference we have seen that it is much cheaper to transport coal or oil than it is to transport electricity. And I believe one day there’s going to be an ugly awakening when we realize how expensive electricity has become.
Mueller (2:25): One reason we should expand wind energy, as you mentioned, is climate change. How true is it that yes, there always has been climate change, but the increase over the last years is especially frightening?
Prof. Malberg: That is in no way based on anything. That is really a huge myth. During the last 13 years, the amount of CO2 in the atmosphere has risen more than at any time since the last Ice Age, especially since the start of the Industrial Revolution. But since the last 10 to 12 years, we have not had any more global warming. The temperature has reached a plateau and has even shown a slight declining trend. That means that while CO2 has increased strongly, the temperature has not reacted at all.
Mueller (3:24): And what do you say to politicians and media who tell us every day to be active for the climate?
Prof. Malberg: My conclusion is one that is completely different: I say it is a basic human right to have clean air, clean water, uncontaminated soil and an ecological system that is intact. That means the highest priority is environmental protection. But humans do not have “a right to a stable climate”. That just does not exist. It never has existed. What is natural about the climate system is that it is not constant, it always changes.  When people speak so often about species dying, then one has to address environmental protection, and not assign everything to climate protection, and to blame it all on a phantom. The temperature increase we have had over the last 150 years of about 0.7°C has occurred multiple times since the last Ice Age, and nature repeatedly withstood it. Today there would be no polar bears if nature was unable to cope in balancing out the natural temperature fluctuations.
Mueller (4:50): What can you take home [from this conference] here in Sylt?
Prof. Malberg: We’ve had an interesting spectrum here. We discussed the climate behaviour. We’ve discussed the clearly measured non-acceleration of sea level. Of course there is a natural sea level rise, but it has not accelerated. We’ve discussed legal topics here at this conference. And finally we have learned from an energy expert that if we go ahead with wind and solar energy, then we have to understand that these two forms of energy depend on the weather. The wind doesn’t always blow, and very often the sun doesn’t shine here. And building solar plants in the desert would mean huge losses of energy because of the long transmission distances. That means we looked at a very broad spectrum of issues that absolutely belong in the public debate.
Mueller (6:00): Professor Mahlberg, thank you for the discussion.

After years of being ignored by AGW climate scientists and modelers, the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation (AMO) has more recently been recognized as a factor in climate forcing.
The Met Office at the December 5-9, 2011 presentation at the Fall AGU Meeting reported that they now use AMO unfiltered in their interannual and decadal climate forecasts.  I have been writing about AMO since 2009 (see below) along with other writers. Some of the articles have appeared on WUWT and ICECAP blogs. More recently Bob Tisdale has done some fine in-depth analysis of AMO [see below]. It is not the intention of this brief article to repeat all that material nor to explain what AMO is, or is not, other than just to summarize as follows:
The AMO is an ongoing series of long-duration changes in the sea surface temperature of the North Atlantic Ocean, with cool and warm phases that may last for 20-40 years at a time and a difference of about 1°F between extremes. These changes are natural and have been occurring for at least the last 1,000 years.
The AMO index is calculated at NOAAPSD by using the Kaplan SST data set (5×5), determining the area-weighted average over the North Atlantic over 0-70N and then detrending this data. The AMO has affected air temperatures over much of the Northern Hemisphere, in particular Eastern North America and Western Europe. For more information on AMO refer to the references at the bottom of this article.
It is the intent of this brief article to offer some preliminary or early results from my own analysis of AMO and the Canadian East Coast climate correlation. I will leave detail analysis to those who make their living in this field.
The AMO seems to be a significant climate factor affecting Canadian East coast surface temperatures, including the air temperatures of the four Maritime provinces, Labrador and Quebec air temperatures and even sometime reaching as far west as Ontario. These areas represent about 20% of Canada’s total surface area.
The first graph shows the Canadian Atlantic Coast Annual Temperature Departure from 1961-1990 averages and the Annual AMO index for the years 1948-2010. This period was picked because it was the only period for which Environment Canada provides temperature data summaries. The graph shows that the Atlantic Coast annual temperature departures seem to fluctuate with the cycles of AMO. The warm cycle when AMO was positive 1926-1964, a cool cycle when AMO was negative or cool 1965-1994, and finally another warm cycle 1995 to the present when AMO has been mostly positive. The year 2010 was the warmest annual year for the Atlantic Coast post 1948 with a departure of 2.1°C.

Figure 2 below shows a similar pattern for the Atlantic Coast but for the winters. Note that the winter AMO index has been scaled up by a factor of 3 for better visibility.

Figure 3 below shows a similar pattern for the winters of Northeastern forests area which includes areas like Labrador, Northern Quebec and Ontario.

Figure 4 below is for the period 1990-2010 and illustrates in detail how the annual Atlantic temperatures went up as AMO went positive or warm in 1995.

Figure 5 below illustrates the post 1998 period and how the Winter Atlantic Coast and Northeastern Forests temperature departures both seem to follow the winter AMO pattern. Both are relatively flat or slightly declining. One can clearly see the temperature drop in 2009 when AMO went briefly negative during early part of 2009 for about 5 months. This may happen again during early 2012.

The sixth and final graph below shows the monthly trend of the AMO index since 2005. As of November it had gone negative for the first time since 2009 at -0.035.

Final comments
Temperature departures in Eastern Canada seem to follow the AMO index as we saw above. I tend to think that the current negative AMO level is temporary and seasonal only. I think the durations of negative and positive AMO cycles are variable and the next sustained negative or cool phase for the AMO may not start for few years more (possibly 2015). In my opinion a cooling will be first observable in the Arctic Ocean SST and in the Arctic atmosphere caused by more high altitude cold atmosphere transferred to lower levels in the Arctic region. The cooler Arctic together with a negative AO will in turn cool the North Atlantic Ocean and the AMO via currents and atmosphere links and eventually cool the land areas of the Eastern Coast of North America and Western Europe.
The predictive value of the negative AMO is that once AMO starts to go negative for a more sustained period (and it can be as long as 60 years and as little as 6 years), it can foretell of sustained global cooling (especially Northern Hemisphere) and adds to the cooling already caused by the cooler SST pattern in the North Eastern Pacific. Such a period existed 1964 -1976 (and to the late 1980’s for Europe) when both PDO and AMO were negative. A stronger negative PDO index is typically a result of both more negative SST anomalies in the NE Pacific in combination with more positive SST anomalies in the Central North Pacific. During the last cooler period for Europe, namely 1962-1987, a period of 26 years, 21 (80%) years had a negative or cool AMO. AMO was last negative from 1964 to 1995 or 31 years and prior to that it was negative from 1902 -1926 or 24 years.

"What do tampons and climate change have in common? It’s not just their environmental toll (seriously: take a look at what’s in some disposable menstruation products and then tell me the Diva Cup seems weird) – both issues attracted the largest number of signatures to an Australian parliament e-petition.  Until the petition calling for parliament to declare a climate emergency came along with its 160,000 (and counting) signatures, the March 2018 petition calling for an end to the “tampon tax” held the e-petition honour, with 104,185 signatures. The tampon tax was axed just a few months later, with the states and territories agreeing to forgo the $30m or so lost in GST revenue, and a government still keen to snub out potential election issues. The petition, one of many in the years since the GST was applied to women’s sanitary products, served as a flashpoint in a debate that had raged for almost two decades. But while the campaign was ultimately successful, it wasn’t the petition itself which led to the change, but the political will to pick it up. For the curious: the official record for the largest ever petition presented to the House is 1,210,471 signatures on a paper petition on pharmacy funding, presented to the House in 2014. pic.twitter.com/dMDuZBAF1a As with most things in life, when it comes to parliamentary petitions, timing is everything. In a word, no. Unlike the UK, there is no signature threshold that would force the Australian House of Representatives to debate a petition. A private member, which is any MP who is not a minister, can go through the normal processes to apply to the selection committee to try and move a motion to discuss the petition during the private members’ business section of a sitting, but the selection committee has to agree to it. If that doesn’t work, or a motion to discuss the petition fails, which given the government has the numbers in the House, happens every time the government doesn’t initiate something, then a MP could discuss it during a 90-second statement (short speeches made to the House about whatever the scheduled MP wants to talk about, just before question time) or, one of the political parties could make it a “matter of public importance”. Nope, but there are attempts to have the voice of the people recognised in this way. Late last year an inquiry into parliamentary petitions delivered this report, which recommended MPs be given 10 minutes on Mondays when parliament sits to present petitions. It also recommended that any petition with 20,000 signatures be considered for debate in the federation chamber, which is where spillover debates and speeches are made, so the House can keep on with its agenda. It may not be the main chamber, but it would still be recorded in Hansard, the official parliamentary record. That’s pretty similar to how the UK handles its signature threshold. But any changes – if any are made at all – won’t be coming in time for this petition; the government is yet to respond to any of the recommendations within the 2018 report. For a petition to be counted as a petition on the parliamentary website, it just needs to meet the requirements for lodging and have at least one signature. Which is not exactly the most onerous conditions. So there are a lot of petitions being hosted on the website. A lot. If your pet peeve isn’t on there, it wouldn’t be hard to rectify that. But it also means that without an external campaign letting people know it is there, it is easy for petitions to get lost. If you do want to know more about the petitions being hosted on the parliamentary site, head here. The friendly team at the Twitter account @aboutthehouse are also very helpful. Having your voice heard is never a waste of time, so if you feel strongly enough about an issue to log on to a parliamentary website and put your name to it, go nuts. The petition doesn’t close until 16 October, which is in the middle of the next sitting week and it has already attracted enough attention that you can guarantee it will be raised. Particularly in light of Scott Morrison’s comments to the UN last week. Both the Greens and Labor will make note of this petition and attempt to have the parliament recognise it, in some way. But even that won’t result in the parliament declaring a climate emergency. It’s a numbers game, and Labor and the Greens, even with all of the crossbench, simply don’t have them. But don’t lose hope – after all, you are reading an explainer on it, which means that it has already made enough of an impact to get people talking about parliamentary e-petitions, something normal people don’t really spend time thinking about. And the tampon tax was axed. Sure, it took almost 20 years, but when the ocean is lapping at Cronulla Stadium, even the most stubborn of men will begin caring about that."

At the 1.10 mark he calls Al Gore’s film An Inconvenient Truth “inconsistent” and reminds us how scientists “warned of cooling” in 1970s. At the 2.25 mark he brings up Michael Mann’s hockey stick chart:
No chart has been so falsified as the hockey stick chart. It’s an embarrassment for the IPCC.”
A little later he referred to it as a “nasty fabrication” that was debunked by a “Canadian think tank”. Dronskowski reminds his audience that the scientists are talking about “tenths of a degree” with error margins “of a full degree” and that “nobody can believe it”. At the 3:42 mark he again repeats:
“This hockey stick curve was a very very nasty fabrication designed to spread fear”.
At the 4.00 min. mark he shows the GISS temperature chart and reminds us at the 4.50 mark that:
It was supposed to get warmer, but the temperature hasn’t gone anywhere.”
He cautioned the audience that “the datasets are very shaky”. At the 5:45 mark he brings up consensus, and states emphatically:

There is absolutely no consensus. Zero consensus!”
And then slams Al Gore’s claim that CO2 caused warming, and not vice versa. At the 7.20 mark he tells the audience there is huge money in the game…”$100 billion a year flow because of climate change” and calls the government’s attempt to limit the temperature when it can’t even limit health insurance costs as “madness”. At this point the audience applauds loudly.
He then slams the corruptive effects that the funding has on academics: “I know colleagues who run entire institutes only with climate. There’s no way for them to back down, otherwise the institute will be ruined.”
At the 8.25 mark he reminds the audience:
I want to be clear. There is no causal effect! No consensus! Correlation is not proof!”
To illustrate the point he shows how US domestic oil production correlates with rock music quality, which brings thunderous applause from the audience.
This is indeed a surprising development for Germany. Prof Dronskowski should not wonder tomorrow morning why many other German scientists, who are swimming ingovernment climate funding, are suddenly no longer talking to him.
Prof. Richard Dronskowski a chemist and physicist. He has a faculty position at the Solid State and Quantam Chemistry Department at the RWTH Aachen and is the winner of the Otto Hahn Award of the Max Planck Society. He’s a member of the Collegium of the German Research Society, member of the German Physical Society, and the American Chemical Society.

Hans Schellnhuber and WGBU want to revolutionize society in 2 decades. Source: http://nachhaltigkeit2009.commerzbank.de

Awhile back Hans Schellnhuber, director of the ultra-alarmist Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research (PIK), released his master plan for the Great Transformation of global society – from one fuelled by carbon to a Utopian one powered by fuzzy-warm renewable energy.
This he claims would rescue the planet from imminent climate catastrophe. To help guide world leaders through the transformation, Schellnhuber and group of wisemen authored a guide called: World In Transition – A Social Contract For Sustainability.
Economist Carl Christian von Weizsäcker wrote a commentary in Germany’s flagship online political daily Franfurter Allgemeine Zeitung on Schellnhuber’s 420-page master plan. The WBGU’s plan calls for the transformation to be done in 10 – 20 years, where “not only must the production and consumption habits fundamentally change, but also the incentive systems, institutions, normative maxims and scientific disciplines (foremost the economic science disciplines).”
Sounds pretty damn radical.
Weizsäcker sees the whole thing as naive and worrisome, and reminds us that the Neolithic Revolution took thousands of years to complete and that the Industrial Revolution took 150 years, and is actually still in progress in many poorer countries. So how can anyone expect a revolution of the scale Schellnhuber proposes to be accomplished in 20 years? By having a total lack of knowledge of how societies work is the answer.
Of course this Great Transformation would be led by a powerful guiding global state, Schellnhuber proposes. Weizsäcker goes on to compare the WBGU’s proposed endeavour to Vladimir Lenin’s “proletarian Russian Revolution of 1917, under leadership of the Bolshevist wing of the communist party”, which also promised to “lead humanity to a new age, into a global-wide economic and societal system that would end the exploitation of men by men and create a world that could not be better”.
Weizsäcker adds:
We know what history teaches us with respect to this announcement of a Fundamental Revolution. After the citizens said good bye to the most brutal of methods of the guiding Stalin-State, the empire ended up in a hopeless dead-end stagnation which finally ended, and had to end, in the total collapse of a historical lesson”.

I’d say Schellnhuber and the WBGU are well beyond naive.  What Schellnhuber proposes is nothing less than a reckless and adventurous social engineering experiment, tantamount to a half-baked plan that calls for taking apart a jumbo jet full of passengers and putting it back together again as a glider – all in midflight.
Schellnhuber and his WBGU of course would like to have the audience believe that this Revolution would be carried out “democratically, freely and successfully.” Deomcracy itself would have to undergo a transformation. Just how democratic would the WBGU’s proposed new society be? Weizsäcker translates the WBGU’s text as follows:
More democracy yes, but only if it serves to achieve our aims.”
and comments:
We are actually not speaking about democracy when the wisemen (modern: the scientists) of the country prescribe the result up front and inform the people: ‘you may decide – but only as long as you decide correctly. Otherwise we will have to take away your co-determination on behalf of the collective good.”
Now allow me to translate: That’s tyranny, and not democracy. Weizsäcker sums it up:
Karl Popper and Friedrich August von Hayek would turn in their graves if they heard this highly offical recipe as a new form of democracy.”
Of course not everyone is wary of the WBGU’s proposed societal coup d’etat. There are many leaders out there who, all doped up with green ideology, think these adventurous, poorly thought out schemes are going to save humanity. Like German President Christian Wulff.
Sigh – those who forget history are condemned to repeat it.

"As presidents, prime ministers and corporate executives gathered at the UN climate action summit on Monday, for the first time, an indigenous representative joined the event in a formal capacity. Tuntiak Katan of the Ecuadorian Shuar people spoke on behalf of the International Indigenous People’s Forum on Climate Change (IIPFCC), a caucus of indigenous rights advocates who, for years, has been working towards more robust participation and inclusion at the UN level in response to the climate crisis – even more so after the importance of traditional knowledge was mentioned in the 2015 Paris accord.  On Monday, Katan shared the stage with the Bangladeshi prime minister, Sheikh Hasina, and the philanthropist Bill Gates in discussing best approaches for adapting to a planet that is heating. “There’s no time left,” said Katan. “We must make a pact for life and for our future.” In his two-minute address, Katan outlined three climate action commitments of the IIPFCC as requested by the UN secretary general. Of these steps, the indigenous rights leader who also serves as vice-president of Coordinator of the Indigenous Organizations of the Amazon River Basin (Coica), emphasized most the need for indigenous inclusion. “We are more than 400 million indigenous peoples in the world and we protect 80% of the world’s biodiversity,” Katan said. The address was seen by some as representation that doesn’t go far enough, but in the larger scope of the indigenous rights struggle, it was also seen as a small but significant step towards being seen and heard. Formal indigenous representation has chronically been absent at UN climate talks even though indigenous peoples have been voicing concerns about a warming planet for decades. “The Inuit have been bringing forth warnings about global warming to the international community since the first Earth summit in Rio de Janeiro in 1992,” said Kuupik Kleist, former prime minister of Greenland, in a statement. But Monday’s summit represented the most visible commitment made by the UN in promoting indigenous inclusion in high-level climate conversations and advanced progress from the historic working group formed at COP24 held in Poland last year. At that gathering, the IIPFCC secured their right for the first time to participate in vital decision-making in how traditional knowledge will be exchanged in adapting to the climate crisis as outlined in paragraph 135 of the Paris agreement. Andrea Carmen, executive director of the International Indian Treaty Council, credits these strides to an increasing number of climate scientists who are turning to traditional knowledge systems as a way to deeper understand the natural world. “Most of the states listening to the scientists are truly scared and are turning to indigenous peoples and saying: ‘Come and sit at the table and tell us what you’re thinking,’” said Carmen. But with UN recognition of these indigenous “ways of knowing”, as Carmen describes them, advocates insist that such acknowledgment must also come with assurances; that certain rights, most distinctly spelled out in the UN Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples, are firmly upheld. One provision calls on countries to take effective steps to ensure indigenous knowledge systems are safeguarded so that they can continue to be practiced by the very tribal communities of which they belong. “Our traditional knowledge and the ways that we use it and how we think about it, needs to be respected,” said Carmen, adding that traditional knowledge doesn’t begin and end with the environment but rather the whole relationship indigenous peoples have with the land – economically, socially and culturally. For all the promising gains, though, it was Kayapó tribal leader and 2020 candidate for the Nobel peace prize, Raoni Metuktire of the Brazilian Amazon who perhaps demonstrated best the need for more indigenous inclusion at the UN level. Raoni was denied access to Monday’s climate summit despite explaining to organizers that his own ancestral homelands were still going up in flames – fires blamed on the multinational development logging plans of Brazil’s president, Jair Bolsonaro. “Let Raoni in! Protect the Amazon!” shouted his supporters as he stood in the main lobby outside of the UN general assembly. Amazon Watch, one of the leading not-for-profit organizations promoting the protection of the ecosystem, said Raoni was not properly credentialed to attend the summit although he was allowed access to the main UN campus. But Leila Salazar-López, Amazon Watch’s executive director, said given the dire concerns over the rainforest, concessions for his inclusion should have been made. “The Amazon is on fire,” said Salazar-López. “And it’s a result of rolling back environmental laws and the rights of indigenous peoples because of Bolsonaro. “There’s a need to tell world leaders.” “They need us,” said Carmen. “We represent a source that can not only save lives and future generations but maybe also contribute to the shared survival of humanity.”"

Share this...FacebookTwitterSorry, but I always get a little nervous when top German and European officials put themselves first in line for a “new world order” that will tell the rest of the world how to behave. Other countries outside of Germany or Europe can and should decide for themselves how to live and run things.
Why do Europe’s elitists always view foreign ideas and ways as inferior?
CO2 Handel here reports that German Environment Minister Norbert Röttgen, one of Chancellor Angela Merkel’s leading officials, has declared climate protection the “new world order“.
Röttgen obviously has been having disturbing visions of a planet headed for a climatic catastrophe – unless us humans stop burning fossil fuels and start rain-dancing to the beat of appointed climate high priests. Never mind that global temperatures haven’t risen in 15 years, visions from green prophets and wisemen trump.
Or maybe Röttgen is simply dreaming of wielding lots of global power. According to CO2 Handel:
There can only be one global answer to global warming in the words of Federal Environment Minister Norbert Röttgen (CDU). Climate protection is a ‘Weltordnungspolitik’ (world order policy), said Röttgen on Thursday in Bonn at an international human rights conference.

That also means: ‘Everybody must be on board.’ To have a greater impact on global environmental and climate protection, a new UN special organization – something like the WHO for health – would have to be set up.”
Herr Röttgen says that the Kyoto Protocol, which covers only 15% of the world’s greenhouse gas emissions, is unable to function any longer.
Strange how activist warmists often accuse skeptics of being paranoid for believing that climate policy is masquerading as global governance. Here we have the German Federal Minister of Environment himself, a top government authority, calling for climate policy to be made into “world order policy”. How could anyone make the true intentions any clearer?
So dear global citizens, get ready to go out and rain-dance every day for good weather and climate, i.e. act like raving superstitious fools, because the government says you have to.

" In a fast-changing world, it’s a reassuringly unvarying truth that whenever the novelist Jonathan Franzen weighs in on current affairs, it drives people bonkers on social media. And so it went, a few weeks back, when Franzen published a New Yorker essay wondering if we should give up hope of decisively averting the climate apocalypse. Something about the sheer Franzenness of Franzen makes it hard for his critics to focus on what he’s actually saying: he was attacked as a nihilist and a fatalist, even though he urged action and investment to combat global warming; and the New Yorker was chastised for not assigning the piece to a climate scientist, even though the relative impotence of public pronouncements by climate scientists was central to his argument. It was difficult not to interpret the ferocity of the response as evidence that he’d broached a subject many would rather avoid. Lost in the commotion was what I’d say was Franzen’s most important reminder: that our capacity for concern is finite, and we ignore that finitude at our peril. Each of us has limited time, energy and other resources, and so, inevitably, if your sole priority is achieving victory in a planetary-scale existential battle, there’ll be nothing left for anything else. “Keep doing the right thing for the planet, yes,” Franzen wrote, “but also keep trying to save what you love specifically – a community, an institution, a wild place, a species that’s in trouble – and take heart in your small successes.” They needn’t be explicitly climate-related, either. There’s something wrong with a moral code that says you shouldn’t spend your spare time caring for a dying relative (say) because it’s time you could have spent saving the environment.  You might object, of course, that real-life climate activists don’t neglect their dying grandparents; they manage to attend to both demands. But then you’ve already granted Franzen’s point – that it’s justifiable to withdraw some of your finite energy from what seems like the only global priority in order to reinvest it locally, and on what matters most to you. More than justifiable, in fact: it may be the only way to avoid paralysis or despair in the face of the world’s problems. In the smartphone age, as David Cain observed recently on his blog raptitude.com, our limited capacity for concern is distributed over so many urgent demands that it’s like “releasing a tiny drop of water on each square inch of a forest fire”. Imagine, he wrote, if you could gather up all the public concern and distribute it differently, so that several thousand people would make one specific issue – or sub-issue, in the case of the climate – their primary moral concern for a decade. It’s hard to imagine more progress wouldn’t be made. We can’t engineer the world that way, obviously. But we could probably try harder, as individuals, to pick a handful of battles in which to invest our finite concern. The trickiest part would be ignoring all the others. “Not my problem!” we’d have to think, when encountering a story about Syrian refugees, or fires in the Amazon. Not from callousness, but because we’d nominated some different problems as “ours”, and were already busy making a difference. The veteran ecologist Joanna Macy explores environmental activism as a “dance with despair” on the podcast On Being. oliver.burkeman@theguardian.com"

Share this...FacebookTwitterSomehow I missed Nir Shaviv’s comment about Jasper Kirby’s CLOUD experiment, read here: Shaviv writes (emphasis added):
Ok, so what do these results imply?
The first point was essentially pointed above. The results unequivocally demonstrate that atmospheric ionization can very easily affect the formation of condensation nuclei (CNs). Since many regions of earth are devoid of natural sources for CCNs (e.g., dust), the CCNs have to grow from the smaller CNs, hence, the CCN density will naturally be affected by the ionization, and therefore, the cosmic ray flux. This implies that ion induced nucleation is the most natural explanation linking between observed cosmic ray flux variations and climate. It has both empirical and beautify experimental results to support it.
Second, given that the cosmic ray flux climate link can naturally be explained, the often heard ‘no proven mechanism and therefore it should be dismissed’ argument should be tucked safely away. In fact, given the laboratory evidence, it should have been considered strange if there were no empirical CRF/climate links!
Last, given that the CRF/climate link is alive and kicking, it naturally explains the large solar/climate links. As a consequence, anyone trying to understand past (and future) climate change must consider the whole effect that the sun has on climate, not just the relatively small variations in the total irradiance (which is the only solar influence most modelers consider). This in turn implies (and I will write about it in the near future), that some of the 20th century warming should be attributed to the sun, and that the climate sensitivity is on the low side (around 1 deg increase per CO2 doubling).
Read it all here: http://www.sciencebits.com/CLOUDresults.
He says he’ll write more about this in the future. Hopefully he won’t keep us waiting too long, as many of us are looking forward to his expert assesssments.

Share this...FacebookTwitter**** UPDATE: No. 14 on SPIEGEL Bestseller List! ****
This is stunningly phenomenal. According to spokeswoman Julia Strack at Hoffmann & Campe publishing, 20,000 copies have been distributed over the last week and:
It will enter the German bestseller list on Monday as number 14.”
“Die kalte Sonne” is also the No. 1 seller at publisher Hoffmann & Campe.

Source: Hoffmann & Campe Top Ten List
The NWZ daily in Oldenburg writes here:
Seldom has a book about climate change and the role of CO2 on climate fired up the debate like ‘Die kalte Sonne’ has. For many climate activists, the book’s subtitle is a provocation: ‘Why the climate catastroiphe is not taking place’ – which is viewed as playing down the harm and risk to the Earth’s climate.”
The NWZ then writes:
The demand for the book is large. At the moment the book is out of print and will go through another printing, Vahrenholt reported.”
Being in the top 20 is great news. In fact, all books in the top 20 are normally placed at the entrance of the book-shops near the cash registers. This will further bolster sales.

Mass press coverage
Although climate activists have blasted the book, major media outlets have been giving it ample coverage. Here are some quotes from the press collected by Hoffmann & Campe:
“While all of Europe Freezes these days, Fritz Vahrenholt is providing a heated debate.“ – Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung, 7 Feb. 2012
“Vahrenholt (62) a maverick who conveys the current zeitgeist.“ www.zeitonline.de, 6 February 2012
“…Germany’s most naughty renewable energy manager…“ – Frankfurter Allgemeine Sonntagszeitung, 29 January 2012
“… is Vahrenholt also a hardnosed climate skeptic?“ – Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung, 12 Feb 2012
“With his claims on climate change Professor Fritz Vahrenholt […] has provided for headlines.“ – Welt am Sonntag, 12 Feb 2012
“A new book on climate change has […] triggered a heated discussion. Thus the authors plead that imthat everybody keep a cool head. In this country this is going to be tough to do.“ – Die Welt, 11 Feb 2012
The warmists, in their attempts to slam the book, have only succeeded in driving it up near the top of bestseller lists. Worse is that once people read the book, they are never going to believe the hoax again.
It needs to be noted that most of the warmists who have blasted the book have not even read it. Mojib Latif confirmed that on ARD television when asked if he bought the book. He said he “read parts of it here and there”. So of course he isn’t going to have a clue about the book’s arguments, and thus he ends up saying dumb things that will come back to him later.

Share this...FacebookTwitterIs our climate becoming more extreme?
By Paul Homewood
Hurricane Katrina (Photo credit: NOAA)
There has been much discussion recently about “Climate Disruption” or “Global Weirding”. John Holdren has talked about “increases in floods, wildfires, droughts, heat waves and hurricanes” while Rajendra Pachauri says: “Based on observation, we know that there will be more floods, more drought, more heat waves and more extreme precipitation events. These things are happening”.
Al Gore of course is quick to blame any extreme weather event on climate change. Even reputable climate scientists such as Katharine Hayhoe talk about Global Weirding. “Heavy rains, deep snowfalls, monster floods and killing droughts are signs of a new normal of extreme U.S. weather events fueled by climate change,” scientists and government planners said.
Katharine Hayhoe climate scientist of Texas Tech University told reporters:
It’s a new normal and I really do think that global weirding is the best way to describe what we’re seeing.”
But are we really seeing more extreme weather nowadays?
Our memory of events from years ago tends to blur into the mists of time. Furthermore the global nature of today’s news media often brings to our attention stories which we would not have even known about if they had happened decades ago. I have therefore put together the following record of extreme weather events from 1971, which I hope will provide a certain amount of perspective when looking at what is happening today. Why 1971? Quite simply it is 40 years ago, a nice round number, and of course, before the gradual rise in global temperatures began a few years later.
DROUGHTS
 In the US there were several notable droughts in 1971:
 * Florida – The worst drought on record resulted in 400,000 acres of the Everglades burned by fires. (1)
 * Texas – Worst drought since the 1950’s. (2)
 * Maryland – The 1958-71 drought produced the largest recorded annual departures from average stream discharge. (3)
 * California – The summer of 1971 was “extra hot and long. Rainfall did not completely wet the (tree) root zones the winter of 1971-72 (sic)”. The same report in 1978 stated “the rate of development (of dieback of tree limbs) has been accentuated in recent years”. (4)
 * Hawaii – The drought on Maui was described as the worst in 22 years. (5)
 * North Carolina – The Air Force Bombing Range Fire destroyed 29300 acres of forest. (6)
 * Minnesota – The Little Sioux Fire destroyed 14000 acres following “a period of abnormally dry weather”. (7)
 * In total there were 108398 wildfires in the US in 1971 affecting 4.2 million acres. ( Figures for 2010 were 71971 fires and 3.4 million acres). (7a)

In the rest of the world there were many more:
 * Australia – In Victoria  what was described as a severe drought began that would last to 1973. (8)
 * Ethiopia – 1971 saw the start of a 2-year drought that would claim 300,000 lives. (9)
 * Kenya – 150,000 people were affected in what was described in 2006 as even worse than the 2005 drought, itself one of the worst on record. (10)
 * Sahel – Mali, Chad, Nigeria and Burkina were in the middle of a drought that lasted from 1967-88 and which was described in Nigeria as the worst since 1913. (11)
 * Okinawa – Experienced the worst drought in history. (12)
 * China – Much of Northern China was in the grip of what in Beijing was on record as the worst drought ever (before or since). (13)
 * Afghanistan – This was the worst in the country’s history. (14)
 * Iraq – This severe drought led to the mercury poisoning tragedy. Iran was also affected. No drought there has been as bad since. (15)
 * India – The 1971-72 drought affected many states and ranked as the 5th worst since records began in 1876. (16)
 * Argentina – The 1971 drought was worse than anything since. (17)
FLOODS
 * North Vietnam – The Red River flood was an absolutely terrible disaster leaving 100,000 dead. It was listed by NOAA as one of the century’s top weather events and described as a 250 year event. (18)
 * India – Orissa was hit by a cyclone which left 10,800 dead. (19). Also, in Central India the Bundelkhand district was hit by floods (which were followed in 1972 by droughts). (20)
  * Malaysia – 32 people were killed and 180,000 affected in the Kuala Lumpur floods in the worst floods since 1926. (21)
 * Australia – In January the Canberra flood claimed 7 lives followed a month later by floods in Victoria which were called a 100 year event. In Queensland every month from January to May saw major floods and significant flooding returned in December. (22) (23) (24)
 * New Zealand – The New Plymouth area was hit by their worst ever flood after 11.4 inches of rain fell in 24 hours.(25)
 * Brazil – 130 dead in Rio de Janeiro floods. (26)
 * Quebec – Heavy rainfall caused a massive landslide at the village of Saint-Jean-Vianney, leaving 31 dead. (27)
 * Spain – 19 died in floods in Barcelona after 308mm of rain in 24 hours. (28)
 * USA – Alaska suffered a major flood, only exceeded by the 1986 flood in the last 50 years. (29)
 * USA – In February significant flooding occurred in Nebraska, Iowa, Illinois and Wisconsin.(30)
 * USA – In March Southeastern States were affected with Georgia recording record levels in some areas. (30)
 * USA – May and June brought significant flooding to Utah, Idaho, Nebraska and Wyoming. The discharge from the Bear River in Utah was considered a 75 year event. (30)
 * USA – Significant flooding hit Pennsylvania, Ohio and West Virginia in June and July. (30)
 * USA – In August Baltimore was struck by one of the most damaging thunderstorms in 50 years and 14 died from the resulting floods. (30)
 * USA – Widespread flooding followed Tropical Storm Doria up the coast from North Carolina to Maine in August. Some streams in New Jersey and Pennsylvania registered record floods. (30)
 * USA –  Extended flooding occurred in September and October affecting Texas, Louisiana and Oklahoma. (30)
 * USA – More significant flooding hits Oklahoma and Arkansas in December. (30)
HURRICANES, TORNADOES, ETC. 
 * The Atlantic hurricane season was a “fairly active” one with several notable storms.(31)
 * The strongest was Edith, a Category 5, which killed dozens in Nicaragua before turning north and hitting Louisiana. (31)
 * Ginger is on record as the longest lasting Atlantic hurricane ever, or at least until the 1899 San Ciriaco hurricane was retroactively discovered to be longer. (31)
 * An unnamed storm in August attained hurricane status further north than any other North Atlantic tropical cyclone. (31)
 * Canada was unusually on the receiving end of the tail ends of 2 hurricanes, Beth and Doria which both caused huge amounts of damage from flooding. Both were listed by Natural Resources Canada among the 18 major hurricanes of the 20thC. (32)
 * In the Pacific the hurricane season was above average with 18 named storms, 6 of which made landfall. This latter number is still the record for a season. (33)
 * The typhoon season was also a busy one with 24 typhoons of which 6 were super typhoons. This compares to 7 typhoons including 2 super typhoons in 2010. The season had an extremely active start with a record number of storms before August. (34)
 * Typhoon Rose left 130 dead in Hong Kong plus many more at sea. It was described by the Hong Kong Observatory as “one of the most intense and violent” to have affected Hong Kong. (34)
 * Cyclone Althea hit Queensland as a Category 4 cyclone in December. Damage was extensive but would have been worse if it had not arrived at low tide. (35)
 * The tornado season in the USA was also above average with 58 F3+ tornadoes ( compared to 39 in 2010). (36)
 * The worst tornado outbreak occurred in the Mississippi Valley during 2 days in February. 19 tornadoes were spawned claiming 123 lives across 3 states. (37)
OTHER EVENTS

 * The highest ever UK January temperature was recorded in Gwynedd at 65F. (38)
 * In Canada the snowfall record for one season was set on Mount Copeland in British Columbia in the winter of 1971/72. (39)
 * In the same winter Mount Baker in Washington broke the US record when 1122 inches fell. (40)
 * Montreal’s “snowstorm of the century” left 17 dead with 70 mph winds producing second storey drifts. (41)
 * Texas and Oklahoma were hit by a giant blizzard which set the state record snow depth in Oklahoma of 36 inches. The National Weather Service in Amarillo lists this blizzard as one of the top 20 weather events in the Panhandle. (42) (43)
 * Columbia suffered its worst winter in years resulting in economic losses of $150 million. To make matters worse heavy rains caused the two biggest rivers, the Magdalena and Cuca, to flood vast regions in the Central and Western parts of the country. (44)
 * Most of the USA was colder than normal. 1971 nationally was the 36th coldest in the 20th century. (45)
Which year saw the more extreme weather, 1971 or 2010? Who can say. How can anyone compare the severity of, say, a hurricane with that of a drought? Or a flood with blizzard? Katharine Hayhoe complains that our weather is becoming unpredictable but surely it has ever been so. Perhaps we should really start worrying when we stop getting extreme weather events.

"What would you do to save the world? Not the strapline for a Netflix series, but rather the question that sits behind Jonathan Safran Foer’s second work of nonfiction, We Are the Weather. The answer to the question appears to be “not very much”, given that despite the looming threat of global heating, despite the fact the next generation (and those that follow) will live more precarious lives, with food, water and clean air in ever-shorter supply, despite the fact that the future of our planet appears to be one of flooded cities, scorched forests and sulphurous skies, we continue to behave as if the climate crisis is someone else’s problem. In 2018, despite knowing more about climate change than we have ever known, we produced more greenhouse gases than we have ever produced, at three times the rate of global population growth. Climate change, therefore, exists as a rhetorical challenge as much as a scientific one. The most pressing question is how to persuade people to act, and to act now, both on an individual basis and, particularly, collectively. Extinction Rebellion provides a blueprint for action, but what about the majority who aren’t about to chain themselves to the headquarters of Shell? One landmark in the rhetorical battle was Al Gore’s 2006 film An Inconvenient Truth, although it may surprise you to learn that Gore’s film, for all its rigour, didn’t mention the single largest contributor to global heating: livestock.  Now Safran Foer, best known for his astonishing magical-realist debut novel Everything Is Illuminated, but also the author of a bestselling 2009 book about factory farming, Eating Animals, has set about remedying that omission. In We Are the Weather, he demonstrates that, rather than being an insurmountable nexus of insoluble problems, there’s one small change that all of us can make that would have a sustained and far-reaching impact on the climate crisis: eating fewer animal products. “We cannot keep the kind of meals we have known and also keep the planet we have known. We must either let some eating habits go or let the planet go. It is as straightforward and as fraught as that.” First, a warning: this is a life-changing book and will alter your relationship to food for ever. I can’t imagine anyone reading Safran Foer’s lucid, heartfelt, deeply compassionate prose and then reaching blithely for a cheeseburger. There’s some dispute as to precisely what proportion of global heating is directly related to the rearing of animals for food, but even the lowest estimates put it on a par with the entire global transportation industry. A well-evidenced 2009 report by the Worldwatch Institute claimed that livestock-related emissions accounted for 51% of all greenhouse gases, “more than all cars, planes, buildings, industry and power plants combined”. Whichever the case, Safran Foer’s thesis is clear and compelling: by making “a collective act to eat differently” (he suggests “no animal products before dinner”) we can turn the tide of the climate crisis. The book is made up of five sections, each divided into a series of sharp, hard-hitting chapters. Part two, How to Prevent the Greatest Dying, is a bombardment of facts that seeks to overwhelm the reader with evidence. “Humans use 59% of all the land capable of growing crops to grow food for livestock”; “60% of all mammals on Earth are animals raised for food”; “There are approximately 30 farmed animals for every human on the planet”; “In 2018, more than 99% of the animals eaten in America were raised on factory farms”; “Animal agriculture is responsible for 91% of Amazon deforestation”; “If cows were a country, they would rank third in greenhouse gas emissions, after China and the United States.” These facts, though, are part of the problem, rather than the solution. The point is, we know this stuff, we just don’t believe it. And so the rest of the book is dedicated to persuading us that it is our duty to act, just as, Safran Foer suggests, it was the duty of Jewish leaders in the US to act when Jan Karski, a member of the Polish underground, came to them in June 1943 with news of the murder and persecution of Jews in Europe. The Jewish leaders, and particularly the supreme court justice Felix Frankfurter, didn’t act. “I am unable to believe what you told me,” Frankfurter told Karski. History now judges Frankfurter as it will judge us. The final chapter is structured as a letter from Safran Foer to his children. The author’s grandmother, who herself fled Poland just before it was too late to do so, has just died. Most of her family were killed in the Holocaust and Safran Foer powerfully interweaves her story of action with his own history of inaction in the face of global warming. Reversing climate change, he says, “requires an entirely different kind of heroism”. This heroism is “perhaps every bit as difficult” as the sacrifice his grandmother made “because the need for sacrifice is unobvious”. That sacrifice begins, as the book’s subtitle suggests, at breakfast. • We Are the Weather: Saving the Planet Begins at Breakfast by Jonathan Safran Foer is published by Hamish Hamilton (£16.99).

Share this...FacebookTwitterAnyone wondering what some US leaders envision for the USA’s energy policy may wish to attend the following Harvard German Conference to find out.
The energy part of the conference is taking place this weekend, Saturday morning, February 18, 2012:
9:30 – 10:30: Energy – Keynote Jeremy Rifkin.
The Third Industrial Revolution: The New German Model for a Post-Carbon Economy, Radcliffe Yard
10:30 – 10:50: Coffee Break, Radcliffe Yard
10:50 – 11:15: Energy Address, Dr. Hermann Ott (MdB German Green Party), Radcliffe Yard
11:15 – 12:40: Energy – Panel and Q&A:
Full throttle towards green energy – Germany visionary or misguided?
Prof. Dr. Jürgen Kluge, Dr. Hermann Ott, Benjamin Schlesinger, Ph.D., Prof. Dr. Eicke Weber, Radcliffe Yard
And if you’re interested in finding out how the “new German model” is coming along, read about it here – it aint pretty! In fact, the power grid came only a whisker away from a collapse during the recent cold spell. And many German companies are relocating to places where supply is more reliable.

But who cares about these nuances – it’s the way the USA should go these misguided pointy heads tell us. I’ll let the German readers here tell you who these German masterminds are.
DR. KEIL’S FULL 28-PAGE REPORT IN ENGLISH
The above report is a must read if you are involved in energy engineering, planning or policy!
If you do, you’ll never want to touch the German strategy. In fact, according to experts from 21 of the World Energy Council’s country committees:
81% of the countries surveyed reject the German way as a model for the world, and none of the experts could imagine their own countries following the German way.”
I’ve read the entire 28-page report, and it sounds worse than Soviet-style central planning. If anyone happens to be near Harvard, go check out the conference.
So far in Germany, the current attempt to switch over to renewable energy has only succeeded in:
1) driving up electricty and energy rates for consumers,
2) making the power supply unreliable,
3. littering the landscape with windparks and solar panels,
4. driving up the price of food,
5. driving industry out of country,
6. regulating private lives more and more intensely, and
7. putting billions into the pockets of a few opportunists and carbon traders.

"How do we make sense of the Earth when it seems to be turning against us in revenge for its despoliation? The very act of writing about the devastation can sometimes create a kind of coherence. Elizabeth Kolbert shows us how with The Sixth Extinction, where she focuses on a few of the million or so species that are dying out in what is now known to be one of the greatest extinction events in the history of the Earth. The closeness of the focus creates a powerful sense of empathy, not just with the vanishing creatures but also with the writer as she struggles to account for the horrors to which she is bearing witness. Dahr Jamail’s The End of Ice is another unflinching attempt to grapple with almost incomprehensible realities. Jamail travels widely and listens closely to scientists, and to people whose ways of life are threatened by ecological breakdown. “The grief for the planet does not get easier,” he writes. “Returning to this again and again is, I think, the greatest service I can offer in these times.”  Our current predicament is both overwhelming and elusive, manifesting itself not in big events but in what the Princeton professor Rob Nixon calls a kind of “slow violence”, revealed in small but telling details. Such details abound in Annie Proulx’s Bird Cloud, a memoir of her experience of building a house in a very challenging location in Wyoming. Proulx has always paid close attention to landscape and this is no exception: it is the terrain that awakens the writer to the effects of planetary changes. A memoir of a completely different kind is Roy Scranton’s Learning to Die in the Anthropocene. Scranton served in Iraq as a private in the US army and he draws on that experience in trying to understand the implications of climate crisis for himself and his loved ones: the result is a book that is fiercely urgent and deeply poignant. In The Mushroom at the End of the World, Anna Tsing goes in search of the much-prized matsutake mushroom, found only in certain damaged forests. The matsutake serves as both vehicle and metaphor for a giddying exploration of capitalism, networks of trade and the hidden lives of forests, ultimately opening up the possibility of salvaging meaning from an increasingly disordered reality. The disrupted migration of monarch butterflies underpins a powerful human story in Barbara Kingsolver’s luminous novel Flight Behaviour. But human stories are precisely the problem – there is a terrible cost to privileging the human over other forms of life. We need stories that can accommodate other kinds of protagonists, and there is no better example of this than Richard Powers’s marvellous The Overstory, a novel that gives trees a wonderfully vivid fictional life. Many people have always known that emotions are not exclusive to humans. But what does it mean when someone says they can understand the inner lives of animals, trees, or even forests? Bruce Albert and Davi Kopenawa provide a vivid sense of this in The Falling Sky: Words of a Yanomami Shaman. The Yanomami of the Amazon, like all the indigenous peoples of the Americas and Australia, have experienced the end of what was once their world. Yet they have survived and somehow succeeded in making sense of a wounded existence. They have a lot to teach us.  • Gun Island by Amitav Ghosh is published by John Murray.

"The UK will need investment worth billions of pounds every year to remove enough greenhouse gases from the air to meet its 2050 climate targets, according to a report commissioned by the government. The report, by analysts at Vivid Economics, estimated that the UK would need as much as £20bn a year to remove up to 130m tonnes of carbon dioxide from the air.  This will be necessary in the coming decades to make up for industries such as aviation, agriculture and heavy industry as the UK works to build a net-zero carbon economy. “Even if emissions are reduced aggressively across the economy, the UK is expected to continue to emit a significant amount of greenhouse gases annually,” the report said. “The rate of rollout will need to be rapid, particularly in the 2030s and 2040s, and will require significant policy support.” The report has urged ministers to consider supporting investment in greenhouse gas removal. This could mean offering new subsidies and grants for carbon capture technologies and projects, or demanding that companies that supply fossil fuels and agriculture products offset a percentage of their carbon emissions by investing in greenhouse gas removal. A spokesman for the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy said: “This report presents a variety of different options for consideration, and we will look closely at its findings. “We recognise the importance and urgency of taking action right across the economy to deliver on our world-leading net-zero target, including by developing our approach to greenhouse gas removal technology.” On average, the report estimates that the UK may need between £1bn and £2bn a year in 2030 to remove greenhouse gas emissions from the air, rising to between £6bn and £20bn by 2050. The most expensive projects would involve technology that can absorb carbon dioxide from the air. This could remove about 25m tonnes of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere every year at a cost between £160 and £470 a tonne. The cheapest options include restoring natural habits, which could absorb 5m tonnes of carbon from the air every year at a cost of between £8 and £78 a tonne. The report even suggests supporting “enhanced weathering”, a relatively new approach to carbon removal in which fields are spread with ground-up silicate rocks, such as basalt, to increase the soil’s natural rate of carbon absorption. This could remove 15m tonnes of carbon from the air every year, but the cost of this process is uncertain at between £39 and £390 a tonne. The analysts expect large-scale greenhouse gas removal to rely on projects that use bioenergy alongside carbon capture technology, known as BECCS, as well as projects that capture carbon directly from the air, or DACCS. BECCS technology is being used on a small-scale at the Drax power plant in North Yorkshire, where some of the coal-burning power units have been converted to run on biomass. Biomass is considered by the UK and EU governments to be carbon-neutral because the pellets are made from sustainably farmed trees which absorb carbon emissions while they grow. Drax is using carbon capture technology at the power station to trap one tonne of carbon emissions a day from burning the pellets. However, the project has attracted criticism from campaigners who question whether biomass, which Drax imports from the US, should be considered a renewable energy source. Almost 800 scientists wrote to the EU government last year to call for biomass to be stripped of its carbon-neutral status."

Share this...FacebookTwitterThe Winnepeg Free Press here and Yahoo report here that Western Canada needs to brace for a brutal winter. Hat tip reader Matti Vooro.
The Yahoo News blog writes:
Meteorologists are calling for an early and cold winter in Western Canada, probably one of the top three coldest in the last 20 years for the West Coast.”
This comes at the heels of last month’s reports from Britain  where long-range forecasters warned of below average temperatures from October through February, along with lots of whites stuff, which just a few years ago was said would be “rare and exciting” in the future because of global warming.
Cold events caused by natural factors
In times of global warming, people may ask what’s causing all the cold and snow? Accuweather’s Brent Anderson has the answer:
That’s typical of a La Nina, but (blasts) don’t last very long; they come and they go,”

In other words, when cold events occur, it’s because of natural factors. But when warm events happen, then it’s man-made global warming. And what about Britain’s coming cold weather? You guessed it -also  caused by natural factors (UV radiation!). And should cold extremes befall us, then of course it’ll be due to global warming, er, man-made climate change – which scientists say “leads to weather extremes”. If you are getting confused, don’t worry – so am I! (And so are the scientists).
So how cold is it going to get over the vast Canadian territory? The Winnipeg Free Press writes:
The forecast is one of the coldest winters in the past 20 years for Western Canada, major snowstorms for Ontario and Quebec and a drier than normal winter for Atlantic Canada.”
Accuweather’s Brett Anderson adds:
Western provinces can expect a fifth-consecutive deep freeze to move in and stay.”
and
Vancouver will experience one of its coldest winters on record.”
Last month German whippersnapper meteorologist Dominik Jung, a warmist, predicted here the fourth consecutive bitter winter would grip Central Europe this winter and could strain the energy supply. Looks like we’ll need to burn more coal, and not less.

Two short reports today…
1) Solar jobs in Germany overstated
The idea was to shift from dirty fossil and dangerous nuclear fuel power generation over to clean, climate-friendly renewable energy, and thus create thousands of new green jobs that would usher in the German Green Revolution and so make Germany a model for the rest of the world on how to responsibly use energy.
Unfortunately, it may be becoming a model of what not to do.
A recent report throws more ice water on the green dream – at least in the solar industry. The report says that the number of solar jobs in Germany is much less than what is claimed by the industry. Instead of 133,000 solar jobs, the number is only 80,000.
According to CO2 Handel.de:
According to the Berlin Polytechnic University for Technology and Economy(HTW) there are currently about 80,000 jobs in the German photovoltaic industry, this reported by Welt am Sonntag.”

//-->




The 133,000 jobs claimed by the solar industry trade associations have not been reached by a long shot. According to the Berlin Polytechnic University, approximately 75% of the jobs are not even in the so-called hightech areas of manufacturing, but rather in distribution and installation.
A few days ago NoTricksZone here reported how solar companies in Germany are bleeding to death, and shifting production to Asia. Solar panels are increasingly being manufactured in China and Malaysia where costs are much cheaper.
Not only are the lost jobs in the fossil fuel and nuclear industries not being replaced, but electricity rates have begun to soar as well, adding another hit to the economy.
2) Green statists on Rick Perry 
It’s now dawning on Europe’s greenies that Obama’s challenger in 2012 is going to be a solid skeptic (It obviously has not dawned on them that even Obama thinks little of the issue, probably because he knows the green revolution is a scam and would slam especially the poor). Statist green German website Klima der Gerechtigkeit (Climate of Justice) looks at emerging front-runner Rick Perry’s and his positions on climate change.
Perry is currently the favorite to be the Rupublican nominee. In the primaries his anti-climate positions likely will not be a disadvantage. That could change if the Republicans nominate him to go up against Obama. Climate change has had a noticeable impact on Texas over the last 20 years; it has become hotter and dryer. So far Perry has moved forward with his platitudes. But his home state is moaning under one of the worst droughts in its history – farmers face harvest losses of US$ 10 billion. Its governor allows his campaign to be financed by the oil and gas lobby and demands an end to all state regulations.
It’s going to be a fun campaign. Seriously.”
It very well may be. Texas is one of the fastest growing states, creating 40% of all new jobs in the entire country. It’s population is booming too. Concerning climate change, 69% of all Americans believe scientists have lied about climate change. Let’s see if Obama is stupid enough to side up with the 31%.

Share this...FacebookTwitterImagine if the government forced supermarkets to buy bread from plain white bread bakeries, ordered them to pay these bakeries a fixed price that’s 5 times higher than normal for 20 years, and forced them to buy up all the white bread these bakeries could produce, whether needed or not.
And imagine if the government also forced the supermarkets to buy bread that was never baked to begin with! All of this of course justified by bogus science claiming plain white bread is healthy and whole grain bread is a killer.
You can imagine the consequences.
Well, that’s exactly what Germany is doing with electricity. It requires power utilities to buy up “green” electricity from every producer at exorbitant rates, and to do so for 20 years. And if the grid gets overloaded on windy days, the wind-farm operator is told to stop producing, but still gets paid by the power utilities.
Unfortunately, Germany’s green politicians here were too dim-witted to foresee the obvious consequences. Now reality has since caught up. The German electricity market is on the verge of collapse. The scale of the EEG Renewable Energy Feed-in Act is of unprecedented stupidity, a folly that will certainly go down in German history textbooks.
The backpedaling away from solar subsidies in Germany is now happening so fast that it’s making people’s heads spin. Call it the reverse energy supply transition – one from fantasy back to reality.
Germany pulls the emergency brake on solar energy
Today a growing number of German officials, who were once huge proponents of renewable energies and the EEG Feed-In Act, are now realizing that solar energy in gray and rainy Germany is a folly after all. Electricity rates in Germany are skyrocketing and the risks of uncontrolled energy supply interruptions are mounting. Officials are now screaming for a drastic scale-back of solar subsidies. Economics Minister Philip Rösler is now calling for an end to the fixed and guaranteed (for 20 years) renewable energy feed-in rates paid to green producers.
Even Germany’s super green Environment Minister Norbert Röttgen has seemingly woken up and now plans to drastically scale back new installations of solar systems in Germany, according to CO2 Handel here. In the new plan, subsidies will be scaled back on a monthly basis and accelerated. Subsidies for solar systems under the new plan would end by 2017.
Energy intensive industries are bolting, or are planning to do so

Power utilities have been finding it increasingly difficult to juggle the constantly and widely varying energy sources of wind and solar power, and are warning that power outages and grid collapses are just a question of time.
The mandatory feed-in of the vastly more expensive solar energy has caused electricity rates to surge and have been driving energy-intensive industries out of Germany. Solar energy was until recently seen as a way of filling in as a power supply in place of the shut down nuclear reactors, and rescuing the climate from coal plants. Now the focus of politics has reversed and shifted to rescuing the economy.
Recent surveys have shown that companies are becoming increasingly wary of conducting operations in Germany due to what they view as a potentially unreliable energy supply. The European Institute for Climate and Energy EIKE) here reports that:
One fifth of every industrial company has moved activities to foreign countries, or plans to do so, because of the uncertain energy and raw material supply. This is the result of a survey conducted by the German Chamber of Industry and Commerce (DIHK), in which 1520 companies participated. DIHK-President Hans Heinrich Driftmann finds this alarming: Here, fears that Germany is losing its appeal for foreign investors in the wake of it’s energy supply transformation.”
No wonder Environment Minister Röttgen plans to take drastic measures in curbing solar energy. Germany’s industrial economy is eroding rapidly. Prof. Dr. Dieter Ameling, a former steel industry leader and spokesman, recently said the (green) energy supply transition in Germany meant the downfall of energy intensive industry in Germany.
Unfortunately greens don’t understand that transferring clean, high-standard German industry to foreign, low-standard countries means more CO2 emissions and pollution, and not less. And they certainly do not understand even the most basic laws of economics. Germany’s Renewable Energy Feed-In Act is proof.
Kook greens in Canada think solar power is for free!

Share this...FacebookTwitterWindmills are subject to cyclic loading, which means even small cracks in the load-bearing structure can grow and eventually lead to catastrophic failure. One catastrophic failure occurred yesterday near the Central German town of Kirtorf, read here (in German). Hat-tip Dirk H.
Many photos here
The tower broke 25 meters up. Investigators are now examining the rubble to deterime the exact cause of the failure. Looking at the detailed photos at the above link, it looks as if the failure occurred where two tower segments are bolted together. Maybe cheap, counterfeit bolts were used. Luckily no one was injured or killed.
The mishap occurred at about 11:30 in the morning at a windpark with 7 turbines. The blades, turbine and upper part of the tower crashed onto a path on the ground, reaching as far as 50 meters away. The debris even struck and destroyed a nearby transformer station. Meanwhile officials have called for a shutdown of 17 other turbines in the area and that they be subjected to a thorough technical inpsection before being allowed to go online.
Other news reports say the turbine was erected 11 years ago and that the maximum windspeed recorded yesterday was 57 km(hr – stormy, but usually a wind speed that windmills have no problems coping with.

"The New South Wales government is considering legislation that could limit the ability for planning authorities to rule out coalmines projects based on the climate change impact of emissions from the coal once it is burned. It comes after a campaign from the NSW Minerals Council over decisions that have referenced the impact of “scope 3 greenhouse gas emissions” as a reason for either rejecting a mining project entirely or for imposing conditions on it.  For a coalmine, scope 3 greenhouse gas emissions are from the burning of the coal after it is sold into the market, including overseas. The planning minister, Rob Stokes, said it was “not appropriate for state governments to impose conditions about emissions policies in other countries”. He said the government was looking at a range of options, including legislation or a new guideline for how planning authorities should factor scope 3 greenhouse gas emissions into the assessment process. The recent decisions include the NSW land and environment court’s rejection of the Rocky Hill coalmine in February, which cited the impact the mine would have on climate change, including through the burning of coal in other countries, at a time when “a rapid and deep decrease” in global emissions was urgently needed. In August, the NSW Independent Planning Commission approved the expanded United Wambo coal project near Singleton but as a condition said the coal could only be exported to countries that have ratified the Paris agreement. In September the commission rejected the development of a greenfield coalmine in NSW’s Bylong Valley, citing the impact the mine would have on groundwater, agricultural land and on climate change. The NSW Minerals Council has since launched attack ads that target the planning system for “failing the people of NSW”. In a statement last week, the council’s chief executive Stephen Galilee said the decision to launch a campaign came after months of “warnings to the minister for planning and others in the government about the risk of the planning system to jobs and investment”. He said the situation had reached “crisis point” with the Bylong Valley decision. Stokes said the Minerals Council was one of the stakeholders the government was consulting in its development of a policy on scope 3 emissions. “We are working with key stakeholders, including the federal government, NSW Minerals Council and consent authorities, to develop a clear policy direction as quickly as possible to provide certainty to the community, industry and investors,” he said. “We are looking at a range of options including legislation.” The consent authorities in this instance include the NSW land and environment court. But environment groups are warning the government not to bow to pressure from the mining industry. Lock the Gate said the impact of downstream greenhouse gas emissions “is arguably the most complicated, severe and lasting environmental impact of NSW’ export coalmines”. Lock the Gate coordinator George Woods said the public should also have a say in how planning decisions address the climate consequences of coal developments and that should be done through a public hearing process run by the independent planning commission. “It’s disappointing and frankly dangerous for the planning minister to narrowly consult only with the mining industry on a matter of profound importance like this,” she said. “The mining industry has flexed its political muscle but the government really needs to address the bigger issue and the public sentiment on this.” Elaine Johnson, the principal lawyer with the Environmental Defenders Office of NSW, which represented Groundswell Gloucester in the Rocky Hill case, said if the government was planning changes to the way planning authorities consider scope 3 emissions, the consultation for that should be broad and include other key stakeholders such as community and environment groups. “The land and environment court, in the Rocky Hill decision, has confirmed that it is entirely appropriate for decision-makers to impose conditions on projects that will contribute to dangerous climate change in a planning context,” Johnson said. She said that was recognised by the independent planning commission in the United Wambo and Bylong Valley assessments. “We would also say that in 2019 we are making planning decisions in a context which includes advice from the world’s best scientists that we’re approaching a climate emergency,” she said. “If global emissions continue to rise and if serious action is not taken at all levels of government, by communities and business, the impacts of dangerous climate change will be catastrophic.” The NSW Minerals Council said recent independent planning commission decisions related to emissions generated in other countries were “inconsistent with the Paris agreement and its associated greenhouse gas accounting framework”. “The NSW government has attempted to clarify its policy on scope 3 emissions through correspondence to the IPC but this has been disregarded,” Galilee told Guardian Australia. “The NSW government must therefore provide legislative and policy certainty on this issue.”"
"An Australian mining company was able to massively increase greenhouse gas emissions from two of its coalmines without penalty under a government policy that is meant to limit carbon pollution from large facilities. Centennial Coal was given permission on three occasions since 2016/17 to increase the greenhouse gas emissions from its Myuna colliery and Mandalong mines in New South Wales, according to data kept by the clean energy regulator. The increases were approved under the government’s safeguard mechanism, which is supposed to ensure that emissions cuts paid for by taxpayers through its emissions reduction fund – now called the climate solutions fund – are not wiped out by rising emissions elsewhere. The safeguard mechanism sets pollution limits for large emitters such as mines and power plants. If a company exceeds this pollution baseline, it is required to purchase carbon credits to offset the increase, or pay a penalty. However, the government’s policy allows companies to apply to increase their emissions baselines under certain conditions, thus allowing them to increase their overall total emissions. The Australian Conservation Foundation (ACF), which analysed emissions data for Centennial Coal published by the clean energy regulator, says flaws in the safeguard policy meant Centennial avoided having to buy about $8.3m in carbon offset credits, or pay an alternative penalty or implement stronger measures to cut their pollution. The ACF’s analysis found that in 2017-18, Centennial’s Myuna mine overshot its baseline of 402,028 tonnes by 65% – emitting a total of 664,956 tonnes – but it avoided penalty after having its baseline increased by the clean energy regulator. The mine’s total emissions were more than double its reported emissions for the previous year. It was also granted two baseline increases for its Mandalong mine, one in 2016/17 and one in 2017/18, for more than 300,000 tonnes in excess emissions. In 2016/17, Centennial reported emissions of 1,560,761 tonnes of carbon at Mandalong, exceeding their reported baseline of 1,508,644 by 3.8%. In 2017/18 the mine was granted another baseline increase and reported total emissions of 1,866,089 tonnes. Gavan McFadzean, the ACF’s climate and energy program manager, said the data highlighted the failure of the safeguards policy to effectively cap pollution from large emitters. “The fact that Centennial haven’t done anything legally wrong is the problem,” he said. Sign up to receive the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning “These are huge overshoots in emissions which are done really with impunity by the industrial and mining sectors in the full knowledge that the Morrison government will give them a free pass on whatever emissions of CO2 or methane they pump out into the atmosphere above their baseline.” Australia’s emissions have continued to rise, despite the Morrison government’s claims it is taking action to address the climate crisis. The government’s most recent quarterly greenhouse data showed fugitive emissions produced during the extraction of fossil fuels were up by 5.9%. Centennial is not the only company to have been granted baseline increases under the safeguard mechanism. Mining company Anglo American nearly doubled its greenhouse gas emissions in two years at its Moranbah North mine in central Queensland without penalty. McFadzean said the rise in pollution from companies such as Centennial and Anglo American was “swamping” the abatement purchased with public money through the climate solutions fund or the reductions coming from the Renewable Energy Target. “As a first step, the government must close the loopholes Centennial has exploited and tighten safeguard pollution caps over time, as recommended by the Climate Change Authority,” he said. “This is a bare minimum first step towards a comprehensive Australian climate change strategy that must bring down our pollution to zero by 2050 from all sectors of our economy including heavy industry, transport, energy and the land.” Katie Brassil, Centennial’s company spokesperson, said there were provisions in the legislation that allowed companies to increase their emissions in certain circumstances. “Both Mandalong and Myuna met these provisions,” she said. Brassil said the company was able to seek a baseline increase at Mandalong due to changes in the natural deposit that meant there was an increase in emissions of fugitive gas. In the case of the Myuna mine, the company was able to increase its baseline because it could demonstrate that its production – and therefore total emissions – had risen but it had reduced the mine’s emissions intensity per tonne of coal. “Centennial is due to lodge its NGER’s (National Greenhouse and Energy Reporting) return for 18/19 and we anticipate a reduction in Mandalong’s emissions and again reduced emissions intensity for Myuna for the period,” she said. The energy and emissions reduction minister, Angus Taylor, said baselines “are intended to allow businesses to continue normal operations, support business growth and encourage lower emissions production”. “As a result of changes made in March 2019, following a transition period, emissions limits will better reflect business as usual operations and will provide a more even and ongoing incentive for businesses to actively monitor and manage emissions,” he said."

Share this...FacebookTwitterLike all electric cars, the Norwegian Think Global electric car was the future. And because it held the promise of rescuing the climate, it was especially worshipped by the media. It symbolized technical savvy, progressive thinking, and was supposed to be proof that thinking green could lead to success, profit and a saved planet.
Well think again. All that was just slick marketing. And, as always, it never takes long for reality to catch up, pass and leave fantasy in the dust…no matter how much it is subsidized.
Cars waiting a year for parts, 30% broken down
About a week ago the English-language Norwegian online newspaper thelocal.no told us the story of how the hip “Think” electric cars has turned into a complete flop, at least in Norway. The Local writes here:
Think electric cars have begun to stack up at the few mechanic’s shops able to service them due to a spare parts shortage. Up to 30 percent of the 2,000-odd models produced have suffered breakdowns of a key power-control unit, or PCU. The car’s lithium-ion battery is powerless to recharge without the PCU, and the plant that made them shut its doors in Finland in June.”
When the car was first rolled out, the politically correct media loved it. Even Norwegian neswpaper Addresseavisa bought one of its own. But The Local writes that Addresseavisa’s own Think “was in for repair”.

Most likely sitting in a lot in the back waiting for spare parts that likely will never come. The Think car has had a history of failure. According to Wikipedia it went bankrupt 4 times since it was founded in 1991. Even Ford took a shot at it, but abandoned it.
Nissan Leaf and range anxiety 
The Think car is not the only electric car suffering from financial and technical woes. Other brands, even with the help of massive subsidies, have shown zero viability. Take the subsidized Nissan Leaf for example: Liza Barth of Consumer Reports panned it. Here’s what she wrote about it (emphasis added):
I decided to head out on my regular long commute, with the cheaper toll, but saw the Leaf quickly run though the charge and drop to 39 miles about halfway through my trip and I was freezing. I was very happy to see stopped traffic on the New York State Thruway (that’s a first) as that calmed my range anxiety and I saw the estimated range actually increase by six miles. The last two miles of my trip, I put on the heat with 24 miles left, but it did little to warm my already numb fingers and toes. I made it to the office with 17 miles to spare.”
The Leaf also comes with a “high-pitched whine”.   The infrastructure for charging up electric cars is also a complete flop.  For example North Carolina’s Duke Energy supplies charging stations for electric cars, but has asked its customers not to use them. According to WCNC:
Duke Energy is asking customers who own their electric car charging station to stop using the product after a house fire in Mooresville last month.”
Looks like lack of range, massive subsidies, impracticality and no infrastructure will continue to plague and cripple electric cars for a long time to come.

"Sometimes you don’t realise how conditioned you are until you meet someone who isn’t. Sure, I may be blunt in my work, but I still say sorry when someone barges into me in the street. I smile when others are being difficult. After all, I am of a certain age, and was brought up, consciously or not, to be a people-pleaser. In the 80s, I stood hesitantly outside an assertiveness training class – feminists used to do lots of stuff like that – unsure whether to knock or not, as I was five minutes late. As I have got older, I please myself far more and everyone else far less. And I often look to younger women for guidance.  The extraordinary reactions of certain men to Greta Thunberg, which have nothing to do with her urgent and necessary message on the climate emergency, tells you exactly what happens when a young woman simply refuses to be sexualised. It makes them deeply uncomfortable. Thunberg’s manner may be associated with her Asperger’s, but her defiance unsettles them. Old, male intellectuals in France have been farting on because she is not “sexy” enough. Yes, really. The 84-year-old philosopher Bernard Pivot, the president of the Académie Goncourt, a French literary society, talked of the sexy Swedish girls of his youth. Greta does not match up, apparently. Michel Onfray, 60, another philosopher, said she has the age and body of a cyborg. Pascal Bruckner, 70, said her face was “scary” and that she flaunts her autism. Trump, as we know, has mocked her. She is a 16-year-old, and these are grown men. And they are terrified. Wonderful. Who knew you could shake the patriarchy simply by refusing to smile for it, dress for it or demur to it? A refusal to acquiesce to the male gaze has these dinosaurs squirming. Greta, you teach us about more than one kind of climate. Thank you. • Suzanne Moore is a Guardian columnist"

"Hundreds of thousands of people around the world are taking place in the latest wave of climate strikes to demand urgent action on the escalating ecological emergency. Last week, millions walked out of schools and workplaces, uniting across timezones, cultures and generations in the biggest climate protests in history before a special UN conference in New York. Organisers said they were expecting another huge turnout on Friday, with demonstrations planned from Canada to the Netherlands, Sweden to Morocco, Italy to India. In New Zealand, record numbers of protesters were reported to have taken to the streets on Friday. Greta Thunberg, the teenager who inspired the school strike movement with her solo protest outside the Swedish parliament last year, said 3.5% of the country were taking part. An open-letter signed by 11,000 New Zealanders was delivered to parliament on Friday morning calling on the government to declare a climate emergency – following the lead of numerous councils around the country. “Our representatives need to show us meaningful and immediate action that safeguards our futures on this planet,” Raven Maeder, the School Strike 4 Climate national coordinator, said. “Nothing else will matter if we cannot look after the Earth for current and future generations. This is our home.” As part of the Earth Strike events, there are also expected to be big demonstrations in Latin America from Mexico City’s vast Zócalo square to the Plaza de Mayo in Buenos Aires.Activists say Plaza Italia in Santiago, Chile, will be flooded with demonstrators from 6pm, while protests will be staged in cities in Brazil, Bolivia, Ecuador and Paraguay around the rim of the Amazon rainforest.On Bogotá’s high Andean plain, the environmental movement has faced a severe crackdown. In July, protesters across the country pleaded for an end to the violence that has resulted in numerous activists being killed, with peace and development thinktank Indepaz putting the figure at 734 deaths in the first seven months of 2019.“We want to keep fracking out of our country and demand an immediate change towards decarbonisation,” said the activist Susana Muhamad, who was planning to march past the offices of the country’s largest petroleum company, Ecopetrol, at midday. More than 30 events have been planned in Argentina, where crowds will be marching across the capital from the Plaza de Mayo to the seat of the national congress.Among them will be Stephanie Cabovianco, a 30-year-old activist from Buenos Aires. “There are no outright leaders coordinating our movement in Latin America – and that’s a good thing,” she explains. “This is a fight led by young people, and its structure should be as horizontal as possible.” New Zealand leading the way into Friday nr 2 in #WeekForFuture Early reports speak of 170’000 people on #ClimateStrike in NZ. Or 3,5% of the population... Good luck everyone striking around the world. Change is coming!!#FridaysForFuture https://t.co/u5JIWkNDen The strikes are a sign of the growing awareness and anger of the severity and scale of the climate crisis among people around the world. Earlier this week, Thunberg excoriated world leaders at the UN for their “betrayal” of young people after the New York summit failed to deliver ambitious new commitments to address dangerous global heating. The climate activist told governments: “You are still not mature enough to tell it like it is. You are failing us. But the young people are starting to understand your betrayal.”"

Share this...FacebookTwitterMeteorologist Dr Karsten Brandt’s website donnerwetter.de gives his Central European seasonal forecast for the fall and looks ahead into the winter.
The good news is that autumn may turn out to be warm and pleasant for Central Europe. The bad news is that there’s a good chance the winter will be cold.

Brandt writes:
The current long-term prognoses provide a preliminary look into the 2011-2012 winter. For those of you who were hoping for a mild winter after the last snowy and cold winters, which brought traffic chaos and shortages of road salt, you’ll probably end up disappointed: At the moment the indications show that there is going to be a powerful cold phase in the Winter of 2011/2012. At least one, and probably even 2 months are going to be icy.”
Cold winters “due to global warming”

Now for you AGW skeptics out there, don’t you dare go out saying that a cold Central European winter is a sign of cooling. To the contrary according to new models out of Potsdam, cold winters are a sure sign of global warming and man-made climate change, just as this is the case with hot weather. Yes the cold fits right in with the global warming picture – the models say so.
According to Vladimir Petoukhov last year of the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research in Potsdam, Germany:
Our results imply that several recent severe winters do not conflict the global warming picture but rather supplement it, being in qualitative agreement with the simulated large‐scale atmospheric circulation realignment.”
Here he is not just talking about Central Europe, but the northern hemisphere in general.
Our simulations with the ECHAM5 general circulation model demonstrate that lower‐troposphere heating over the B‐K seas in the Eastern Arctic caused by the sea ice reduction may result in strong anticyclonic anomaly over the Polar Ocean and anomalous easterly advection over northern continents. This causes a continental‐scale winter cooling reaching −1.5°C, with more than 3 times increased probability of cold winter extremes over large areas including Europe.”
This is all getting quite confused. Global warming causes colder winters. Warmer ocean waters cause more cyclones, But if the warmer ocean waters are in the Arctic then they are actually “anti-cyclonic”…which means less storms. If all that doesn’t make sense, well that’s because nonsense, confusion and psychosis are also traced back to AGW. A recent study said so.
One thing is certain: Natural climate change is causing lots of silly science.

Share this...FacebookTwitterI thought the planet today was warm – too warm, we keep hearing. Well the Arctic was a heck of a lot warmer 53 million years ago. Today’s climate by comparison is downright frigid.
The Bild der Wissenschaft reports on a paper appearing in the Proceedings of the Royal Society here that shows the Arctic was covered with forests.
The Arctic appears to have been forested 53 million years ago, along with rich plant and animal diversity. According to the paper, conditions were similar to the southeastern North America, with climate conditions like Central Europe’s today. Scientists from the University of Birmingham discovered this by analysing rock layers of the Stenkul fjord on the Canadian island of Ellesmere and the pollen, fungus spores and fossils of animals they contained.
According to Bild der Wissenschaft, the average annual temperature was a relatively balmy 8 to 15 egrees Celsius back then, with summertime temperatures climbing above 20°C. In the wintertime the temperatures were around the freezing point, similar to what we have today in Europe and southern North America today.
The scientists were surprised by the diversity of plants and that they were found so far north during the warm periods.
Now that’s real global warming – and not the 0.7°C we have had over the last 150 years.

When it’s the 2nd coldest year of this century, sea levels are dropping and you’re a warmist desperate for headlines, what do you do? You resort to using outlier and obscure data sources – like the warmist University of Bremen – and claim Arctic ice is “dramatically shrinking” and has reached “a record low” (since satellite measurement began 30 years ago).
Too bad all other datasets show the opposite is true. Using the other well-known sources, the NOAA IMS, NSIDC, JAXA, NORSEX, DMI, or AMSR-E, 2011 was not even close to 2007.
By most accounts, 2011 fell about 300,000 sq km short of 2007. That’s more than 8000 Manhattans. You can see all the up-to-date charts at Anthony Watts excellent sea ice page here.
Dr. Steve Goddard prepared an excellent comparison chart of 2007 and 2011. As you can see it’s not even close when viewed objectively.
Green shows ice added in 2011 compared to 2007.

How the U. of Bremen measures ice to me is truly mysterious. Are they into science or media manipulation? Serious and objective observers of course will be extra careful with future statements coming from Bremen.
Will 2011 take a turn downwards in the days ahead?

Right now temperatures north of 80°N latitude are below normal (see chart below) and falling rapidly, as they typically do this time of the year. Refreezing is now taking place at a vigorous rate. In fact, by most accounts, the 2011 melting season ended near a record early point (Sept 9 – IARC-JAXA). A warming world would show ice melts into late September, and not ending in early September.
Temperature above 80°N, http://ocean.dmi.dk/arctic/meant80n.uk.php:

Arctic freezing and melting is but only one single indicator from many in discerning global temperature behaviour. Ice-free North Poles were recorded back in the 1950s. And over the last months Steve Goddard’s site has presented numerous accounts of “rapidly melting Arctic ice” – from the early 20th century! Clearly there is nothing unusual about today’s global climate and “ice-free Arctics”.
The relatively low ice extents today in the Arctic are all part of the ongoing global cyclic changes. They are nothing new. Indeed many scientists expect the Arctic to recover. And when it does, it could very well be that melting will shift to the Antarctic.
And if it doesn’t, then expect places like the University of Bremen to see to it that it does.
