================================
From: Ivar Giaever [mailto:giaever@XXXX.com]
Sent: Tuesday, September 13, 2011 3:42 PM
To:kirby@aps.org
Cc: Robert H. Austin; ‘William Happer’; ‘Larry Gould’; ‘S. Fred Singer’; Roger Cohen
Subject: I resign from APS
Dear Ms. Kirby
Thank you for your letter inquiring about my membership. I did not renew it because I can not live with the statement below:
Emissions of greenhouse gases from human activities are changing the atmosphere in ways that affect the Earth’s climate. Greenhouse gases include carbon dioxide as well as methane, nitrous oxide and other gases. They are emitted from fossil fuel combustion and a range of industrial and agricultural processes. The evidence is incontrovertible: Global warming is occurring.
If no mitigating actions are taken, significant disruptions in the Earth?s physical and ecological systems, social systems, security and human health are likely to occur. We must reduce emissions of greenhouse gases beginning now.
In the APS it is ok to discuss whether the mass of the proton changes over time and how a multi-universe behaves, but the evidence of global warming is incontrovertible? The claim (how can you measure the average temperature of the whole earth for a whole year?) is that the temperature has changed from ~288.0 to ~288.8 degree Kelvin in about 150 years, which (if true) means to me is that the temperature has been amazingly stable, and both human health and happiness have definitely improved in this ?warming? period.
Best regards,
Ivar Giaever
Nobel Laureate 1973

Share this...FacebookTwitterAmid all the solar bankruptcies and exorbitant subsidies being paid out and causing electricity rates to skyrocket, see previous post, here’s hippie David Suzuki in the following video (3 min. mark) insisting “It’s free, man, it’s free!”

With idiots like that advising governments, we’re not surprised everything is going bankrupt.
It may be an alternative, but it’s lightyears from being free. Just ask the poor people in Germany.

Share this...FacebookTwitterA scan of the larger German online dailies such as DIE WELT, Bild, Der Spiegel, FAZ, etc.  here in Germany shows absolutely no interest or any coverage of Al Gore’s 24 Hours of Reality.Maybe the old continent is losing interest in a movement that once appeared to be scientific, but has long since been reduced to childish name-calling and data manipulation.
The AFP here put out a news blurb, but little else is out there. It could be that editors will print something later, if space allows. But in general the silence is deafening.
Gore’s long losing streak
Objectively speaking, Al Gore is on serious a losing streak. His book sales have hit rock bottom, the Chicago Climate Exchange is dead, so is the Kyoto protocol successor, skepticism is growing, and his new Climate Reality Project is getting few visitors after a brief jump right after it opened. Indeed the global warming issue is out – totally passé.
A big problem is how Gore combatively frames the issue. For him it’s either you accept the science of climate catastrophe, or you are a despicable denier. Gore simply doesn’t grasp that most people are somewhere in between.
Even the warmist/alarmist sites in Germany are not even bothering to report on Gore’s senseless rantathon. One gets the feeling that he is appearing more and more washed up with every passing month. And with every emotional outburst, he is being regarded more and more as an embarrassment to the movement rather than a bonus.

Share this...FacebookTwitterLike all electric cars, the Norwegian Think Global electric car was the future. And because it held the promise of rescuing the climate, it was especially worshipped by the media. It symbolized technical savvy, progressive thinking, and was supposed to be proof that thinking green could lead to success, profit and a saved planet.
Well think again. All that was just slick marketing. And, as always, it never takes long for reality to catch up, pass and leave fantasy in the dust…no matter how much it is subsidized.
Cars waiting a year for parts, 30% broken down
About a week ago the English-language Norwegian online newspaper thelocal.no told us the story of how the hip “Think” electric cars has turned into a complete flop, at least in Norway. The Local writes here:
Think electric cars have begun to stack up at the few mechanic’s shops able to service them due to a spare parts shortage. Up to 30 percent of the 2,000-odd models produced have suffered breakdowns of a key power-control unit, or PCU. The car’s lithium-ion battery is powerless to recharge without the PCU, and the plant that made them shut its doors in Finland in June.”
When the car was first rolled out, the politically correct media loved it. Even Norwegian neswpaper Addresseavisa bought one of its own. But The Local writes that Addresseavisa’s own Think “was in for repair”.

Most likely sitting in a lot in the back waiting for spare parts that likely will never come. The Think car has had a history of failure. According to Wikipedia it went bankrupt 4 times since it was founded in 1991. Even Ford took a shot at it, but abandoned it.
Nissan Leaf and range anxiety 
The Think car is not the only electric car suffering from financial and technical woes. Other brands, even with the help of massive subsidies, have shown zero viability. Take the subsidized Nissan Leaf for example: Liza Barth of Consumer Reports panned it. Here’s what she wrote about it (emphasis added):
I decided to head out on my regular long commute, with the cheaper toll, but saw the Leaf quickly run though the charge and drop to 39 miles about halfway through my trip and I was freezing. I was very happy to see stopped traffic on the New York State Thruway (that’s a first) as that calmed my range anxiety and I saw the estimated range actually increase by six miles. The last two miles of my trip, I put on the heat with 24 miles left, but it did little to warm my already numb fingers and toes. I made it to the office with 17 miles to spare.”
The Leaf also comes with a “high-pitched whine”.   The infrastructure for charging up electric cars is also a complete flop.  For example North Carolina’s Duke Energy supplies charging stations for electric cars, but has asked its customers not to use them. According to WCNC:
Duke Energy is asking customers who own their electric car charging station to stop using the product after a house fire in Mooresville last month.”
Looks like lack of range, massive subsidies, impracticality and no infrastructure will continue to plague and cripple electric cars for a long time to come.

Share this...FacebookTwitterIn a press release here, the German Weather Service, DWD, announces the release of its so-called interactive Climate Atlas, which projects what the German climate will be like up to the year 2100. They’ve got some real prophets over there.Needless to say, the climatically correct DWD’s Climate Atlas projects many barbecue summers in the decades ahead for Germans, especially after 2050, when many of us will be gone and climate change hysteria will be something in the history books.
The DWD uses a composite of up to 21 climate crystal balls simulations for generating it’s climate projections.
Sorry for the sarcasm, but for me these 90-year projections are pretty much hocus pocus…just colourfully packaged PhD guesses. Can anyone tell me what the sun will be like in the year 2060? Oh sorry, I forgot.  The sun is only a backseat climate driver.
No barbecue summer this year, July 2011 was too cool.
In another press release, the DWD reports that July, 2011, in Germany refused to cooperate with the models and was colder than normal. So Germans will have to wait at least another year for hopes of the next barbecue summer.
Germany had a quite gray, cool and wet July according to the preliminary results of the DWD’s approximately 2000 measurement stations. Compared to the long-term mean, July 2011 came is at 16.1°C, 0.8°C cooler than normal. The coolest areas were the southwestern parts of Germany. The highest recorded temperature was 33.8°C on July 12 and the low was 2.0°C recorded on July 16. In Münsingen-Apfelstetten light frost was even recorded. Sea temperatures of the North and Baltic Seas remained below 20°C (last year they were up to 23°C).
July in Germany was also wet. About 114 l/m² fell on average – well above the normal of 78 l/m².  The wettest area: the town of Barth recorded 291 l/m² of rainfall – doubling its previous record.
July in Germany also recorded less sunshine, with an average of 162 hours, or 22% less than the normal of 209 hours. This made it the 8th grayest month since 1951.

In the news Poland is holding firm against all the EU-climate rescue nonsense. According to the German site http://klima-der-gerechtigkeit.de/ (Climate of Justice!), climate protection is going to be increasingly problematic with Poland, who are now suing the EU Commission because of the EU’s conditions that will mean charging emitters for rights to emit greenhouse gases. After 2013, companies will have to pay for certificates. 95% of Poland’s electricity is generated using coal, and the country plans to build an additional 13 coal-fired power plants in the future, READ HERE, which writes:
Its heavy dependence on coal for electricity production is highlighted by a plan to build 13 new coal-fired power plants, for which the country obtained free “carbon permits” from the European Commission the day before it assumed the Presidency. ClientEarth, an environmental NGO, is reportedly attempting to bring the matter to court, arguing that such free allocations under the EU-ETS are not legal.”
Let’s hope Poland sticks to its guns and doesn’t cave in to the green suicide energy-pact that is being rammed through in Europe.

From Steven Goddard, sea level rise drop.

Der Spiegel reports today how the UN has just come out with a new report claiming the big threat now is local heat waves and freak storms.
That’s quite a change from global-wide warming and sea level rise.

Remember how for years and years UN scientists, armed with their mighty models, warned the planet faced massive hurricanes, rapid sea level rise and global-wide warming? Funny how we’ve been hearing very little about that lately. We’ve gone from “global warming” to “spot heating” with local storms sprinkled in.
Maybe the change in narrative has something to do with the hard statistics showing no real hurricanes hitting the USA in over 3 years or so. In fact it’s been yet another year with not a hurricane hitting the coast. Indeed tropical cyclone activity looks everything but out of control, and has been taming big time for 20 years! See: Ryan Maue. Can’t dupe the public with that anymore.
Even worse (if you’re an alarmist) is that sea levels are dropping! See Steve Goddard’s site here. They’ve been showing a declining trend over the last couple years. Oh dear! oh dear! The models never predicted that.

These disappearing horrors, once their favorites, have turned into shock and awe over the warmist camp. It’s panic time for them. How on Earth are they now supposed to spread fear and panic when all their old horror scenarios are dissolving before their very eyes?
The answer of course is to trot out new ones, this time they’re using horrors where the statistics are incomplete, thus making it difficult to disprove alleged increasing trends. Not only that, their models have suddenly begun to show they’re coming! And we all know how flawless their models are.
Der Spiegel reports today on how a new UN study has now just come up with local extreme heat waves as the next man-made climate disaster. It’s perfect – man-made heat waves are now lurking somewhere out there, waiting to pounce on unsuspecting regions and fry unprepared citizens. It could happen anywhere, and you may be next! The UN cites Russia and Texas as compelling evidence. Also waiting to ambush locally are storms and flash floods, so says the UN.
But even Der Spiegel is not so convinced and adds:
This year other studies show no increase in weather extremes: Winter storms in the northern hemisphere have been trending less, report scientists in the magazine ‘Tellus’. The same goes for river flooding in USA. That US rivers are being influenced by man-made climate change cannot be discerned, the US Geological Service summed up in October.”
Global sea level rise and global-scale warming are obviously dead. Looks like a tough road ahead for warmists and their desperate efforts to keep the climate Halloween party going.

Share this...FacebookTwitterAnthropogenic global warming skepticism, not taken seriously in Germany until recently, has now got the warmists in a state of panic, despair and even deeper irrationality.
 
Warmists Vlad Georgescu and Marita Vollborn have written an essay at German public radio called: Climate Change? No Thanks! It focuses on the growing wave of skepticism now sweeping across Germany, all sparked by Fritz Vahrenholt’s and Sebastian Lüning’s skeptic book Die kalte Sonne (see right side bar). Georgescu and Vollborn write:
It is a dangerous comeback. Not even a year has passed since 7 of Germany’s atomic power reactors have been taken offline, and book publishers and the media have now found a new issue: man-made climate change is a fake.”
Both Georgescu and Vollborn claim that publishers, using hefty advertising budgets and “brute force”, are ramming books of this kind onto the bestseller lists against the mainstream. Georgescu and Vollborn are clearly perturbed and add:
Book publishers are whipping up this trend because provocative issues promise fat profits in times of falling sales. The publishing comeback of the climate change opponents would be negligible were it not for the simultaneous ongoing energy-political decisions that have serious consequences.”
Here one can assume with reasonable certainty that the two authors are taking aim at Hoffmann & Campe, the publisher of Die kalte Sonne, and Axel Springer, a powerful media group that runs the leading dailies that recently featured articles such as the now infamous “The CO2 Lies“ and others.
In addition to Vahrenholt’s bestselling book, the two authors bemoan that the German government at the same time has drastically cut back solar energy subsidies, and call the move “an energy-political catastrophe.” Never mind what the subsidies have cost consumers.
The two true-beliver authors are convinced that alternatives are the way to go in the future and pose the question: “Are we too dumb to take advantage of these opportunities?” To which they answer “yes” because “we’re blind to the interdependencies between politics and energy corporations, or the lack of will to stop them.”
At the end of the essay, the two sobbing authors blame the miserable state of the global warming movement on the energy companies and Big Oil. In the end the two authors incite activists and protesters to act up and occupy.
Vahrenholt on Phoenix TV: “High time the discussion gets opened up”
To their credit, producers at Phoenix television featured a 34-minute long interview with Vahrenholt. The interview will be rebroadcast a third time this afternoon.
Click here to watch interview with Vahrenholt
During the talkshow “im Dialog“, moderator Alfred Schier already early in the interview confirms Germany’s growing skepticism: “There have always been skeptics in Germany, but they were never really taken very seriously. That has changed since you’ve joined their side.”

In the show Vahrenholt pretty much said what he’s been saying for weeks now – the IPCC is overstating CO2’s contribution to warming, and he backs it up with facts that no one has refuted so far. At the 7-minute mark Vahrenholt reminds the audience that it is not only himself who doubts the IPCC, “but also hundreds of scientists”.
At the 9:30 mark Vahrenholt then says that Germany “has reached a point where it is no longer allowed to think new ideas” and that people who disagree with AGW get no support of any kind. “It’s high time the discussion gets opened up,” Vahrenholt says, and adds that his book was written to give skeptic scientists a platform which they have long been denied.
The interview then goes into the details of the historical temperature curve where Vahrenholt explains the oceanic and solar impacts that are at play, but which up to now have been ignored by the IPCC. Vahrenholt says that there needs to be an explanation on why there has not been any warming in 14 years.
At the 18:30 mark, Schier brings up Mojib Latif, one of Vahrenholt’s harshest critics. Vahrenholt said he’s somewhat disappointed how a renowned scientist like Latif can make an X look like a U before the German public. Vahrenholt then explained the workings of the stratosphere and that these were things Latif should know. Vahrenholt summed up: “Latif warned 10 years ago that school children in Germany would not know what a snowman was” and then reversed course 5 years later by claiming “that it would get colder”. On that point Vahrenholt agreed. He then added:
What particularly irritated me was that he discussed the book without bothering to read it. That’s just not the way to have a discussion. I read all his publications. This is just something you simply expect a scientist to do.”
Vahrenholt later in the interview claimed that the IPCC has created a climate of fear in Germany – so much so that the country, which gets about as much sunshine as Alaska, went through all the trouble of installing half of the world’s solar power capacity at an enormous cost. Indeed Today Germany is in such a state of irrational panic that it seems ready to commit economic suicide in order to save itself from a computer-modelled climate catastrophe fantasy.
At the 29:30 mark Schier again confirms that skepticism has been unleashed in Germany:
With your book you have turned the perception of climate change on its head, a bestseller against the mainstream.”
Vahrenholt then later says: “In a society there always needs to be someone to provide for movement. In the end, I think society benefits from it.”
At the 32:30 mark Vahrenholt says about the IPCC:
I’m afraid that with the next report, the 5th report, the IPCC will not come to their senses. In the draft it does not look good, the sun doesn’t get the right to be a factor. But in the end, reality will decide whether the IPCC and Germany’s biggest warming proponents bare correct. […] What’s nice today is that with the internet, it’s forever. In 10 years we’ll be able to look back at everything that is said today and see who was right.”
Schier ended the interview by saying that they would meet again in the year 2020 “im Dialog” to see who is right: the IPCC or Vahrenholt. My bet is not on the IPCC.

Share this...FacebookTwitterWith another financial crisis flaring up, the green energy sector this time is taking a hit. This is being reported today in the German language Technology Review here.
Hat-tip: reader Jean
No wonder Al Gore blew a fuse a few days back. With this news and the Chicago Climate Exchange shutting down, the poor bloke is probably taking a real hit. Might want to have a skyscraper watch.
The article starts with the introduction:
Innovative companies of the finance-intense sector of renewable energy risk are getting their supply of cash cut off. Investors are opting for lower risk projects.”
Almost everywhere globally governments are scaling back programs that support renewable energies.”

And so it’s only normal that venture capital companies are now opting out. Investment strategies are changing. Technology Review writes:
Germany, Italy and Spain are reducing subsidies, in America the money from the 2009 stimulus package is slowly running out.”
According to Technology Review, people want quicker returns and less risk. Well who doesn’t? Technology Review writes:
During the last years many finance companies began, however, to invest in long-term projects with high capital requirements. That only worked mainly because they were able to expect subsidies from the state. Thus hundreds of millions flowed into start-ups in solar technology, which first had to build expensive plants to get the technology ripe for the market. The profits came later, if at all.”
Now the state subsidies are shrinking and new startups will have little chance of competing against the already established companies – too risky. The bubble has nowhere to go but to implode. So watch the politicians soon scramble and start blaming “speculators” and “greedy finance companies” for the mess they themselves created, and then start calling for more financial regulation. Technology Review sums it up:
David Victor, expert for solar and wind energy support at the University of California in San Diego fears the worst: ‘Innovation in the energy sector could slip into a major crisis’.”

Share this...FacebookTwitterSometimes I don’t know whether to sympathize with the protesters, or to tell them “I told ya so, stupid”. This industrialization of Vermont’s landscape is happening because these environmentalists originally spurred it all on with their ridiculous protect-the-climate nonsense, led by kook, dimwit senators like Bernie Sanders.

This is Green Energy? Let’s call it the Bernie Sanders Environmental Rescue Reserve.
Now the protesters are horrified at the consequences of their earlier stupidity and climate folly. Vermont has already ruined the Sheffield heights ridgeline, and now they are busily doing the same to the ridgeline of the Lowell Mountains, both are just a few miles from my boyhood home.
The protest is small but gathering in size and momentum. But I’m afraid it’s all a little too late though. You just don’t spend millions in planning, permitting and site preparation only to abandon the project. It’s definitely going to happen. At this point all we can hope for is that it’ll put the brakes on the other landscape desecration projects slated for elsewhere. I know the next time I’ll be driving there I’ll be seeing a massive industrial complex where once a beautiful mountain ridgeline once stood.
Sure you get more wind on a mountain-top. But I know the climate of Northern Vermont, and it aint that windy. Nobody can honestly say that they are going to reach anywhere near 20% capacity for these 450-foot windmills. There just isn’t that much wind there – look at the video. See any wind?
What’s really stupid is that 95% of Vermont’s energy was CO2-free to begin with. But who cares, let’s blast the mountain tops off and industrialize them, and pretend we’ve rescued the planet like real heroes.
As far as the protesters are concerned, I have to wish them the best of luck. I encourage them to do whatever it takes to stop this true environmental crime now taking place in Lowell. I’d trespass in a minute if I were there. James Hansen and Greenpeace do it all the time; get right in their faces. If the law fails, then you have to force it until it works again. I’m not advocating violence, just a peaceful protest. Readers ought to donate whatever they can, at least write a message of support. What’s happening here is not law, it’s the law selling out.
The protesters have started a blog, and updates are being provided. http://lowellmountainsnews.wordpress.com/
I really don’t want to write about this – it’s just too difficult.

So let’s give Obama credit where credit is due. With his focus now returning to jobs and economy, he is slowing getting on the right path. Still, right now, his formula for job creation looks like it comes from a playbook written in the 1930s.

Share this...FacebookTwitterBitter conflict with climate skeptics has moved to the newspapers and media. Earlier this year, German science review magazine WPK Quarterly published a report here on how one scientist dealt with a skeptic journalist, hat-tip here and here.
It’s front page cover bears a full page photo of Stefan Rahmstorf along with the headline:

Independent Scientist or Poltical Agitator?
 A journalist defends herself against the malice of Stefan Rahmstorf”

The feature story, written by Markus Lehmkuhl, starts on page 4 and is titled:

Ideology and Climate Change or:
 How to shut up journalists
A freelance journalist becomes a target of of renown climate scientist Stefan Rahmstorf, who in the fight for the alleged truth doesn’t hold back using personal defamation.”

Stefan Rahmstorf of the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research (PIK) is an IPCC lead author, advisor on Hans Schellnhuber’s WBGU, and one of Germany’s most influential climate scientists. Today it is widely known that journalists and scientists who express doubt over man-made climate change or criticism over the science and the IPCC often find themselves attacked by the Potsdam professor via the press or his Internet blog.
For German science journalist Irene Meichsner, it was in the wake of Climategate when she penned an unflattering piece about the IPCC and the slew of errors and false assumptions in its Fourt Assessment Report. Her story was published on February 8, 2010, in two German dailies: the Kölner Stadtsanzeiger (KStA) and the Frankfurter Rundschau (FR). Sticking to the facts, Meichsner’s damning piece cast the IPCC’s credibility into serious doubt.
Rahmstorf, who acts as sort of a gatekeeper and watchdog when it comes to guarding the global warming hypothesis and the institutes that propagate it, responded by publishing 2 pieces at his blog, the first on 20 February and the second on 26 April 2010. He also had a letter published at the FR on March 25, 2010, where he called the accusations made in Meichsner’s story false and made up. He attacked Meischsner, implying that she played loose with the facts, and that she had even lifted part of her text from skeptic blogs.
Rahmstorf even convinced the FR to publish a 2-page retraction on April 30, 2010, which, according to the WPK Quarterly, claimed that Meichsner’s accusations aimed at the IPCC were “part of a campaign by skeptics” designed “to discredit the IPCC”.
According to the WPK, Rahmstorf wrote in his February 20 blog piece that Meichsner’s story represented:
…a media scandal where a few journalists mislead the public with completely exaggerated or freely made up pseudo-scandals. Too many among them are naive and go along without seeing through the farce.”
Rahmstorf also aimed harsh words at the journalist’s integrity and credibility, suggesting that she never bothered to read the IPCC report and that she did things that never happened. For example, the WPK Quarterly writes:



<!--
google_ad_client = ""ca-pub-3545577860068042"";

google_ad_height = 200;
//-->




He accused her of uncritically copying text from [Richard] North and [Jonathan] Leake.”
As credibility and reputation are especially important for the survival of a free-lance journalist, and based on that she had stuck to the facts in her article, Meichsner felt Rahmstorf had obviously ventured too far in his response to her story, and so took the matter to court demanding that Rahmstorf be forced to cease and desist making the untrue claims.
So what judgement did the State Court in Cologne hand down? WPK Quarterly provides that (my English legal translation – you’ll forgive me for not being a lawyer):

In the name of the People, 9 February of this year,
a judgement was issued and entails: The Defendant is
judged by the 28th Civil Chamber of the State Court
of Cologne “to (…) cease and desist from
arousing the impression that
a) the Plaintiff copied from bloggers Richard
North and journalist Jonathan Leake;
b) the Plaintiff had the defendent
informed through the editorial board of
the Frankfurter Rundschau that he should
remove the name of the Plaintiff from the
blog story of the Defendant ‘FR Retracts
Article Against IPCC’ and to name only
the Frankfurter Rundschau. Furthermore,
the Defendant must pay the plaintiff
511.58 euro plus interest and bear
two thirds of the costs of the legal dispute.
The Chamber determined that the grounds
were untrue allegation of facts that
violated her personal rights.”

WPK Quarterly wrote at length about this story and featured it in its up-front editorial, deeming the overall case merits special attention because:
“…a free journalist was able to successfully defend herself against the malice that a renown scientist who had dumped on her.”
Although Rahmstorf lost in court, he was able to chalk up an off-court victory. When asked if she would report more on climate change, the WPK writes:
For now she has had enough of climate science. She doesn’t write about it any more.”
Indeed it’s not a topic for those with thin skin and people who can’t afford to put their careers on the line. Expressing skepticism over a politically correct issue in Germany indeed leads to malicious attacks. Like the old saying goes: Sometimes it’s much more dangerous to speak up against wrongdoing than it is to commit it.

Share this...FacebookTwitterSlowly it seems that some greens are starting to wake up from their zombie condition and are showing signs that they may one day realize the disaster they’ve unleashed.
German public television, the ZDF of all networks, has a clip on how the building of windmills has completely run amok in Germany. Hat-tip: www.kaltesonne.de/.


Now mountain and hill tops are being deforested to clear the way for 200 meter tall monster industrial wind turbines. As the ZDF shows, greens are aghast.
The clip shows how forests in Rhineland Palatinate are being cleared, along with the habitats of 13 different types of bats and other types of biodiversity, all to make way for wind parks. The people at the start of the clip are visibly in a state of shock. This is the last thing they ever expected of their once beloved movement.
Margrit Stroh says:
I’m amazed that once we were all in favour of wind energy, and now we are demonstrating against it.”
As for Isa Mann (later in the clip) save your tears, lady. You were warned. Worse, the clearing of land is being done without even obtaining a permit. That formality can be skipped when it comes windparks – so decrees the Greens.
With wind parks, all due process gets thrown to the wind. Bats, beetles or trees, which can otherwise stop any billion-euro project in Germany, simply get trampled when it comes to wind parks.

Part of the reason for all this is because the German government finds itself in a jam. It concocted a nice story on why it needs to be done, and now it has to save its face quickly – even if it means destroying Germany’s once famous forests and landscape.
Magdelene Becker, on the verge of being speechless, says:
Now, even before anything is permitted! I can’t believe that they are allowed to do such a thing. I don’t understand it.”
Follow the Vorreiter (Führer)!
If you don’t understand it, then let Green Party propagandist, one bordering on climate madness, Eveline Lemke explain it:
If we don’t succeed in transforming our supply of energy soon and if we don’t show the world how to fight climate change, then nobody will look at us. Germany is the leader. We want the world to witness how one goes about protecting the climate. Without climate protection, there won’t be any species diversity left to protect. This is why this is a priority.”
Rarely does one see that level of arrogance and dominance-with-a-mission as that displayed by Lemke. Now if that doesn’t convince you how out to lunch these people are…
Welcome to Germany – a country run by Green infallible Führers – and soon to be covered by windmills, corn for biogas…and possibly lots of angry citizens.
Note: The video clip is called: Der “GRÜNE Wahnsinn”, which means: The “GREEN Madness”. I call it “Green Führerism”, which is the same.

Speaking of falling standards, Al Gore and the IPCC got a Nobel Peace Prize for a crackpot movie and flawed climate reports respectively. So Schellnhuber is now in good company. Who is next? James Hansen?

Mueller: We are here on the island of Sylt at the conference “Gegenwind” and I have with me Professor Dr. Malberg from Berlin. Professor Malberg, what do you say about wind power with regards to the climate discussion?
Prof. Malberg: Wind power plants cannot be justified by the climate issue. I examined in detail what drives the climate and I looked at all the available data, from Europe, from USA, from Japan –  all data were evaluated, and naturally the global data. It clearly shows that the climate is dominated by the sun, and then on top of that by the oceans, and then a little bit by the CO2 effect. I would estimate it has a magnitude of 10%, for Co2, and not more. More than 80% of the climate change is driven by the sun. That means relative to natural climate change, the influence by CO2 is very small, and so it does not justify any action for climate protection, where wind parks are built in order to save CO2. Sure you can do it, but it won’t have any impact on our climate, at least no real impact.
Mueller (1:33): Germany is a leader in installing wind-parks, and so are the German efforts sensible?
Prof. Malberg: It’s naturally a political decision, that’s clear. But it is also an economic decision because we know it is very expensive. And when we have to transmit the power from wind parks at the coast and into the country all the way to south Germany. Then it is going to be a very expensive transmission. Here at the conference we have seen that it is much cheaper to transport coal or oil than it is to transport electricity. And I believe one day there’s going to be an ugly awakening when we realize how expensive electricity has become.
Mueller (2:25): One reason we should expand wind energy, as you mentioned, is climate change. How true is it that yes, there always has been climate change, but the increase over the last years is especially frightening?
Prof. Malberg: That is in no way based on anything. That is really a huge myth. During the last 13 years, the amount of CO2 in the atmosphere has risen more than at any time since the last Ice Age, especially since the start of the Industrial Revolution. But since the last 10 to 12 years, we have not had any more global warming. The temperature has reached a plateau and has even shown a slight declining trend. That means that while CO2 has increased strongly, the temperature has not reacted at all.
Mueller (3:24): And what do you say to politicians and media who tell us every day to be active for the climate?
Prof. Malberg: My conclusion is one that is completely different: I say it is a basic human right to have clean air, clean water, uncontaminated soil and an ecological system that is intact. That means the highest priority is environmental protection. But humans do not have “a right to a stable climate”. That just does not exist. It never has existed. What is natural about the climate system is that it is not constant, it always changes.  When people speak so often about species dying, then one has to address environmental protection, and not assign everything to climate protection, and to blame it all on a phantom. The temperature increase we have had over the last 150 years of about 0.7°C has occurred multiple times since the last Ice Age, and nature repeatedly withstood it. Today there would be no polar bears if nature was unable to cope in balancing out the natural temperature fluctuations.
Mueller (4:50): What can you take home [from this conference] here in Sylt?
Prof. Malberg: We’ve had an interesting spectrum here. We discussed the climate behaviour. We’ve discussed the clearly measured non-acceleration of sea level. Of course there is a natural sea level rise, but it has not accelerated. We’ve discussed legal topics here at this conference. And finally we have learned from an energy expert that if we go ahead with wind and solar energy, then we have to understand that these two forms of energy depend on the weather. The wind doesn’t always blow, and very often the sun doesn’t shine here. And building solar plants in the desert would mean huge losses of energy because of the long transmission distances. That means we looked at a very broad spectrum of issues that absolutely belong in the public debate.
Mueller (6:00): Professor Mahlberg, thank you for the discussion.

Share this...FacebookTwitterHave you ever been to a dinner party with lots of people when suddenly a mouse runs across the room and someone yells “mouse!” Most people simply ignore the intrusion, while others may ask “where?” But you can always count on someone flying into a fit of hysteria, jumping up on a table screaming and shaking violently until the medics arrive and shoot the person up with a massive dose of tranquilizers before wheeling the sedated patient to the nearest hospital for overnight obsevation. Irrational? Yes.That was pretty much how German politicians and media reacted in the wake of Fukushima. As the rest of the world watched with concern, and had their reactors checked over for good measure, Germany flipped out and plunged into a wave mass panic not seen since Orson Welles’ radio adaptation of War of the Worlds by H. G. Wells on October 30, 1938. After Fukushima, Germany immediately shut down 8 of its older reactors and then rammed through a law ordering the remaining 9 reactors be shut down as soon as possible.
That bout of total irrationality and panicked decision-making is now going to cost Germany a bundle, so estimates engineering giant Siemens AG here. Hat-tip Benny Peiser.
According to Reuters:
Germany’s exit from nuclear power could cost the country as much as 1.7 trillion  euros ($2.15 trillion) by 2030, or two thirds of the country’s GDP in 2011,  according to Siemens (SIEGn.DE),  which built all of Germany’s 17 nuclear plants.”
If that does not bankrupt something, nothing will. Germany wants to switch over to renewable energy. How much will that impact global temperatures? A few hundreths of a degree?
The estimate from Siemens makes some assumptions. Reuters writes:
The estimate of 1.7 trillion euros assumes strong expansion of renewables, with feed-in tariffs as the biggest chunk of costs. The cost would be lower — at about 1.4 billion euros — if gas was one of the major energy alternatives, Suess said.

The estimates given by Siemens factor in feed-in tariffs — costs that utilities have to pay to generators of renewable energy — investments into power transmission and distribution, operations and maintenance as well as technologies to store renewable energy and carbon dioxide.”
Siemens’ estimate is much higher than the 250-300 billion euros estimate given earlier by power plant executives. In the end, the price increase will be paid by the consumer, both private and business. This will hardly make Germany an attractive place to work (which is an activity that requires energy).
So it’s little wonder that businesses are calling it quits in Germany and moving to places that are more business friendly and energy is cheaper.
Don’t take my word for it. According to CO2 Handel here, comnpanies now see Germnany as a risk:
Rising energy and raw material prices are the top risks for Germany as a place to do business. Also 58% of companies fear that power outages. Since switching off 8 nuclear power reactors, power plants are have to switch on and off faster than ever before.”

Share this...FacebookTwitterWe’ve all heard about Hans Schellnhuber’s masterplan for the Great Transformation of society, from one powered by “climate killing” fossil fuel energies to one powered by gentle, earth-healing renewable energies.
Well, it turns out that the Great Transformation would likely end up being the Great Transfer-mation – of private wealth!
The online Die Rheinpfalz here  reports that if Germany succeeded in shifting to renewable energy, it would cost each German household €800.00 per month, or almost €10,000 ($13,000) per year, this according to calculations by physicist Gerd Ganteför of the University of Konstanz.
What benefit would all that money possibly lead to? Firstly, lots of government interference in private lives. Secondly, maybe a few undetectable hundredths of a degree Celsius of less warming. Indeed no endeavour in human history would cost so much and yet deliver so little to society as a whole. Thirdly, it would make (and has made) a few people outrageously rich.
Online Die Rheinphalz writes:
Covering the entire German energy demand of 2500 billion kwh per year – that includes heating, transportation and a large part of industry – with green technology would be impossible says the expert of the University of Konstanz. That would entail additional costs of 800 euros per household per month, and that is unaffordable,’ says Ganteför.”
But that’s not the way a group of green zealots see it. They actually believe we can’t afford not to take the unaffordable path of green energy, otherwise the earth will burn up. And a lot of interest groups and industries are just salivating over the prospects of such a massive transfer of wealth. Indeed many slimy European politicians from all parties have vested interests in green energy.
Ganteför points out that these extreme costs would not be bearable, and so they would lead to massive reductions in the use of electricity by private and business consumers, and so lead to a…:
…considerable change of lifestyle for every individual. Individual transportation and business production would have to be massively scaled back.”
But this is precisely what these green zealots want (IMHO). They want humankind to move back into the mud, to be completely humiliated – and to get very rich while inflicting the pain.

Share this...FacebookTwitterThere’s been some discussion in the media about the Potsdam Institute’s (PIK) recent paper claiming that Greenland is much closer to a collapse than previously expected.
 
Don Easterbrook calls PIK scenario “nonsense!” (Photo: nofrakkingconsensus.com)
However, few scientists outside the circle of IPCC alarmists are taking the PIK claims seriously. Recall that the IPCC 5th report is pathologically desperate for climate horror stories – because the planet hasn’t warmed at all in 15 years and is now actually cooling.
For example Professor Don Easterbrook at WUWT has called the PIK’s computer model generated scenario:
Nonsense! The Greenland ice core data show that almost all of the past 10,000 years was warmer than present and the ice sheet didn’t disappear.  The ice core data show periods of warming many times more intense as recent warming without melting the ice sheet.  So much for computer modeling!  Look at real data if you want to predict real events.”
Good advice. But the problem is that real climate data don’t produce any disaster scenarios.
U.S. planes abandoned in Greenland in 1942 recovered – after being buried in 100 meters of ice!
Here’s an anecdote that illustrates how Greenland ice thickened and not thinned as the PIK would like us to believe (hat-tip to a German reader by e-mail).
According to this news report from 2008, a group of plane enthusiasts, scientists, business people and adventurists founded WoRAG (Worldwide Recoveries AG) with the mission to conduct an expedition to Greenland.

The purpose? To recover US WWII planes buried under about 100 meters of ice in eastern Greenland.
In 1942 two U.S. bombers and 6 Lockheed P-38 Lightning fighter planes were being flown to England by American pilots to join up with British forces. But the pilots had to abandon their planes over Greenland because of bad weather and low fuel. The pilots were rescued a few days later by the US Marines.
One of the P 38 planes (pictured below) was recovered in 1992 – from under 80 meters of ice!

P 38 Lightning “Glacier Girl,” dug out from 268 feet of ice in eastern Greenland in 1992. (U.S. Air Force photo by Tech. Sgt. Ben Bloker)
According to the above-linked report, WoRAG set off to recover 5 more planes from under 100 meters of ice (just 16 years later in 2008) – a challenge that could be met only with specially developed and produced ice melting equipment. Why not wait for the rapid global warming to melt the ice away? The report writes:

Waiting for climate change to melt the ice would take way too long.”

Now how do you suppose the planes got buried by 100 meters of ice over 70 years? Boy, that sure is some ice melt!

This is stunningly phenomenal. According to spokeswoman Julia Strack at Hoffmann & Campe publishing, 20,000 copies have been distributed over the last week and:
It will enter the German bestseller list on Monday as number 14.”
“Die kalte Sonne” is also the No. 1 seller at publisher Hoffmann & Campe.

Source: Hoffmann & Campe Top Ten List
The NWZ daily in Oldenburg writes here:
Seldom has a book about climate change and the role of CO2 on climate fired up the debate like ‘Die kalte Sonne’ has. For many climate activists, the book’s subtitle is a provocation: ‘Why the climate catastroiphe is not taking place’ – which is viewed as playing down the harm and risk to the Earth’s climate.”
The NWZ then writes:
The demand for the book is large. At the moment the book is out of print and will go through another printing, Vahrenholt reported.”
Being in the top 20 is great news. In fact, all books in the top 20 are normally placed at the entrance of the book-shops near the cash registers. This will further bolster sales.

Mass press coverage
Although climate activists have blasted the book, major media outlets have been giving it ample coverage. Here are some quotes from the press collected by Hoffmann & Campe:
“While all of Europe Freezes these days, Fritz Vahrenholt is providing a heated debate.“ – Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung, 7 Feb. 2012
“Vahrenholt (62) a maverick who conveys the current zeitgeist.“ www.zeitonline.de, 6 February 2012
“…Germany’s most naughty renewable energy manager…“ – Frankfurter Allgemeine Sonntagszeitung, 29 January 2012
“… is Vahrenholt also a hardnosed climate skeptic?“ – Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung, 12 Feb 2012
“With his claims on climate change Professor Fritz Vahrenholt […] has provided for headlines.“ – Welt am Sonntag, 12 Feb 2012
“A new book on climate change has […] triggered a heated discussion. Thus the authors plead that imthat everybody keep a cool head. In this country this is going to be tough to do.“ – Die Welt, 11 Feb 2012
The warmists, in their attempts to slam the book, have only succeeded in driving it up near the top of bestseller lists. Worse is that once people read the book, they are never going to believe the hoax again.
It needs to be noted that most of the warmists who have blasted the book have not even read it. Mojib Latif confirmed that on ARD television when asked if he bought the book. He said he “read parts of it here and there”. So of course he isn’t going to have a clue about the book’s arguments, and thus he ends up saying dumb things that will come back to him later.

Share this...FacebookTwitterSteffen Hentrich of the liberty-oriented blogsite “Denken für die Freiheit” (Thinking for Liberty) writes a piece called “Climate-Killing Energy Transformation” about how Germany’s energy transformation from nuclear and fossil fuels to renewable energies is not working out very well.
 

The annual report “Energy Consumption in Germany in 2011″ confirms that Germany is going to have a difficult time reducing its share of CO2 emissions should nuclear power be stopped completely. Even though the total output of CO2 emissions is declining in Germany, more lignite (brown coal) is being burned (AGEB, S. 37) and the amount of CO2 emitted for each kilowatt hour of electricity jumped:
According to estimates by the German BDEW e.V. (Federal Association of German Energy and Water Management), the specific CO2 emissions from electricity generating plants for public power supply (i.e. not including power generation by industry) was 0.51 kg CO2/kWh net. With respect to the previous year (0.49 kg CO2/kWh net), they have risen about 4%! Only 2007 had such a high comparable increase, which also was attributed to the shutdown of some nuclear power plants, but to a lesser extent. The comparably CO2-intensive power generation from lignite exceeded the previous year’s level. Also the relative share of lignite power plants in the overall decreasing power production jumped 25%.”
The effects that renewable energy sources have on relieving the power supply should not be over-estimated. So the real question for the future becomes: what emission reductions can be reached if we opt to go without the further promotion of renewable energy?
The necessity of integrating the renewable energy power supply with the existing public power grid not only entails considerable investment and ecological burdens, but also adversely impacts the efficiency of the conventional power plant system. The more unsteadily conventional systems operate (because they have to constantly adjust according to the erratic supply from renewables) the less efficient they become.
It is increasingly clear that reducing CO2 is going to be much tougher than anyone expected. Costs are always proportional to the size of the obstacles. Pretending that the obstacles are small has no impact on the real price.

Share this...FacebookTwitterTough day for the German press yesterday, reporting the story about the Kaufmann et al 2011 paper, which looks at what’s behind the 10 years of no global warming. Read more here at WUWT . The day before that, signs of warming were everywhere, the media said. Then a day later they all say there hasn’t been warming in 10 years. Go figure!
Here’s a look at what some various newspapers and weeklies have written:
Der Spiegel writes:
China’s sulphur emissions put the brakes on climate change
Climate paradox: The atmosphere contains more and more carbon dioxide, but the temperatures did not go up to 2008. Scientists explain it with the phenomena of burning dirty coal in China. Foremost the sulphur contained in the coal compensates for the greenhouse effect.”
But Der Spiegel then warns of the consequences of China cleaning its emissions!
This is no reason to cancel the alarm for the future. The earth could be facing a phase of especially rash warming: when solar activity picks up again and emerging countries like China reduce their emissions of air pollutants like sulphur.”
Die Welt writes:
Why global warming has not occurred up to now
Climate scientists repeatedly warn of global warming – but: So far it hasn’t shown up.
Scientists warn everywhere of global warming. But today there is no trace of it.”
Die Presse writes:

A renown scientist says the stop in temperature increase can indeed be explained. The enormous increase of the emitted CO2 since 1998 has come for the most part from coal power plants in China. Starting in 1998, there was no global warming for 10 years, from 2005 to 2008 it was even 0.2°C cooler.”
Die Zeit writes:
China’s coal gives global warming a break
Despite the immense CO2 emissions, the greenhouse effect took a break from 1998 to 2008. Sulphur emissions, La Niña and a tired sun are responsible.”
The Financial Times Deutschland writes:
Solar cycles and coal power plants cooling the earth
China as the climate rescuer? Indeed the increasing coal consumption – in addition to other effects – has contributed to making global warming weaker than feared earlier. But the future temperature increase could be that much stronger.”
The Handelsblatt writes:
Environmental pollution puts the brakes on warming
Despite the increasing CO2 emissions into the atmosphere, the earth has hardly warmed over the last 10 years. Scientists say various factors are responsible, among them dirty coal and the solar cycle.”
Right! Now coal causes cooling. And the sun has an impact, too. I wonder if these scientists are ever going to make up their minds.
Most of the leftist papers simply ignored the story, and so their faithful readers will continue being completely stupid and oblivious.

Share this...FacebookTwitterGerman scientists have made a spectacular find. Near the Bavarian city of Augsburg they found a 14-million year old fossil of a python.
What’s interesting is that pythons like very warm, tropical weather, and not the cool, crappy stuff Germany has to offer. That means Germany (Central Europe) had to have been a balmy place 15 million years ago. In fact it was about 10°C warmer than it is today, the fossil indicates. German scientists published a paper in the journal Geodiversitas (DOI: 10.5252/g2011n3a2), which the online Frankfurter Rundschau here reports on. The FR writes:
Never before has such a find been discovered this far north. The remains give us clues on the climate back then.
Because pythons prefer warmer temperatures, today they live in the tropical regions of Asia and Africa. About 15 million years ago the predecessors of the today’s giant snakes also felt at home in Germany.”
How warm was it 15 million years ago in Germany? The Frankfurter Rundschau quotes the leader of the study, Madeleine Böhme of the University of Tübingen:

We gather that temperatures had an average of 19°C, otherwise the snakes would not have felt comfortable here.“
Currently the average annual temperature for Augsburg is about 8°C. So why did the pythons disappear? Climate change, says the Frankfurter Rundschau.
Climate change did the pythons’ ancestors in.
In any case the giant snakes found optimum living conditions in Germany for only a very short time, the scientists write. After the warm-subtropical temperatures of 14 million years ago, it got cooler and drier.”
So much for the claim the planet only changes when man lives on it.

Now for you AGW skeptics out there, don’t you dare go out saying that a cold Central European winter is a sign of cooling. To the contrary according to new models out of Potsdam, cold winters are a sure sign of global warming and man-made climate change, just as this is the case with hot weather. Yes the cold fits right in with the global warming picture – the models say so.
According to Vladimir Petoukhov last year of the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research in Potsdam, Germany:
Our results imply that several recent severe winters do not conflict the global warming picture but rather supplement it, being in qualitative agreement with the simulated large‐scale atmospheric circulation realignment.”
Here he is not just talking about Central Europe, but the northern hemisphere in general.
Our simulations with the ECHAM5 general circulation model demonstrate that lower‐troposphere heating over the B‐K seas in the Eastern Arctic caused by the sea ice reduction may result in strong anticyclonic anomaly over the Polar Ocean and anomalous easterly advection over northern continents. This causes a continental‐scale winter cooling reaching −1.5°C, with more than 3 times increased probability of cold winter extremes over large areas including Europe.”
This is all getting quite confused. Global warming causes colder winters. Warmer ocean waters cause more cyclones, But if the warmer ocean waters are in the Arctic then they are actually “anti-cyclonic”…which means less storms. If all that doesn’t make sense, well that’s because nonsense, confusion and psychosis are also traced back to AGW. A recent study said so.
One thing is certain: Natural climate change is causing lots of silly science.

Share this...FacebookTwitterNot long ago I wrote about how German solar cell manufacturers are drowning in a sea of red ink, read here and here.
The latest to bite the economic bullet are a biofuel plant in Freiberg, and Germany’s E10 ethanol blended fuel.
Merkel’s Solyndra – Choren Industries GmbH goes insolvent
The online leftist TAZ reports here that Choren Industries GmbH located in Freiberg, Saxony is now insolvent. The plant was designed as a pilot for future plants in producing “sun-diesel” from wood waste and biomass. It was designed to produce 18 million litres of the “climate-friendly” fuel, the TAZ reports. It employs 300 workers.
Even Chancellor Angela Merkel visited the plant along with a substantial entourage, before cameras, in April 2008. Unfortunately, the plant was never able to make a profit. The TAZ writes:
Indeed neither the manufacturing costs nor the technology appear to be controllable. Shell opted out already in 2009. Then VW and Daimler followed in July, and so insolvency was unavoidable. Approximately €100 million have been invested so far, €30 million of which were subsidies.”
It turns out that the entire project is not financially feasible and naive calculations had been made. Such a plant requires huge quantities of wood and biomass to operate. All the handling, power, equipment and effort needed to process the raw material ended up consuming much of the energy that was produced. The result: an economic fiasco. Your government masterminds at work.
Still, Germany does not allow itself to be easily deterred by a few green follies and failures. Indeed it is now building a 60 million euro pilot plant in Karlsruhe, insisting that more development is needed. But not everyone is convinced. The TAZ writes:
Biologist Stefan Klotz of the Environmental Research Centre in Leipzig is doubtful when it comes to the production of biofuel. The sun energy stored in biomass via photosynthesis is used with an efficiency of less than 1%. To grow extra plants and then to burn them is a ‘dead-end’.”

Germany’s E10 fuel debacle
Now add the E10 debacle. Awhile back Germany mandated that petroleum companies must blend in 10% bio-ethanol with regular fuel and to offer this so-called E10 fuel to consumers at petrol stations – all part of reducing CO2 emissions. Unfortunately, the government forgot to ask consumers if they had any interest in buying the low-grade stuff to begin with. As the online DIE WELT reports here, few people are interested in filling up with E10 fuel because of concerns the fuel could damage sensitive engine parts and lead to premature wear and expensive repair costs. DIE WELT writes:
The ADAC made headlines with a long-term test of an Opel Signum, which was rated as not being able to handle the E10 fuel. The conclusion: ‘E10 can be damaging’. After 27,000 kilometers of driving, according to ADAC Motorwelt magazine, the driver noticed an intense gasoline smell. The wall of the fuel pump was completely corroded.”
So adamant was the government about petrol stations selling the “environmentally friendly” fuel that it threatened to levy massive fines on companies who did not fulfil sales quotas. DIE WELT writes:
In the industry it’s already clear that the biofuel quota of 6.25% will never be reached.”
For Holger Krawinkel, energy expert of the Federal Association of Consumers:  it is already clear:
E10 is factually dead.“
And these people want to rescue Greece?
The more that Angela Merkel and the Greens try to take over and manage Germany’s energy industry, the more of a laughing stock they are becoming.

Share this...FacebookTwitterRemember how greeny two-shoes EU thought it could implement the EU Directive requiring all airlines that start or land in Europe to participate in its costly emissions trading scheme beginning in 2012  – all to rescue the planet?
EU airline emissions directive meets reality. (Photo credit: NASA)
In the system greenhouse gas emissions would have a price and the airlines would have to buy emissions permits. And the EU meant business. Any airline that refused to play along with its let’s-pretend-to-rescue-the-planet-game would be restricted from flying to and from Europe. Yes, it was time to tell the rest of the world how to behave and to bow to its demands.
Well, reality has a way of catching up with obscene and absurd green ideas. In this case it isn’t taking long.
Today the German CO2 Handel.de reports here that the EU has decided to back off.  Hey, we were just kidding. The EU will now accept pledges from countries to cut emisions at home. Yeah, we know what that’s worth. It needs to be pointed out that airlines in EU countries can forget about getting out of buying certificates…it appears the concessions are for non-EU airlines only.
Gee, I wonder why the tune is changing. According to CO2 Handel:

There was massive resistance from outside. More than 20 countries, among them Russia, India, Brazil, China and USA, threatened to revoke landing and air space rights for European airlines if the EU stuck to its plan. Behind the scenes, China warned that it could cancel billions of euros in orders for French and German Airbus planes.”
Well hey, maybe climate is not really that serious after all. A promise to cut somewhere else will do.
Humiliated, EU Climate Commissar Connie Hedegaard sent out her spokesman to deliver the message on Thursday in Brussels:
We’re flexible.”
Economics and reality have a way of focussing the mind, don’t they?

With severe drought now ravaging the region, the IPCC forecasts and models are beginning to look like a complete farce.
Deadly drought and famine hit East Africa (Chart source: USAID)
Lately we have all been hearing about the serious drought that has been causing misery in impoverished East African countries – especially Somalia with tens of thousands of deaths, and some 750 000 expected to die in the next four months, Ecotretas points out that “one would imagine that the IPCC would have predicted it” with their multi-million dollar super computer models and “leading scientists”. Well, it turns out they indeed made forecasts back in 2007, but today just the opposite is occurring, i.e. instead of getting more rainfall, as was forecast by the IPCC, rainfall has all but disappeared.
Ecotretas looked up what the IPCC projected for Eastern Africa in its 4th Assessment Report of 2007. For example in Chapter 11 of the Executive Summary:
There is likely to be an increase in annual mean rainfall in East Africa.”
On page 869, in Chapter 11.2.3.2 (emphasis added):
The increase in rainfall in East Africa, extending into the Horn of Africa, is also robust across the ensemble of models, with 18 of 21 models projecting an increase in the core of this region, east of the Great Lakes.”

So much for the ensemble of models. Surely one can only conclude that the claims made by the IPCC’ models concerning global temperatures for the next 100 or 200 years simply can no longer be taken seriously. Read more at ECOTRETAS here.
 
A host of other institutes parroted the IPCC bogus forecasts
It was not only IPCC scientists who were completely wrong with East African rainfall projections, but also a number of other institutes and organisations got it all wrong – probably because they only parroted the junk scenarios put out by scientists like Mike Hulme.
Ecotretas presents a collection of more rainfall for the African Horn here, which includes Christian Aid in the UK in 2009, International Livestock Research Institute  in 2010, The World Bank in 2010, the Institute for Environmental Security in January 2011, and the Grantham Institute for Climate Change in 2009, which claimed:
In eastern Africa, including the Horn of Africa, and parts of central Africa average rainfall is likely to increase.”
When are people going to stop listening to these charlatans?

Share this...FacebookTwitterSorry, but I always get a little nervous when top German and European officials put themselves first in line for a “new world order” that will tell the rest of the world how to behave. Other countries outside of Germany or Europe can and should decide for themselves how to live and run things.
Why do Europe’s elitists always view foreign ideas and ways as inferior?
CO2 Handel here reports that German Environment Minister Norbert Röttgen, one of Chancellor Angela Merkel’s leading officials, has declared climate protection the “new world order“.
Röttgen obviously has been having disturbing visions of a planet headed for a climatic catastrophe – unless us humans stop burning fossil fuels and start rain-dancing to the beat of appointed climate high priests. Never mind that global temperatures haven’t risen in 15 years, visions from green prophets and wisemen trump.
Or maybe Röttgen is simply dreaming of wielding lots of global power. According to CO2 Handel:
There can only be one global answer to global warming in the words of Federal Environment Minister Norbert Röttgen (CDU). Climate protection is a ‘Weltordnungspolitik’ (world order policy), said Röttgen on Thursday in Bonn at an international human rights conference.

That also means: ‘Everybody must be on board.’ To have a greater impact on global environmental and climate protection, a new UN special organization – something like the WHO for health – would have to be set up.”
Herr Röttgen says that the Kyoto Protocol, which covers only 15% of the world’s greenhouse gas emissions, is unable to function any longer.
Strange how activist warmists often accuse skeptics of being paranoid for believing that climate policy is masquerading as global governance. Here we have the German Federal Minister of Environment himself, a top government authority, calling for climate policy to be made into “world order policy”. How could anyone make the true intentions any clearer?
So dear global citizens, get ready to go out and rain-dance every day for good weather and climate, i.e. act like raving superstitious fools, because the government says you have to.

The European Environment Agency recently (March 2011) updated their European temperature data by adding the data for the years 2010 and the winter of 2011. The data can be found at EEA 2010, KNMI (http://climexp.knmi.nl), based onClimate Research Unit (CRU) gridded datasets HadCrut3 (land and ocean) and CruTemp3 (land only) from http://www.cru.uea.ac.uk
WINTER TEMPERATURES 1948-2011
European winters seem to have gone through an alternating warm-cool –warm- cool cycle since the 1940s and now appear headed for a cooler cycle like the 1962-1987 period.

A LOOK AT THE MORE RECENT WINTER TEMPERATURES 1998-2011
European winter temperatures have been cooling more recently since 1998, and especially 2009-2011.

European annual temperatures warmed from 1998-2007 but have started to cool over the last 3 years in a row since 2008.

SUMMER TEMPERATURES 1998-2010
On the surface, European summers seem to be getting warmer since 1998. However the higher warming summers of 2003, 2006, and 2010 were all preceded by or affected by an El Nino, just before or as the El Nino partly happened during these summers. So the extra warming may be due to a natural El Nino cycle. If one discounts these  El Nino years, the summer temperatures are quite flat and show no real base warming  due to global warming. For more detail information on El Nino years see the NOAA site http://www.cpc.ncep.noaa.gov.

HISTORIC MEAN WINTER TEMPERATURES FOR BERLIN, GERMANY – IMPACT OF THE NORTH  ATLANTIC  OSCILLATION
For those Europeans who still believe that their climate is primarily affected by human generated carbon dioxide, the graph below illustrates that the NAO level seems to be a much more significant cold winter factor affecting temperatures in Berlin, Germany. The temperature data is from GISS Station Temperature Data and NAO data is from CGD’s Climate analysis Section of Jim Hurrell http://www.cgd.ucar.edu. According to the NOAA:
The NAO consists of a north-south dipole of anomalies, with one center located over Greenland and the other center of opposite sign spanning the central latitudes of the North Atlantic between 35°N and 40°N. The positive phase of the NAO reflects below-normal heights and pressure across the high latitudes of the North Atlantic and above-normal heights and pressure over the central North Atlantic, the eastern United States and western Europe. The negative phase reflects an opposite pattern of height and pressure anomalies over these regions.”

FINAL COMMENTS
There is nothing in the above graphs and figures that would warrant the drastic reductions being planned for carbon dioxide emissions and the extremely expensive green energy options being planned by Europe in light of the most difficult economic environment that exists in Europe and the globe. Surely there are much more pressing problems that confront the world and Europe than solving an apparently non-existing problem that is only speculated to exist 100 years from now.

Share this...FacebookTwitterMichael Krüger at our friends Science Skeptical brings us this jewel of German dissent. Professor Dr. rer. nat. Richard Dronskowski at Aachen University brings loud applause from what appears to be a lecture hall full of his students as he slams the AGW science and the hucksters behind it.

At the 1.10 mark he calls Al Gore’s film An Inconvenient Truth “inconsistent” and reminds us how scientists “warned of cooling” in 1970s. At the 2.25 mark he brings up Michael Mann’s hockey stick chart:
No chart has been so falsified as the hockey stick chart. It’s an embarrassment for the IPCC.”
A little later he referred to it as a “nasty fabrication” that was debunked by a “Canadian think tank”. Dronskowski reminds his audience that the scientists are talking about “tenths of a degree” with error margins “of a full degree” and that “nobody can believe it”. At the 3:42 mark he again repeats:
“This hockey stick curve was a very very nasty fabrication designed to spread fear”.
At the 4.00 min. mark he shows the GISS temperature chart and reminds us at the 4.50 mark that:
It was supposed to get warmer, but the temperature hasn’t gone anywhere.”
He cautioned the audience that “the datasets are very shaky”. At the 5:45 mark he brings up consensus, and states emphatically:

There is absolutely no consensus. Zero consensus!”
And then slams Al Gore’s claim that CO2 caused warming, and not vice versa. At the 7.20 mark he tells the audience there is huge money in the game…”$100 billion a year flow because of climate change” and calls the government’s attempt to limit the temperature when it can’t even limit health insurance costs as “madness”. At this point the audience applauds loudly.
He then slams the corruptive effects that the funding has on academics: “I know colleagues who run entire institutes only with climate. There’s no way for them to back down, otherwise the institute will be ruined.”
At the 8.25 mark he reminds the audience:
I want to be clear. There is no causal effect! No consensus! Correlation is not proof!”
To illustrate the point he shows how US domestic oil production correlates with rock music quality, which brings thunderous applause from the audience.
This is indeed a surprising development for Germany. Prof Dronskowski should not wonder tomorrow morning why many other German scientists, who are swimming ingovernment climate funding, are suddenly no longer talking to him.
Prof. Richard Dronskowski a chemist and physicist. He has a faculty position at the Solid State and Quantam Chemistry Department at the RWTH Aachen and is the winner of the Otto Hahn Award of the Max Planck Society. He’s a member of the Collegium of the German Research Society, member of the German Physical Society, and the American Chemical Society.

Share this...FacebookTwitterUPDATE 8/20: For whatever reason, Frank Abel has completely taken down his post. Most likely it did not amuse some particular persons.
==================================We all know that seasonal forecasts looking 90 days or so into the future are not easy to make and have considerable uncertainty. But that hasn’t kept some bold meteorologists from going out and issuing 3-month seasonal forecasts that even include the week-by-week weather development for the period, and claiming up to 80% probability they will be right. I’m not aware of any technology that would allow that.
And who can forget the forecasts of “barbecue summers”?
Increasingly a number of serious meteorologists are now getting annoyed by these crackpot crystal ball forecasts, which are eagerly spread by the media and never turn out to be correct.
One vocal critic is German meteorologist Frank Abel here, who is a weatherman at MeteoGroup Deutschland GmbH in Berlin, part of the biggest private European weather company.
Abel took two prominent summer-2011 forecasts made by 2 popular German meteorologists back in March and May respectively, and tells us today how they panned out. Abel:
In summary what they did get right was (like with a horoscope) purely by chance.”
He then quotes the Institute for Weather and Climate Communication (IWK) in Hamburg concerning the forecasts made by the 2 meteorologists.
Frank Böttcher of the IWK told me what he thought: ‘What does that tell us? Their projections are worse than if they had been picked randomly.”
Indeed Abel and dozens of other meteorologists had gotten so fed up with the dubious seasonal forecasts that they banded together back in April and drew up the so-called Hamburg Declaration on Longterm Prognoses, which has since been signed by well over 100 meteorologists. Here it is in English (my translation):
================================================
Hamburg Declaration On Longterm Weather Prognoses
by the Meteorologists of the 6th Extreme Weather Congress


<!--

google_ad_height = 200;
//-->




We, the signers of the Hamburg Declaration, do hereby declare:
Long-term prognoses for approaching seasons are among the major targets of meteorology. Generating these prognoses are still at the very early stages of development. For producing such prognoses, research institutes are using super computers, without which, from today’s scientific perspective, it would be impossible to calculate the long-term developments. The results provide information on the monthly-basis anticipated deviations from the mean value and the probability of their occurrence. Such forecasts are currently possible only for very large extended regions.
Using today’s state of the art science, only the following type of forecast for June would be possible: ‘With a probability of 65%, it will be 0.3° to 0.5°C cooler than normal in southern Germany.’ Considerably more accurate forecasts for weeks and days for specific local areas, in the view of the undersigned, are not meteorologically and scientifically tenable and thus serve to damage the reputation of serious meteorologists. Thus the undersigned hereby request that making and publicizing of such prognoses, which give the public the incorrect appearance that it is possible to make accurate forecasts with our current level of knowledge, be avoided.
Signature
================================================
Well how about that – 65% probability a forecast for a period only 2 or 3 months into the future will be correct? Now what should that tell us about forecasts made for 5, 10, 20, 50 or even 100 YEARS down the road? Precisely – also just “horoscopes”, and them actually happening would be “purely by chance.”
Declaration On Climatic Forecasts
I now propose a Declaration on Climatic Forecasts. Serious meteorologists admit that seasonal forecasts are tricky and fraught with huge uncertainties. So isn’t it only appropriate that climatologists stop fooling the public and admit that their decadal and 100-year forecasts are also highly uncertain?
And please spare us the bullcrap that weather forecasts and climate prognoses are completely different. If anything, for obvious reasons, climatic prognoses are even far more difficult and thus uncertain.
One only has to consider that there is absolutely no agreement today among scientists on the strengths of forcings from the vast array of factors that act on our climate.
Science begins with honesty.

COPENHAGEN – One of the world’s biggest green-energy public-policy experiments is coming to a bitter end in Germany, with important lessons for policymakers elsewhere.
Germany once prided itself on being the “photovoltaic world champion”, doling out generous subsidies – totaling more than $130 billion, according to research from Germany’s Ruhr University – to citizens to invest in solar energy. But now the German government is vowing to cut the subsidies sooner than planned, and to phase out support over the next five years. What went wrong?
There is a fundamental problem with subsidizing inefficient green technology: it is affordable only if it is done in tiny, tokenistic amounts. Using the government’s generous subsidies, Germans installed 7.5 gigawatts of photovoltaic (PV) capacity last year, more than double what the government had deemed “acceptable.” It is estimated that this increase alone will lead to a $260 hike in the average consumer’s annual power bill.
…
To put it another way: by the end of the century, Germany’s $130 billion solar panel subsidies will have postponed temperature increases by 23 hours.” Continue reading…
For all you others countries out there considering the German model – think about it! What more do you need to be convinced it’s a folly?

After years of being ignored by AGW climate scientists and modelers, the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation (AMO) has more recently been recognized as a factor in climate forcing.
The Met Office at the December 5-9, 2011 presentation at the Fall AGU Meeting reported that they now use AMO unfiltered in their interannual and decadal climate forecasts.  I have been writing about AMO since 2009 (see below) along with other writers. Some of the articles have appeared on WUWT and ICECAP blogs. More recently Bob Tisdale has done some fine in-depth analysis of AMO [see below]. It is not the intention of this brief article to repeat all that material nor to explain what AMO is, or is not, other than just to summarize as follows:
The AMO is an ongoing series of long-duration changes in the sea surface temperature of the North Atlantic Ocean, with cool and warm phases that may last for 20-40 years at a time and a difference of about 1°F between extremes. These changes are natural and have been occurring for at least the last 1,000 years.
The AMO index is calculated at NOAAPSD by using the Kaplan SST data set (5×5), determining the area-weighted average over the North Atlantic over 0-70N and then detrending this data. The AMO has affected air temperatures over much of the Northern Hemisphere, in particular Eastern North America and Western Europe. For more information on AMO refer to the references at the bottom of this article.
It is the intent of this brief article to offer some preliminary or early results from my own analysis of AMO and the Canadian East Coast climate correlation. I will leave detail analysis to those who make their living in this field.
The AMO seems to be a significant climate factor affecting Canadian East coast surface temperatures, including the air temperatures of the four Maritime provinces, Labrador and Quebec air temperatures and even sometime reaching as far west as Ontario. These areas represent about 20% of Canada’s total surface area.
The first graph shows the Canadian Atlantic Coast Annual Temperature Departure from 1961-1990 averages and the Annual AMO index for the years 1948-2010. This period was picked because it was the only period for which Environment Canada provides temperature data summaries. The graph shows that the Atlantic Coast annual temperature departures seem to fluctuate with the cycles of AMO. The warm cycle when AMO was positive 1926-1964, a cool cycle when AMO was negative or cool 1965-1994, and finally another warm cycle 1995 to the present when AMO has been mostly positive. The year 2010 was the warmest annual year for the Atlantic Coast post 1948 with a departure of 2.1°C.

Figure 2 below shows a similar pattern for the Atlantic Coast but for the winters. Note that the winter AMO index has been scaled up by a factor of 3 for better visibility.

google_ad_height = 200;
//-->




Figure 3 below shows a similar pattern for the winters of Northeastern forests area which includes areas like Labrador, Northern Quebec and Ontario.

Figure 4 below is for the period 1990-2010 and illustrates in detail how the annual Atlantic temperatures went up as AMO went positive or warm in 1995.

Figure 5 below illustrates the post 1998 period and how the Winter Atlantic Coast and Northeastern Forests temperature departures both seem to follow the winter AMO pattern. Both are relatively flat or slightly declining. One can clearly see the temperature drop in 2009 when AMO went briefly negative during early part of 2009 for about 5 months. This may happen again during early 2012.

The sixth and final graph below shows the monthly trend of the AMO index since 2005. As of November it had gone negative for the first time since 2009 at -0.035.

Final comments
Temperature departures in Eastern Canada seem to follow the AMO index as we saw above. I tend to think that the current negative AMO level is temporary and seasonal only. I think the durations of negative and positive AMO cycles are variable and the next sustained negative or cool phase for the AMO may not start for few years more (possibly 2015). In my opinion a cooling will be first observable in the Arctic Ocean SST and in the Arctic atmosphere caused by more high altitude cold atmosphere transferred to lower levels in the Arctic region. The cooler Arctic together with a negative AO will in turn cool the North Atlantic Ocean and the AMO via currents and atmosphere links and eventually cool the land areas of the Eastern Coast of North America and Western Europe.
The predictive value of the negative AMO is that once AMO starts to go negative for a more sustained period (and it can be as long as 60 years and as little as 6 years), it can foretell of sustained global cooling (especially Northern Hemisphere) and adds to the cooling already caused by the cooler SST pattern in the North Eastern Pacific. Such a period existed 1964 -1976 (and to the late 1980’s for Europe) when both PDO and AMO were negative. A stronger negative PDO index is typically a result of both more negative SST anomalies in the NE Pacific in combination with more positive SST anomalies in the Central North Pacific. During the last cooler period for Europe, namely 1962-1987, a period of 26 years, 21 (80%) years had a negative or cool AMO. AMO was last negative from 1964 to 1995 or 31 years and prior to that it was negative from 1902 -1926 or 24 years.

Hans Schellnhuber and WGBU want to revolutionize society in 2 decades. Source: http://nachhaltigkeit2009.commerzbank.de

Awhile back Hans Schellnhuber, director of the ultra-alarmist Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research (PIK), released his master plan for the Great Transformation of global society – from one fuelled by carbon to a Utopian one powered by fuzzy-warm renewable energy.
This he claims would rescue the planet from imminent climate catastrophe. To help guide world leaders through the transformation, Schellnhuber and group of wisemen authored a guide called: World In Transition – A Social Contract For Sustainability.
Economist Carl Christian von Weizsäcker wrote a commentary in Germany’s flagship online political daily Franfurter Allgemeine Zeitung on Schellnhuber’s 420-page master plan. The WBGU’s plan calls for the transformation to be done in 10 – 20 years, where “not only must the production and consumption habits fundamentally change, but also the incentive systems, institutions, normative maxims and scientific disciplines (foremost the economic science disciplines).”
Sounds pretty damn radical.
Weizsäcker sees the whole thing as naive and worrisome, and reminds us that the Neolithic Revolution took thousands of years to complete and that the Industrial Revolution took 150 years, and is actually still in progress in many poorer countries. So how can anyone expect a revolution of the scale Schellnhuber proposes to be accomplished in 20 years? By having a total lack of knowledge of how societies work is the answer.
Of course this Great Transformation would be led by a powerful guiding global state, Schellnhuber proposes. Weizsäcker goes on to compare the WBGU’s proposed endeavour to Vladimir Lenin’s “proletarian Russian Revolution of 1917, under leadership of the Bolshevist wing of the communist party”, which also promised to “lead humanity to a new age, into a global-wide economic and societal system that would end the exploitation of men by men and create a world that could not be better”.
Weizsäcker adds:
We know what history teaches us with respect to this announcement of a Fundamental Revolution. After the citizens said good bye to the most brutal of methods of the guiding Stalin-State, the empire ended up in a hopeless dead-end stagnation which finally ended, and had to end, in the total collapse of a historical lesson”.

I’d say Schellnhuber and the WBGU are well beyond naive.  What Schellnhuber proposes is nothing less than a reckless and adventurous social engineering experiment, tantamount to a half-baked plan that calls for taking apart a jumbo jet full of passengers and putting it back together again as a glider – all in midflight.
Schellnhuber and his WBGU of course would like to have the audience believe that this Revolution would be carried out “democratically, freely and successfully.” Deomcracy itself would have to undergo a transformation. Just how democratic would the WBGU’s proposed new society be? Weizsäcker translates the WBGU’s text as follows:
More democracy yes, but only if it serves to achieve our aims.”
and comments:
We are actually not speaking about democracy when the wisemen (modern: the scientists) of the country prescribe the result up front and inform the people: ‘you may decide – but only as long as you decide correctly. Otherwise we will have to take away your co-determination on behalf of the collective good.”
Now allow me to translate: That’s tyranny, and not democracy. Weizsäcker sums it up:
Karl Popper and Friedrich August von Hayek would turn in their graves if they heard this highly offical recipe as a new form of democracy.”
Of course not everyone is wary of the WBGU’s proposed societal coup d’etat. There are many leaders out there who, all doped up with green ideology, think these adventurous, poorly thought out schemes are going to save humanity. Like German President Christian Wulff.
Sigh – those who forget history are condemned to repeat it.

Share this...FacebookTwitterThere’s been lots of disingenuous criticism from the CO2 end-of the world warmists and Armageddonists aimed at Fritz Vahrenholt’s and Sebastian Lüning’s new best selling skeptic book Die kalte Sonne. Much of it attacking Svensmark’s theory of solar amplification via cosmic rays.
Again. none have really read the book, they simply repeat the same old debunked arguments.
Henrik Svensmark hits back at the skeptics at the Die kalte Sonne site (scroll down to the English version):
Prof. Henrik Svensmark, Danish National Space Center (Copenhagen) on the criticism aimed at his solar amplifier via cosmic rays: 
Some people, including your critic Florian Freistetter on ScienceBlog, seem to think that physics is a democratic process and what matters is to count how many papers favour or disfavour each hypothesis. That of course is nonsense. All that really signifies is the evidence from observations and experiments, and how a theory stands up to attempts to falsify it. Remember Einstein’s comment on the pamphlet Hundert Autoren gegen Einstein (1931) – “If I were wrong, one would be enough”.
The hypothesis that cosmic rays strongly affect the climate offers a serious challenge to the more fashionable hypothesis that man-made greenhouse gases have been the main cause of climate changes. So it does not surprise me that many people try to falsify it. In fact it’s quite flattering that they go to so much trouble, when one good outcome (for them) should be enough, and in my opinion no such paper has been produced so far.
Freistetter suggests that all the recent papers say I’m wrong. That shows he is not very familiar with the climate physics literature. I think he has gone to some trouble to select papers against the cosmic-ray theory and ignore the favourable ones. Continue…
For the climate end-of-worlders  and critics like Freistetter, it would help to first climb out of the holes of ignorance before spouting off. Try reading for once. Freistetter admitted to ramming his head into the sand: “I never read the book. I didn’t want to buy it.” He doesn’t want to deal with arguments he can’t beat.
In his recent Blog-Artikel, Freistetter provided 1001 reasons why Prof. Svensmark is wrong about his solar amplifier via cosmic rays theory. Unfortunately for Freistetter, CERN’s results and historical correlations between sun and climate are ignoring his junk science.

Share this...FacebookTwitterThe online Der Spiegel yesterday published a piece by Hans von Storch, Director of the GKSS-Research Center in Geesthacht, Germany and Nico Stehr of the Karl-Mannheim-Professur for Cultural Sciences at the Zeppelin University in Friedrichshafen. The title:”The world of the the world-saving professors has failed”
Their conclusion on Durban: “The conference in Durban was a disappointment; environmental policy is stuck. Climate scientists are to blame because they are fixated on conceitedness and missionary zeal for reducing CO2 emissions.” They add:
The UN Climate Conference in Durban was a swan song.”
The attempt by scientists to guide a successful climate policy has failed. […] The cause for this is a false understanding of the role of climate science and the simplification of the climate change problem.”
For years, science professors had taken on the role of saving the planet, their arrogance exploding faster than CO2 emissions in China. It wasn’t long ago that everything appeared to be in order for the climate scientists. Physicist and chancellor Angela Merkel even allowed herself to be advised by leading scientists of a renowned institute, one was even allowed to use the title: “Advisor to the Chancellor”. Von Storch and Steyr write:
 Their views were accepted throughout the world as fact and their suggestions taken as correct.
Politics was to be guided by science – the science of a few men. Since then climate policy has failed, and CO2 emissions have risen unabated.
They led to failed climate policy. The leading figures in climate science are now suffering from withdrawal syndrome because no one wants to listen to them any longer, let alone celebrate them.”
Citing James Hansen, von Storch and Steyr are calling for a new direction in climate communication policy, pleading that policymakers move away from “Hollywood scientists”, who are naively portrayed as playing the lead roles as “world rescuers”.

What’s needed, the two authors say, is a more open discussion and not “autocratic government forms as solutions to the climate problem” or “great transformations of society” backed by the authority of scientists.
Von Storch and Steyr write that all the scare-mongering has had a devastating impact. Claims that climate change will lead to climate wars, death, disease, refugees, etc. are “not only perceived as attempts by single groups of scientists to gain recognition and financing, but also lead to perceptions that everything is connected to climate change.” Von Storch and Steyr write:
This either gets understood as absurdity or leads to the acceptance of an inevitable fate.”
Von Storch and Steyr cite recent US surveys that show society no longer trusts scientists.
Factual discussions hardly take place between climate science, civil societal organizations, and politics. The acceptance of climate science as a competent, objective interpreter is disappearing.”
They conclude:
It’s time for scientists to devote themselves to science once again. The societal climate debate has to open up.”
If anything else can be concluded, it is that something has gone terribly wrong and that major overhauls of the entire process are long overdue and in dire need. And when Der Spiegel, who started this whole mess 25 years ago, starts bringing it up, then you know something is afoot.

Share this...FacebookTwitterQuaternary Science Reviews has published a new paper: Combined dendro-documentary evidence of Central European hydroclimatic springtime extremes over the last millennium by authors Ulf Büntgen et al.
Photo credit: Hannes Grobe/AWI
See abstract here.
Anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions and associated effects on the Earth’s climate system are supposed to be causing more frequent and severe weather extremes and thus having terrible impacts on ecosystem function, agricultural yield, and human health.
Well, this new study says it aint quite so. The abstract of this paper states it plainly (emphasis and spelling correction added):
Documentary evidence independently confirms many of the dendro signals over the past millennium, and further provides insight on causes and consequences of ambient weather conditions related to the reconstructed extremes. A fairly uniform distribution of hydroclimatic extremes throughout the Medieval Climate Anomaly, Little Ice Age and Recent Global Warming may question the common belief that frequency and severity of such events closely relates to climate mean stages.”
The main highlights:
11,873 living and historical fir ring width samples were compiled across Europe. The world’s largest tree-ring composite continuously spans the AD 962–2007 period. Tree-ring extremes were triggered by April–June precipitation anomalies. Documentary evidence independently confirms dendro signals over the past millennium. Reconstructed extremes may constrain climate model simulations over long timescales.
So yet another climate myth debunked. If anything, it shows that it’s the media and alarmist hysteria that’s extreme, and not the weather.

Share this...FacebookTwitterThere have been lots of new and exciting developments this year in climate science, mainly the growing evidence that the sun (no surprise here) plays an obvious role in driving climate, as we have recently heard from CERN. This will certainly be one of the major points of focus at this year’s conference.

That’s why distinguished speakers such as Prof. Dr. Jan Veizer, Prof. Dr. Nir Shaviv and Prof. Dr. Henrik Svensmark are slated to tell us more about it and the reaction from the scientific community.
I attended last year’s conference and I can tell you it was worth every minute, and I intend to go this year as well. A number of other bloggers were there too. Andrew Montford will also be a speaker.

Share this...FacebookTwitterFritz Vahrenholt gives a comprehensive interview with leading Austrian daily KURIER here.
Why is it cooling? H/t: Real Science
The interview covers a number of areas. But a few points I found particularly interesting. On the lack of warming since 2000, the KURIER asks if it’s too short of a time period.
Of course it is. But we still need an explanation on why CO2 emissions, which the IPCC says is responsible for global warming, and which rose continuously since 2000, has not caused any warming. There has to be natural causes: the sun and the 60-year ocean cycles –  they were the reasons why we wrote the book.”
Vahrenholt also has words on Germany’s current attempt to move to renewable energy:
We’ve  gone into a hectic rush and today in Germany we are converting wheat into bioethanol, and installing 50% of all the world’s photovoltaic systems in a country that gets as much sunshine as Alaska – namely Germany.  This uncoordinated mad rush is rooted in fear: It’s our fault, we could trigger a climate catastrophe.”
On the IPCC filtering out the sun and other factors:
It is indeed interesting that of the 34 members of the IPCC editorial team that wrote the summary report, one third are connected to the WWF and Greenpeace. That is legitimate, but that has to be made transparent. Imagine just the opposite and the editorial team were one third Exxon supporters. Wouldn’t people say: ‘Hello! Is that really necessary?'”

Vahrenholt on why the climate debate has inquisitorial undercurrents:
Because it has long since not been about a purely scientific issue,  rather it is about how to run society. Some are saying that we are entering an uncontrollable situation, and so claim any means against it is justified.”
Like throwing democracy overboard, as some are advocating. Here Vahrenholt specifically singles out Schellnhuber’s WBGU and his Great Transformation of society masterplan, which calls for:
…changes in consumption behavior, changed trade behavior and that non-sustainable living styles be stigmatized by society.”
On the success of the book?
It’s no. 14 on the Spiegel bestseller list. Of course I hope the book will be read. The worst thing that could happen would be a spiral of silence, a discussion that never gets held. In five or ten years, we’ll know who is right.”
Overall, a solid and convincing interview by the KURIER. This will push book sales in Austria, Switzerland and Bavaria. Readers can visit the “http://kaltesonne.de/” site, which has an English translation button.

Share this...FacebookTwitterMay 2011 - SLR = 3.1 mm/yr
Portuguese skeptic website Ecotretas sent me the following story about rising sea levels awhile back. Seems the more sea level rise slows down, the more the alarmists claim it is accelerating (Sorry about the poor visual quality of graphics).
More hiding the decline
by Ecotretas
The University of Colorado has done it again! Despite the fact that sea level has been going down for the last year, they are saying that sea level rise rate is going up! You can see it with your own eyes in the graphics below.
In the first graph above, was generated last May and shows sea level going up 3.1 mm/year (sorry about the fuzzy quality). I debunked that at the time, because the University of Colorado introduced an artificial correction of 0.3 mm/year.
The second graph that follows was produced in July, just 2 months later, and they have applied more adjustments corrections. Note that all the newly introduced points are below the trend-line, so it should be diminishing… But no! It went up from 3.1 mm/year to 3.2 mm/year!
July 2011 SLR= 3.2 mm/yr
They give a reason for the correction: Although the latest Jason-2 GMSL estimates (cycles 95-102) are well below the trend line, most likely due to the recent La Nina (we plan to add a sea level/ENSO comparison page shortly), the rate increased slightly from 3.1 to 3.2 mm/yr due to the improvements to the TOPEX SSB model and replacement of the classical IB correction with the improved DAC correction, as noted above.
So, once again it’s about the models, and not the real data! To figure out this nasty science, I’ve graphed the difference between the two first graphs.
Plot of the difference
Clearly, all data points are pushed up. Big differences appear until 2002, which get below 10 mm between 2002 and 2005, and get even bigger after 2005.
The black line, which is a linear regression trend for all the data points, clearly shows that the correction introduces a rising trend!
The sea level rate measured by satellite should now be somewhere near 2.8 mm/year, and that is still clearly above what is being measured by tide gauge stations. One more example of hiding the decline!

Share this...FacebookTwitterA reader brings our attention to a paper published by the Quaternary Science Reviews, authored by Liang Chen, Karin A.F. Zonneveld, and Gerard J.M. Versteegh of the University of Bremen: Short term climate variability during “Roman Classical Period” in the eastern Mediterranean.This one is about a temperature reconstruction from Southern Italy going back 2000 years. The abstract states:
Climatic and environmental reconstructions based on a dinoflagelate cyst record from a well dated site in the Gulf of Taranto located at the distal end of the Po-river discharge plume have been established with high temporal resolution in order to obtain insight into potential forcing of short-term climatic and oceanographic variability in the southern Italian region during the “Roman Classical Period” (60 BC – AD 200).
So how much does the reconstruction say us humans and our CO2 emissions have warmed the planet since the Roman days? Here’s what the abstract concludes (emphasis added):
The dinoflagellate cyst association indicates that local sea surface temperatures which in this region are strongly linked to local air temperatures were slightly higher than today. We reconstruct that sea surface temperatures have been relatively high and stable between 60 BCeAD 90 and show a decreasing trend after AD 90.”
It was warmer back then!  Gee, did greenhouse gases cause the warming during the time of the Romans? What could it have been, we all wonder? Stop wracking your brains, the answer is:
Fluctuations in temperature and river discharge rates have a strong cyclic character with main cyclicities of 7 – 8 and 11 years.”
11 years? Now why does this number sound familiar? Could it have anything to do with a certain solar cycle that is very well known (at least outside of the IPCC)? The abstract continues:
We argue that these cycles are related to variations of the North Atlantic Oscillation climate mode. A strong correlation is observed with global variation in delta14C anomalies suggesting that solar variability might be one of the major forcings of the regional climate. Apart from cyclic climate variability we observed a good correlation between non-cyclic temperature drops and global volcanic activity indicating that the latter forms an additional major forcing factor of the southern Italian climate during the Roman Classical Period.”
Yet another reconstruction showing the sun at work. Today, however, the sun doesn’t do anything. At least that’s what the experts at the IPCC would like to have us believe.

Share this...FacebookTwitterWe keep hearing various stories about sea level rise. Some alarmists even claim that it’s accelerating and coastal locations could be drowning in water by the end of the century, if not sooner. So I decided to make quick check of the data myself.
I took a sampling of 21 randomly selected locations scattered all over the globe and checked their respective sea level trends (not satellite data) to see what is happening. The following map shows the locations:

As you can see, the points are scattered all over the globe. The idea is to take a random representative sampling – much like a quality engineer who takes a random sampling of raw material from a bulk tanker truck arriving at a factory.
What follows is the corresponding list of the locations with the sea level trends measured by the NOAA.
Location  –  rate in mm per 100 years  –  observed most recent rate trend
1. Ketchikan, Alaska  (-19 mm/100 yr) – steady drop
2. San Francisco, CA. (+201 mm/100) – slowing down
3. Honolulu, Hawaii (+150 mm/100) – slowing down
4. Kwajalein, Marshall Is. (+143 mm/100) – speeding up
5. Piladelphia, PA (+280 mm/100) – steady rise
6. St. Petersburg, FL (+236 mm/100) – slowing down
7. La Libertad, Ecuador (-122 mm/100) – steady drop
8. Cristobal, Panama  (+141 mm/100) – slowing down (last 10 years)
9. Cananeia, Brazil (+420 mm/100) – speeding up
10. Argentine Is, Antarctica  (+172 mm/100) – slowing down
11. Newlyn, UK (+171 mm/100) – steady rise
12. Tenerife Spain (+153 mm/100) – steady drop
13. Walvis Bay, Namibia (+33 mm/100) – steady drop
14. Simons Bay, S Africa (+159 mm/100) – speeding up
15. Karachi, Pakistan (+48 mm/100) – steady drop
16. Cochin India (+137 mm/100) – steady rise
17. Legaspi, Philippines (+522 mm/100) – slowing down
18. Sydney Australia (+59 mm/100) – slowing down
19. Fremantle, Australia (+148 mm/100) – slowing down
20. Wellington, New Zealand (+241 mm/100) – slowing down
21. Hosojima, Japan (-53 mm/100) – steady drop
For example San Francisco sea level is rising at a rate 201 mm per 100 years and the latest trend shows that sea level rise is slowing down.

Here are the results
– Steady drop: 6
– The rise is slowing down: 9
– Speeding up: 3
– Rising steadily: 3
Do you see any red flags? The average of the 21 NOAA measured trends is 147 mm/100 years (6 inches). This is a far cry below the IPCC projected 22 inches for the next 100 years.
Most of the sampled locations are dropping or the sea level rise is slowing down. Only at 6 locations is the rise steady or speeding up. The Marshall Islands show a speeding up, but Pago Pago, American Samoa shows a decline.
Clearly this random sampling of locations shows no signs of any accelerating disaster. To the contrary, it indicates that sea level rise is most likely slowing down.
This is a preliminary check only, and of course much more data would need to be crunched to make a final conclusion. But from the preliminary check, we can safely say that anyone who claims that SLR is accelerating is probably just a charlatan who is trying to get more funding.
Concerning satellite data, someone really ought to check the calibration of the satellites.

These are just some of the bogus scares the UN and activists use to keep the masses in a state of panic. The more, the better. Hardly a day goes by without the media fretting about at least one or more of the above. And the list just keeps growing.
In the headlines over the last few days in Germany and Europe are two new topics: Water shortage and food-wastage.
New Crisis No. 1: Global water shortage
One we hear a lot about is the growing water consumption crisis, which Die Welt reports on here. Though it’s not new, the tone is getting ever shriller. Billions are now threatened. According to Die Welt:
‘The demand for water is increasing just at a time when climate change is threatening its availability,’ says the latest UN World Water Report.”
More than 20,000 experts from over 100 countries have gathered in Marseilles for a week-long conference on potable water. Is it really necessary to have 20,000 experts just to talk about water? Obviously there are lots of people who can’t find regular worthwhile jobs.

Not surprisingly, one of the big culprits threatening the water supply is meat production, so they tell us. According to Die Welt:
Foremost the manufacture of animal feed is, according to the data, very water intensive. Up to 15 thousand litres of water are needed to produce a sole kilogram of meat. Globally about 70 percent of fresh water is consumed for the manufacture of food.”
Note how all of this points to one direction: regulating human food consumption. And note how it fits in nicely with the scheme of eco-eugenicist Matthew Liao who proposes genetically engineering people to shrink them down in size. The UN creates the bogus crisis in order to legitimize the grand experiment.

The 700-page UN report called “Managing water under uncertainty and risk” was released at the start of the Marseilles conference amid much media buzz. H2O certificate trading anyone?
New Crisis No. 2: Naughty Germans throw away too much food!
The latest crisis in Germany is food wastage. According to the TAZ:
A German citizen throws away 81.6 kilograms of food every year. This is what a study from the University of Stuttgart shows. Federal Minister of Agriculture Ilse Aigner (CSU) will present it Tuesday, reports Die Welt.”
For Aigner, Germans throwing away so much food simply takes the cake! Such waste can no longer be tolerated. So what does she propose to do about it? Aigner plans a campaign to educate the public so that they learn that the best-before-date printed on food labels does not necessarily mean the food is no longer fit for consumption once it expires. Never mind if the milk smells a little sour or if the bread is a little moldy – just eat it!
TAZ writes that the campaign:
…will prevent food being thrown into the garbage even though it can still be eaten.”
Minister Aigner clearly has nothing to do. So she decides to pester the private consumers and up-bring them on food and how to eat…real government intrusion…the nanny state getting ready to spoon-feed its citizens.
What business does the government have here? Once people buy food at the supermarket, it becomes their own private property. And what they do with it is nobody else’s business. What’s next? Bureaucrats rummaging though your rubbish looking for food scraps? The TAZ writes:
The authors of the study say that about two thirds of the food that is thrown out could be avoided. Every year about 11 million tonnes of food ends up in the garbage. 61 comes from private households, 17 Prozent from institutions like restaurants, schools and cafeterias, 17% from industry. The remaining 5% from retailers.”
What’s the underlying message behind the food wastage crisis? They are trying to tell us that food is too cheap! Get ready for higher food prices – especially meat.

Share this...FacebookTwitterThings are so bad for the warmists in the USA that they now have to hope that radical German papers will carry the day for them. This is really quite pathetic.
Yesterday German left-wing online Die Zeit, a favourite among German “intellectuals”, attempted to bring the hockey stick back from the dead by granting washed-up climate scientist Raymond Bradley an interview.
The following are excerpts of the interview. I think Al Gore or moveon.org provided the answers for Bradley.
“The curve is robust”
Die Zeit poses the question: “Does the hockey stick chart need to be corrected?” Bradley answers:
No, the curve is robust. It was only one of hundreds of charts in the IPCC report. But the climate deniers in the US industry tried to bury the credibility of the IPCC by casting the curve into doubt. Some US Congressmen, who are marionettes of the oil industry, demanded that we provide detailed information about all financial information for the last few years. It hasn’t been easy with them breathing down our necks.”
I don’t know what the aim of all this is. Of course the German public hardly sees the other side of the science, which is usually in English and rarely filters through the German media. Citizens have to rely on their one-sided media, like Die Zeit.
Germany is a bit like the North Korea of climate information. Warmists are hoping Germans will remain oblivious nd keep believing in the coming doomsday. Obviously Bradley is hoping that the many duped Germans are somehow going to rescue him from the mess he and his team are in. It’s not easy being one step away from permanent disagrace.

Die Zeit then asks: “Since then, several comissions have confirmed your climate diagram. Has anyone apologised to you?” Now what does that tell you about Die Zeit and Die Zeit readers? I guess they’ve never heard of “Climategate” or the Medieval Warm Period.  (Now readers outside of Germany are probably getting an idea of just how far from reality German has drifted). Bradley answers:
No, instead the attacks continue. Michael Mann, the lead author of the curve, is still under investigation. In mid November he had to fight to keep all his e-mails during his time at the University of
Virginia from being made public.”
I’ll refrain from comment here. Bradley then goes on to say that at this stage he no longer feels threatened. But he did some years ago, as “people used the power of the state to intimidate the scientists”.
Bradley also does not expect any progress in Durban. As far as the future of US politics, he is not too optimistic, and warns:
Only when Obama gets re-elected and is supplememnted by a new majority in Congress will anything change. As long as the Tea Party dominates, it’s going to be difficult for Obama.
Die Zeit is regarded in Germany as a leading “intellectual” paper. And, if you linked to their article, you’ll notice they’re still using the old disgraced hockey stick, and believe oil companies are behind the skeptics, that sea level rise is accelerating and all the other myths.
This all reminds me of an old lone Japanese soldier marooned on a desert island, still hiding because he thinks WWII hasn’t ended yet.
Really – I’m not kidding when I say Die Zeit is an intellectual paper in Germany. Now you know the sorrowful state of German “intellectuals” (and Ray Bradley).

Share this...FacebookTwitterHere’s a snippet from a CFACT news conference in Durban I find quite amusing.
Some British-accented girlie-guy, tree-hugger warmist ocean acidist (Felix von Geyer, Platts Emissions Daily) demands to know “who-the-hell” funds CFACT, and that CFACT comment on ocean acidification.
Lord Monckton gives the yuppie retread more of an education in 2 minutes than he probably ever got during all his years as an undergraduate student.
You can watch the entire CFACT press conference here.
You can watch the entire CFACT press conference here.
I wonder if von Geyer is ever going to realize what a fool he made himself out to be. The guy could have spared himself all the embarassment had he just changed his tone a bit and his words. But oh no. he had to come in there, filled to the nose with arrogance and conceit, and act like he has to lecture everyone else.
Some advice: If you’re a pathetically ignorant soul on a particular subject, then it is a good idea not to run around a pretending to be informed. People see right through it.  In this case we got a full body scan of von Geyer.
Worse, for the students, the guy teaches at Concordia University, Department of Political Science, in Montreal (when he isn’t busy globe-trotting). They’re going to learn from this guy?
If von Geyer’s question signfies anything, it is that the movement has abandoned CO2 gas and has now moved on to Co2 acid.

Share this...FacebookTwitterChristian churches nowadays are pretty much always empty in Germany. But there is one church that is always full: the Church of Environmentalism. So comments Jan Fleischhhauer of Spiegel yesterday here.

Environmentalism fad in Germany ready for the scrap heap as absurdities get exposed. Public domain photo: John Muir, 1907.
Few countries have gone as fanatic as Germany when it comes to environmentalism. In Germany a mere bird’s nest or a even a beetle can stop a multi-billion euro public works project dead in its tracks and delay it indefinitely until an entire battery of comprehensive environmental studies are carried out and numerous lawsuits settled.
Fleischhauer writes of Germans today:
No other people on God’s Earth seperate garbage so devotedly, save so much water, and expend so much effort to lead an ecologically exemplary lifestyle.”
Even Spiegel seems to doubt the radical environmentalism now gripping Germany. This is not to be under-estimated. Spiegel is after all the flagship news magazine that revolution-prone university students like to quote. It serves as the casting mold for the next generation of thinkers – of changers.
Over the years, Germany’s religion of environmentalism has become so fervent that the country is now naively embarking on a climate and environmental protection crusade. Read here, second part if you have any doubts.
Fleischhauer writes that efforts to protect the planet have gotten so extreme that they actually serve to harm it instead. As an example he cites water saving, which leads to sewage systems getting clogged up because they no longer get flushed with enough water.

More than 80% of a water utility’s expenses are because of maintenance to the sewage system, and it doesn’t help at all that less and less water is coming down into it from above. All experts agree that it would be better if Germans used more, and not less water.”
And what happens to all the garbage that Germans so dutifully separate? According to Fleischhauer, much of it ends up being burned in the kilns at the nearest cement plant.
Another example of good intentions leading to destructive consequences is the use of biofuels. Fleischhauer writes:
In 2011 the well subsidized farming of corn made Germany an importer of grains for the first time in 25 years just so that it could bake enough bread. Everywhere corporations have started buying up fields and land worldwide.”
And they are not planning to use it to grow food to feed the 1.4 billion hungry people on the planet. Little wonder that food prices are going up globally.
When it comes to electric cars, Fleischhauer quotes a new, critical book written by Alexander Neubacher: “Ökofimmel”. German automobile club ADAC determined that electric cars emit more CO2 than compact diesel cars. “And if manufacturing is taken into account, then the electric cars fare even worse.” Fleischhauer adds:
‘Especially the production of batteries gobbles up huge amounts of electricity,’ writes Neubacher in his guide through the ecological world and its absurdities.’ For a single electric car, about as much additional energy is consumed as what is contained by 10,000 litres of gasoline .'”
Finally all the absurdities of the Church of Environmentalism are being communicated by a persuasive messenger. The religion is being exposed. Now it’s only a question of time before the passions of rebellion flare up. And there are signs of it everywhere in Germany. The genie is out of the bottle.

Share this...FacebookTwitterDer Spiegel reports today that scientists have identified soot (black carbon) as one of the major global warmers out there.
According to Science Journal here, a team of 24 experts led by NASA scientist Drew Shindell looked at 400 emission control measures and identified 14 measures targeting methane and black carbon (BC) emissions that would reduce projected global mean warming.
Source: http://atmoz.org/blog/2007/06/12/global-melting-big-thaw/
Recently scientists and activists have been frustrated by the slow progress and dogged reluctance by countries to cap CO2 emissions, which are thought to be causing global warming. So Shindell looked for alternative ways to avert warming. Suddenly, lo and behold, soot (BC) and methane have emerged as major global warming factors. The amount they admit soot and methane contribute to warming is in my view astonishing.  The abstract states (emphasis added):
We considered ~400 emission control measures to reduce these pollutants by using current technology and experience. We identified 14 measures targeting methane and BC emissions that reduce projected global mean warming ~0.5°C by 2050.”
This equals the total amount of warming we’ve seen in the last 40 years!
Now scientists are telling us that soot and methane will have the same effect that CO2 is claimed to have had over the last 40 years? Whatever happened to the assertion that man-made CO2 has caused 95% of the warming over the last decades? Obviously CO2 as a driver is seriously getting cut down to size. Throw in the emerging solar effects and there isn’t much left for poor old CO2.

The abstract continues:
This strategy avoids 0.7 to 4.7 million annual premature deaths from outdoor air pollution and increases annual crop yields by 30 to 135 million metric tons due to ozone reductions in 2030 and beyond. Benefits of methane emissions reductions are valued at $700 to $5000 per metric ton, which is well above typical marginal abatement costs (less than $250). The selected controls target different sources and influence climate on shorter time scales than those of carbon dioxide–reduction measures. Implementing both substantially reduces the risks of crossing the 2°C threshold.”
No need to worry any longer about a doubling of CO2 concentrations. Indeed CO2 as a driver and its hypothesized positive feedbacks simply aren’t materializing. We haven’t seen any warming in 15 years. Now scientists are realizing that soot is a big league player.
Der Spiegel writes:
About 3 billion people prepare their meals over open fires that burn wood, dung or coal, and thus emit huge amounts of soot. However attempts to get people in Africa and Asia to get interested in other cooking devices have often proven to be difficult.
Of course it has been difficult. When idiot bureaucrats attempt (and are successful) to slow down progress, people remain poor and all they have left to burn is wood. But if they promote growth, free markets and development so that poor countries can attain western standards of living, then they will be able to afford to burn cleaner fuels like gas and oil. And if someday they should get really rich, they too will be able to afford wind and solar energy.

Share this...FacebookTwitterIs our climate becoming more extreme?
By Paul Homewood
Hurricane Katrina (Photo credit: NOAA)
There has been much discussion recently about “Climate Disruption” or “Global Weirding”. John Holdren has talked about “increases in floods, wildfires, droughts, heat waves and hurricanes” while Rajendra Pachauri says: “Based on observation, we know that there will be more floods, more drought, more heat waves and more extreme precipitation events. These things are happening”.
Al Gore of course is quick to blame any extreme weather event on climate change. Even reputable climate scientists such as Katharine Hayhoe talk about Global Weirding. “Heavy rains, deep snowfalls, monster floods and killing droughts are signs of a new normal of extreme U.S. weather events fueled by climate change,” scientists and government planners said.
Katharine Hayhoe climate scientist of Texas Tech University told reporters:
It’s a new normal and I really do think that global weirding is the best way to describe what we’re seeing.”
But are we really seeing more extreme weather nowadays?
Our memory of events from years ago tends to blur into the mists of time. Furthermore the global nature of today’s news media often brings to our attention stories which we would not have even known about if they had happened decades ago. I have therefore put together the following record of extreme weather events from 1971, which I hope will provide a certain amount of perspective when looking at what is happening today. Why 1971? Quite simply it is 40 years ago, a nice round number, and of course, before the gradual rise in global temperatures began a few years later.
DROUGHTS
 In the US there were several notable droughts in 1971:
 * Florida – The worst drought on record resulted in 400,000 acres of the Everglades burned by fires. (1)
 * Texas – Worst drought since the 1950’s. (2)
 * Maryland – The 1958-71 drought produced the largest recorded annual departures from average stream discharge. (3)
 * California – The summer of 1971 was “extra hot and long. Rainfall did not completely wet the (tree) root zones the winter of 1971-72 (sic)”. The same report in 1978 stated “the rate of development (of dieback of tree limbs) has been accentuated in recent years”. (4)
 * Hawaii – The drought on Maui was described as the worst in 22 years. (5)
 * North Carolina – The Air Force Bombing Range Fire destroyed 29300 acres of forest. (6)
 * Minnesota – The Little Sioux Fire destroyed 14000 acres following “a period of abnormally dry weather”. (7)
 * In total there were 108398 wildfires in the US in 1971 affecting 4.2 million acres. ( Figures for 2010 were 71971 fires and 3.4 million acres). (7a)

In the rest of the world there were many more:
 * Australia – In Victoria  what was described as a severe drought began that would last to 1973. (8)
 * Ethiopia – 1971 saw the start of a 2-year drought that would claim 300,000 lives. (9)
 * Kenya – 150,000 people were affected in what was described in 2006 as even worse than the 2005 drought, itself one of the worst on record. (10)
 * Sahel – Mali, Chad, Nigeria and Burkina were in the middle of a drought that lasted from 1967-88 and which was described in Nigeria as the worst since 1913. (11)
 * Okinawa – Experienced the worst drought in history. (12)
 * China – Much of Northern China was in the grip of what in Beijing was on record as the worst drought ever (before or since). (13)
 * Afghanistan – This was the worst in the country’s history. (14)
 * Iraq – This severe drought led to the mercury poisoning tragedy. Iran was also affected. No drought there has been as bad since. (15)
 * India – The 1971-72 drought affected many states and ranked as the 5th worst since records began in 1876. (16)
 * Argentina – The 1971 drought was worse than anything since. (17)
FLOODS
 * North Vietnam – The Red River flood was an absolutely terrible disaster leaving 100,000 dead. It was listed by NOAA as one of the century’s top weather events and described as a 250 year event. (18)
 * India – Orissa was hit by a cyclone which left 10,800 dead. (19). Also, in Central India the Bundelkhand district was hit by floods (which were followed in 1972 by droughts). (20)
  * Malaysia – 32 people were killed and 180,000 affected in the Kuala Lumpur floods in the worst floods since 1926. (21)
 * Australia – In January the Canberra flood claimed 7 lives followed a month later by floods in Victoria which were called a 100 year event. In Queensland every month from January to May saw major floods and significant flooding returned in December. (22) (23) (24)
 * New Zealand – The New Plymouth area was hit by their worst ever flood after 11.4 inches of rain fell in 24 hours.(25)
 * Brazil – 130 dead in Rio de Janeiro floods. (26)
 * Quebec – Heavy rainfall caused a massive landslide at the village of Saint-Jean-Vianney, leaving 31 dead. (27)
 * Spain – 19 died in floods in Barcelona after 308mm of rain in 24 hours. (28)
 * USA – Alaska suffered a major flood, only exceeded by the 1986 flood in the last 50 years. (29)
 * USA – In February significant flooding occurred in Nebraska, Iowa, Illinois and Wisconsin.(30)
 * USA – In March Southeastern States were affected with Georgia recording record levels in some areas. (30)
 * USA – May and June brought significant flooding to Utah, Idaho, Nebraska and Wyoming. The discharge from the Bear River in Utah was considered a 75 year event. (30)
 * USA – Significant flooding hit Pennsylvania, Ohio and West Virginia in June and July. (30)
 * USA – In August Baltimore was struck by one of the most damaging thunderstorms in 50 years and 14 died from the resulting floods. (30)
 * USA – Widespread flooding followed Tropical Storm Doria up the coast from North Carolina to Maine in August. Some streams in New Jersey and Pennsylvania registered record floods. (30)
 * USA –  Extended flooding occurred in September and October affecting Texas, Louisiana and Oklahoma. (30)
 * USA – More significant flooding hits Oklahoma and Arkansas in December. (30)
HURRICANES, TORNADOES, ETC. 
 * The Atlantic hurricane season was a “fairly active” one with several notable storms.(31)
 * The strongest was Edith, a Category 5, which killed dozens in Nicaragua before turning north and hitting Louisiana. (31)
 * Ginger is on record as the longest lasting Atlantic hurricane ever, or at least until the 1899 San Ciriaco hurricane was retroactively discovered to be longer. (31)
 * An unnamed storm in August attained hurricane status further north than any other North Atlantic tropical cyclone. (31)
 * Canada was unusually on the receiving end of the tail ends of 2 hurricanes, Beth and Doria which both caused huge amounts of damage from flooding. Both were listed by Natural Resources Canada among the 18 major hurricanes of the 20thC. (32)
 * In the Pacific the hurricane season was above average with 18 named storms, 6 of which made landfall. This latter number is still the record for a season. (33)
 * The typhoon season was also a busy one with 24 typhoons of which 6 were super typhoons. This compares to 7 typhoons including 2 super typhoons in 2010. The season had an extremely active start with a record number of storms before August. (34)
 * Typhoon Rose left 130 dead in Hong Kong plus many more at sea. It was described by the Hong Kong Observatory as “one of the most intense and violent” to have affected Hong Kong. (34)
 * Cyclone Althea hit Queensland as a Category 4 cyclone in December. Damage was extensive but would have been worse if it had not arrived at low tide. (35)
 * The tornado season in the USA was also above average with 58 F3+ tornadoes ( compared to 39 in 2010). (36)
 * The worst tornado outbreak occurred in the Mississippi Valley during 2 days in February. 19 tornadoes were spawned claiming 123 lives across 3 states. (37)
OTHER EVENTS

 * The highest ever UK January temperature was recorded in Gwynedd at 65F. (38)
 * In Canada the snowfall record for one season was set on Mount Copeland in British Columbia in the winter of 1971/72. (39)
 * In the same winter Mount Baker in Washington broke the US record when 1122 inches fell. (40)
 * Montreal’s “snowstorm of the century” left 17 dead with 70 mph winds producing second storey drifts. (41)
 * Texas and Oklahoma were hit by a giant blizzard which set the state record snow depth in Oklahoma of 36 inches. The National Weather Service in Amarillo lists this blizzard as one of the top 20 weather events in the Panhandle. (42) (43)
 * Columbia suffered its worst winter in years resulting in economic losses of $150 million. To make matters worse heavy rains caused the two biggest rivers, the Magdalena and Cuca, to flood vast regions in the Central and Western parts of the country. (44)
 * Most of the USA was colder than normal. 1971 nationally was the 36th coldest in the 20th century. (45)
Which year saw the more extreme weather, 1971 or 2010? Who can say. How can anyone compare the severity of, say, a hurricane with that of a drought? Or a flood with blizzard? Katharine Hayhoe complains that our weather is becoming unpredictable but surely it has ever been so. Perhaps we should really start worrying when we stop getting extreme weather events.

Share this...FacebookTwitterSomehow I missed Nir Shaviv’s comment about Jasper Kirby’s CLOUD experiment, read here: Shaviv writes (emphasis added):
Ok, so what do these results imply?
The first point was essentially pointed above. The results unequivocally demonstrate that atmospheric ionization can very easily affect the formation of condensation nuclei (CNs). Since many regions of earth are devoid of natural sources for CCNs (e.g., dust), the CCNs have to grow from the smaller CNs, hence, the CCN density will naturally be affected by the ionization, and therefore, the cosmic ray flux. This implies that ion induced nucleation is the most natural explanation linking between observed cosmic ray flux variations and climate. It has both empirical and beautify experimental results to support it.
Second, given that the cosmic ray flux climate link can naturally be explained, the often heard ‘no proven mechanism and therefore it should be dismissed’ argument should be tucked safely away. In fact, given the laboratory evidence, it should have been considered strange if there were no empirical CRF/climate links!
Last, given that the CRF/climate link is alive and kicking, it naturally explains the large solar/climate links. As a consequence, anyone trying to understand past (and future) climate change must consider the whole effect that the sun has on climate, not just the relatively small variations in the total irradiance (which is the only solar influence most modelers consider). This in turn implies (and I will write about it in the near future), that some of the 20th century warming should be attributed to the sun, and that the climate sensitivity is on the low side (around 1 deg increase per CO2 doubling).
Read it all here: http://www.sciencebits.com/CLOUDresults.
He says he’ll write more about this in the future. Hopefully he won’t keep us waiting too long, as many of us are looking forward to his expert assesssments.

Share this...FacebookTwitterI wonder if at times these people realize just how asinine they make themselves appear.
Here’s another “glittering jewel of colossal science ignorance” at the German online Frankfurter Neue Presse. It is titled: Experiments Show Hesse’s Climate in the Future. Hesse (in German: Hessen) is a state in Central Germany, which puts it in the middle of Europe. Its largest city is Frankfurt.
Scientists of the University of Gießen and the State Department for Environment and Geology (HLUG), also in the state of Hesse, studied jointly at the Environmental Observation and Climate Impact Station, whatever the hell that is.
In a nutshell, a bunch of obviously misguided scientists and politicians, with lots of taxpayer money to waste, got together and pumped a bunch of CO2 over a 4.5 hectare plot of land for years to see how the plants there would react.
Now, with the results, they think can deduce the future climate of the planet. Yes, things really have gotten that bad. By now I’m sure you are all just dying to hear the results. Here they are, reports the Frankfurter Neue Presse (drumroll):

They presented some of their results on Thursday. Hard times are coming for fruit trees and Riesling wine. ‘It’s going to get warmer, the summers drier and the winters wetter’, says HLUG President Thomas Schmid. ‘In South Hesse we are going to have Mediterranean conditions by the end of the century.’ The Riesling grape, which doesn’t like it so warm, could get problems under certain circumstances, so could fruit tress. According to the findings from the scientists, the blossoms will be earlier and earlier. Nighttime frost will then have a greater chance of destroying the fruit blossoms and thus the fruit itself.”
More warming, more frosts. That’s logical. Hesse Minister of Environment Lucia Puttrich (Conservative Party) in Linden said:
The project opens a window to the future.”
That’s not a window that you are looking through, Madam. It’s a hallucination – one induced by being all drugged up in Green religion and junkie science. How about getting an education? It’s the only known cure against such chronic hallucinations. I’m doing all I can to hold back with the words.
How much worse can all the madness possibly get? Truly the Modern Dark Ages have befallen Europe once again.

Germany has put the shutdown of all its nuclear reactors on the fast track since the Fukushima accident. Finally, Germany’s Renewable Energy Revolution to rescue the planet from nuclear power and climate-killing CO2 emissions appears set begin in earnest, at least that’s what the climate rescue heroes would like to believe.
Unfortunately for the renewable energy cheerleaders, and the enemies of fossil fuels, things are in reality developing quite differently globally and even in Germany. For example, China is putting one brand new coal power plant online every week, and will do so for the next 40 years. Now, suddenly, Germany looks poised to crank up its coal power capacity too. Edgar L. Gärtner at eigentumlich frei has a commentary called: Energy Revolution” – The New Age of Coal“. The climate fantasy rescuers aren’t going to like it.
Since Germany has taken 8 of its nuclear reactors out of operation since April, 2011, its energy supply now stands vulnerable. To keep the lights from going out, which is a real prospect should a very cold winter day befall Germany, old coal plants are now being brought back to operationability in order to serve as “cold reserve capacity”. Gärtner writes:
This confirms what independent specialists have been predicting since the ‘energy revolution’ was announced by Chancellor Angela Merkel: Instead of the rise of the promised “Age of Renewable Energies“, the nuclear phaseout will lead to a Renaissance of coal and (to a small extent) natural gas.”
Indeed, even ultra-green Germany is going back to coal. And Gärtner adds:
There are lots of signs indicating the age of coal as a resource for electrical power generation is actually just getting started.”

And anyone who doesn’t believe this is probably listening to too much German public media news, or is in chronic denial. Gärtner explains:
According to the most recent Statistical Review of World Energy of oil company BP, one of the most reliable sources of energy market data, coal consumption has increased by almost 50% over the last 10 years alone.”
And during those same 10 years, global temperatures have plateaued, or even fallen slightly, depending which data-set you’re looking at. Gärtner continues (emphasis added):
Such a rash increase has never been seen before. China and India alone account for 90 percent of this increase. Coal’s share of global energy generation has almost reached 30% and is now as now at 1970 levels. At 48.2% almost half of the world’s coal consumption is by China. Plans by China’s leadership provides for a coal power expansion of 600 gigawatts by the year 2035. Also in western countries coal consumption increased in the year 2010 by 5.2%, the most since 1979.
So why is coal burning gaining so fast? The answer is economics and science.
Global coal reserves are huge, enough to last an estimated 1000 years according to some estimates. Moreover the fuel is easy and cheap to extract, transport and use. And because there are now 7 billion people on the planet to sustain, its low price means that it is a real life-saver, one that can be relied on and does not depend on the weather. Thus only the most ignorant, or most tyrannical, of politicians would sit on mountains of coal and allow citizens to freeze to death in the wintertime.
Now that climate science is uncovering that CO2 is indeed a minor climate driver, the use of coal should be allowed unabated. Indeed science is showing more and more that coal is by no means a climate killer, but a human life-saver.

Share this...FacebookTwitterThe UN just released its summary report on how we should all expect extreme heat in the future. Well forget all that.It’s all nonsense coming from unrealistic models that do not even take the cycles of the sun (source of 99.9% of the Earth’s surface heat) and cycles of the oceans (which cover 70+% of the Earth’s surface) into account. Garbage in, garbage out. Simple as that.
And a few days ago German climatologist Mojib Latif spewed out more nonsense, claiming Germany would soon experience Sahara-like summers – also based on the same completely bogus climate models that ignore 99.999% of the Earth’s energy systems (sun and oceans).
Alaska gets a taste of the ice age, -40°F in mid November!
Alaska is just the latest example of how glaringly deficient the models are. Not long ago the models said global warming was supposed to be especially pronounced up in the Arctic – in places like Alaska. Someone forgot to tell the climate that.
The following are excerpts from the newsminer.com (temperatures in degrees F).

Fairbanks, Alaska set a new low temperature record on Thursday the second time in three days with a temperature of 41 degrees below zero. That broke the old record of 39 below set in 1969. Fairbanks also set a new record of 35 below on Tuesday, and hit 39 below on Wednesday, two degrees shy of the record. The last time Fairbanks saw 40-below temperatures in November was in 1994, when temperatures of 45, 43 and 45 below were recorded on Nov. 24, 25 and 30, respectively.
“This sort of thing is certainly more common in December and January than November,” meteorologist Dan Hancock at the National Weather Service in Fairbanks said. “We can go through an entire winter and not get this cold.”
Several record low temperatures set more than 40 years ago were broken in the Fairbanks area. Eielson Air Force Base had a low of 43 below early Thursday morning, which broke the previous record of 40 below in 1969. It was the second day in a row a new record was set at Eielson. It was 42 below there on Wednesday morning.
The coldest temperature reported Thursday morning was a record 54 below in Manley Hot Springs. A temperature of 49 below was recorded at KNJP radio station in North Pole, also a record. Thursday morning saw lows of 46 below in Fort Yukon, 45 below in Nikolai, 42 below in Nenana and Tanana and 40 below at Bettles.
Worse, there’s a chance even colder air could move in early next week. How cold it gets will depend on how much cloud cover there is. Meteorologist Julie Malingowski said. “If it does clear out, we’re doomed.” …read all about it here!

Share this...FacebookTwitterI got a CFACT newsletter from Marc Morano about the EPA. It reads as follows:
Dear Pierre,
Last week dawn broke on marble head. Obama woke up and killed EPA’s new ozone rule before it could start killing jobs. 
Businesses, job seekers, taxpayers and electric ratepayers all raised a cheer. For the radical Greens, who have grown used to having their every whim met, not so much. 
There’s a full on hissy fit going on in left field.

MoveOn said, “This is a decision we’d expect from George W. Bush.” 
Natural Resources Defense Council wrote, “Obama has come down on the side of the polluters and those extreme forces who deny the value of government safeguards.”
Greenpeace wrote, “Corporate polluters don’t have to worry about dismantling the Clean Air Act, it appears that President Obama is doing it for them.” They announced Greenpeace will use its tremendous financial resources to launch a campaign to pressure Obama to reverse course.
The Sierra Club said that they were “appalled” by Obama’s decision and with temerity declared it would “literally cost lives.” They too are spending what it takes to put on the pressure.

That’s just a sample of the tooth gnashing going on. Obama’s EPA surrender was like a warning siren for every radical Green pressure group out there (and there are plenty). They are organizing right now to push their man back into line and keep him there.
CFACT is working just as hard and fast to debunk the coming propaganda wave with 
hard facts. 
Help us compete and win. Let’s start with this cogent analysis by CFACT Senior Policy Analyst Bonner Cohen. Please forward it to as many people as you can. Ask them to keep it moving. Let’s email, post to Facebook, tweet on Twitter and not neglect good old word of mouth.
Hard work, solid facts and good sense can carry the day.  We are reminded again that sunlight is a powerful disinfectant.
So send the “hard facts” link to as many people as you can. Don’t let the EPA start interfering with every aspect of your life and property.

When it’s the 2nd coldest year of this century, sea levels are dropping and you’re a warmist desperate for headlines, what do you do? You resort to using outlier and obscure data sources – like the warmist University of Bremen – and claim Arctic ice is “dramatically shrinking” and has reached “a record low” (since satellite measurement began 30 years ago).
Too bad all other datasets show the opposite is true. Using the other well-known sources, the NOAA IMS, NSIDC, JAXA, NORSEX, DMI, or AMSR-E, 2011 was not even close to 2007.
By most accounts, 2011 fell about 300,000 sq km short of 2007. That’s more than 8000 Manhattans. You can see all the up-to-date charts at Anthony Watts excellent sea ice page here.
Dr. Steve Goddard prepared an excellent comparison chart of 2007 and 2011. As you can see it’s not even close when viewed objectively.
Green shows ice added in 2011 compared to 2007.

How the U. of Bremen measures ice to me is truly mysterious. Are they into science or media manipulation? Serious and objective observers of course will be extra careful with future statements coming from Bremen.
Will 2011 take a turn downwards in the days ahead?

Right now temperatures north of 80°N latitude are below normal (see chart below) and falling rapidly, as they typically do this time of the year. Refreezing is now taking place at a vigorous rate. In fact, by most accounts, the 2011 melting season ended near a record early point (Sept 9 – IARC-JAXA). A warming world would show ice melts into late September, and not ending in early September.
Temperature above 80°N, http://ocean.dmi.dk/arctic/meant80n.uk.php:

Source: Danish Meteorological Institute.
Arctic freezing and melting is but only one single indicator from many in discerning global temperature behaviour. Ice-free North Poles were recorded back in the 1950s. And over the last months Steve Goddard’s site has presented numerous accounts of “rapidly melting Arctic ice” – from the early 20th century! Clearly there is nothing unusual about today’s global climate and “ice-free Arctics”.
The relatively low ice extents today in the Arctic are all part of the ongoing global cyclic changes. They are nothing new. Indeed many scientists expect the Arctic to recover. And when it does, it could very well be that melting will shift to the Antarctic.
And if it doesn’t, then expect places like the University of Bremen to see to it that it does.

Share this...FacebookTwitterUsually warmists screech that humans are 95% responsible for the recent warming, and that huge positive water vapor feedbacks will get involved in the future. So it’s not very often you hear a warmist admit that humans perhaps could be just half responsible for the warming of the last 100 years.This is what German climate expert Professor Mojib Latif said in an interview this morning with NDR public radio.
AUDIO HERE!
Forget all the obligatory “we’ve got to cut our emissions soon” stuff. When you look past that, Latif had a few surprises in his interview, mainly he’s keeping the door open that human GHG emissions may not be such a big problem after all. Call it the Great Disappearing Crisis.
1.15 mark: Latif says he sees no positive aspects coming out of Durban, thus confirming it was a failure (warmist point of view).
1.45 mark, Latif:
Durban failed. Durban was the 17th conference of this type, and one now has to ask if such conference make any sense.”

Interesting is at the 3:15 mark. The moderator even now admits that the seriousness of the greenhouse gas problem is actually disputed. This shows that even the media is repositioning. The moderator asks Latif what his view on climate is. Latif replies:
The fact is that there is climate change. The fact is that man is also at least 50% responsible for the warming over the last 100 years.”
50% responsible? If warming has been 0.7°C over the last 100 years, then according to Latif man’s share would only be about one third of a degree Celsius°. That would make a doubling of CO2 look awfully benign.
Latif is now a lukewarmer. Politically, he’s hot on renewable energy. But that’s a different topic.
Some readers will accuse me of twisting Latif’s words. Sorry, but 50% of 0.7°C is about a third of a degree. That’s major back-pedaling.

Share this...FacebookTwitterReader Paul Homewood shows how PBS cooks the books to give the appearance that the USA is having a hot year when in fact it’s just another run of the mill year.
================================================================
By Josh
Record Breaking High Temperatures – What’s Really Behind It?
By Paul Homewood
America’s Public Broadcasting Service (PBS) is keeping track each day of the number of high temperature records being set in the USA. As at 30th August they reckon the year-to-date total was up to 4779. The clear message is that “temperatures must be getting hotter”. But is this so? Are matters as simple as they appear? We need perhaps to start by looking at the methodology employed.
PBS are using data collected by the NCDC from official stations only (not volunteer stations). They go on to say: “In order to make it into our count, a recorded temperature must either tie or exceed a previously recorded temperature on that date in a previous year”. In other words they are not just recording all time highs or even highs for a particular month, just highs for that particular day. So, for instance, a heat wave that lasts 2 days could set 2 records even if the second day was not as hot.
PBS also state – “NCDC records go back for many stations as far as the mid-19th century”. To the extent that this is true, very few record low temperatures would be set given the fact that the 19th century was a particularly cold era. However, as we shall see later, this is such a misleading statement that it borders on being dishonest.
USA 2011 35th warmest – nothing unusual
Before we look more closely at PBS’s numbers we should have a quick look at the overall temperature record for the USA in 2011. From January to July, 2011 ranks only 35th warmest in the last 100 years according to NCDC data.
However this year has perhaps been slightly unusual, with the Northwest being relatively cool and the South and East being warmer than unusual, so averages do not tell the whole story.
Out of the total of 4779 record highs so far, 718 occurred in July, a figure slightly above the average monthly figure of 597. I have broken down this July number and find that 42 record highs are in Kansas. Again this seems to be a representative sample. According to the NCDC map, Kansas July temperatures were “much above normal” but not as hot as Texas and Oklahoma, see here.
Double counting in Kansas
The mean July temperature for Kansas was 84.8°F this year. This ranks 5th warmest in the last 100 years with 1934 the hottest at 86.7. 1936, 1954 and 1980 also had hotter Julys. In other words, although this July has been very hot in Kansas, it is certainly a long way from being the hottest, see here.
What do the 42 record temperatures for Kansas tell us when we look at them more closely? There are 20 official weather stations in Kansas of which 19 appear to be at airports. Record temperatures, however, have only been set at 8 of these. All of these 8 stations are airport based. Two of these are in Topeka and so are arguably double counted! These are listed below:
Location – Year first operational
Dodge City Regional AP – 1942
Emporia Municipal AP – 1950
Garden City Regional AP – 1939
Hill City Municipal AP – 1948
Olathe Johnson Co AP – 1978
Topeka Billard Municipal AP – 1948
Topeka Forbes Field AP – 1942
Wichita Mid Continent AP – 1953
http://www4.ncdc.noaa.gov/cgi-win/wwcgi.dll?wwDI~GetCity~USA
Many “record setting” stations do not even go back to the 1930s
We can see immediately that the claim that “many stations go back to the 19th century” certainly does not apply to Kansas. More importantly none of these date back to the mid 1930s when July temperatures were much higher than now. (Topeka Billard is listed as starting in 1932. However the actual records start in 1948), see here.

Although none of these stations go back prior to 1939, there are earlier records available at other locations that are very close to some of these stations. These records show that in most cases higher temperatures were recorded either in 1934 or 1936. These alternate stations are typically less than 4 miles from the current station and the metadata show similar conditions such as altitude.
Out of the 23 “record highs” set at these 5 stations in 2011, 16 were lower than previous highs set before the station became operational. Only 30% were genuine highs or 1.4 per station. (It is possible of course that some of these records were also exceeded in years prior to 1934).
When we analyse the July temperature for these stations further. It is clear from this analysis, regardless of the parameters used, that July in both 1934 and 1936 were significantly hotter than July 2011.
Siting effects
There is one further matter to look at. What effect have airport siting or other UHI effects had on the long term temperature trend at these sites? Taking Topeka as an example, I have identified 4 other weather stations nearby which are not based at airports and are in smaller towns. They are all certified USHCN COOP stations and have continuous records dating back to 1936. Their metadata and geography are summarised below.

TOPEKA
No station changes since 1932.
Station situated 410 ft from runway
Topeka has a population of 127,000 but the airport is 4 miles out of town.
HORTON
The station is based at a water plant and has been in the same location since 1983.
Population of 2000.
Horton is 42 miles from Topeka.
PAWNEE CITY
The current station is within a mile of its site in 1936 with no significant change in altitude.
Population of 1000.
77 miles from Topeka. (Pawnee City is actually in Nebraska, but is closer to Topeka than most other comparable Kansas sites).
LAWRENCE
The current station is 2 miles from the 1936 site. Both sites are within the town.
It is also now at an altitude 145ft higher than in 1936 which will have a small effect on temperature differences.
Population is 66,000.
Lawrence is 40 miles from Topeka.
LEAVENWORTH
The current station is within 1 mile of the 1936 site and both were situated in the centre of town. As with Lawrence there has been a slight altitude increase of 80 ft.
Population is 38,000.
41 miles from Topeka.
Temperature comparisons between 1936 and 2011 show:
 
In other words, Topeka has become significantly warmer relative to the “rural” sites at Horton and Pawnee City. Both maximum and mean temperatures show a divergence of between 3°F and 4°F. Interestingly the medium sized towns appear to be consistent with Topeka in terms of maximum temperatures (particularly when the slightly higher altitudes are factored in), which suggests that the UHI effect in these towns is similar to the airport effect at Topeka. (As the airport is 4 miles outside town the UHI effect of Topeka’s larger size is probably not significant). There does not appear to be any logical reason, though why mean temperatures at Leavenworth and Lawrenceare relatively cooler.
So what can we conclude?
1) Over the US as a whole, 2011 has so far been barely warmer than average. In no way can it be remotely described as “hot” as implied by PBS.
2) As forKansas, July, although much warmer than average, is only the 5th warmest in recent years and 1.9F cooler than 1934.
3) The only stations in Kansas where records were set in July are all airport based and date back no earlier than 1942. Alternative stations confirm most of these “records” are lower than previously set in 1934 and 1936.
4) Where records are available back to 1934, they show that temperatures in both 1934 and 1936 were considerably higher for the month as a whole than 2011. This is true for average maximum, average mean and high maximum.
5) Comparison with rural stations suggest that airport siting and possibly UHI have had an upward effect on temperatures since 1936 of as much as 4F.

Share this...FacebookTwitterIt’s official: the Alfred Wegener Institute Antarctic Neumayer-Station III is a meteorological observation station that’s been measuring air temperature and other magnitudes in Antarctica for 30 years, which is the period of time used to define climate for a region. The results are clear and indisputable. The AWI writes in its press release:
At the Neumayer Station it has not gotten warmer over the last 30 years.”
Note they avoid saying it got cooler. If the trend had been the opposite, the results would have been blasted out to the world in the most vivid terms. Annual mean temperature for the years 1982 to 2011 measured at the Neumayer-Station (all graphics come from the Alfred Wegener Institute):

Mean annual temperature plot at the Neumayer Station shows cooling. (AWI)

According to the press release, the temperature station uses instrumentation that makes US climatological measurement system look like a meteorological junkyard. The Antarctic station uses a special type thermometer that is protected from the sun’s rays and has a sensitive platinum wire. The thermometer is 2 meters above the surface. Whenever a measurement is made, the surrounding air is set into turbulence and the measurement is then input into a computer. According to Director Gert König-Langlo:
We check the stability of the measurement system on a regular basis using calibration thermometers.
At the station the annual mean temperature over the last 30 years was minus 16°C. The year 1996 with a mean temperature of minus 14.3°C was the warmest of the last 30 years and the year 2000 was the coldest with a mean temperature of minus 17.8° Celsius.”
With all the concern over global warming gripping Europe, you’d think this would be all over the news. Nope! Not a peep of this cooling trend has appeared anywhere in the German news as far as I can tell. Unfortunately, the AWI did not offer any explanation as to why they have measured cooling. But it is quick to add:
This development is however a regional change and the measurement data from the Neumayer-Station III  is in no way representative for global climate changes. ‘Only at the centre of Antarctica has it not gotten warmer. On the Antarctic peninsula on the other hand, the mean temperature has risen up to 3°C. We also observe a similar warming in the Arctic,’ says König-Langlo.”
I’ll now take the liberty to offer the AWI scientists a clue: perhaps ocean cycles and currents have something to do with it?

The Neumayer station also shows a powerful upward trend for the amount of sunshine:
Amount of sunshine at the Neumayer Station of the AWI.
Here, however, König-Langlo doesn’t hesitate to offer an explanation:
Our weather data shows that the part of Antarctica where our station is located is increasingly influenced by high pressure. We have clear skies more and more often. And wherever cloud cover is missing in polar regions, heat gets radiated out and the lower air layers cool.”
More and more high pressure resulting in clear skies. (AWI)
Polar temperatures depend a lot on cloud cover? A couple of days ago it was soot. Sometimes it’s aerosols. Other times it’s all CO2.  I wish these scientists would make up their minds for once! But it’s never the sun, never the oceans (though without them there would be no climate to change). We keep hearing of different warming drivers, but the numbers never add up because nobody dares to scale back CO2 is as a driver. In the end the scientists look absolutely untrustworthy with their explanations – in layman’s terms they make themselves look like they’re FOS.
When you add their numbers up, the result says they absolutely are.
Near the end of the press release comes the pitch for more funding to conduct more research.
Why the temperature curve of the Neumayer-Station differs so much from the other research stations on the Antarctic peninnsula is still the object of current research. “Further measurements and research efforts are necessary to clear up the matter,’ says Gert König-Langlo.”

Two short reports today…
1) Solar jobs in Germany overstated
The idea was to shift from dirty fossil and dangerous nuclear fuel power generation over to clean, climate-friendly renewable energy, and thus create thousands of new green jobs that would usher in the German Green Revolution and so make Germany a model for the rest of the world on how to responsibly use energy.
Unfortunately, it may be becoming a model of what not to do.
A recent report throws more ice water on the green dream – at least in the solar industry. The report says that the number of solar jobs in Germany is much less than what is claimed by the industry. Instead of 133,000 solar jobs, the number is only 80,000.
According to CO2 Handel.de:
According to the Berlin Polytechnic University for Technology and Economy(HTW) there are currently about 80,000 jobs in the German photovoltaic industry, this reported by Welt am Sonntag.”

The 133,000 jobs claimed by the solar industry trade associations have not been reached by a long shot. According to the Berlin Polytechnic University, approximately 75% of the jobs are not even in the so-called hightech areas of manufacturing, but rather in distribution and installation.
A few days ago NoTricksZone here reported how solar companies in Germany are bleeding to death, and shifting production to Asia. Solar panels are increasingly being manufactured in China and Malaysia where costs are much cheaper.
Not only are the lost jobs in the fossil fuel and nuclear industries not being replaced, but electricity rates have begun to soar as well, adding another hit to the economy.
2) Green statists on Rick Perry 
It’s now dawning on Europe’s greenies that Obama’s challenger in 2012 is going to be a solid skeptic (It obviously has not dawned on them that even Obama thinks little of the issue, probably because he knows the green revolution is a scam and would slam especially the poor). Statist green German website Klima der Gerechtigkeit (Climate of Justice) looks at emerging front-runner Rick Perry’s and his positions on climate change.
Perry is currently the favorite to be the Rupublican nominee. In the primaries his anti-climate positions likely will not be a disadvantage. That could change if the Republicans nominate him to go up against Obama. Climate change has had a noticeable impact on Texas over the last 20 years; it has become hotter and dryer. So far Perry has moved forward with his platitudes. But his home state is moaning under one of the worst droughts in its history – farmers face harvest losses of US$ 10 billion. Its governor allows his campaign to be financed by the oil and gas lobby and demands an end to all state regulations.
It’s going to be a fun campaign. Seriously.”
It very well may be. Texas is one of the fastest growing states, creating 40% of all new jobs in the entire country. It’s population is booming too. Concerning climate change, 69% of all Americans believe scientists have lied about climate change. Let’s see if Obama is stupid enough to side up with the 31%.

Share this...FacebookTwitterI thought the planet today was warm – too warm, we keep hearing. Well the Arctic was a heck of a lot warmer 53 million years ago. Today’s climate by comparison is downright frigid.
The Bild der Wissenschaft reports on a paper appearing in the Proceedings of the Royal Society here that shows the Arctic was covered with forests.
The Arctic appears to have been forested 53 million years ago, along with rich plant and animal diversity. According to the paper, conditions were similar to the southeastern North America, with climate conditions like Central Europe’s today. Scientists from the University of Birmingham discovered this by analysing rock layers of the Stenkul fjord on the Canadian island of Ellesmere and the pollen, fungus spores and fossils of animals they contained.
According to Bild der Wissenschaft, the average annual temperature was a relatively balmy 8 to 15 egrees Celsius back then, with summertime temperatures climbing above 20°C. In the wintertime the temperatures were around the freezing point, similar to what we have today in Europe and southern North America today.
The scientists were surprised by the diversity of plants and that they were found so far north during the warm periods.
Now that’s real global warming – and not the 0.7°C we have had over the last 150 years.

Share this...FacebookTwitterThe Winnepeg Free Press here and Yahoo report here that Western Canada needs to brace for a brutal winter. Hat tip reader Matti Vooro.
The Yahoo News blog writes:
Meteorologists are calling for an early and cold winter in Western Canada, probably one of the top three coldest in the last 20 years for the West Coast.”
This comes at the heels of last month’s reports from Britain  where long-range forecasters warned of below average temperatures from October through February, along with lots of whites stuff, which just a few years ago was said would be “rare and exciting” in the future because of global warming.
Cold events caused by natural factors
In times of global warming, people may ask what’s causing all the cold and snow? Accuweather’s Brent Anderson has the answer:
That’s typical of a La Nina, but (blasts) don’t last very long; they come and they go,”

In other words, when cold events occur, it’s because of natural factors. But when warm events happen, then it’s man-made global warming. And what about Britain’s coming cold weather? You guessed it -also  caused by natural factors (UV radiation!). And should cold extremes befall us, then of course it’ll be due to global warming, er, man-made climate change – which scientists say “leads to weather extremes”. If you are getting confused, don’t worry – so am I! (And so are the scientists).
So how cold is it going to get over the vast Canadian territory? The Winnipeg Free Press writes:
The forecast is one of the coldest winters in the past 20 years for Western Canada, major snowstorms for Ontario and Quebec and a drier than normal winter for Atlantic Canada.”
Accuweather’s Brett Anderson adds:
Western provinces can expect a fifth-consecutive deep freeze to move in and stay.”
and
Vancouver will experience one of its coldest winters on record.”
Last month German whippersnapper meteorologist Dominik Jung, a warmist, predicted here the fourth consecutive bitter winter would grip Central Europe this winter and could strain the energy supply. Looks like we’ll need to burn more coal, and not less.

Share this...FacebookTwitterOne way to indoctrinate children on living green is to teach them in a green passive school that requires little energy consumption. This is what they are attempting in East German Schwarzheide, as reported at the online Lausitzer Rundschau daily.
 There’s only one small problem: The lesson in living repsonsibly to protect the climate has backfired. The school’s ventilation is so bad that it is making students and teachers get ill by the score. Hat-tip: EIKE.
In general, a passive building typically has very low air infiltration from outside and is heavily insulated to ensure low thermal heat loss. Indeed heating requirements can be as low as 15 kwh per square meter of occupancy space per year. In the wintertime air intake is heated, and in the summertime the building uses the cool night air along with lots of shading for cooling. These types of buildings, at least in north Germany, are not equipped with air conditioning.
Unfortunately at the Schwarzheide SeeCampus school in Niederlausitz, the climate system in the school building doesn’t work like the architectural models thought it would. According to the Lausitzer Rundschau:
Pupils and teachers dread every school day at the SeeCampus. If the deodorant of just one person fails to work, then half the classroom goes into a coma. The ventilation in the exemplary passive building is a catastrophe. There’s an extreme lack of fresh air on hot days. Because of concern over the health of the children, who complain about headaches and fatigue, parents are threatening to stop operation of the school through legal action.
The school building SeeCampus in Niederlausitz becomes completely overheated on summer days and is badly ventilated. Headaches and cardio-respiratory problems with pupils and teachers are the result. The number of sick days is climbing rapidly.”

According to the website of the proud window and door supplier, Wiegand, the 3-storey €23 million school was built in 15 months and was dedicated during a party-like ceremony in February 2011 by Brandenburg State Minister President Platzeck, and State Council member Heinze accepted the Certificate from the Passive Building Institute.
Pupils and teachers being used as human guinea pigs to test the green experiment. Despite all the complaints, authorities have taken no action and are playing down the problems. According to teacher and administrator Andrea Eisenblätter:
 The air is dry. Because of the lack of oxygen, many students constantly have headaches. Concentration is near zero. How is anyone supposed to get proper grades?“
Parent Frank Klonowska from the town of Lauchhammer says:
It is suffocatingly warm, you can hardly breath. I was completely drenched in sweat after just 3 minutes. It is simply incomprehensible that the technical design of the ventilation system at the SeeCampus even got approved.”
In the end expect hundreds of thousands of euros more to be spent on proper ventilation and climate control, and expect much more than the ballyhooed 15 kwh/m²/year to be consumed. Or, in the worst case, expect the place to be taken over by the weeds soon.

Heartland Institute’s 6th International Climate Conference Concludes
While climate tourists were meeting for the zillionth time to talk about rescuing the Kyoto Protocol and spreading a party-atmosphere at the taxpayers’ expense in Berlin, elite climate scientists met in Washington for the 6th time (privately financed), and agreed: The global climate is as normal as it has ever been – only the politics in a few countries (foremost Germany) is getting more and more out of whack.
 In Berlin concerned German Environment Minister Norbert Röttgen was doing his best to encourage the stalled and disappointed UN climate rescuers, and demanded they not relent in their attempts to avert the imaginary climate catastrophe. After all climate change is “a crisis for humanity”. For Röttgen and his Climadonna Merkel it’s nothing less. In contrast, everything at the 6th International Climate Conference in Washington was factual and based on science, and not fear and emotions. What follows are some impressions by EIKE’s President, Dr. Holger Thuss”
“About 250 participants and media representatives made their way to Washington to the 6th International Conference on Climate Change of the Heartland Institute (ICCC-6), a think-tank in Chicago. Organizers set out to challenge the so-called consensus on man-made global warming. The most important result of the conference which ended on the first of July was that such a consensus does not exist. 
The most important presentations were made by Dr. Patrick  J. Michaels (George Mason University / Cato Institute), Prof. Dr. S. Fred Singer (Emeritus of the University of Virginia) and Prof. Bob Carter (Queensland University, Australia). In his presentation Michaels concentrated on the historical background of the climate debate, where the organisational prerequisites were created already back in the 1940s. A big problem, says Michaels, is especially the existing combination of science funding with political-strategic planning by politicians. 
Prof. Singer introduced the updated progress report of the 2009/10 NIPCC Climate Report of the independent scientists. Prof. Bob Carter reported on the detailed study of the New Zealand temperature data, which also showed a strange upward jump in temperatures very similar to the famous hockey stick manipulations (Climategate), where experts were able to find major flaws. Also here raw data “disappeared”.
Special emphasis has to be placed on the contributions by Marc Morano (ClimateDepot.org and CFACT) and Anthony Watts (Wattsupwiththat.com), who run 2 of the most important skeptic websites globally. While Morano delivered a large quantity of new information on the status of climate policy, Watts provided the unmistakable many and wide range of error sources when recording and measuring of important weather data. Moreover Morano, Watts and other speakers emphasized that the politicization of the climate climate debate has continued to increase since the last conference. In all western countries it is being attempted to drive climate-change education into the minds of young children at schools by incorporating a binding curriculum – but only with minimal success. In contrast, there are questionable scientific facts which are being also legally challenged in countries like the USA and Australia. Also information on the status of this was provided.
The most problematic country in the west concerning the subject of climate change remains – this became clear during the conference – Germany. Especially during the breaks observers from Germany were again and again asked worried questions about the German “Sonderweg“, i.e. different path.”

In a piece titled Under Deniers, science publicist Dirk Maxeiner writes about how dissent over any politically touchy topic in Germany is increasingly being suppressed lately: by applying the label “Leugner” (denier).
Especially when one considers what Germany went through during its history, I find it appalling that a person’s right to speak up and to exercise dissent here would be suppressed in that particular manner. Sadly, that is exactly what is happening now whenever someone expresses a “different opinion” on any politically sensitive topic, especially climate change.
So just how are climate dissenters being regarded here in Germany? Among some: like criminals. Maxeiner describes how:
Whoever even quietly doubts this or that aspect of catastrophic global warming finds himself in no time at all in the company of those on the dock of the Nuremberg trials, or of Bishop Williamson and Ahmadinedschad. It is as if the denial of a crime in the past could be compared to the doubt over a feared future catastrophe.”
Well, this is pretty much what’s happening in Germany. How often does we hear the term “climate change denier” in the “debate”?
In Germany it was just on the anniversary of Kristallnacht last November when a group of leading German Green Parliamentarians (Dr. Hermann Ott, Bärbel Höhn, Hans Josef Fell, Sylvia Kotting-Uhl, Jürgen Trittin etc.) sent a brief query to Chancellor Angela Merkel demanding that she explain how someone in her party could have the gall of meeting with “climate change denier” Fred Singer.
The query contained the term “denier” at least 7 times, once in the title, 3 times in the introduction (once even personally calling Fred Singer, who is Jewish, a “climate change denier”), once in point no. 6, once in point no. 10 and once in point no. 11 (see here). It is all documented.
But to Germany’s credit, for whatever it’s worth, this brand of science bullying was not it’s own invention, but more so appears to be of American origin. The German Greens seem to be content to use it for all it’s worth. Maxeiner tells us how the real groundwork was prepared:

To do this, it was first necessary to equate modern industrial societies with the Holocaust. For the climate protection apologist Al Gore ‘the evidence of an ecological Kristallnacht is as clear as the shattering of glass in Berlin.’ For well-known American climate scientist James Hansen one has to ask the question when one views the calving of glaciers: ‘Could the the sound of breaking ice masses serve as a Kristallnacht to wake us up?’ Regarding coal trains, he found it appropriate to comment: If we don’t succeed in stopping the construction of new coal power plants, then these are death trains that are no less gruesome than the trains that rolled into the crematoriums.’ For the last remark, he at least apologized.”
And let’s not forget Dave Roberts (of Grist) and his notorious comment:
When we’ve finally gotten serious about global warming, when the impacts are really hitting us and we’re in a full worldwide scramble to minimize the damage, we should have war crimes trials for these bastards — some sort of climate Nuremberg.”
In the end, all this rhetoric has served to label climate science dissenters as criminals on par to Holocaust deniers. In Germany the term “denier” has lately become the fashionable weapon of the politically correct in attacking opposition, and so it is no surprise that it is being widely used here for a number of other issues, like the recent shooting spree in Norway and criticism of Islam. Maxeiner writes:
Claudia Roth of the Green Party speaks of ‘denying the reality of Islam’ when addressing critical views of Islam. Magazine Der Spiegel, always one to use the latest word-trends and to not miss a single beat, concocted the magic term: ‘Islam-denier”.
And today anyone who expresses criticism of the euro now risks being labelled a “euro-denier”.
So speak at your own peril. To dissent is to “deny”, which is now being associated with crimes of the worst kind. One has to remember that in Germany there is little debate on climate change. The dissenters are an extremely small minority and have very few resources. The risks of speaking here up are very real.
As for me – the more they try to shut us up with this kind of bullying, the more I’m going to bring up their crude examples.

Share this...FacebookTwitterAnyone wondering what some US leaders envision for the USA’s energy policy may wish to attend the following Harvard German Conference to find out.
The energy part of the conference is taking place this weekend, Saturday morning, February 18, 2012:
9:30 – 10:30: Energy – Keynote Jeremy Rifkin.
The Third Industrial Revolution: The New German Model for a Post-Carbon Economy, Radcliffe Yard
10:30 – 10:50: Coffee Break, Radcliffe Yard
10:50 – 11:15: Energy Address, Dr. Hermann Ott (MdB German Green Party), Radcliffe Yard
11:15 – 12:40: Energy – Panel and Q&A:
Full throttle towards green energy – Germany visionary or misguided?
Prof. Dr. Jürgen Kluge, Dr. Hermann Ott, Benjamin Schlesinger, Ph.D., Prof. Dr. Eicke Weber, Radcliffe Yard
And if you’re interested in finding out how the “new German model” is coming along, read about it here – it aint pretty! In fact, the power grid came only a whisker away from a collapse during the recent cold spell. And many German companies are relocating to places where supply is more reliable.

But who cares about these nuances – it’s the way the USA should go these misguided pointy heads tell us. I’ll let the German readers here tell you who these German masterminds are.
DR. KEIL’S FULL 28-PAGE REPORT IN ENGLISH
The above report is a must read if you are involved in energy engineering, planning or policy!
If you do, you’ll never want to touch the German strategy. In fact, according to experts from 21 of the World Energy Council’s country committees:
81% of the countries surveyed reject the German way as a model for the world, and none of the experts could imagine their own countries following the German way.”
I’ve read the entire 28-page report, and it sounds worse than Soviet-style central planning. If anyone happens to be near Harvard, go check out the conference.
So far in Germany, the current attempt to switch over to renewable energy has only succeeded in:
1) driving up electricty and energy rates for consumers,
2) making the power supply unreliable,
3. littering the landscape with windparks and solar panels,
4. driving up the price of food,
5. driving industry out of country,
6. regulating private lives more and more intensely, and
7. putting billions into the pockets of a few opportunists and carbon traders.

Share this...FacebookTwitterARD German public television presented a short clip of Fritz Vahrenholt  and the contents of his new book during its early morning show on Monday. ARD had an agitated Prof Mojib Latif on to respond.It is still unclear why Latif is agitated with Vahrenholt to begin with, as they both agree that CO2 is only half responsible for the recent warming.
Most likely it all has something to do with Latif’s love of being in the media limelight. He’ll say anything to get on TV.
Lüning responds to Latif’s TV comedy
Sebastian Lüning, co-author of the book “Die kalte Sonne” together with Vahrenholt, responds to Latif’s comments at his http://www.kaltesonne.de website, which I present in English as follows:
Early risers today were able see a report about “Die kalte Sonne” on the ARD-Morgen magazin. The report gave an overview of the book’s positions and of Fritz Vahrenholt. Then Mojib Latif appeared in the studio, and was visibly agitated with Vahrenholt. In addition to a tirade that is truly worth watching, Latif attempted to refute the book’s main assertions. According to Latif, it could be shown just by looking at the temperature development of the stratosphere that the sun has no big impact on the course of the climate, CO2 and the sun here would lead to completely different developments. Both of these competing climate factors would each have their own characteristic fingerprint, and so it would be possible to distinguish between the two. Latif: ‘Up there 30, 40, 50 kilometers in altitude we are measuring a massive cooling. And that is precisely the effect of of CO2. That can only be explained by CO2…” .
The audience, comprised mainly of laymen, probably were impressed by Latif’s every word. Latif then delivered the knockout punch, and summarized for the audience: ‘That means that I don’t need 400 pages to show it’s the sun. I need a full two sentences to show that it’s CO2.’

Unfortunately for Prof. Latif, stratospheric cooling cannot be in any way a strong indicator for a powerful climate impact by CO2 because:
1) The cooling of the stratosphere occurred mainly during the 1980-1995 phase, a time when the ozone layer was thinned out by FCKW emissions, as the following figure depicts:

Source: Ozone concentration/stratosphere (left) and temperatures/stratosphere (right): Avajon et al. 2007, also see webpage of Prof. Scott Mandia and webpage of Markus Gronotte.
The thinning out of the ozone led to a continuous decline in stratospheric absorbed solar energy, which led to a cooling in the stratosphere. In the 1990s, CFC emissions were cranked back by the Montreal Protocol and the ozone layer has been slowly recovering since 1995. Since 1995 there’s been no significant temperature changes – the values have been oscillating about a plateau.
For Latif, explaining why CO2 is the dominant driver can be done in only two sentences. Exposing these people for who they really are is turning out to be much easier than imagined. In the interview he says he did not even buy the book, and that he only read a few excerpts of it. Latif is not serious with his conclusion on the book.

Hamburg storm of 1962
Today is the 50th anniversary of the great storm of 1962, which with winds peaking at 200 km/hr hit Hamburg, Germany particularly hard. More than 50 dikes burst as the tide surged and submerged one sixth of the city. Imagine if that heppened today!

In total, the homes of about 60,000 people were destroyed, and the death toll amounted to 347 in Hamburg alone.
The European storm of 1953 – the worst in 500 years
It caused floods that took 2,000 lives. Holland was worst hit. Dikes gave way and flooded towns all across Europe.

Other great European storm disasters (when CO2 was 280 ppm):
17 Feb. 1164: Julian Flood, 20,000 dead.
16 Jan. 1219: 1st Marcellus Flood Reportedly 36,000 dead
14 Dec. 1287: St. Lucia’s Flood 50,000 dead

Share this...FacebookTwitterThe English Der Spiegel presents a blistering report on the solar energy debacle in Germany this week in a piece titled:
Solar Subsidy Sinkhole, Re-Evaluating Germany’s Blind Faith in the Sun.
The costs of subsidizing solar electricity have exceeded the 100-billion-euro mark in Germany, but poor results are jeopardizing the country’s transition to renewable energy. The government is struggling to come up with a new concept to promote the inefficient technology in the future…continue reading at Der Spiegel here.
Some bits of reality:
Solar farm operators and homeowners with solar panels on their roofs collected more than €8 billion ($10.2 billion) in subsidies in 2011, but the electricity they generated made up only about 3 percent of the total power supply, and that at unpredictable times.
Until now, Merkel had consistently touted the environmental sector’s “opportunities for exports, development, technology and jobs.” But now even members of her own staff are calling it a massive money pit.

If all commitments to pay subsidies so far are added together, Frondel adds, ‘we have already exceeded the €100 billion level.'”
Read about the entire dismal mess at Der Spiegel, see link above.
Yet, the Greens in Germany are proud of this debacle and cannot get enough of it. Green Party leader Jürgen Trittin says here at CO2 Handel (emphasis added):
‘We are experiencing a concentrated campaign against renewable energy over the recent days,’ Trittin thinks. ‘It is being led by the coal lobby at RWE and Eon, but it is also being incited by the Federal Ministry of Economics.’ Trittin said, the Feed-In Act is by far the most inexpensive way of expanding renewable energies. ‘That’s why it has been copied by over 50 countries.’ “
50 countries that are ruining their energy supply. It should be clear just how detached from reality people like Trittin are.
But with such handouts, I really ought to start thinking about having a system of my own installed on our house. If you don’t jump through the hoop, then you pay through the nose. But on the other side of the hoop, you get rewarded. So it’s stupid not jump through it.

The scam is falling apart, bit by bit like a cake out in the rain. Hat-tip: http://climatedepot.com/. No wonder some “climate science” characters are resorting to desperate acts. I wonder how the media feels about all this. They used to view themselves as so high and mighty, and now nobody is listening to them.
According to the UPI here, emphasis added:
Three-quarters of Americans say natural disasters are on the increase, but fewer than ever believe the climate is heating up, a new poll finds.
Only 44 percent say they ‘believe the theory‘ that carbon dioxide emissions are warming the Earth, down from 51 percent in 2009 and 71 percent in 2007, but most movement has been into the “not sure” column.”
That means the number of people who believe the theory has dropped a whopping 27% in just 4 years. After all that indoctrination and disinformation, this is their result. And to think that us skeptics are only getting warmed up!
The hoax is over folks. Stop acting like it aint.

That means start kissing German green jobs good bye. Yet another Soviet-style propped up industry begins to bite the dust.
According to co2-handel.de here, rising raw material prices on the purchasing side, falling prices on the sales side, falling market demand, and reduced subsidies are spelling big trouble for the once booming German solar industry.
Solarworld, based in Bonn, did better than most other German solar companies. For the first 6 months of 2011 it recorded a profit of €22.4 million, but that was down significantly from €34.8 million for the same period last year. Half-year sales plummeted 12% to €535 million.
Hemorrhaging red ink – production moving to Asia
Konstanz-based Sunways AG’s 2nd quarter sales collapsed from €64.6 million to €38.7 million during the first half of this year, posting a loss of €2.5 million euros.

Things were even worse for Conergy. According to CO2-handel.de, the Hamburg-based company lost €41 million in the first 6 months of this year compared to a profit of €5 million for the same period last year.
Bavaria-based Phoenix Solar extended its losing streak, posting a loss of €21.1 million compared to a loss of  €18.7 million for the same period last year. Sales plummeted 61% to €140.8 million.
Q-Cells in Bitterfeld-Wolfen plans to shut down a large portion of its solar cell production at facilities in Bitterfeld-Wolfen and shift it to Malaysia in a bid to stem the hemorrhaging red ink. CO2 handel.de writes about Q-Cells:
Production capacity in Germany is to be scaled back by 50%.”
Asian manufacturers are now flooding markets with cheap modules. Solarworld director Frank Asbeck expects 8 gigawatts of over-capacity from Asia.
The flood of red ink is occuring despite government subsidies, which however have been scaled back this year. Face it without the still generous subsidies, the figures would be much worse. And despite the low-priced cells coming from Asia, it’s still a lousy way to produce energy – especially in gray and rainy Germany.

Share this...FacebookTwitterMore about More. Below is a short interview with Austrian rapper Kilez More.
More, 22, recently released a rap song/video called Climate Change (Climate Lies, Climate Swindle…), which features the IPCC, CRU and the hockey stick. Now how does a young rap artist know so much about such a complex issue, let alone write a skeptic rap song about it for the youth?
The song indeed is mobilizing the youth, not in masses, but it is a budding challenge. For that Kilez is becoming a sort of enfant terrible, persona non grata in Europe – who dares speak truth to power. I’ve since translated the German text to English, and Kilez has added the English subtitles to his Youtube video:

Of course it doesn’t rhyme in English – but it gives you the gist of what he’s rapping about.

Interview
The following is an interview with Kilez, about what motivated him to “take on the establishment”. He is an environmentalist fighting for cleaner air and water, eradication of poverty, animal abuse, etc. Some of his positions may be off the wall for some of us, but most of us will agree with his position that authority needs to be questioned, and that we ought not be complacent – especially young people on the subject of climate change.
————————————————————————————-
INTERVIEW
NTZ: Most young people your age aren’t interested in climate change. What sparked your interest?
KM: Like with many issues, I approached it by questioning the “official stories”. I do my best to research and make sure I get both sides of the story. When I did this with “climate change” I realized it’s mostly a hoax.
NTZ: When did you have your first doubts?
KM: It was years ago I think when I read a few lines about it in a book – and this increased my attention. It was written that the “Club of Rome” decided a long time ago already, before anyone ever heard about it, that “climate” would be the thing for the future. So I started to search for answers on my own and this quickly got me really to what I think is now the truth. We had scares before in Germany and Austria – like with acid rain and forests dying. Here the scientists and mass media said all forests would die by the end of the century. Now it’s 2011 and everybody knows they were completely false.
NTZ: What led you to write a rap song about climate change?
KM: The topic is everywhere around and it’s crazy what’s going on, so I decided to do something, because no alternative story gets shown. Also in the school-books the children are learning this stuff. I think music is a good way to reach young people – so they maybe start to question the world around them and not to take everything implicitly. Up to now, I’ve read books about the climate-topic, and I pursued the “climategate” story. It all guided me to make a song about it.
NTZ: How does the public in Austria and Germany view climate change? Are people questioning it?
KM: I dont know how the situation is in your country, but in Germany and Austria different opinions don’t exist – it’s really weird how everyone thinks the same – everywhere it is accepted as a fact without any doubt.
That’s why people look at you as if your an idiot (or whatever) when you question it – but yes, critical thinking is increasing here. I recognize it myself, through my music and the resonance I get from listeners.
The music also leads me to very interesting people, journalists, politicians, and so on, and they all try to do their best to get people to think critically.
Kilez More
NTZ: When you perform, what is it you want your listeners to do? Why should they believe you?
KM: I always say with my songs I don’t want the listeners to believe everything I say – no,
that’s the wrong way. That would be the same wrong way as believing everything the newspapers or TV-shows are saying. The message is to think on your own, to search the truth by yourself and to speak out loud against unfairness and lies.

Share this...FacebookTwitterMatthias Iken has written a piece at the online German daily Hamburger Abendblatt here on Germany’s reaction to Fritz Vahrenholt’s and Sebastian Lüning’s climate skeptical bestselling book “Die kalte Sonne“. His piece is titled: The Intolerant Society.
Germany deals with its climate skeptics (Public domain work)
Needless to say, the reaction to Germany’s bestselling skeptic book has been brutally harsh. In his piece, Iken reminds us of three rules in Germany:
1. Never praise the Pope!
2. Never doubt the multi-cultural society!
3. And do believe in climate change!”
Violating any of the above will get you into serious trouble. Since Vahrenholt’s and Lüning’s skeptic book has hit the bookshelves, the two authors have been met with a storm of outrage from the much of the media, numerous zealot activists and the political establishment. Vahrenholt’s own party comrade Michael Müller even labelled him a “climate denier”.
Germany stomps “skeptic physics“
As Die kalte Sonne website mentions, Iken writes:
It is best kept silent that Vahrenholt is the director of RWE subsidiary Innogy for alternative energies. The same applies to the fact that the former environmental politician fought as a pioneer for the ecological movement, as the author of the book Seveso ist überall [Seveso is everywhere} and that he was the manager of the wind power company Repower. He has earned the right to be taken seriously. No one has to agree with him, but he needs to be discussed with.”

Die kalte Sonne website writes that one has to wonder about the massivve blind trust placed in the keepers of the unchallenged IPCC climate truth. Instead of entering into a fruitful discussion, brimstone and fire has rained down. Numerous scientists who agree at least with parts of the book’s argumentation are keeping silent for fear of being chastised by colleagues and loss of grant money. Unfortunately Germany has seen similar days some decades ago. The only difference today is that the science that challenges climate orthodoxy now gets called skeptic physics.
No. 14 on bestseller list
Critics also unfairly claim that the book was not written by real climate scientists. However, not only is Vahrenholt a professor of chemistry, he is also an expert in renewable energies – something the media keeps burying. One critic scientist even made the mistake of claiming that Lüning has not authored any real peer-reviewed papers. However, it turns out that he has authored or co-authoredover 30 publications, and, since two weeks, is the author of a bestseller: “Die kalte Sonne”, now ranked No. 14 on Spiegel’s bestseller list.
On the other hand, warmist Mojib Latif, a fierce critic of Vahrenholt and Lüning, has also just released a climate book. It’s ranked number 31,500 at Amazon, making it a real loser. Latif obviously is seething with envy and so has resorted to petty back-biting.  
Die kalte Sonne also includes 4 guest authors who are distinguished experts and pioneers in their respective fields: Nir Shaviv, Henrik Svensmark, Nicola Scarfetta and Werner Weber. Scientifically, it’s as solid as can be.
Ikes reminds us:
As Francis Picabia once said: Our heads are round so that we can think in all directions. In Germany we often act like blockheads.”

Share this...FacebookTwitterHere’s the kind of green propaganda that poor Germans have to endure from their obviously panicked and hysterical Green government.
The German Environment Agency has put out a booklet advising citizens on how to achieve a Climate Neutral Lifestyle, in a bid to avert imminent catastrophe. This is really spooky. The guide communicates that it is Germany’s collective, ethical duty to save the planet from the scientifically proven “climate catastrophe” and that all citizens need to mobilize.
It defines the morality and ethical standards that citizens are to adopt. The guide first starts off by warning citizens:
We are all aware of the importance of climate protection. We are also aware that time is running out.
Scientific evidence on the imminent danger for humans and nature and the resulting cost has been increasing dramatically over the past decades, as has the knowledge about possible action to avert it.”
and:
What is needed is a political and economic U-turn in favour of climate protection.
Social commitment (such as membership in environmental groups) could further the introduction of more environmentally friendly legislation.”
5 examples of living green
So if you are a good citizen, care about the planet, and want to assure that future generations will have a happy planet, then it is your duty to live like one of the following 5 example persons. How you cut CO2 emissions is a “difficult ethical question,” the guide says.
Sabine P.
1. lives in a well-insulated flat
2. participates in car sharing
3. uses bicycle for short trips
4. buys green electricity
5. buys organic produce
6. buys energy-efficient household appliances (A++)
7. supports environmental organisations
She has no car, but “has a clean conscience as well as a lower electricity bill. However, Sabine’s commitment does not end with consumption. ‘I am a member of various environmental organisations and donate on a regular basis.’”

Or you can live like Peter B.
1. lives in a passive house
2. has a solar panel on his roof
3. drives an economical car (3.5 l/100km)
Peter B. says: “It is fantastic to shower with water heated by the sun.” I never knew you could tell the difference.
Check out Katharina C.
1. limits consumption by limiting work hours and salary
2. lives in a small flat
3. turns the heating down
4. lives close to her workplace
5. participates in car-sharing
6. uses the bicycle for short trips
7. avoids long-distance travel
8. buys green electricity
9. buys energy-efficient appliances (A++)
10. cooks vegetarian dishes
11. buys organic food
12. looks out for ecolabels such as the Blue Angel
13. buys CO2 certificates from the EU emissions
By now you are getting the feeling this is communist central planning economy that will fail quickly. Soon Germany and Europe will look like North Korea. Or how about:
Sybille B.
1. has a season ticket for the railway and no car
2. invested money in wind energy (€ 30,000)
3. invested money in sustainability funds (€ 20,000)
The keep telling where to invest. Someone is getting awfully rich from this scam. This is not trickle down, but gusher up economics. Finaly we have
Linus L.
A successful executive, always on the go. His CO2eq emissions come to 18 tonnes per annum. Clearly, this is not a sustainable lifestyle, and he knows it. No problem though: He donates 420 € per year to a reputable carbon offsetting service provider. Hence, his money only goes to UN-certified projects that fulfil the Gold Standard. He sees it as part of his global responsibility – helping other countries to build low-carbon industries.
Some of you may ask what Pierre G. does to reduce carbon emissions. Answer: Not a damn thing. I leave lights on, eat steak, own 2 cars, drive instead of walk, leave windows open etc.
Result? The planet has not warmed in almost 15 years. Screw the green religion, take your hysteria and get out of my house.
Personally I’m going to put a copy of this booklet in the safe so that my children one day can look back and marvel at the degree of collective madness and hysteria that is capable of gripping a society when science runs totally amok. It is truly scary that some societies today are led by institutions seized by such hysteria.
Surely this will be another case study (and again from Germany) for the historians of the future.

Share this...FacebookTwitterI really hate doing this, because I know that the poor scientist will probably be summoned to some office somewhere for an earful, or just suddenly disappear in some big ice crevice. We all know that in Germany terrible things happen to climate scientists (and journalists) and who don’t say the right things.
Our friends at here at Science Skeptical bring us this clip, which is a snippet from a report that appeared on NDR German public TV last Friday evening.

In the clip Prof. Heinrich Miller is working down at the Antarctic Neumayer III station and is interviewed by NDR. Miller is deputy director of the Alfred Wegener Institute (AWI) in Bremerhaven and has been researching the Arctic and Antarctic for decades. He’s a true old hat of polar research who really knows what he’s talking about. Science Skeptical writes:
There’s hardly any other climate scientist that knows the polar regions as well and as long as Miller does.”
In the above clip, NDR asks Miller about the trend in Antarctica and what climate-related changes have been noticed? Miller says (emphasis added):
Here almost nothing has changed. At least not near the surface. The average annual tempertures have remained the same. There are of course large fluctuations from year to year. If anything over the last 30 years we have a slight cooling trend. And this flies in the face of what is always immediately claimed: ‘The climate is warming and the Antarctic is melting’.”
There it is, right from the horse’s mouth, from someone who really knows: Antarctica is cooling.

Share this...FacebookTwitterHere’s a presentation by the past Chairman of the American Solar Energy Industry, Armageddonist Chuck Kutscher, another person who can only be happy if he’s convinced the future is filled with doom and gloom.

h/t: Chris Smith
This is Al Gore repackaged. This is really a sorrowful, populist presentation. How did Kutscher get a PhD! We will redebunk this point by point.
It’s getting late – and I’ve watched the first half. Will finish tomorrow.
I can tell you right now that Fritz Vahrenholt’s and Sebastian Lüning’s new book Die kalte Sonne, using the latest data and peer-reviewed literature, completely demolishes every single point Kutscher makes. Sheesh – Kutscher is still stuck on TSI!
I can’t believe there are so many gullible suckers out there like Chris taking this crap in hook, line and sinker.
Debunking the presentation:
1. 4:30 mark – “Well-heeled misinformation campaign.” That’s bogus. Most of the doubt arises from privately run blogs with little or no money (Climate Audit, WUWT, etc.) and a rapidly growing number of skeptical scientists who are finding loads of flaws in the science. From time to time some media outlets are reporting on this. Public observation has also failed to detect the occurrence of any of the horror predictions. The warmist movement on the other hand is funded by billions.
2. 5:00 mark – “Climategate e-mails show the scientists wanted to get the message out.” Oh, that’s why they defied the requirements of thr FOIA and refused to make the data public. Read The Hockey Stick Illusion

3. 5:30 mark – “Independent panels exonnerated the Climategate scientists.” It’s proven that these were whitewashes led by warmist hacks. McIntyre has gone through all that.
4. 9:15 mark – “Mann’s hockey stick was fundamentally correct.” The national Academy of Sciences said Mann’s hockey stick was rubbish. The new ones that were made to replace it were also shown by McIntyre to be flawed as well. Don’t worry, we will go back and dig it all up again. The 2007 IPCC report did drop it. The one they depicted on page 457 was buried under the updated ones, which brought back the Medieval Warm Period and the Little Ice Age.  Here’s the IPCC hockey stick history.

Share this...FacebookTwitterSome of us may have had suspicions in the past. Now it’s confirmed – some parts of the green/climate movement are so radical that they are now attracting neo-Nazis and extremists.
The online German leftist daily TAZ has come out with an article that describes a disturbing phenomena, namely: the green movement is being infiltrated by these psychos. The TAZ piece is titled: Nazis against coal.
The TAZ opens with:
Green. That’s the color that is inseparably linked to the environmental movement. But behind the appearance that there are lots of left-wing folks behind it, there are often ‘brown environmentalists’ who spread their extreme right wing ideas via their environmental friendliness. A new report by the Heinrich-Böll Foundation now shows that environmental initiatives are being ever more frequently infiltrated by Neonazis.”
Don’t get mad at me, I’m just the messenger. I don’t want to label the true green movement and environmentalists as brown by no means. But sometimes you have to admit that some of the features of the radical climate movement are strikingly similar. The most radical among them want to 10-10 the climate science skeptics, depopulate the planet down to less than a billion people, and dictate to the rest of the world how to live.

The 6 Heinrich-Böll Foundation authors of the 112-page book titled Brown Environmentalists examined extreme right activities within the environmental spectrum in the Mecklenburg region of East Germany. Unfortunately the book is not available in English. The activities included nationalistic protests against Polish plans to build nuclear power plants and extreme right wing parties providing legal advice on environmental issues. Makes you wonder who funds who.
Anti Americanism – protect the homeland!
The Heinrich Boll Foundation is concerned that organic food farmers in the far eastern part of Germany are taking on ultra right wing behaviours and so advises organic shops and individuals to “closely examine the backgrounds of organic farmers who they buy from.” The green brown radicals also were the first to appear at the founding of a citizens initiative called “Say no to coal!” in the town of Lübtheen in 2005. Apparently Udo Pastörs, a honcho in the quite brown NPD party led a protest against the American coal corporation with the intention of spreading radical anti-Americanism.
This ought not be a surprise. Indeed much of the green agenda is aimed against American ideals, and thus it is little wonder that it appeals broadly to haters of Americans. And how often have we heard radical warmists and environmentalists refer to the human race as parasites? That’s only one step away from picking up a spray can of Raid. There are things they seem to have in common. My suggestion to true greens is that you really ought to tone down the rhetoric against those who do not agree with you. Just look at the company you’re getting. It’s disgusting.
The organic farmers mentioned above have roots that go back a long time. Back in the 1920s in Koppelow near Krakow the Volks Nationalistic Movement of the so-called Artamanen started their grand settlement projects. Among the Artamanen, who were dedicated to a Blut und Boden (blood and soil)-inspired ruralism,  were the infamous Nazis Heinrich Himmler and Auschwitz commandant Rudolf Höß. According to the TAZ report, extreme right wing ecological movements go far beyond the “68” generation, and are focused on defending the homeland and preserving the environment.

Share this...FacebookTwitterI must admit that over the last record-breaking 10 days here at NTZ, it’s been interesting to watch the climate activists and the end-of-the world whackos hyperventilate about Fritz Vahrenholt’s and Sebastian Lüning’s questioning of climate science.
So over-the-top have some of the attacks been that readers are beginning to question the very sanity of some of these obsessive Armageddonist.
At Germany’s version of moveon.org, www.vorwaerts.de, the mouthpiece of Germany’s socialist SPD party, to which Vahrenholt himself is a member, party honcho Michael Müller unloads. Müller’s rambling diatribe runs over an exhaustive 5 pages. Strangely on the surface, his screed appears like a book review of Die kalte Sonne, but after going through Müller’s rant, one finds almost nothing about the book itself!
Müller obviously has never read it.
So it’s good that the very first and only reader comment makes a point, one that hopefully will remind Müller what a raving public fool he looks like. Reader Gerhard v.d. Straten left the following comment:

Do you think that’s okay? Climate denier, irresponsible, climate-Sarrazin? Indeed that goes too far. We really have not gone back to the Dark Ages where everyone who questions the faith gets stoned to death. Vahrenholt and Lüning don’t even do that. They are only bringing into the discussion the point that global warming is 50% caused by man. How would it be to first read the book before first foaming at the mouth, Herr Müller?
Yours,”
That’s good advice for any mouth-foaming end-of-worlder. Obviously discussing anything with the closed-minded basket cases we’ve seen over the last few days is a waste of time. All they’re interested in is finding the closest tree to carry out their political lynchings. I suggest to Müller that he take steps to have Vahrenholt booted from the SPD Party. Go ahead and try.
Unfortunately, Mr Straten, the end-of-worlders like Müller are indeed back in the Dark Ages. I wonder how much longer your comment will even remain. Here’s the original German in case it should disappear:
Finden sie das in Ordnung. Klimaleugner, verantwortungslos, Klima-Sarrazin. Das geht doch nun wirklich zu weit. Wir sind doch nun wirklich nicht im Mittelalter angekommen und müssen jeden steinigen, der eine Glaubensrichtung in Frage stellt. Varenholt und Lüning tun das noch nicht einmal. Sie bringen nur die These, dass die globale Erwärmung 50% menschgemacht ist mal wieder in den Blickpunkt. Wie wäre es mal mit Buch lesen und nicht gleich Schaum vor den Mund kriegen, Herr Müller.
M.f.G.

The TAZ comments:
…that countries will talk until 2015 and that they will obligate themselves beginning in 2020 to legally reduce emissions. Emerging countries like India and China have recognized this, but have gained time and sufficiently expanded the paragraphs to allow the real binding obligations to be undermined. The USA does not have to deal with anything until 2020.”
Der Spiegel writes:
“Greenpeace was disappointed. ‘The watered-down compromise coming from pressure by India and USA will not lead to an international binding climate treaty, but rather to a loosely binding agreement,’ said  Greenpeace climate expert Martin Kaiser. ‘The conference created a last-second loophole for the USA and fossil fuel industries with the help of India.’ Now another protracted negotiation process threatens.

…the result can be interpreted according to one’s own preference. For those who stayed up late into night they can claim that at least a paper everyone can agree on resulted in the end. But the critics point out, and correctly so, that as far as content is concerned, no agreement that would actually limit the emission of CO2 was reached. The appearance of an agreement is preserved.”
The FAZ writes:
Now a new global climate treaty will be negotiated that will include for the first time climate targets for the United Nations and emerging countries such as China and India. Environmentalists complain about the too many loopholes in the agreement.”
Die Zeit writes:
By the year 2015 a legally binding contract is to be drawn up to limit warming to 2°C.
The circus will go on.

The Germany-based European Institute for Climate and Energy (EIKE)has a piece called: First The IPCC and Now The DWD: Tricked Series With Alleged Warming After the Year 2000. The piece alleges that both the IPCC and the German Weather Service (DWD) are playing it loose with temperature data sets to produce the illusion of global warming for the last 10 years.
========================================
First The IPCC and Now The DWD: Tricked Series With Alleged Warming After the Year 2000
By Josef Kowatsch, for EIKE
In February 2007 Working Group I of the IPCC released its Summary for Policymakers (SPM) on the status of the global climate for political leaders. It was already false at the time it was published and it certainly hasn’t gotten more correct since then.

Fig. 1 shows the B1 scenario with a CO2 increase to 600 ppm, A1B to 850 ppm, and the pessimistic A2 of 1250 ppm. The year 2000 scenario illustrates the optimistic case of CO2 remaining stable at 390 ppm.
Although the IPCC computer graphic appears colorful and pretty, it is completely remote of reality, and is a science sham.  To explain why, let’s begin by dividing up the graphic in 2 parts.
Part 1: 1900 to 2000
From the year 1900 to 2000, i.e. the left half, this part is made up of real measured data, even if the IPCC does not cite a data source.  According to the curve, there is a detectable temperature increase. No one disputes the fact that it has gotten warmer since the end of the Little Ice Age.
Here one has to consider the fact that the global warming was for the most part driven by the urban heat island effect (UHI), which was caused by man over the last 100 years. Measurement stations, which earlier were mostly located outside of built-up areas, are located today in the middle of built-up areas. The thermometer themselves don’t know whether the warmth originates from the climate or from built-up infrastructure, and so they record the error along with the measurement. Out in the open countryside, or out to sea, these temperature increases do not occur.
If one cleans up the temperature records to account for the UHI effect, then the alleged temperature increase becomes much less obvious.
Also see: “Wärmeinseleffekt täuscht Klimaerwärmung vor“ (UHI masquerades as climate warming).

Fig. 2: In the last 100 years, temperatures in Germany have remained more or less the same. There have been warm years and cold years – even decades. We had an increase just before the millenium ended. After 2000 we had a decline.

Part 2, 1900 to 2000
After the year 2000, is the above curve headed for reality? According to the IPCC the C02 concentration increased 15 ppm over the last 10 years. And the temperatures? Contrary to the tricked IPCC curve, they’ve fallen. The curves of the IPCC should have gone downwards. Therefore all 4 shown scenarios are false. In Germany the temperature drop since 2000  is 2°C. This was confirmed by the German Weather Service (DWD) in Offenbach (by E-mail dated 6 September 2010):
…globally 1998 is the warmest year and in Germany it is 2000. That’s no secret, and anyone can know this …“
The real temperature drop is not shown in the IPCC curve from Figure 1. Shown are only the false projections beginning in the year 2000. Neither politicians nor the media (and forget the Umweltbundesamt [German Federal Department of Environment]) have bothered to take the time to examine the data for the IPCC and at the DWD for the years 2000 to 2010, which show average temperatures of:
9.9/ 9.0/ 9.6 / 9.4 / 9.0 / 9.0 / 9.5 / 9.9 / 9.5 / 9.2 / 7.8.°C
This is how the easily duped, like the media and our politicians, become victims of a climate propaganda and then act to further propagate the fantasy of ongoing warming. 
From the entire course of the original DWD values, we now consider only the last 12 years.

Fig.3:  Original curve of the DWD: The section of the first 6 years up to 2004 is 9.4°C. The section of the following 6 years up to the year 2010 is 9.15°C. Strangely, this curve was on the official DWD website for only a few weeks.
Summary
The IPCC is playing around with tricked data. The temperature curve of the IPCC shown in Fig. 1 still keeps popping up in the media. Here the first part of the curve is not correct, and the computer forecast second part is completely false for the first 10 years. Nobody really knows what will happen in the next 10 years. And as far as the year 2050 is concerned, absolutely no one can know.

A recent news clipping on the research of an international climate scientist claimed rising temperatures during the other three seasons are actually cooling off winters in North America –all because of snowfalls in Siberia and an atmosphere pressure pattern in high latitudes called the Arctic Oscillation (AO).
The argument that is being made is that the recent warmer summers (due to global warming) are causing more negative Arctic Oscillation, which in turn causes colder winters in North America and Europe. This is totally opposite to what the IPCC predicted.
Here is what the actual abstract to an article called Arctic Warming, Increasing Snow Cover & Widespread Boreal Winter Cooling by Judah L. Cohen et al 2012 in the Environmental Research Letter said:
The most up to date consensus from global climate models predicts warming in the Northern Hemisphere (NH) high latitudes to middle latitudes during boreal winter. However, recent trends in observed NH winter surface temperatures diverge from these projections. For the last two decades, large-scale cooling trends have existed instead across large stretches of eastern North America and northern Eurasia. We argue that this unforeseen trend is probably not due to internal variability alone. Instead, evidence suggests that summer and autumn warming trends are concurrent with increases in high-latitude moisture and an increase in Eurasian snow cover, which dynamically induces large-scale wintertime cooling. Understanding this counterintuitive response to radiative warming of the climate system has the potential for improving climate predictions at seasonal and longer timescales.”
I like the words ”most up to date consensus from global warming models” and “recent trends in observed NH winter surface temperatures diverge from these projections”. In plain English the AGW scientists are finally admitting that even their latest climate models are wrong with respect to global warming. I give the above authors credit for finally admitting what most of us have known for some time.
Also the statement “For the last two decades, large-scale cooling trends have existed instead across large stretches of eastern North America and northern Eurasia “seems overstating the cooling. There has not been large-scale cooling for 2 decades, only the last 10 years in North America – as noted below-  and in Europe only the last 4-5 years.
As has been recently reported by this writer on this blog and at Anthony Watts on WUWT, the summers in both the contiguous US and Canada have not warmed but have actually cooled in US and the trend is quite flat in Canada over the last 10 years. Therefore warmer summers cannot be causing more negative AO and colder winters.
The colder winters are more likely due to changing spatial pattern of more cooler water in the North East Pacific than in the Central and North West Pacific Ocean, especially since 2007 (see PDO) and more recently the slow cooling of the Atlantic Ocean (see AMO) here.
While it is true that a negative AO can result in cooler winters, what causes the AO to cycle unpredictably is not yet clearly understood. Scientists have been unable to predict AO levels for more than a week or two. Whatever has been causing AO to cycle or to be negative, it has been causing this for at least a century and probably much longer – our records only go back to about 1899. This not a new phenomena caused by recent global warming. Below is a plot of winter AO provided by Jiaso.Washington.edu for the years 1899-2002.

More recent AO Index data after 2002 to 2011 can be found at NOAA:

http://www.cpc.ncep.noaa.gov/products/precip/CWlink/daily_ao_index/ao_index.html
Here is how the winter AO has varied during past warming and cooling phases of this planet for the last century:
JANUARY, FEBRUARY, MARCH AVERAGE AO INDEX
1900s decade: 7 positive, 3 negative AO winters
WARMING PHASE [temperatures rising] 1910 -1939
1910s 6 positive, 4 negative
1920s 8 positive, 2 negative
1930s 6 positive, 4 negative
TOTAL 20 positive, 10 negative
COOLING PHASE [temperatures dropping] 1940 -1969
1940s 4 positive, 6 negative
1950s 4 positive, 6 negative
1960s 4 positive, 6 negative
TOTAL 12 positive, 18 negative
WARMING PHASE [temperatures rising] 1970- 1999
1970s 5 positive, 5 negative
1980s 5 positive, 5 negative
1990s 7 positive3 negative
TOTAL 17 , 13 negative
POTENTIAL COOLING PHASE? 2010-2030
2010s 6 positive, 4 negative (temperatures have been declining slightly during the past decade)
2010 negative AO WINTER
2011 positive AO winter
Final Comments
It would appear that the Winter AO Index has a significant impact on global winter temperatures. During recent two 30 year global warming phases there were more positive (warm) AO winters than negative (cold) AO winters and almost twice as many. During 30 year global cooling phases, there are more negative AO winters than positive AO winters and about 50% more. During individual peak warm decades (1920s and 1990s) there were 2 to 4 times as many positive AO winters as negative AO winters. During individual peak cooling decades [1940s, 1950’s and 1960s, there were 50% more negative AO winters.
Clearly the recent negative AO winters are not new phenomena caused by warmer summers due to global warming but is a continuing natural climate process that has been ongoing for centuries. A recent extreme cold spell in Canada during January 2012 was happening with mostly positive AO, so we have a lot to understand about our climate. There seems to be no end to some climate scientists trying to tie every climate phenomena, however small or varied, to global warming.

Share this...FacebookTwitterEverybody say thank you to Poland.
It was the only of 27 European countries to reject the EU’s climate roadmap at a conference of Environment Ministers in Brussels Friday, angering environmentalists and EU climate protection expansionists.
The EU aims to cut greenhouse gas emissions by 80 – 95% by 2050 compared to 1990 levels. The EU has already committed to cutting its greenhouse gas emissions by 20% by 2020, 30% by 2030 and by up to 60% by 2040. Poland has accepted the target for 2020 but refuses to agree to the remaining targets, claiming it’ll hurt its power generation industry, which is 90% based on coal.
Der Spiegel here reports that Oxfam called Poland’s position “annoying and irresponsible” and that Greenpeace was “outraged”.
The EU claims that cutting back CO2 emissions by up to 95% by 2050 will limit global warming to 2°C, and thus lead to a rescue of the planet. Today’s European leaders fancy themselves as sort of world action heroes who are called on to save the planet from the certain climate catastrophe. This of course can only be achieved by taking away more of everybody’s money.
According to the Financial Times Deutschland, EU Climate Commissar Connie Hedegaard was upset by Poland’s action, venting she would not stand for it:

We will never accept one country sabotaging the progress of the whole world. This also affects a country within the European Union.”
The Handelsblatt writes:
Poland wants to stop Europe’s every jump ahead and will first wait for binding commitments from other large polluters like China and USA.”
Anyone who doubts that Europe’s climate Napoleons don’t mean business should think again. Not only does Hedegaard think she can boss Poland around, she also thinks she can tell the rest of the world what to do. Take airlines for example.
Hedegaard (Photo: Wedege)
China retaliates, puts orders for 45 Airbus planes on ice!
The online Merkur here reports that all 27 EU countries agreed on imposing the requirement that airlines flying to and from Europe purchase climate emissions permits. “Flights to and from Europe must have pollution permits. These will be charged for the first time beginning in 2013. China, USA and India are vehemently opposed to the long agreed system.” The Süddeutsche Zeitung  writes: “Because of the dispute, China has threatened retaliation and have put orders for 45 Airbus planes on ice.”
Once Russia, USA, India and a host of other countries start putting the pressure on, expect the climate Napoleons to retreat. Read here. The EU’s Waterloo is just a year away. In the meantime Connie Hedegaard is busily setting up Europe for it.

Share this...FacebookTwitterHow many billions of euros has the EU spent on renewable energy in order to reduce climate killing CO2 emissions? How many billions have been spent on research, institutes, think tanks, government, NGOs, etc., for the purpose of educating and regulating the public to curb CO2 emissions?
How many pages have been written and words spoken preaching that CO2 has to be reduced rapidly, or else the Earth will burn in hell?
How many light bulbs have been changed?
No continent on the planet has pontificated so incessantly to the rest of the world about the evils of CO2 emissions like Europe has.  The ultra-green continent even demands emissions be cut by 30% by 2020, and 80% by 2050.
So wouldn’t you think that Europe would be cutting its emissions every year?
In reality, Europe is like the chronic alcoholic who goes around telling everyone that he’s gone dry, only to stagger through the door hours later every evening.
The religious tree-hugger site klimaretter reports on the EU’s latest CO2 binge. EU emissions rose 2.4% in 2010. Ironically, the cause of the rise is reported to be a healthier economy, and a cold winter!

At least in Germany,  that is if the current string of harsh winters doesn’t stop. And according to Dr Karsten Brandt’s latest winter forecast for 2011/12 at donnerwetter.de, this coming winter is projected to be yet another harsh one. No let-up in sight.
That would make it Germany’s 4th consecutive harsh winter in a row. Brandt already calls 3 harsh winters in a row “unusual”.
The bulk of the cold will occur in December and January, with both months being interrupted by brief mild spells. November will start off mild, but will then fall sharply into a cold spell, with snow likely. Brandt reminds us that this a probable forecast. Things of course could develop differently.
As Brandt mentions, energy prices in Germany have surged over the years, and so many households are going to be taking another real battering with the heating costs.
Indeed today much of Germany’s inflation is driven by spiralling energy costs, due in large part to Germany’s mandatory energy feed-in laws, which require power companies to buy up renewable energies at fixed, sky-high prices and to sell it to consumers as “green” power. Power companies have no choice but to pass the high prices along to the defenceless consumers. Gas, heating oil and electricity prices are are all coupled. The only consolation consumers get, ironically, is the false belief they are helping to keep the planet from getting warmer.
Some power companies figured out creative ways of exploiting the system. According to one story I’ve heard, one Swiss or Austrian company was buying cheap French nuclear power for 3 cents a kwh, used the power to pump water in to a high-elevation pump-storage reservoir, then ran the water through hydroelectric turbines and sold the energy as green power at exorbitant prices. I have no idea how true that story is, but it would not surprise me. After all, we do know that there is no shortage of climate scams.

Share this...FacebookTwitterHere I don’t mean models like Claudia Schiffer.Hans von Storch’s blog Klimazwiebel here brings up an interview by the University of Hamburg with climate scientist Eduardo Zorita, whose insights I always appreciate. The interview is well worth reading.
The following are two parts that stand out for me (emphasis added):
Klimazwiebel: What would be your advice for young researchers who want to work on climate simulations?
Zorita: …there are two dangers that a student should avoid. One is to get stuck in a daily routine of programming and launching simulations, and slowly forgetting that simulations are performed to answer some previous question. [… }The second danger is to fall in love with your model and lose sight of the real observations out there. Models are in this sense dangerous and climate models even more so.
Klimazwiebel: What would you do with an additional million Euros for your research?
Zorita: …I would set up a project to understand the behavior of tropical clouds in the Late Maunder Minimum, at the height of the Little Ice Age 300 years ago, from proxy records and model simulations. This could give us hints about cloud cover changes in climates a bit different from the present and thus help us say something about the future climate change.

And imagine if the government also forced the supermarkets to buy bread that was never baked to begin with! All of this of course justified by bogus science claiming plain white bread is healthy and whole grain bread is a killer.
You can imagine the consequences.
Well, that’s exactly what Germany is doing with electricity. It requires power utilities to buy up “green” electricity from every producer at exorbitant rates, and to do so for 20 years. And if the grid gets overloaded on windy days, the wind-farm operator is told to stop producing, but still gets paid by the power utilities.
Unfortunately, Germany’s green politicians here were too dim-witted to foresee the obvious consequences. Now reality has since caught up. The German electricity market is on the verge of collapse. The scale of the EEG Renewable Energy Feed-in Act is of unprecedented stupidity, a folly that will certainly go down in German history textbooks.
The backpedaling away from solar subsidies in Germany is now happening so fast that it’s making people’s heads spin. Call it the reverse energy supply transition – one from fantasy back to reality.
Germany pulls the emergency brake on solar energy
Today a growing number of German officials, who were once huge proponents of renewable energies and the EEG Feed-In Act, are now realizing that solar energy in gray and rainy Germany is a folly after all. Electricity rates in Germany are skyrocketing and the risks of uncontrolled energy supply interruptions are mounting. Officials are now screaming for a drastic scale-back of solar subsidies. Economics Minister Philip Rösler is now calling for an end to the fixed and guaranteed (for 20 years) renewable energy feed-in rates paid to green producers.
Even Germany’s super green Environment Minister Norbert Röttgen has seemingly woken up and now plans to drastically scale back new installations of solar systems in Germany, according to CO2 Handel here. In the new plan, subsidies will be scaled back on a monthly basis and accelerated. Subsidies for solar systems under the new plan would end by 2017.
Energy intensive industries are bolting, or are planning to do so

Power utilities have been finding it increasingly difficult to juggle the constantly and widely varying energy sources of wind and solar power, and are warning that power outages and grid collapses are just a question of time.
The mandatory feed-in of the vastly more expensive solar energy has caused electricity rates to surge and have been driving energy-intensive industries out of Germany. Solar energy was until recently seen as a way of filling in as a power supply in place of the shut down nuclear reactors, and rescuing the climate from coal plants. Now the focus of politics has reversed and shifted to rescuing the economy.
Recent surveys have shown that companies are becoming increasingly wary of conducting operations in Germany due to what they view as a potentially unreliable energy supply. The European Institute for Climate and Energy EIKE) here reports that:
One fifth of every industrial company has moved activities to foreign countries, or plans to do so, because of the uncertain energy and raw material supply. This is the result of a survey conducted by the German Chamber of Industry and Commerce (DIHK), in which 1520 companies participated. DIHK-President Hans Heinrich Driftmann finds this alarming: Here, fears that Germany is losing its appeal for foreign investors in the wake of it’s energy supply transformation.”
No wonder Environment Minister Röttgen plans to take drastic measures in curbing solar energy. Germany’s industrial economy is eroding rapidly. Prof. Dr. Dieter Ameling, a former steel industry leader and spokesman, recently said the (green) energy supply transition in Germany meant the downfall of energy intensive industry in Germany.
Unfortunately greens don’t understand that transferring clean, high-standard German industry to foreign, low-standard countries means more CO2 emissions and pollution, and not less. And they certainly do not understand even the most basic laws of economics. Germany’s Renewable Energy Feed-In Act is proof.
Kook greens in Canada think solar power is for free!
Finally here’s hippie David Suzuki (3 min. mark) saying “It’s free, man, it’s free!”

With idiots like that advising governments, we’re not surprised everything is going bankrupt.

Share this...FacebookTwitterWe’re hearing about clandestine evil deals being made in Durban and that the UN may indeed emerge as the global Führer soon. Rubbish!
Der Spiegel reports here that Durban threatens to sink into chaos.
According to Der Spiegel, a new paper had been drafted overnight and included things like “warming will be limited to 2°C, even 1.5°C” and that “by 2050 greenhouse gas emissions will be cut back 50 to 85 percent compared to 1990” and that developing countries “will be obligated to cut back projected emissions growth by 2020 by 15 to 30 percent”.
Rumours are out claiming they’re closing in on a deal and that our liberty is about to end. But fear not. Der Spiegel, who have well-embedded reporters in Durban, writes:
In any case, a deal will not happen. In paragraph 47 of the paper, which looks at financial aid for developing countries, it is stated: The payments will be ‘equal to the budget that the industrial country has for defence, security and war.'”
We all know that Europe does very little in defence and military. That would mean the US would have to pay just about everything. If Obama accepted this, it would be a Jonestown-scale political suicide by the US Democratic Party. Even the biggest leftists in the US could hardly fantasize such a massive transfer of wealth by a single country. The condition is a set-up to force the USA to reject it – and thus take the blame again.

Der Spiegel writes:
That passage will certainly be deemed as completely unacceptable by the US: The country would not only have to make the money it spends on defence available, but also additional billions that it spends on war. Just the Afghanistan operation costs the USA 100 billion per year.”
Dear readers – Durban has moved to Kooksville, and they just want to end this circus, blame the US, and go home. You’ll hear about a little something here, of a little deal there, some commitment here, etc. But in the end it’s all nothing.
Every year it’s the same. They draft something so unfair that the US can’t accept, then they all blame the US for the failure. I wonder why the US even bothers showing up at all.
The clowns are headed back home and the circus is moving to the next town.

A quite recent headline in our news warned that “Regions must brace for weather extremes: UN climate panel”. Apparently this will be the after-effect of global warming caused by man-made greenhouse gases. We can expect more frequent extreme events such as the drought in Texas and the Thailand floods because of global warming, they said.
Figure 1
 
It is strange that the IPCC panel should link recent extreme weather events to global warming because quite simply there has been no global warming to speak of for 10-15 years now based on the official climate data from the governments of the world [US /NCDC, ENVIRONMENT CANADA and THE EUROPEAN ENVIRONMENTAL AGENCY. Recently US meteorologist Anthony Watts showed that the continental U.S. has not warmed in the last 10 years, and in fact has grown cooler in the summer and colder in the winter. The climate data numbers come from the National Climatic Data Center.
Not only have the US temperatures been flat for the last 10-15 years, but a similar pattern is happening in Canada. The Canadian national annual, summer and winter temperature departures from the 1961-1990 averages have been flat for 10-14 years when measured on Excel linear trend and based on Environment Canada’s own data. Comparing today’s winter temperature departure with that of the period 1961-1990 can be misleading since the 1961-1990 period was low or cool phase of the planet’s 60 year cycle and any comparison will always show warming not due to man generated global warming, but due to natural and regular changes (30 years of cooler weather followed by 30 years of warmer weather) in the planets climate pattern. It is like comparing summer temperatures with winter temperatures, the summer will always show warming.
Regionally 7 of the 11 regions reported by Environment Canada showed declining or flat winter temperature departures over the last 10 years. The average winter departure was about 2°C between 1998-2011. Only the Atlantic Coast, Northeastern Forests and Arctic Tundra, Mountains, and Fiords showed rising winter temperature departures. But the North Atlantic Ocean heat content is dropping and so is the Arctic Ocean’s heat content.
The Northern Hemisphere, North Atlantic, North Pacific and East Pacific SST Anomalies are all dropping. It will not be long before the Atlantic Coast and the Arctic regions will show similar cooling as the AMO goes cool or negative. North America is more likely see much cold weather during the next 20-30 years rather than global warming of 3-6°C as predicted by the IPCC. The recent severe winter weather along Alaska and the US east coast was just a sample of what may lie ahead. This cooling has been building for a decade now. So how can global warming be causing current and future extreme weather events when global warming as predicted has not been happening for a decade and is unlikely to happen during the next 30 years since the world 60-year climate cycle is heading for colder weather due to changing ocean surface temperatures and changes in deep ocean currents?
Ocean SST as measured by PDO, AMO, ocean heat content and ENSO cycles and pressure changes as measured by AO and NAO are all pointing to a future cooling planet. AMO has gone negative in November 2011 for the first time since early 2009. Time will tell whether this is just the normal seasonal dip or a long-term pattern. This cooler AMO, if sustained through the winter, could signify cooler weather for the US east coast and Western Europe. Several severe storms have already happened this fall on both sides of the Atlantic.
Here are two web references to support the above evidence of global cooling in North America: http://wattsupwiththat.com and http://ca.news.yahoo.com/blogs.
So why are we pouring all this taxpayers money to solve a the non-existing problem as currently defined when the world is near financial collapse and there are so many more pressing problems in our world today? Any prudent leader should see we need to change our priorities.
Further evidence of global cooling 
The five following graphs illustrate the lack of global warming in US and Canada.

North American snow extent as reported by Rutgers University 
The North American snow extent has been increasing for 5 years in a row since the Pacific Ocean SST pattern started to show cooler water as measured by PDO. Already the 2011-2012 winter snow extent is greater than that of 2010-2011 winter by some 60% by week 45. Snow extent levels are approaching the record levels of the late 1970s.

Canadian winter, summer and annual temperature departures from 1961-1990. Averages for the years 1998 -2011
The annual trend of the departures as shown below indicates a flat or slightly cooling trend, and not global warming at all. Yes they fluctuate but that does not mean the trend is warming.

Canadian winter temperature departures from 1961-1990. Averages for the years 1998-2011

http://ec.gc.ca/adsc-cmda/default.asp?lang=En&n=4A21B114-1
The winter cooling is especially apparent in the Canadian bread basket, namely the Prairie Provinces and their north half or the Northwestern Forests. Environment Canada reports in their Trend, Extremes and Current Season Ranking, 1948-2011[64 years] that the warming trend in these areas is 3.2 and 3.7 degrees C over the last 64 years. What is far more meaningful and not stated in their bulletins is that this area has been cooling for 10 years and very rapidly since 2006. The winter temperature departures dropped some 7°C between 2006 and 2009 alone and have been below or at the 1961-1990 averages for the last 3-4 years (see below). No wonder we are having all the spring floods from the extra melting snow in this area.
The cold winters are likely to continue and so are the floods for the next 20-30 years as the 60 year planetary climate cycle goes into its cold phase. We are having the winters like the previous cold cycle 30 years ago. Yet Environment Canada only talks about continuing global warming . on their web page. There is absolutely nothing about possible global cooling or warning to the Canadian public and businesses about possible flooding again, crop losses, infrastructure disruptions, etc from the pending weather.

PDO 
In November, the Pacific Decadal Oscillation or PDO dropped to its lowest level since 1961 at -2.33. The 1961 level was -2.69. PDO  is an after effect of the ENSO signal and reflects a spatial pattern of the amount of cooler water in the north Pacific. Negative levels are accompanied by much cooler weather in the Northern Hemisphere especially in North America. This index started to go negative in 2007 and based on historical patterns, it could be negative for the next 20-30 years, signifying cooler weather for the same period. This has already been apparent the last four years in the North American weather – especially the winters.

“No place on Earth is warming as fast as Greenland,” we keep hearing. Or: “Greenland is approaching a tipping point!”

The Arctic is known as a desert, with little rain or snow, winter or summer. When I was at Thule AFB in 1962 – 63, snow accumulation was a few inches each winter, and most of that was blown in from the ice cap. In more recent years, however, the snowfall at Thule has increased.

Over the recent years we have been inundated by media reports that Greenland is losing ice at a rapid rate, raising sea-levels, etc, etc. But what is really happening? To find out, look at the following chart from Rutgers University:

Figure 3: Greenland snow cover from Rutgers University Global Snow Laboratory website. ww.climate4you.snowcover.htm
The plateau at the top of the chart depicts complete snow cover, 100%. Note how the trend is clearly steadily up.
Greenland is approaching a condition of year-around complete snow cover.
Is this getting reported in the media? I wonder what condition triggers an ice age?

Figure 1 above depicts the NH cold season temperature trend over the last ten years. The global trend is zero! (the number in the top right corner). Source: GISS.
Figure 2 below depicts the oceans only. The NH cold season ocean surface cooled 0.04 degrees C in the last decade, or 0.4 degrees C per century.

So, where’s the warming? Wasn’t it supposed to result in warmer winters?

Jorge Montt Glacier, Southern Patagonian ice field. (Photo credit: NASA - public domain photo)
A team of scientists studied tree rings from old trees recently exposed by the retreating Patagonian glaciers. Samples of these trees were dated using radiocarbon methods, yielding burial ages between 460 and 250 years ago.
Well guess what! The study confirms that the Little Ice Age existed in Chile too. Now remember how the high-sticking hockey team kept trying to have us believe that the Medieval Warm Period-Little Ice Age thing was a local phenomena, and not global? That claim is looking more and more like a real joke with every passing study.
The person who brought my attention to this paper is an expert geologist, and wishes to remain anonymous. He wrote me in an e-mail:
Amazing how globally widespread the ‘local North Atlantic’ Little Ice Age was in fact.”
And he quoted the paper’s abstract:
The dendrochronology and maps indicate that Glaciar Jorge Montt was at its present position before the beginning of the LIA, in concert with several other glaciers in Southern Patagonia, and reached its maximum advance position between 1650 and 1750 AD.”
No misprint there. It’s correct. Before the LIA the Chilean glaciers were at the same spot as the present position. Send a copy of that paper to Michael Mann and the rest of the climate clowns.

Unfortunately some Green thugs are still unable to learn tolerance and the lessons of history, and felt they had to threaten and harrass “thought criminals” who dare to question the Greens’ uncompromising vision of the future. Rudolf Kipp, who runs the Science Skeptical blog, had to take the video down. He left his reason as a reader comment (emphasis added):
For those of you who wonder where the video has gone. Remember, this is still Germany. We tolerate everyone’s right to free speech, so long as he shares our opinion…I have put the video off-line since the lecturer has been molested by mails and defamation and has received anonymous phone calls in private and his family has been affected as well.”
For those of you inclined to dissent, let Dronskowski be an example to you. Keep marching in lockstep – don’t ask questions, or else.
This is not the Germany I’ve come to know over the last 20+ years. I wonder what is becoming of the country. Dissenters are being labelled criminals. Professors can no longer speak up. Who can remember the last time this was so?
My view is that these green thugs are hardly different than the brown crap who allegedly murdered a number of Turks whose only crime was to dare to live a different culture in Germany. Germany’s intelligence services sat on their thumbs, not taking the threat seriously, read here. Obviously they are also not taking the threat of the greenshirts seriously either.
And some say we are living in an age of enlightenment. Well, all this is starting to enlighten me.

Share this...FacebookTwitterIt appears the tactics of Stefan Rahmstorf are truly beginning to catch up with him. What goes around, comes around.H/t: Lubos Motl
Der Spiegel today has a story on IPCC bigwig and ultra-alarmist Stefan Rahmstorf, who is also a lead scientist at the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research and elite member of the Hockey Team. For those of you who may not recall, Rahmstorf is the outlier oceanographer that projects a sea level rise of about 1.4 meters, even when the rest the world, including real observations, all point to something that is about 1/7 of that.
It’s a bit late at night here and so the main points only. Der Spiegel starts:
Renown climate scientist and German government advisor Stefan Rahmstorf was found guilty of a blog attack against a journalist.  According to the opinion of a state court, he made untruthful assertions. Also the ‘Frankfurter Rundschau’ has come under fire.”
A State Court says he’s guilty of making untruthful assertions. Interpret that how you wish. The Frankfurter Rundschau is a sort of daily that former East German comrades lean towards. On the Rahmstorf ruling by the court, we reported about it here.
To make a long story short, journalist Irene Meichsner wrote a critical report about the IPCC, which appeared in the Frankfurter Rundschau daily, to which Rahmstorf reacted quite nastily. He asserted at his blog that the journalist had been dishonest, sloppy, had never read the IPCC report, and that she even lifted text from another source (Richard North and Jonathan Leake). For a journalist, such accusations are of course career threatening and thus deadly serious.
Meichsner didn’t stand for it, took the case to court, and won.
The Original text of the Court Judgement is here.
That should have been the end of it but, according to Der Spiegel, the PIK (Rahmstorf ‘s employer) has gotten into the fray. The PIK you’ll recall is run by German masterplanner Hans-Joachim Schellnhuber, who chairs the WBGU and directly advises Chancellor Angela Merkel. If you ever wondered where Merkel comes up with all these brilliant climate policy ideas, e.g. like the 2°C warming limit, then look no further.
Der Spiegel tried to contact Rahmstorf directly for comment on the Cologne State Court ruling, but received only a statement from the PIK which attempted to play down the incident. The statement was also posted at the PIK site. According to Der Spiegel the statement claimed:
‘Mistakes can happen.’ This involves ‘interpretation questions’ and ‘misunderstandings’.”
and that:

google_ad_height = 200;
//-->




“The PIK asks his colleagues to understand that it is the duty of a scientist “to inform the public about errors”.
Der Spiegel, citing the Cologne Court Ruling”, calls the PIK published statement:
An amazing interpretation”.
The State Court ruling against Rahmstorf is a cease and desist order that requires Rahmstorf to refrain from making the false assertions about the journalist. Yet at the PIK website the statement (on behalf of Rahmstorf?) again was clearly implying there had been “errors” in Meichsner’s report when in fact there weren’t. Talk about defying a court order! According to Der Spiegel, the PIK has since revised the text at its site. Obviously it’s not the journalist Meichsner that’s sloppy and loose with the facts. The Court was very clear on that.
Der Spiegel reminds readers that this is not the first time that Rahmstorf has maliciously taken on people who do not share his opinion and speak out.
Time and again he has not only gone after journalists, but also after scientists who have openly expressed views that Rahmstorf didn’t like.”
Der Spiegel cites the Franfurter Rundschau daily as an example, who according to Der Spiegel:”played an unusual part in the affair. The editors at FR distanced themselves from Meichsers critical piece two months after they had published it” after Rahmstorf had intervened and then published a full two-page story on how “the IPCC had been the target of an awkward campaign.” In plain English, the FR went down on its knees before a group of elite scientists.
That is disturbing. Der Spiegel was unable to obtain any comment from the FR.

// ]]&gt;Hans von Storch of the Helmholtz Center in Geesthacht Germany was also once a target of Rahmstorf. According to Der Spiegel, today he keeps a copy of the original State Court Ruling up at his private website.
At his blog Rahmstorf in the meantime gripes that “in the classical media you no longer have any control over the end product.”
The ice under Rahmstorf feet is getting awfully thin, and it’s not because of global warming.

Share this...FacebookTwitterThe woes in the renewable energy sector continue unabated. We’ve heard a number of headlines of jobs being lost in the solar industry – now jobs are being lost in wind as well.
According to news reports, the world’s largest wind tuirbine manufacturer, Vestas,  will lay off another 2300 workers worldwide, along with a possible additional 1600 jobs in the USA.  The reason is sluggish demand. The company also announced the closure of a number of facilities. Last year the company had laid off 3000 employees.According to the German language CO2 Handel, 1300 jobs will be lost at the headquarters in Aarhus Denmark.
The wind turbine manufacturer had again lowered its forecast for sales turnover for 2011 and now expects 6 billion instead of 6.4 billion euros in turnover.”
The company no longer believes it’ll make a profit. CBS News writes:
…a potential slowdown in the United States could also result in the layoff of an additional 1,600 employees there.”
and
Last year, Vestas laid off 3,000 workers after posting a 24 percent drop in the third quarter.”
According to Global Winnepeg, job losses in the USA will depend on whether or not the company will get more handouts from the taxpayers:
It said the U.S. layoff plans would mainly depend on whether the Production Tax Credit — which gives a favourable low tax rate to makers of renewable energy — would be extended or not. In 2010, Vestas was awarded about $51 million in tax credits through the U.S. federal stimulus program.”

Share this...FacebookTwitterGermany’s media is sick and intolerant at times, seemingly continuing a once infamous tradition.
Yesterday NDR German public television had an interview with Fritz Vahrenholt, co-author with Sebastian Lüning of the bestselling book Die kalte Sonne now sweeping through Germany. The NDR piece is dubbed: “Vahrenholt and the ‘CO2 lies'”. The clip first introduces the climate topic and reminds viewers that “that man is causing global warming and storms.”
Established climate science is indignant about the scrutiny
NDR first questions Hartmut Grassl and Jochem Marotzke, both of the Max Planck Institute for Meteorology. Grassl, obviously agitated by Vahrenholt’s skeptical book, crossly replies:
Ach, actually I have no desire to comment on such nonsense.”
If you listen closely, you’ll hear a burst of laughter from some hyena in the background. Jochem Marotzke also takes the same snobby attitude: No one should question AGW. Why the indignant reaction from Marotzke and Grassl? One can only speculate.
Suppressing open debate
Perhaps they feel that a chemistry professor (Vahrenholt) and a geologist (Lüning) have no business doubting their science. But my guess is that they are completely embarrassed, and thus terrified, about having been duped by what is turning out today to be a really dumb and simplistic hypothesis: climate trace gas CO2 rules the climate and other factors play no role. These two scientific men bought into the global warming end-of-the-world catastrophe hook, line and sinker. They have absolutely no desire to have all this exposed by an open debate.
And as Lüning writes at the “Die kalte Sonne site here:
One gets the sense they are now trying harder than ever to suppress debate.”

NDR could not resist delivering a low blow to Vahrenholt. The used old footage of him when he was Environment Senator for Hamburg over 20 years ago. The footage shows the young Vahrenholt climbing down through a manhole while the reporter says: “He has opted to descend into another world.” NDR’s message to the viewers is clear: “Skeptics belong in the sewers.  Now you know how nasty things can get in Germany.
Critics should first read the book
The NDR interview with Vahrenholt on the other was well handled.
During the interview, Vahrenholt’s calls out the major error made by the IPCC, not properly taking the sun and ocean currents into account, and falsely assigning all the warming to CO2 from 1980 to 2000. ARD asked Vahrenholt to respond to Mojib Latif’s recent criticism, also indignant. Vahrenholt replied.
“He really ought to first read the book.”
They all should read the book. From their comments, it’s clear that they haven’t, and they seem stunningly ignorant of the latest science – or they simply just don’t want to talk about it.
Good news! The book is selling like hot cakes – no. 14 on bestseller list
Here’s a little anecdote. I live in a small town and four weeks ago I ordered two copies of “Die kalte Sonne” from our local bookshop here in town – one for myself and one for the bookshop display window, which the owner kindly allowed. I told the owner that the book was highly controversial and politically incorrect. “What do you mean?” he asked. I told him “the book doesn’t believe in the climate catastrophe!” He just laughed.
Today the bookshop owner sent me a message to let me know that “Die kalte Sonne” is now on the Spiegel bestseller list and that customers have been snapping them up, and that he’s been ordering more copies.Then he told me on the phone that once a book is on the Spiegel bestseller list, then sales pick up.
So expect tens of thousands of copies to be sold nationwide!
